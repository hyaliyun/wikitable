It was adapted by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. from the 1969 French film The Unfaithful Wife (La Femme infidèle). It tells the story of a couple living in suburban New York City whose marriage goes dangerously awry when the wife indulges in an adulterous affair with a stranger she encounters by chance. The film was remade in India under the title Murder (2004), starring Emraan Hashmi and Mallika Sherawat in a melodramatic manner. Unfaithful grossed $52 million in North America and $119,137,784 worldwide. Despite mixed reviews overall, Lane received much praise for her performance. She won awards for Best Actress from the National Society of Film Critics and New York Film Critics, and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Plot Edward and Connie Sumner live in Westchester County, New York with their eight-year-old son, Charlie. While shopping, Connie runs into stranger Paul Martel and scrapes her knees, accepting Paul's offer to treat her injuries at his Soho apartment. Uncomfortable with his advances, she leaves. Finding Paul's phone number inside the book he gave her, Connie calls him and is invited over. Paul again flirts with her. She leaves despite their mutual attraction, but visits again, and they have sex. Both thrilled and guilty, Connie uses her work as an excuse to continue visiting Paul, raising Edward's suspicion. Noticing Connie readying herself with new shoes and lingerie, Edward asks her to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment. Edward calls the salon and confirms Connie was lying. Edward is devastated when a private investigator, Frank Wilson, provides pictures of Connie and Paul together. As Connie's visits become more frequent, she is late to pick up Charlie from school and realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. She decides to end things in person and the following day she does some errands. As Connie completes her grocery shopping errand, she drives to Paul's home to break off the bad news but notices him running off to the library with another woman. She jumps out of her car and runs to the library to confront Paul and the other woman. As she notices them caressing, Connie starts to get jealous and physically attacks Paul and the other woman. As she is in the elevator alone with Paul, she asks him how many women is he seeing but Paul denies the entire subject and tells Connie that the woman is only just a friend and nothing more. She then tells Paul that she doesn't want to see him anymore and tells him that their affair is over and mentions she hates him. However as she attempts to leave Paul's apartment, he manages to chase and capture Connie. She then tries to stop and push Paul away but is unsuccessful and they end up having quick but steamy and erotic makeup sex in the hallway of his apartment. She leaves, narrowly missing Edward, who confronts Paul. Paul lets him into his apartment. As they discuss Connie, Edward is stunned to find a snow globe he had given her, which Paul explains she had gifted to him. Edward snaps and fractures Paul's skull with the snow globe, killing him instantly. Cleaning up evidence, Edward hears Connie leave a message for Paul, saying she must end their affair. He erases the message and later dumps Paul's body in a landfill but is plagued by memories of the murder. NYPD detectives arrive at the Sumner home, explaining that Paul's estranged wife has reported him missing. Connie claims she barely knows him, and the detectives return a week later to reveal that Paul's body has been discovered. Connie lies that she met Paul at a fundraiser which, to her surprise, Edward corroborates. Later, she finds the photos of her and Paul, realizing Edward knew about the affair. She also notices that the snow globe has been returned to their collection. Sharing a meaningful look with Edward, she realizes he murdered Paul. They argue, and Edward says that he wanted to kill her instead of Paul. In the days that follow, Connie discovers a hidden compartment in the snow globe containing a photograph of her, Edward, and an infant Charlie, with a loving anniversary message. As she burns the photographs of her and Paul, Edward says he will turn himself in, but Connie objects, saying they will find a way to move on, and they appear to return to a normal life together. One night, Edward stops at a red light with Charlie asleep in the backseat. Connie whispers that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees, consoling her as she cries. It is revealed that Edward has stopped the car near a police station. Cast *Richard Gere as Edward Sumner *Diane Lane as Constance \\"Connie\\" Sumner *Olivier Martinez as Paul Martel *Erik Per Sullivan as Charlie Sumner *Chad Lowe as Bill Stone *Dominic Chianese as Frank Wilson *Erich Anderson as Bob Gaylord *Michelle Monaghan as Lindsay *Kate Burton as Tracy *Margaret Colin as Sally *Željko Ivanek as Detective Dean *Michael Emerson as Josh *Damon Gupton as Other Businessman *Joseph Badalucco Jr. as Train Conductor Production According to actor Gere, an early draft of the screenplay presented the Sumners as suffering from a dysfunctional sexual relationship. It gave Connie some justification for having an affair. According to the actor and to director Lyne, the studio wanted to change the storyline so that the Sumners had a bad marriage with no sex, to create greater sympathy for Connie. Both men opposed the change; Lyne in particular felt that the studio's suggestions would have robbed the film of any drama: \\"I wanted two people who were perfectly happy. I loved the idea of the totally arbitrary nature of infidelity.\\" The Sumners' relationship was rewritten as a good marriage, with her affair the result of a chance meeting. =Pre-production= During pre- production, the producers received a video-taped audition from Olivier Martinez, who was selected for Paul. His character was portrayed as French once Martinez was cast. Lyne said, \\"I think it helps one understand how Connie might have leapt into this affair—he's very beguiling, doing even ordinary things.\\" Once cast in the role, Martinez, with Lyne's approval, changed some of his dialogue and the scene in which he first seduces Lane's character, while she is looking at a book in Braille. According to Martinez, \\"The story that was invented before was much more sensual, erotic and clear.\\" Lyne cast Lane in the role of Constance after seeing her in the film, A Walk on the Moon. He felt that the actress \\"breathes a certain sexuality. But she's sympathetic, and I think so many sexy women tend to be tough and hard at the same time.\\" Lyne also wanted Gere and Lane to gain weight in order to portray the comfort of a middle-age couple. In particular, he wanted Gere to gain 30 pounds and left donuts in the actor's trailer every morning. Lyne asked director of photography Peter Biziou, with whom he made 9½ Weeks, to shoot Unfaithful. After reading the script, Biziou felt that the story was appropriate for the classic 1.85:1 aspect ratio because it \\"so often has two characters working together in the frame\\". During pre-production, Biziou, Lyne and production designer Brian Morris used a collection of still photographs as style references. These included photos from fashion magazines and shots by prominent photographers. =Principal photography= Initially, the story was set against snowy exteriors, but this idea was rejected early on. Principal photography started on March 22, 2001 and wrapped on June 1, 2001 with Lyne shooting in continuity whenever possible. The film was primarily shot in New York City. During the windstorm sequence where Connie first meets Paul, it rained and Lyne used the overcast weather conditions for the street scenes. The director also preferred shooting practical interiors on location so that the actors could \\"feel an intimate sense of belonging\\", Biziou recalls. The cinematographer also used natural light as much as possible. At times, Lyne's directing took its toll on the cast and crew. In a scene taking place in an office, the director pumped it full of smoke, an effect that \\"makes the colors less contrasty, more muted\\". According to Biziou, \\"The texture it gives helps differentiate and separate various density levels of darkness farther back in frame\\". The smoke was piped in for 18 to 20 hours a day and Gere remembers, \\"Our throats were being blown out. We had a special doctor who was there almost all the time who was shooting people up with antibiotics for bronchial infections\\". Lane acquired an oxygen bottle in order to survive the rigorous schedule. The film has many explicit sex scenes, including a tryst in a restaurant bathroom and a passionate exchange in an apartment building hallway. Lyne's repeated takes for these scenes were demanding for the actors, especially for Lane, who had to be emotionally and physically fit for the scenes. To prepare for the initial love scene between Paul and Constance, Lyne had the actors watch clips from Fatal Attraction, Five Easy Pieces, and Last Tango in Paris. Lane and Martinez would also talk over the scenes in his trailer beforehand. Once on the set, they felt uncomfortable until several takes in. She said, \\"My comfort level with it just had to catch up quickly if I wanted to be the actress to play it.\\" Martinez was not comfortable with nudity. Lane said that Lyne would often shoot a whole magazine of film, \\"so one take was as long as five takes. By the end, you're physically and emotionally shattered.\\" Lane had not met Martinez before filming, and they did not get to know each other well during the shoot, mirroring the relationship between their characters. A full four weeks of the schedule was dedicated to the scenes in Paul's loft, which was located on the third floor of a six-story building located on Greene Street. Biziou often used two cameras for the film's intimate scenes to reduce the number of takes that had to be shot. =Post-production= Lyne shot five different endings to Unfaithful based on his experiences with Fatal Attraction, whose initial ending was rejected by the test audience. According to Lyne, he had some debate with the 20th Century Fox officials, who wanted to \\"make the marriage gray, the sex bad. I fought that. I tried to explore the guilt, the jealousy--that's what I'm interested in.\\" The studio did not like the film's \\"enigmatic\\" ending, which they felt failed to punish crimes committed by the characters. It imposed a \\"particularly jarring 'Hollywood' final line\\", which angered Gere. Following negative reactions from test audiences, the studio reinstated the original ending; a few weeks before the film was to open in theaters, Lyne asked Gere and Lane to return to Los Angeles for re-shoots of the ending. Lyne claimed that the new ending was more ambiguous than the original and was the original one by screenwriter Alvin Sargent. Lyne also thought the new ending \\"would be more interesting and provoke more discussion\\", saying he intentionally \\"wanted to do a more ambiguous ending, which treats the audience much more intelligently\\". Reception Unfaithful opened on May 10, 2002 in 2,617 theaters and grossed US$14 million with an average of $5,374 per screen. It made $52 million in the U.S. and Canada, and a total of $119 million worldwide, well above its $50 million budget. =Critical response= The film received mixed reviews, though Diane Lane earned widespread praise for her performance. It currently has a rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 167 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The consensus reads, \\"Diane Lane shines in the role, but the movie adds nothing new to the genre and the resolution is unsatisfying.\\" CNN film critic Paul Tatara wrote, \\"The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times, and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack.\\" Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an \\"A-\\" grade and praised Lane for delivering \\"the most urgent performance of her career\\", writing that she \\"is a revelation. The play of lust, romance, degradation, and guilt on her face is the movie's real story.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times wrote, \\"Instead of pumping up the plot with recycled manufactured thrills, it's content to contemplate two reasonably sane adults who get themselves into an almost insoluble dilemma.\\" In the Los Angeles Times, the critic Kenneth Turan wrote, \\"The only performer who manages to get inside her character is Lane. Whether it's her initial half-distrustful tentativeness, her later sensual abandon or her never-ending ambivalence, Lane's Constance seems to be actually living the role in a way no one else matches, a way we can all connect to.\\" Stephen Holden in The New York Times praised the \\"taut, economical screenplay\\" that \\"digs into its characters' marrow (and into the perfectly selected details of domestic life) without wasting a word. That screenplay helps to ground a film whose visual imagination hovers somewhere between soap opera and a portentous pop surrealism.\\" USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half out of four and Mike Clark wrote, \\"Diane Lane also reaches a new career plateau with her best performance since 1979's A Little Romance.\\" In his review for The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, \\"In the end, Unfaithful leaves you dispirited and grumpy: All that money spent, all that talent wasted, all that time gone forever, and for what? It's an ill movie that bloweth no man to good.\\" David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, \\"Unfaithful shows what a powerful, sexy, smart filmmaker Lyne can be. It's a shame he substitutes the mechanics of suspense for the real suspense of what goes on between a man and a woman, a husband and a wife.\\" Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, \\"Ultimately Unfaithful is escapism in its purest form, and I am willing to experience it on that level, even though with all the unalloyed joy on display, there's almost no humor,\\" and concluded that it was \\"one of the very few mainstream movies currently directed exclusively to grown-ups\\". =Awards and nominations= The studio campaign's theme consisted of what the studio called the film's \\"iconic scene\\": Constance recalling her first tryst with Paul as she takes a train home. According to Tom Rothman, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, \\"That scene captured the power of her performance. It's what everyone talked about after they saw her.\\" Four days before the New York Film Critics Circle's vote, Lane was given a career tribute by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. A day before that, Lyne held a dinner for the actress at the Four Seasons Hotel. Critics and award voters were invited to both. Lane won the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle awards and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Entertainment Weekly ranked Unfaithful the 27th on their \\"50 Sexiest Movies Ever\\" list.

The current is measured immediately before each potential change, and the current difference is plotted as a function of potential. By sampling the current just before the potential is changed, the effect of the charging current can be decreased. By contrast, in normal pulse voltammetry the current resulting from a series of ever larger potential pulses is compared with the current at a constant 'baseline' voltage. Another type of pulse voltammetry is squarewave voltammetry, which can be considered a special type of differential pulse voltammetry in which equal time is spent at the potential of the ramped baseline and potential of the superimposed pulse. Electrochemical cell The system of this measurement is usually the same as that of standard voltammetry. The potential between the working electrode and the reference electrode is changed as a pulse from an initial potential to an interlevel potential and remains at the interlevel potential for about 5 to 100 milliseconds; then it changes to the final potential, which is different from the initial potential. The pulse is repeated, changing the final potential, and a constant difference is kept between the initial and the interlevel potential. The value of the current between the working electrode and auxiliary electrode before and after the pulse are sampled and their differences are plotted versus potential. Uses These measurements can be used to study the redox properties of extremely small amounts of chemicals because of the following two features: 1) in these measurements, the effect of the charging current can be minimized, so high sensitivity is achieved and 2) only faradaic current is extracted, so electrode reactions can be analyzed more precisely. Characteristics Differential pulse voltammetry has these characteristics: 1) reversible reactions have symmetric peaks, and irreversible reactions have asymmetric peaks, 2) the peak potential is equal to E1/2r-ΔE in reversible reactions, and the peak current is proportional to the concentration, 3) The detection limit is about 10−8 M.

Wagner, based on the life of Bert Kreischer. National Lampoon's Van Wilder stars Ryan Reynolds as the title character alongside Tara Reid, Kal Penn, and Tim Matheson. The film follows the misadventures of its lead character Van Wilder, a seventh-year senior, who has made his life goal in helping undergrads at Coolidge College succeed in the future. After an article is written about his legacy by fellow student, Gwen Pearson, played by Reid, Van Wilder's party lifestyle are brought to light. This attracts the attention of Van's father, played by Matheson, which leads to his tuition being cut off. Van Wilder gets stuck in the middle of a love triangle between Gwen and her mean-spirited boyfriend, Richard \\"Dick\\" Bagg (Daniel Cosgrove) while struggling to graduate. Van tries various schemes to earn enough money to pay his tuition and graduate, with help from Gwen and the rest of the student body, except a couple of sinister enemies who attempt to sabotage his efforts. The film grossed $21,305,259 in the domestic box office; $16,970,224 in the international box office; and $38,275,483 worldwide overall. A sequel, Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj, was released on December 1, 2006. A prequel, Van Wilder: Freshman Year, was released straight-to-DVD on July 14, 2009. Plot Vance “Van” Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) is a confident and sardonic seventh-year senior at Coolidge College who is popular among most of the student body. With no ambition to graduate, Van spends his days driving around campus in his customized golf cart, posing nude for figure drawing classes, and organizing soirees and fundraisers for his peers. Among his friends are his roommate and close confidant Hutch (Teck Holmes) and his newly hired assistant Taj Badalandabad (Kal Penn), a sexually repressed foreign exchange student from India. Upon learning that his son is still in school, Van's father (Tim Matheson) arrives at Coolidge intent on bringing him home. When Van refuses, his father decides to sever Van's financial support. Faced with disenrollment due to unpaid tuition, Van seeks a payment extension from the registrar, Deloris Haver (Cynthia Fancher). After Van has sex with her, Deloris hands him the paperwork for an extension, which Van realizes he only needed to ask for in the first place. Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid) works for the school paper, and despite her talents for journalism, her articles don't generate interest from the student body. Her editor assigns her to get an “unattainable” human interest story on Van Wilder as he normally refuses to do interviews for the paper. After a couple of attempts to get money fast, Van is approached by the Lambda Omega Omega fraternity, offering to pay him a thousand dollars to throw them a blowout party and boost their popularity. Overhearing two of the Lambdas expressing their excitement over the party's success and their satisfaction with Van's work, Gwen writes a story crediting Van as the host of the party. Though Van hates the article at first, he realizes it can be the \\"cash cow\\" he needs to stay in school. Van eventually agrees to sit down with Gwen for the follow-up piece after losing a hockey bet to her. Gwen's boyfriend, Richard “Dick” Bagg (Daniel Cosgrove), is a pre- medical student and the president of his fraternity Delta Iota Kappa as well as the student government. As he learns of Gwen's work with Van and suspects a growing bond between them, he moves to sabotage their prospective romance. Van and Richard exchange escalating pranks, culminating in Van, Taj and Hutch replacing the cream filling of a batch of pastries with canine semen taken from Van's English Bulldog Colossus. Though Gwen grows closer to Van, she accesses his transcripts from the Admissions & Records office while doing background work on her piece, learning that Van has actively avoided graduating for the past seven semesters; he stopped attending classes years ago, 18 units short of graduation. Angry that Gwen dug into such personal details, Van dissociates himself from Gwen and takes a contemplative look at his life. Richard arranges to sabotage Van's latest party with Jeannie (Emily Rutherfurd), a member of a sister sorority by smuggling underaged children into the party and getting them drunk, then calling a campus police officer to the scene. As a result, Van is arrested for providing alcohol to minors and faces expulsion from Coolidge. A depressed Van prepares to leave Coolidge until Taj inspires him to fight back against the charges. The student body pools its resources to defend Van against the charges before a university panel featuring, among others, Van's collegiate adversary Professor McDougal (Paul Gleason), Deloris and Richard. While the law club invests time coaching Van to plead innocent to the charges, the rest of the student body works to generate support for Van. Having learned from his past mistakes and what Gwen has shown him, Van goes off-book during the hearing; though he did not intend for underage students to attend the party, he nonetheless considers himself responsible for ensuring its legality. He throws himself at the mercy of the court and asks that rather than expelling him, they force him to graduate; he offers to complete his remaining units before the semester ends, earning a degree in leisure studies. Professor McDougal surprises everyone with his swing vote, casting the 3–2 vote in favor of Van's reinstatement, and Van begins studying for the finals - which will be held in just six days. In retaliation for Richard's underhandedness (having learned it was him who set Van up and his later-revealed infidelity with Jeannie), Gwen spikes Richard's ritual protein shake with a powerful laxative just prior to his taking the Medical College Admission Test. Unable to hold out (since bathroom breaks are forbidden during the test), Richard “dials down the middle” on most of his multiple-choice exam sheet, and hurriedly exits the exam room. As he rushes to find a bathroom, he is intercepted by one of the doctors from the group meant to interview him for admission to Northwestern Medical School, who pulls him into an office to meet with the others. Unable to hold himself any longer, Richard strips off his pants and has violent diarrhea in the wastebasket in the room, to the revulsion and horror of the doctors present. Van uses the entire exam period for his last final with Professor McDougal, finishing with a negative attitude. McDougal himself delivers the news to Van that he passed. McDougal notes that he had been so hard on him all those years because he believed Van wasn't living up to his potential. Gwen finishes her article on Van for the graduation issue revealing Van's many contributions to the students and staff of Coolidge in the last seven years, his superhuman accomplishment of a semester's worth of studying in just six days, and Richard's plot to have Van expelled; Richard is last seen reading the article in a restroom, his medical school dreams, and reputation in ruins. The university celebrates Van's graduation with a wild party held in Van's honor. Van's father appears (having read Gwen's article), admitting he was wrong and expressing his pride in Van's success. Gwen then arrives, lovingly reuniting with Van. Cast Soundtrack The soundtrack album was released on March 26, 2002.

It was originally a wooden fort built in 1628 by the Spanish Empire, who named it \\"Fort San Domingo\\". However the fort was then destroyed by the Spanish themselves, after losing the Second Battle of San Salvador to the Dutch Empire in 1642. After the battle, in 1644, The Dutch rebuilt a fort in the original site, and renamed it \\"Fort Antonio\\". Since the Dutch were called \\"Red Haired People\\" by the Han immigrants during the time, the fort was then nicknamed \\"Fort Red Hair\\".(). In 1724, the Qing Government repaired the fort, and built a perimeter wall with four gates. From 1868 onwards the fort was leased to the British government as its consulate, and a new two-storey building was built nearby as the consul's residence. The fort continued to be used as a British consulate during Japanese rule, but was briefly closed during the Pacific War. After the war, it was returned to British control. The site was used as an unofficial British embassy until 1972, though official diplomatic relations between Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom were terminated in 1950. Afterwards the fort was temporarily managed by Australia and the United States of America, before the fort was returned to the government of Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1980. Since then, the fort has been a National Historical Site, open to tourists and archaeologists alike. The site of Fort San Domingo includes the main fortress, the former British consul's residence, and the south gate built during Qing dynasty. Among the architectures, the main fortress is one of the oldest buildings on the whole island, and there were four cannons placed in the front of the fortress, which could be traced back to Jiaqing era. The former British consul's residence is on the east side of the main fortress, and is a two-storey English-style building. The south gate is the only Chinese style architecture among all the buildings, and is made from Guangin Stones. Fort Dan Domingo is located near Hobe Fort, which was built during the late Qing era. History =Spanish Era= After the Spanish established a permanent colony at San Salvador (Palm Island; modern-day Hoping Island), they proceeded in 1629 to occupy Tamsui, \\"which even at this early period was frequented by many Chinese merchants, who came from Fokien to barter with the Formosa natives.\\" On a night in 1636, a group of local people, angered by the taxes that the Spanish governor had imposed, successfully attacked the fort and demolished it. In 1637, the Spanish rebuilt the fort using stone and raised the walls' height to twenty feet or more. A church was also built on a hill, and the locals helped to make a road to it from the fort. \\"Peter Nuits the Dutch Governor of Formosa, reported these facts to his home authorities and exposed in an interesting report the injury that the Spaniards were doing to Dutch trade and the necessity of sending an expedition to drive them away.\\" After a failed first attempt in 1641, the Dutch made a second expedition on 3 August 1642: \\"the Dutch appeared off Tamsui with a comparatively powerful squadron of four frigates, a large cutter, nine small vessels, besides several transports...\\" After the Dutch mounted artillery at an elevation commanding the fort, they succeeded in taking the fort on 24 August. The Dutch also expelled the Spaniards from nearby Keelung. The Spanish fort in Tamsui had by then already been razed by the Spanish themselves. It is also claimed that no traces remain of the forts on Palm Island, as they were destroyed by Zheng Jing, son of Koxinga. =Dutch era= The Dutch then became the \\"undisputed masters of Formosa\\", and built a new fort on the site with the intention to maintain the trade of sulfur and deer skin, while also deploying vessels in the Tamsui River to protect the trading zone. The fort was named as Fort Antonio, with the name of Governors-General of the Dutch East Indies, Anthony van Diemen, during the time. In 1644, they replaced it with the structure still standing today, also called Fort Antonio. The \\"Old Dutch Fort\\" made of brick and stone has been described as \\"impregnable against any engines of war that those early days could produce.\\" The locals called the Dutch \\"the red-haired people\\", which led to the compound's Hokkien name (). Map of the Spanish fort at Tamsui, later in hands of the VOC =Qing era= From 1683 to 1867 the Qing Dynasty Chinese government controlled the fort and during this time (1724) built a stone wall with four gates around it, of which only one, the main gate, survives. Fort San Domingo and bay, taken between 1860 and 1880. The former British consular residence next to the fort. Following the Second Opium War, in 1868 the British took over the fort, made it their trade consulate, and painted it red (it was previously white). The fort was struck during the 1884 French bombardment of the Battle of Tamsui but suffered no damage. The linguist Herbert Allen Giles resided in the fort from 1885 to 1888 and completed some of his work on the Wade-Giles system of romanization of Standard Chinese there. Next to the fort the British built their consular residence in 1891. The Fort is adjacent to Aletheia University, which traces its origins back to 1872 when the Reverend Dr. George Leslie Mackay, a Canadian Presbyterian, established a mission and then a medical service and a school. =Modern era= The consulate closed during World War II and reopened after the end of the war. The Republic of China (Taiwan) government retrieved the land from the British in 1980, several years after the United Kingdom broke off diplomatic relations with the ROC in 1972. The fort is classified as a grade one listed historical site and is now a museum with the interior recreated from photographs. In 2003, maintenance of the site was entrusted to the Taipei County Government from the Ministry of the Interior. It was reopened after refurbishment in 2005. Tourist information The fort and the former British consular residence, an elegant Victorian house fused with some Chinese elements, now function as a museum. The location provides a beautiful outlook on the Tamsui River and Guanyin Mountain. The fort is open to the public Tuesday – Sunday, 9am – 5pm. There is an $80NTD charge for admission, with some exceptions. Transport The fort is accessible within walking distance North West from Tamsui Station of the Taipei Metro.

It is located east of Antofagasta, some 106 km (60 mi) southeast of Calama and the Chuquicamata copper mine, overlooking the Licancabur volcano. It features a significant archeological museum, the R. P. Gustavo Le Paige Archaeological Museum, with a large collection of relics and artifacts from the region. Native ruins nearby now attract increasing numbers of tourists interested in learning about pre-Columbian cultures. History San Pedro de Atacama grew, over centuries, around an oasis in the Puna de Atacama, an arid high plateau. Its first inhabitants were the Atacameños, who developed basketworks and ceramic pottery crafts that can be now be appreciated by tourists in the several souvenir shops as typical products of San Pedro de Atacama. It was part of Bolivia since independence until Chile claimed ownership during the War of the Pacific. During that war, the Battle of Río Grande was fought in the surroundings. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, San Pedro de Atacama had 4,969 inhabitants (2,928 males and 2,041 females).

The commune is represented in the Senate by Alejandro Guillier Álvarez (PRSD) and Pedro Araya Guerrero (Ind.) as part of the second senatorial constituency (Antofagasta Region). Climate The town lies at an average of , thus visitors often experience mild altitude sickness such as dizziness, lethargy and headaches. The local climate is extremely dry and mild, with daytime temperatures between in the summer (December to February) and in the winter (June to August). Nighttime temperatures routinely drop below and can reach as low as in the winter. Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as cold desert (BWk) for an isotherm of the mean yearly temperature of lower than .

There are various technical definitions of what constitutes a bad debt, depending on accounting conventions, regulatory treatment and the institution provisioning. In the USA, bank loans with more than ninety days' arrears become \\"problem loans\\". Accounting sources advise that the full amount of a bad debt be written off to the profit and loss account or a provision for bad debts as soon as it is foreseen. Doubtful debt Doubtful debts are those debts which a business or individual is unlikely to be able to collect. The reasons for potential non- payment can include disputes over supply, delivery, the condition of item or the appearance of financial stress within a customer's operations. When such a dispute occurs it is prudent to add this debt or portion there of to the doubtful debt reserve. This is done to avoid over-stating the assets of the business as trade debtors are reported net of Doubtful debt. When there is no longer any doubt that a debt is uncollectible, the debt becomes bad. An example of a debt becoming uncollectible would be:- once final payments have been made from the liquidation of a customer's limited liability company, no further action can be taken. Doubtful debt reserve Also known as a bad debt reserve, this is a contra account listed within the current asset section of the balance sheet. The doubtful debt reserve holds a sum of money to allow a reduction in the accounts receivable ledger due to non-collection of debts. This can also be referred to as an allowance for bad debts. Once a doubtful debt becomes uncollectable, the amount will be written off. Accounting practice in different countries =United States= Allowance for bad debts are amounts expected to be uncollected but that are still possible to be collected (when there is no other possibility for collection, they are considered uncollectible accounts). For example, if gross receivables are US$100,000 and the amount that is expected to remain uncollected is $5,000, net receivables will be US$95,000. In financial accounting and finance, bad debt is the portion of receivables that can no longer be collected, typically from accounts receivable or loans. Bad debt in accounting is considered an expense. There are two methods to account for bad debt: # Direct write off method (Non-GAAP) - a receivable that is not considered collectible is charged directly to the income statement. # Allowance method (GAAP) - an estimate is made at the end of each fiscal year of the amount of bad debt. This is then accumulated in a provision that is then used to reduce specific receivable accounts as and when necessary. Because of the matching principle of accounting, revenues and expenses should be recorded in the period in which they are incurred. When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might default on payment, accounts receivable have to be recorded at net realizable value. The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called Allowance for doubtful accounts. At the end of each accounting cycle, adjusting entries are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense. The actual amount of uncollectible receivable is written off as an expense from Allowance for doubtful accounts. Taxability Some types of bad debts, whether business or non-business-related, are considered tax deductible. Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code provides the requirements for which a bad debt to be deducted. Criteria for deduction To be considered deductible, the debt must be: *bona fide debt, and *worthless within the taxable year. A debt is defined as a debt which arises from a debtor-creditor relationship based upon a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a determinable sum of money. The debt in question must also be considered worthless. This distinction is further broken down into the level of collectibles. One must determine whether the qualifying debt is completely or partially worthless. A partially worthless status means a portion of the debt may be recovered in future periods. Numerous factors are taken into consideration including the debtor’s insolvency status, health conditions, credit standing, etc. Section 166 Section 166 limits the amount of the deduction. There must be an amount of tax capital, or basis, in question to be recovered. In other words, is there an adjusted basis for determining a gain or loss for the debt in question. An additional factor in applying the criteria is the classification of the debt (non-business of business). A business bad debt is defined as a debt created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. Whereas, a non-business debt is defined as a debt that is not created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. The classification is quite significant in terms of the deductibility. A non- business bad debt must be completely worthless in order to be deducted. However, a business bad debt is deductible whether it is partially or completely worthless. Mortgage bad debt Mortgages which may noncollectable can be written off as a bad debt as well. However, they fall under a slightly different set of rules. As stated above, they can only be written off against tax capital, or income, but they are limited to a deduction of $3,000 per year. Any loss above that can be carried over to following years at the same amount. Thus a $60,000 mortgage bad debt will take 20 years to write off. Most owners of junior (2nd, 3rd, etc.) fall into this when the 1st mortgage forecloses with no equity remaining to pay on the junior liens. There is one option available for mortgages not available for business debt - donation. The difference is that a valuation of $10,000 can be taken without an appraisal. An appraisal may be able to increase the value to more and must be based on other similar mortgages that actually sold, but generally is less than the face value. The real difference is that as a donation the amount of deduction is limited to up to 50% of Adjusted Gross Income per year with carryovers taken over the next 5 years . This is because the deduction is now classified as a donation instead of a bad debt write off and uses Schedule A instead of Schedule D . This can significantly increase current year's tax reductions compared to the simple write off. The caveat is that it must be completed PRIOR to the date of final foreclosure and loss. The process is simple, but finding a charity to cooperate is difficult since there will be no cash value as soon as the 1st mortgage forecloses. Problem loan In the USA, bank loans with more than ninety days' arrears become \\"problem loans\\".

Hogan.  Origins  According to Hogan, the idea for the book originated around 1976 when he was asked by a friend about whether there was a solution to \\"the Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland. He said that there was no solution that he could see and that the only thing that might work was separating the children and the adults to prevent the prejudices from being taught at an early age. However, some years later he returned to the concept of a society free from conditioning, which formed part of the basis for Voyage from Yesteryear. Plot summary The story opens early in the 21st century, as an automated space probe is being prepared for a mission to explore habitable exoplanets in the Alpha Centauri system. However, Earth appears destined for a global war which the probe designers fear that humanity may not survive. It appears that the only chance for the human species is to reestablish itself far away from the conflict but there is no time left for a manned expedition to escape Earth. The team, led by Henry B. Congreve, change their mission priority and quickly modify the design to carry several hundred sets of electronically coded human genetic data. Also included in this mission of embryo space colonization is a databank of human knowledge, robots to convert the data into genetic material and care for the children and construct habitats when the destination is reached, and a number of artificial wombs. The probe's designers name it the Kuan-Yin after the bodhisattva of childbirth and compassion. Shortly after the launch, global war indeed breaks out and several decades later, Earthbound humanity is united under an authoritarian government. It is this government that receives a radio message from the fledgling \\"Chironian\\" civilization revealing that the probe found a habitable planet (Chiron) and that the first generation of children have been raised successfully. As the surviving power blocs of Earth before the conflict are still evident, North America, Europe and Asia each send a generation ship to Alpha Centauri to take control of the colony. By the time that the first generation ship (the American Mayflower II) arrives after 20 years, Chironian society is in its fifth generation. The Mayflower II has brought with it thousands of settlers, all the trappings of the authoritarian regime along with bureaucracy, religion, fascism and a military presence to keep the population in line. However, the planners behind the generation ship did not anticipate the direction that Chironian society took: in the absence of conditioning and with limitless robotic labor and fusion power, Chiron has become a post-scarcity economy. Money and material possessions are meaningless to the Chironians and social standing is determined by individual talent, which has resulted in a wealth of art and technology without any hierarchies, central authority or armed conflict. In an attempt to crush this anarchist adhocracy, the Mayflower II government employs every available method of control; however, in the absence of conditioning the Chironians are not even capable of comprehending the methods, let alone bowing to them. The Chironians simply use methods similar to Gandhi's satyagraha and other forms of nonviolent resistance to win over most of the Mayflower II crew members, who had never previously experienced true freedom, and isolate the die-hard authoritarians. Frustrated with their lack of success, the authoritarian faction stages a military coup on board the Mayflower II and launches the ship's heavily armed \\"battle module\\", threatening to attack unless they submit to a military dictatorship. Having isolated the authoritarians, the Chironians destroy the module with an antimatter particle beam weapon. The remainder of the crew dissolve their government and join Chironian society. The week after, the laser communications beam to the Mayflower II cuts off, having been destroyed in another global war that had taken place 4.5 years ago. The epilogue is set five years after these events and shows that the Chironians also assimilated the crews of the Asian and European starships. Now united, the Chironians refit and recommission the Mayflower II with an advanced antimatter drive and rename it the Henry B. Congreve. The Henry B. Congreve is sent back to Earth to rebuild human civilization (with the new drive, this journey will only take eight years), fulfilling the Kuan-Yin's mission of preserving humanity. Reception and influences Dave Langford reviewed Voyage from Yesteryear for White Dwarf #57, and stated that \\"Solid and quite worthy stuff, but practically devoid of characterization.\\" Much of the reaction to the novel has been related to the creation of the Chironian society. Ken MacLeod praised the \\"attractive and ... plausible depiction of a communist anarchy\\" while John Clute compared it with the work of Eric Frank Russell. The strong libertarian themes in the novel led to it winning the Prometheus Award in 1983, the first of Hogan's two wins. Hogan's essay \\"What Really Brought Down Communism?\\" explains the reception given to the book in the Soviet Union. In the mid-1980s, Hogan was informed that the novel had been serialized in a Polish science fiction magazine Fantastyka, and, in the absence of a functioning exchange mechanism, paid for it in Polish złotys credited to an account taken out in Hogan's name. The story was republished in other Eastern European countries where its depiction of nonviolent resistance against authority proved popular. In 1989, Hogan attended a convention in Kraków before travelling to Warsaw to meet the publishers of the magazine serial and draw out the money he had been paid. However, inflation following the collapse of the communist regime had reduced the value of the money in the account to just $8.43. Hogan concluded: \\"So after the U.S. had spent trillions on its B-52s, Trident submarines, NSA, CIA, and the rest, that was my tab for toppling the Soviet empire. There's always an easy way if you just look.\\" References  External links  * * Voyage from Yesteryear by James P.

Two long-running features of his programme were \\"The Golden Hour\\" and \\"Our Tune\\". Bates inherited \\"The Golden Hour\\" from Tony Blackburn. Listeners had to guess the year from records played and clues given by Bates. \\"Our Tune\\" ran from 1980 at 11am. Over Nino Rota's theme to Franco Zeffirelli's film Romeo and Juliet (1968), Bates read a sentimental story sent by a listener, ending with a record chosen by the correspondent. In \\"The Birthday File\\" Bates played music by stars celebrating a birthday. Bates' programme featured Jonathan King to comment about music and interviewed stars at the BRIT Awards. In 1989 his summer series \\"Round The World\\" was broadcast from a different country each day. He went round the world in 67 days and raised £300,000 for Oxfam.

He presented the station's roadshow before retiring from the duties after his round-the-world trip in 1989. When Matthew Bannister arrived to modernise Radio 1, Bates was thought to be under threat. Bannister says in The Nation's Favourite that he feared Bates's supposed subversive influence rather than his broadcasting style. Bates resigned in summer 1993 before the station could dismiss him, playing \\"Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)\\" by Reunion as his last record . Bates was on all five national BBC stations -- apart from his stint at BBC Radio 1 and his broadcasts for BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4, he also presented a Prom concert on BBC Radio 3 in 1987 and presented a digest of the daily papers on the original BBC Radio 5 (now BBC Radio Five Live) in 1990. =After Radio 1= After leaving Radio 1 he worked for Irish-based long wave station Atlantic 252, reviving \\"Our Tune\\" and then presented a TV version of the feature daily for BBC1's Good Morning with Anne and Nick in 199495 and later for Sky One.

This was lampooned by comedians such as Harry Enfield BBC Video Ident - 1990's and Ben Elton. Bates appeared himself in a parody of these announcements in adverts for the video game Primal Rage. From September 1995 to April 1996, Bates broadcast for Talk Radio UK (now TalkSport) as the breakfast show presenter. He was then heard on London's Liberty Radio as mid- morning presenter until 1997.

Written by D.C. Fontana and Jerome Bixby (based on Bixby's story) and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast February 23, 1968. In the episode, beings from another galaxy commandeer the Enterprise in an attempt to return home. The title is taken from a line spoken by Juliet in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet: \\"that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet\\",Romeo and Juliet, II.ii.43–44. a line quoted by Captain Kirk during the episode. Plot The Federation starship USS Enterprise responds to a distress call from an uncharted planet. A landing party beams down to locate the source, and promptly finds a humanoid male and female, Rojan and Kelinda of the Kelvan Empire, who immediately paralyze Kirk and the landing party and order Kirk to surrender the Enterprise. Rojan tells Kirk that the Kelvans originate from the Andromeda Galaxy, and have come to find planets suitable for conquest in the Milky Way galaxy. As their own ship had been destroyed by the negative-energy barrier at the galactic rim, they need the Enterprise to make the 300-year return journey. Three other Kelvans transport aboard the Enterprise, and quickly gain control of the ship. Rojan orders the landing party to a cave guarded by Kelinda. Mr. Spock uses his Vulcan telepathic ability to lure her into the cave, where Kirk knocks her unconscious and seizes her control belt. Their freedom is short-lived, however, and as punishment Rojan orders the Kelvan Hanar to activate his belt, transforming two of the landing team members to small cuboctahedral blocks of a chalk-like substance. Rojan picks up the blocks and crushes one to dust, killing Yeoman Thompson. He then transforms the other block (Lt. Shea) back into human form. Back in their cell, Spock relates the experience of his mental contact with Kelinda. The Kelvans, it seems, are not humanoid after all, but have taken human form for convenience; they are actually huge creatures with hundreds of tentacles. (So alien were they, and so powerful their minds, that he had been thrown back out of the mind meld.) Kirk and Spock decide to try to adapt McCoy's neural scanning equipment into a countermeasure to the Kelvans' paralysis field. As a pretext for beaming back to the ship, Spock feigns illness by placing himself into a deep trance. The Kelvans transport the rest of the landing party and themselves to the ship shortly afterwards. Spock determines that there is no hope of penetrating the paralysis field projector's casing. Instead, he has Scott rig the matter/antimatter system to explode on contact with the barrier if Kirk so orders. Kirk opts not to. Once the ship has crossed the galactic barrier, the Kelvans reduce all personnel except Kirk, Scott, Spock, and McCoy into chalk-like blocks. Spock remembers more from his mental contact with Kelinda and reveals that the Kelvans in their natural form have very weak senses and emotions, but in their present form they are having human reactions. Kirk decides to use their inexperience with physical and emotional stimuli against them. Scott introduces the Kelvan engineer Tomar to alcoholic beverages, McCoy injects Hanar with a \\"supplement\\" that is actually a stimulant, and Kirk begins a flirtation with Kelinda, provoking feelings of jealousy in Rojan. Kirk is eventually able to goad Rojan into attacking him, and, in the course of the fight, points out that Rojan is behaving like a human and that his descendants who reach the Andromeda Galaxy will be alien inferiors in the eyes of the Kelvans. Realizing Kirk is correct, Rojan relinquishes control of the ship to Kirk, who then gives the order to return \\"home\\" to our galaxy. The world on which Rojan and his people were marooned is suggested as their new home. Reception Critic Darren Mooney credits this episode's slow pace to the transition from Gene L. Coon to John Meredyth Lucas as show producer. In 2018, Collider ranked this episode the 9th best original series episode.

The stated priorities of the organization are the decriminalization of responsible drug use, the promotion of harm reduction and treatment in response to drug misuse, and the facilitation of open dialog about drugs between youth, parents, and educators. Overview The Drug Policy Alliance was formed when the Drug Policy Foundation and the Lindesmith Center merged in July 2000. Lindesmith Center founder Ethan Nadelmann served as its first Executive Director. The organization has offices in five states as well as a national affairs office in Washington, D.C., which lobbies for federal reform. Administrative and media headquarters are located in New York City, NY. The office for legal affairs is located in Oakland, CA, with two additional state offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The remaining three state offices are located in Trenton, NJ, Santa Fe, NM, and Denver, CO. Broadcast journalist Walter Cronkite spoke out against the War on Drugs in support of the Drug Policy Alliance. He appeared in advertisements on behalf of the organization and wrote a fundraising letter, which was also published in The Huffington Post. In the letter, Cronkite wrote: \\"Today, our nation is fighting two wars: one abroad and one at home. While the war in Iraq is in the headlines, the other war is still being fought on our own streets. Its casualties are the wasted lives of our own citizens. I am speaking of the war on drugs. And I cannot help but wonder how many more lives, and how much more money, will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see: the war on drugs is a failure.\\" Main issues =Cannabis= DPA believes that cannabis should be legal for medicinal purposes of severely ill individuals. They are working state-by-state to educate and inform governors and the people about their beliefs on medicinal marijuana. They present their success with the compassionate use bill which brought medical marijuana access to New Mexico in 2007.Drug Policy Alliance \\"Marijuana\\" =The failed drug war= DPA believes that the War on Drugs in America has failed. They present the argument that the United States has spent billions of dollars on making the country drug- free, but many illicit drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and many others, are purer and more prevalent than ever before. =Overdose= DPA believes the growing numbers of deaths due to drug overdose should be dealt with as a medical rather than a criminal issue. They present the Drug Overdose Reduction Act as their solution.Drug Policy Alliance \\"Preventing Overdose\\" =Parents, teens, and drugs= DPA believes that young people need access to credible information regarding decisions and information on drugs. They believe that open and honest dialogue is the key, and with this idea started the Safety First Project. =State by state= DPA presents the argument that all drugs are different and pose different risks. So, their response is to create policies for individual specific drugs rather than bundling them. They believe that successful harm reduction plays a pivotal role in this topic.Drug Policy Alliance \\"State by State\\" =Health approaches= DPA believes that harm reduction is the best solution to drug abuse and argues that it is not a source for the promotion of drug legalization, rather a movement to reduce the harm of drug abuse in the American society.Drug Policy Alliance \\"Reducing Harm: Treatment and Beyond\\" =Law= DPA believes that many of the arrests for drug possession have been conflicting with many areas of the constitutional rights of Americans. They have been fighting for these rights through their Office of Legal Affairs. DPA has also provided funding for Flex Your Rights, a nonprofit organization that educates the public about their constitutional rights during police encounters. =Communities affected= DPA believes that the war on drugs does not affect all of the American population the same way. They believe that the following four groups suffer the most: Women, Minorities, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender, and Dance, Music and Entertainment.\\"Communities Affected by the War on Drugs\\" =Drug policy around the world= DPA states that many countries around the world are approaching their own war on drugs in a different way than the United States does and that many of the countries can lead as examples for many new approaches in the U.S.\\"Drug Policy Around the World\\" Results DPA was a source of support for California's Proposition 36. \\"Prop 36\\" and the formation of the Drug Courts gave non-violent drug offenders the opportunity to seek treatment in drug rehabilitation programs rather than serve jail sentences. The Drug Courts also removed unlicensed drug rehabs as options for fulfilling probation requirements. DPA was a sponsor of California’s 1996 landmark medical marijuana law, Proposition 215, which made cannabis available to seriously ill patients as well as reduced criminal penalties for possession. DPA continued to weigh in on drug policy legislation with Proposition 215 in Alaska in 1998, Oregon in 1998, Washington in 1998, Maine in 1999, Colorado in 2000, Nevada in 1998 and 2000 and New Mexico in 2007.Drug Policy Alliance \\"About DPA\\" In 2000, DPA helped push California’s landmark treatment-not-incarceration law called Proposition 36. It replaces jail time with substance abuse treatment for first and second time nonviolent drug offenders. More than 84,000 people were removed from jail and graduated from treatment. In 2006, DPA got the “Blood- Borne Disease Harm Reduction Act” signed into law in New Jersey. It allows up to six cities to establish syringe access programs. This helps prevent the spread of blood-borne diseases such as HIV/AIDS. DPA has worked across the country to pass the “911 Good Samaritan Immunity Laws”. These laws are to help encourage overdose witnesses to call 911. They reduce drug possession charges for those who seek medical help. DPA led a campaign in New Mexico to pass the law and were successful in 2007. DPA is also working to eliminate mandatory minimum sentencing and racially biased crack/cocaine sentencing schemes at the state and federal levels. DPA supported the bill that legalized cannabis in Uruguay in 2013.Drug Policy Alliance apoya a Uruguay - Montevideo Portal, December 10, 2013 DPA awards DPA gives annual awards to \\"honor advocates, elected officials and organizations for their courageous work in reforming drug laws.\\".DPA, November 4, 2005, Drug Policy Alliance to Hand Out Honors to Leading Advocates and Organizations at Biennial Conference in Long Beach, CA These include * Edward M.

The second and third games were known as Damocles and Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis respectively. The games were notable for their smooth vector and polygonal graphics, vast environments, and open-ended gameplay which offered several ways to complete each game. All three titles were favourably reviewed when they were originally released, and the titles have a following in the retrogaming community.The Mercenary Site, dedicated to all three installments of the Mercenary series Overview The Mercenary series consists of three main games and a number of add-on datasets. While each game is self-contained, they make occasional references to other games in the series and are connected in terms of their freeform, open-ended gameplay, visual appearance and general ambience. Within each game the player must explore a world rendered in realtime 3D graphics, completing a number of non- linear tasks in order to achieve a single main objective. The title of the series derives from the player's role in carrying out tasks as a \\"hired gun\\". In Mercenary the player crash lands into an ongoing conflict and is able to play the warring factions off against one another to the player's own advantage. In Damocles the player is encouraged to bargain the fate of a whole world for financial reward. However, in The Dion Crisis the player has a less selfish agenda, and must gain the support of voters against the plotting of a sinister businessman. In all three games, the player is accompanied and advised by Benson, a \\"9th generation PC\\". This interaction is handled via a scrolling news ticker at the bottom of the display. As well as providing assistance to the player, much of the humour within the games comes from the occasional sarcastic remarks made by Benson. The Mercenary series =Mercenary= Mercenary (also known as Mercenary: Escape from Targ, Mercenary 1, and Mercenary: A Flight Simulator Adventure in the US) is the first game in the series. It was initially released on the Atari 8-bit family in 1985 and later converted to the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore Amiga and Commodore 16/116/Plus/4 platforms. Across all versions, the game environment is presented using wire frame graphics. Having crash-landed on the planet Targ (en route to the Gamma System of Damocles), the player's main objective is to find a means of escape. In a trademark element of the Mercenary series, there are several ways to achieve this end. A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous \\"good guys\\") and the Mechanoids (invading \\"bad guys\\"), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause. There are other routes to escape, and it is possible to combine strategies to both leave Targ and keep the wealth accrued there. Mercenary: The Second City Mercenary: The Second City, released in 1986, is an expansion pack for the original game. Initially its major distinction is the new colour scheme, representing the other side of the planet. The ground is now red rather than the original green, and the sky is no longer blue. Instead, it is pink in the Amiga and Atari (8-bit and ST) versions, dark blue on the Commodore 8-bit platforms (C64 and Plus/4) and yellow on the ZX Spectrum. However, after a similar objective, the substantive differences reveal themselves subtly: there is a more intricate underground complex, a new set of puzzles to overcome and several significant changes with game objects. It was later repackaged with the original game under the title Mercenary Compendium. =Damocles= Presidential Palace Damocles (occasionally advertised as Mercenary II) is the second game in the series. It was released on the Atari ST and Amiga platforms in 1990. Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions were originally in development but eventually cancelled as a consequence of the declining 8-bit market. Unlike Mercenary, Damocles represented the game environment using filled polygon graphics, allowing a both more realistic and colourful world. An improved, fully texture mapped IBM PC version was in an advanced stage of development and scheduled for release in 1995, but was ultimately cancelled when a conflict between its developers, Novagen and Psygnosis, arose. Once again, the player is stranded on a planet, Eris, with an inoperable spacecraft. Unlike the first game, however, the scope of Damocles is considerably widened, offering the player an entire solar system to explore (the Gamma System; the player's original destination before the Interlude on Targ). There is also a race-against-time element to the game as a comet, the eponymous Damocles (a reference to the Sword of Damocles), is hurtling towards Eris. The player is encouraged to both escape Eris and find a means to prevent Damocles from destroying the planet, if possible without destroying the comet. Although an obvious, but destructive, solution exists, Damocles has no fewer than five distinct solutions. A notable feature of Damocles is its inclusion of orbital mechanics into the game physics. While also featuring less standard physics (e.g. teleportation), it includes a detailed representation of the dynamics of the Gamma System and even includes a simplified form of special relativity. To cross the solar system in reasonable (to the player) time, time dilation occurs. However, given that the player has only a few hours to save Eris, extended periods at near-light speed are unwise. One of the game's many solutions even involves manipulating various planetary bodies in order to make use of the changes in gravitational pulls to divert the Damocles comet. From an aesthetic point of view, the inclusion of celestial physics allows the player to experience attractively-rendered sunrises and sunsets while on planet surfaces as well as various satellite occultations. Damocles contains many real-world references, particularly drawn from the UK in the 1980s. For example, the president of the planet Eris is named Margaret, after Margaret Thatcher (British Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990); and there is a bank called Lawson Bank, after Nigel Lawson (British chancellor of the exchequer from 1983 to 1989; though a real Lawson Bank does exist). Some of the references are more elusive; for example, several stores are called \\"GUM Stores\\", after the real Russian Gosudarstvennyj Universalnyj Magazin department stores. However, the fictional planet of Eris is not a reference to the real-life dwarf planet of the same name, as the latter was only discovered in 2005, some 15 years after the release of Damocles. Despite these references, the game universe has no actual connections with Earth, since the player is given information that the Gamma System was actively explored before the present day (e.g. on approaching a particular moon, Benson informs the player that a space flight company was already present there in 1190). According to the poster that accompanied the game, the events of Damocles take place on 27 April 2099. Damocles: Mission Disks Two mission disks for Damocles were released, known simply as Damocles: Mission Disk 1 and Damocles: Mission Disk 2 respectively. Each disk added a number of extra missions that could be loaded in as saved games, offering the player a few more tasks to complete within the game. Usually these tasks put the player in difficult or unusual situations from which they have to extricate themselves. =Mercenary III= Mercenary III (also known as Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis or Damocles II) is the third and final game in the series. It was released on the Atari ST and Amiga platforms in 1992. Mercenary III is set in the Gamma System again and is based on an improved version of the engine used by Damocles: this time the roads of the various cities are populated by vehicles such as taxis and buses; observation and attack spacecraft are present in the skies; and interaction (albeit to a limited degree) with other characters is possible. After Eris' President Margaret steps down, the player becomes involved in a political crisis on the planet Dion, pitting their wits against a power-hungry politician running for president. The goal of Mercenary III is to prevent this politician from being elected to office. Similarly to the earlier titles, there are several ways of achieving this, with both straightforward and oblique solutions. No mission disks were released for this concluding chapter of the Mercenary series. According to the poster that accompanied the game, the events of Mercenary III take place on 15 January 2101. The villain of this game is a character who appeared in Mercenary: PC BIL, short for the Palyars Commander's Brother-In-Law. =False sequel= In April 1998, the Italian gaming website Zzap! (managed by the same editors and in the same style of the Italian edition of Zzap!64) published a review of a nonexistent sequel as an April Fool's Day prank. The plot of this game, supposedly titled Mercenary IV: The Eleventh Planet, would have been about the invasion of the Gamma system by the inhabitants of a planet with an erratic orbit that entered the system once again. In reality, the plot was inspired by Zecharia Sitchin's book The Twelfth Planet, while the images were doctored screenshots of a custom Duke Nukem 3D level and the unreleased PC version of Damocles. PC port During the 2000s, the three games were ported to PC. It was distributed with the agreement of the former Novagen team. The program, called MDDClone (Mercenary, Damocles, Dion crisis Clone) is freeware, includes all three games, selectable through a drop-down list. It features graphics and gameplay identical to that of the Atari ST versions of the games, with the additional option to fix some bugs that were originally present. To facilitate play, text in the games (principally that from Benson) has been translated from English into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian and Polish in the MDDClone. Reception All three Mercenary titles received strong positive reviews from gaming magazines across all platforms, with the original Mercenary receiving a Gold Medal from Zzap!64 magazine. RUN reviewer Bob Sodaro noted the replay value of Mercenary for the Commodore 64, writing \\"Prior to marking up the maps [included with the game], you should make a number of photocopies so you'll have clean copies when playing subsequent adventures\\". Antic also advised making copies of the map and taking notes. It described the game's size and Atari 8-bit version's graphics as \\"awesome\\", but warned that a color display was required. The magazine concluded that \\"Mercenary's video effects make it a good game overall. But if you aren't in the right place to pick up the clues, you'll get nowhere\\". The ZX Spectrum version of Mercenary was voted number 15 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time, while the Amiga version of Damocles was ranked the 21st best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 0, Future Publishing, May 1991 STart praised Damocless \\"stunning graphics\\", and stated that the \\"massively-detailed environment ... is an innovation in game design\\". The magazine concluded that \\"Damocles is definitely a challenging race against time, to be tackled by all\\".

Details Pye was approximately 37 years old, and a sergeant-major in the 53rd Regiment of Foot (later The King's Shropshire Light Infantry), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 17 November 1857 at Lucknow, India for which he was awarded the VC: Charles Pye is not to be confused with Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Colquhoun Pye (11 Nov 1834 – 17 Feb 1872), son of Henry John Pye and Mary Anne Walker of Clifton Campville, Staffordshire. Charles Colquhoun Pye was not the recipient of the Victoria Cross. Early life Charles Pye was the eldest child of Thomas Pye and Alice Hall. Born in 1820 his birth date is unknown. His baptism occurred on 24 September 1820 at St Mary's church, Castle Church, Staffordshire. Charles was probably a few months old when he was baptised. His death certificate and obituary state he was 56 years old when he died, which suggests he was born prior to July 1820. Charles's brothers, Timothy (b 1822) and Philip (b 1824), where born at Rickercote where their father, Thomas Pye, was a labourer. His sister Harriet (b 1826) and brother Peter (b 1830) were born in Birmingham, where Thomas was a brickmaker. Following the death of their mother, Thomas took his children back to the family home at Rickerscote to be raised by his brother, George Pye and sister Mary Pye. George Pye was later quoted in a newspaper saying that Charles was \\"educated at Stafford\\" and indeed his later correspondence was well written. With the conviction and transportation of their father in 1836 the children were virtually orphaned. Where Charles worked after the completion of his schooling is unknown, however, by 1840 he enlisted at Coventry, Warwickshire, from there being sent for service to India with the 40th Regiment. Pye was promoted to Corporal and transferred into the 53rd Foot in 1858. He became adjutant in 1859 and was promoted without purchase to lieutenant on 9 April, 1860. On 14 April 1860 the 53rd Regiment, including Charles's wife, Mary Ann and her children, Catherine and Matthew Farrell, returned to England on the Lady Clarendon. In 1862 Charles Pye took his discharge and emigrated to New Zealand with his wife and stepdaughter. Here he was appointed Captain of the Auckland Militia in July 1863, and the following year as Captain of the Colonial Defence Force. He served at Hairini and Te Ranga in the Bay of Plenty and a redoubt near Tauranga, Pye's Pa was named in his honour. Following his discharge Charles Pye lived at Papakura then for a short time at Shortland (Thames) where he owned the Duke of Edinburgh goldmine. In 1875 he sailed to Australia, travelling to Kirkstall, Victoria Australia where he purchased his father's farm (his father having married again, had a second family in the district) in 1876 a month before he died on 12 July 1876. He is buried in the same cemetery as his three half brothers. His medals were donated to the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Later life At the end of the Maori wars the Colonial Defence Force was stationed at Papakura where Charles was involed in the local community. He had been a far better soldier than a businessman as his bankruptcy attested. Following the disbanding of the Defence Force in 1866 and the opening up of the goldfields at Thames, Charles and his wife, Mary Ann moved to Karaka Hill, Shortland, Thames. He purchased the Duke of Edinburgh goldmine but was later led into speculating and lost heavily. By 1875, having discovered his father's address he sailed to Australia where they reunited after an absence of forty years. He was taken ill with bronchitis which proved fatal and was buried in the Tower Hill cemetery at Koroit near Warrnambool. Mary Ann Pye died at her son-in-law's home at Mangere on 31 December, 1900 and is buried at the Mangere cemetery with her daughter and grandchildren..The Victoria Cross to the 53rd Regiment : India 1857-58 The farming locality of Pyes Pa, south of Tauranga, is named after him. Memorials honouring Captain Pye can be found at Stafford, UK (his birthplace) and Kirkstall near Koroit, Victoria (his deathplace).

However, a lengthy privately owned bush tramway ran south from the railway station to serve logging interests near Lake Ianthe and a railway extension from Ross through the Haast Pass to connect with the Otago Central Railway was proposed in the early 20th century, but did not eventuate.\\"The Dense Forests and Snow-Fed Streams of the West: Ross to Wanaka via the Haast Pass\\", Otago Witness (24 January 1906), 57. From the 1940s until 9 October 1962, a Vulcan railcar service operated directly from Christchurch to Ross twice a day. A lack of traffic and expensive maintenance costs meant the line was closed beyond Hokitika on 24 November 1980. Much of the old track bed between Ruatapu and Hokitika can be driven as it serves as an access road for local farmers, and a disused truss bridge still stands north of Ross.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 60-1. Demographics and education The population, recorded as 297 people in the 2013 New Zealand census, is largely European in ethnicity, with a minority claiming Māori descent. The town's economy is based around farming and forestry, although a large open-cut mine has operated directly adjacent to the town since 1988. Ross School, a coeducational contributing primary school with a decile rating of six and a roll of 24, is located within the town.

In its standard, post-1957 configuration, the Precision Bass is a solid body, four-stringed instrument equipped with a single split-coil humbucking pickup and a one- piece, 20-fret maple neck with rosewood, pau ferro, or maple fingerboard. Its prototype, designed by Leo Fender in 1950, was brought to market in 1951.Wheeler, Tom, American Guitars: An Illustrated History, interview with Leo Fender, Harper Perennial, NY 1992 It was the first electric bass to earn widespread attention and use, remaining among the best-selling and most- imitated electric basses with considerable effect on the sound of popular music. Background The double bass, as a very large instrument, is often regarded as physically cumbersome and difficult to transport compared with smaller instruments. It was also becoming hard to hear in large bands or those that used amplified instruments, and it requires specialised skills to play that are distinct from those required to play the guitar. The Precision Bass was designed to overcome these problems. The name \\"Precision\\" came from the use of frets to play in tune more easily than upon the fretless fingerboard of the double bass. The electric bass, however, lacks the distinctive acoustic qualities of the double bass, offering a more solid, harder-edged sound with more sustain. The bass guitar became more dominant and transformed the beat and rhythm of pop music from jump blues and swing to rhythm and blues, rock, soul and funk. Acceptance of the electric bass was initially slow, as upright bassists looked at this new instrument with similar contempt, as guitar players did with its solid-body sibling, the Telecaster. It was vibraphonist/drummer Lionel Hampton's band that was among the first to incorporate the new instrument, with subsequent help by the endorsement of Elvis Presley's bass-player Bill Black, who was beginning to use a Precision Bass during the filming of Jailhouse Rock. It was reputed that Black became so frustrated over his initial inability to get used to playing it, he angrily threw it on the floor. Fender also delivered an early Precision to Los Angeles session bassist and arranger Shifty Henry. Monk Montgomery became the second jazz player to popularize the \\"Fender Bass\\"; first, while playing with Lionel Hampton; and then with his brother, guitarist Wes Montgomery. By the end of the 1950's the \\"P-Bass\\" was finally gaining acceptance with both rock'n roll and country bassists, as well as guitarists who would double on the instrument; most notable, was Carol Kaye, a jazz guitarist, who as a bassist, became best-known for her work as part of the consortium of L.A. session musicians, known as The Wrecking Crew. Design alterations and variants A patent sketch for the Fender Precision Bass The original Precision Bass of 1951 shared several of its design features with the six-string Telecaster guitar, the main difference being its double cutaway body. The 1954 release of the Stratocaster with its contoured edges for comfort, was inspired by the Precision bass, which in kind, also received the same style body contours. In 1957 the headstock and pickguard were redesigned to resemble the Stratocaster, with a rounder neck heel replacing the original square shape. A redesigned pickguard was made of a single layer of gold-anodized aluminium with 10 screw holes. At the same time the original single-coil pickup was replaced by the Precision split-coil design with staggered pole pieces, connected in a humbucking mode. However, Fender never emphasized this, as the Seth Lover patent on the humbucking pickup had not yet expired. In 1959 a glued-on rosewood fingerboard featuring \\"clay\\"-style dot position markers replaced the 1-piece maple neck and remained standard until 1966/67, when the CBS-owned Fender companies began to offer a separate, laminated maple fingerboard capped on a maple neck. Rosewood fingerboards were then made of a veneered, round- laminated piece of wood and pearloid dot markers replaced the \\"clay\\"-style inlays introduced in 1959. A Patent Sketch for The Original Fender Precision Bass Design In 1960 the aluminum pickguard was replaced with a 13-screw celluloid design having 3 or 4 layers of black, white, white pearloid or brown \\"tortoise-shell\\"). In that same year the newly designed Fender Jazz Bass was released. The original Telecaster-derived design, with a few updates, was reintroduced in 1968 as the Telecaster Bass. Within a few years, however, it had evolved into a model distinctly different from the contemporary Precision Bass, alongside which it was marketed through 1979. Two artist-designed models use the Telecaster Bass body style; the Mike Dirnt Precision Bass, using today's standard single split-coil pick-up, and the Sting Precision Bass, using a single coil pick-up as did the earliest design. 1958 reissue Precision bass Since 1969 the 1-piece maple neck option has been fitted to many Fender basses and the rosewood fretboard offered as alternative. Some Precision Basses made in the 1970s were also available with an unlined fretless rosewood, ebony or (usually) maple fingerboard, popularized by endorsees Sting and Tony Franklin. Fender briefly offered a fretless P Bass in the mid-1990s as a part of the first-generation American Standard line but dropped this variant at the end of the 20th century. From 1980 to 1984 the Precision Bass was given new active pickups and a high-mass brass bridge. The Special (1980) featured a split-coil pickup with white covers, gold hardware, a 2-band EQ and an active/passive toggle switch. The Elite (1983) had one (Elite I) or two (Elite II) split-coil humbucking pickups, TBX tone circuit and a Schaller fine-tune bridge later used on the Plus Series models of the early 1990s. Some models were available with solid walnut body and stained ebony fretboard. Japanese models appeared in late 1984, with a smaller body shape and a modern C-shape maple neck with 22 medium-jumbo frets. The later 1980s and 1990s saw the introduction of the Precision Plus and Deluxe Plus basses in 1989 and 1991, featuring Lace Sensor pickups, fine-tuner bridges, 22-fret necks and passive or active electronics on certain models. The Custom Shop 40th Anniversary model of 1991 was a luxurious version of the Precision Plus Deluxe bass with gold hardware, a quilted maple top and an ebony fretboard with side dot position markers. The American Series Precision Bass was introduced in 2000 and discontinued in 2008. From 2003 the S-1 switching system allowed the pickup coils to be switched from series to parallel, offering a wider tonal range, but this was discontinued in 2008 with the second generation of American Standard Series instruments. 1956 Precision bass A Black Precision Bass The American Standard (featuring a high-mass vintage bridge and Hipshot lightweight staggered tuning machines), American Deluxe (featuring a J-style humbucking pickup in the bridge position and an active 3-band EQ with an 18V power supply), Highway One (featuring '70s styling, and later models featuring BadAss II bridges with grooved saddles and a Greasebucket tone circuit since 2006) and American Vintage series models are manufactured in Corona, California. As of December 5, 2008, the Standard P-Bass has been updated with CBS era-style decals, a 3-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard. Other features include a split-coil hum- cancelling pickup and a return to the knurled chrome flat-top control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with aged white Stratocaster control knobs. As of March 23, 2010, all American Deluxe Precision Basses came with a N3 stacked-coil Jazz Bass pickup in the bridge position, a 21-fret tinted maple neck with compound rosewood or maple fingerboard with white or black pearloid dot markers, an active/passive toggle switch, a high-mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage tuners, a stealth retainer bar for the A string and a bold CBS-era headstock decal. As of March 23, 2012 the American Standard Precision Bass (except the 5-string version) comes with a Custom Shop 60's P-Bass split-coil humbucking pickup. The 2012 color chart listed 3-Color Sunburst, Olympic White, Black, Candy Cola, Jade Pearl Metallic, Charcoal Frost Metallic as available finishes during that period. As of April 19, 2012 the American Standard Precision Basses are loaded with the Custom Shop '60s Precision Bass split single-coil pick-ups, a 20-fret graphite-reinforced maple neck with compound rosewood or maple fingerboard with white or black pearloid dot markers and a high-mass vintage bridge. It be bought as a 4 or 5 string bass. American Deluxe \\"Ash Body\\" Precisions were offered from 1995 to 2006, and are currently available as of 2011; the 2004 color chart listed Aged Cherry Sunburst, Butterscotch Blonde and Tobacco Sunburst as available finishes during that period. The Road Worn Series 50s P-Bass (introduced in 2009) features a distressed alder body with nitrocellulose lacquer finish, a 1-ply gold anodized pickguard, a synthetic bone nut, American Vintage hardware, a split-coil humbucking pickup and a 1-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 20 vintage frets. In January 2017, Fender retired it's American Standard line to be replaced by the American Professional Series. The Precision Bass was updated with new V-Mod pickups, upgraded tuners that featured increased sustain and better tuning stability, Narrow-Tall frets and a ’63 P Bass profile neck. In October 2020 Fender introduced the American Professional II Precision Bass. Updates included a V-Mod II pickup which had varying amounts of Alnico in each pickup pole for a more balanced sound, new sculpted neck heel (similar to those seen previously on the Elite and Ultra models), Super-Natural neck finish, Posiflex graphite rods for added neck stability and tapered-shaft turning machines. Fender also added new finishes were also added to the lineup: Dark Night, Mercury, Miami Blue and Mystic Surf Green. Finishes that remained in the lineup were 3-Color Sunburst, Black and Olympic White. Fender has also produced several 'Deluxe' or 'Special' models that feature active electronics and/or a Jazz Bass pickup or humbucking soap-bar-type pick-up at the bridge position as well as the normal split-coil pickup to increase the tonal options available. Some P-Basses with J-style bridge pickups used the Jazz Bass control layout—2 volumes and tone—and a side-mount jack socket. Others had the front pickup volume control moved forward to leave room for a top-mounted jack socket. Other variants include dual stacked control knobs similar to that of an early 1960s Jazz Bass or a 3-way pickup selector switch (as used on the Tony Franklin Signature and Plus Series P-Basses). Other variants (sometimes with 21 or 22 frets on the fingerboard) and special-edition Precision Bass guitars have been offered in recent years. Fender made an American Deluxe 5-string model with a split-coil neck pickup, a humbucking J-style bridge pickup and a 3-band active EQ between 2001 and 2007 and currently produces a passive American Professional with a high-mass vintage bridge, a V-Mod split pickup, narrow tall frets and a gloss-coated maple neck with satin back and vintage tint as of 2017, tuned BEADG, along with a Squier Standard version sporting two J-Bass pickups with alnico magnets. The company has also built a Korean- made Squier ProTone 5-string Precision with dual humbuckers and gold hardware in the mid-1990s and a short-scale passive 5-string tuned EADGC called the Bass V during the CBS period in the mid-1960s. The Bass V did not sell well, and after it was discontinued, Fender did not offer another 5-string bass guitar until the 1980s.

It is distinct from the Precision Bass in that its tone is brighter and richer in the midrange and treble with less emphasis on the fundamental frequency. The body shape is also different from the Precision Bass, in that the Precision Bass has a symmetrical lower bout on the body, designed after the Telecaster and Stratocaster lines of guitars, while the Jazz Bass has an offset lower bout, mimicking the design aesthetic of the Jaguar and Jazzmaster guitars. History First introduced in 1960 as the Deluxe Model, it borrowed design elements from the Jazzmaster guitar. It was renamed the Jazz Bass as Fender felt that its redesigned neck—narrower and more rounded than that of the Precision Bass—would appeal more to jazz musicians. The Jazz Bass has two single coil pickups with two pole pieces per string. As well as having a slightly different, less symmetrical and more contoured body shape (known in Fender advertising as the \\"Offset Waist Contour\\" body), the Jazz Bass neck is noticeably narrower at the nut than that of the Fender Precision Bass. While the Precision Bass was originally styled similarly to the Telecaster guitar, the Jazz Bass' styling was inspired by the Jazzmaster guitar, with which the Jazz shared its offset body and sculpted edges that differentiate it from other slab-style bass bodies. The original intention of the instrument was to appeal to upright bass players. The original Jazz Bass had two stacked knob pots with volume and tone control for each pickup. Original instruments with this stacked configuration are highly valued in the vintage guitar market. In late 1961 it received three control knobs: two controlling the volume of each pickup and one the overall tone. Despite this new feature, many stacked knob models were made until about 1962. Another feature the initial models had were the \\"Spring Felt Mutes\\", which were present on basses from 1960 until 1962. The purpose of those mutes was to dampen the overtones and the sustain, and were screwed in place between the bridge and aft pickup. Those felt mutes were not a tremendous success, and were replaced by a cheaper, more simple foam mute glued underneath the bridge cover as was used by the Precision Bass from 1963 onwards. Over the following years as the use of mutes gradually declined both the Precision and Jazz Bass models eventually began to be produced without bridge/tailpiece covers. A number of cosmetic changes were made to the instrument when CBS purchased the Fender companies in 1965. During 1965/66 the Jazz Bass received bound rosewood fingerboards with pearloid dot position inlays (which replaced the older \\"clay\\"-style of the early 1960s) and oval-shaped tuning machines. Block-shaped fingerboard inlays and an optional maple fingerboard were introduced after 1966/67. At first necks with rosewood fretboards received pearloid blocks/binding and maple fretboard necks received black. Fender switched to pearloid blocks/binding on all necks in mid-to-late 1973. Fender also switched to the three-bolt neck \\"micro-tilt adjustable\\" neck and the \\"bullet\\" truss rod in mid-to-late 1974 before reverting to the more standard four-bolt neck fixing and dot-shaped fretboard markers in 1983. White pickup covers and a pickguard/control plate were introduced the same year. In 1986 Fender introduced the Japanese-made Fender Performer Bass, also with micro-tilt neck, designed by John Page and intended to be an Elite version of the Jazz Bass; however, the radical styling was not popular and production ceased the same year. Two other changes that were more important to the tone of the instrument also occurred in the early 1970's. From 1960 until late 1970, the two pickups on the Jazz Bass were spaced 3.6\\" apart. The bridge pickup was then moved .4\\" closer to the bridge, creating a spacing of 4\\". According to Fender itself, this change happened in 1972. https://www.fender.com/articles/gear/jaco-geddy- and-flea-cant-be-wrong-the-story-of-the-jazz- bass?clickref=1101l9tLofia&aff;_id=305950. However, Fender's own history is clearly incorrect as there are unquestionably examples of Jazz basses made in late 1970 that use the 4\\" pickup spacing.https://bassguitarshack.com/jazz- bass-timeline-1960-1982/ This photograph of a well-document 1970 Jazz Bass clearly depicts the 4\\" pickup spacing. https://www.creamcitymusic.com/vintage-1970-fender-jazz-bass-sunburst-finish/ Both 3.6\\" and 4' spacing are found in Jazz basses made in 1971, and there are even a few Jazz basses made in 1972 that use the older 3.6\\" spacing. Many players believe that this change contributed to a somewhat brighter tone from the bridge pickup. Around the same time, Fender began using ash for most of the instrument bodies. Prior to the early 70's, most Jazz basses had bodies made of alder, except for those that were finished in a clear or(\\"natural\\") finish - for those basses ash was nearly always the wood of choice. In the early 70's ash bodies became increasingly common and by 1974 ash bodies were the rule, rather than the exception. Ash is generally thought produce a somewhat brighter (and correspondingly less warm) tone than alder. By the mid-1970's the combination of 4\\" pickup spacing and the use of heavier ash bodies with maple fingerboards combined to produce a notably brighter tone than that produced by Jazz basses from the 60's. American Standard Jazz Basses produced between 1989 and 1994 featured a larger body shape, a 'curved' neck plate set into a chambered pocket for greater sustain and a 22-fret neck, similar to that of a Precision Bass Plus, with a standard vintage-style top- load bridge, two separate volumes and a master TBX tone circuit. Usually known as \\"Boner\\" Jazz Basses, these early American Standard models (designed by George Blanda, who was Fender's senior R&D; engineer during that period) were discontinued in 1994 and shouldn't be confused with the Fender Jazz Bass Plus, which has the same 22-fret neck design, but utilizes a different (downsized) body styling, Lace Sensor pickups, Schaller \\"Elite\\" fine-tuner bridge on the four-string model or Gotoh Hardware high-mass bridge on the 5-string model, and Phil Kubicki-designed active electronics. Unlike the Fender Precision Bass Plus, which had an optional maple neck, the Boner Jazz Bass was offered only with a rosewood fingerboard. The Jazz Plus Bass was available with an alder body and the option of a natural-finish ash body on the four-string model for a $100 upcharge, either a maple or rosewood fretboard on the four-string and pau ferro (an exotic hardwood whose tone is brighter than rosewood yet warmer than ebony) on the five-string. The Jazz Plus debuted in 1989 (the five-string model was released in 1990), discontinued in 1994 and replaced by the USA Deluxe Series Jazz Bass the following year. Jaco Pastorius playing his 1960 Jazz Bass, on November 27, 1977 A fourth push button control is available on American-made Jazz Basses produced between mid-2003 until 2008. Known as the \\"S-1 Switch\\", this feature allows the pickups to operate in standard, parallel wiring, or alternatively in series wiring when the switch is depressed. While in series, both pickups function as a single unit with one volume control, giving the Jazz Bass a sound more similar to the Precision Bass. The two pickups are built to be opposite from each other in both magnetic polarity and electrical phase, so that when heard together, hum is cancelled—the humbucking effect. The Highway One Jazz Bass is a moderately priced American-made bass introduced in 2003, featuring a Leo Quan BadAss II bridge with grooved saddles, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, 1970s styling and a Greasebucket tone circuit since 2006. In 2008, the American Series models were replaced by a new American Standard line, which greatly differs from the first-generation American Standard Series basses introduced in 1994. The 2008 American Standard Jazz Bass retained the \\"American Series\\" rolled-edge neck with highly detailed nut and fret work, as well as the familiar rounded body shape with the vintage body radius, but deleted the S-1 switching system and incorporated a new high- mass vintage bridge, Hipshot lightweight vintage-style tuning machines, a richer and deeper neck tint, gloss maple or rosewood fingerboard and satin back for smooth playability. It also has a thinner finish undercoat that lets the body breathe and improves resonance. In March 2012 Fender updated the American Standard Jazz Bass (except the five-string version) with Custom Shop 1960s Jazz Bass pickups. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Jazz Bass, first introduced in 1960, Fender released in 2010 the 50th Anniversary Limited Edition Jazz Bass. This bass sports a selected alder body finished in a Candy Apple Red nitrocellulose lacquer and incorporates design elements from several periods in the instrument's history, including 1960s-era lacquer finish, headstock logo, chrome bridge and pickup covers, 1970s-era thumb rest and bridge pickup positioning, modern-era high-mass bridge and Posiflex graphite neck support rods. Design features A typical Fender Jazz Bass headstock. The Jazz Bass has a bright sound, with more high end than the Precision Bass. This makes it ideal for slap playing as well as finger-style players. This bright sound is because of the two pickups at different points in the string's length. The bridge pickup gives a tone with more treble, while the neck pickup will yield a rounder sound. The ability to blend the volume of both pickups allows for a wider variety of tones than the Precision Bass can produce. Pickups are RWRP (reverse wound, reverse polarity) from one another, so all hum will be canceled when both pickups are at full volume. Having both pickups cranked up at full volume produces the classic scooped, \\"growling\\" sound which many players—such as Marcus Miller and Will Lee—use for slap bass playing. This sound is the product of certain frequencies from both pickups being out of phase and cancelling each other, leaving a \\"scoop\\" on the midrange. This is similar to what happens on some guitars when one blends the sounds from two different pickups, such as the Fender Stratocaster. Some \\"Deluxe\\" Jazz Bass models feature an active pre-amp (usually with three bands of equalization) in place of a single passive tone control; these basses have three separate equalizer controls: bass and treble responses are controlled by the base and top of a stacked double pot, while midrange is controlled by a second knob. They came with 22 frets, abalone dot position inlays and an 18-volt power supply on some models. Known as Jazz Bass Deluxe since introduced as part of a major reworking of Fender's Electric Bass lineup in 1995, they have been renamed the American Deluxe Jazz Bass to the public as of August 2000 in a Bass Player magazine review of the new \\"Fender American Deluxe Precision V\\" five-string counterpart model to the American Deluxe Jazz Bass. The American Deluxe Jazz Bass (available in four-string fretted and fretless, five-string fretted and left-hand versions) featured two Samarium Cobalt Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, designed by pickup designer Bill Lawrence. Fender used downsized bodies to accommodate the 22-fret neck and reshaped the pickguard with nine screw holes. American Deluxes produced between 1995 and 1999 were initially available with \\"single-pole\\" pickups designed by John Suhr. These were soon changed to the Bill Turner-designed dual-coil Ceramic Noiseless units with nickel-plated (gold-plated on certain models) polepieces until the advent of the Bill Lawrence-designed Samarium Cobalt series in 2004. Other refinements include a strings-through-body/top-load bridge, Posiflex graphite neck support rods, rolled fingerboard edges, highly detailed nut and fret work. Five-string versions are presented with a 4+1 tuner arrangement and two Hipshot string trees since 2002. The asymmetrical five-bolt neck plate, along with the smooth contoured heel allow much easier access to the upper registers. Bound fingerboards with pearloid block inlays were added with the introduction of the American Deluxe Jazz Bass FMT & QMT in late 2001, featuring flamed or quilted maple tops and gold-plated hardware. Fender discontinued these models in 2007. In 2010 the American Deluxe Jazz Bass has been updated with a pair of N3 stacked-coil Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, an active/passive toggle switch, CBS styling and a 21-fret bound compound radius maple neck featuring rosewood or maple fingerboards with rectangular block inlays. Other features include Hipshot vintage lightweight tuners, \\"Strong Arm\\" string retainer bar for the A and low B strings, and Fender's High Mass Vintage (HMV) bridge. The American Deluxe series was discontinued in 2016. The American Elite Jazz Bass, introduced in 2016, sports a compound modern C-to-D neck shape, fourth- generation noiseless pickups, a \\"spoke-wheel\\" truss rod system for easier neck relief adjustments and a new asymmetrical neck heel. It is offered with a compound radius ebony (since 2017) or maple fingerboard, in 4 and 5-string versions. The Mexican Deluxe Active Jazz Bass combines many of the features of the American Deluxe models with a traditional Standard Jazz Bass body, vintage-style hardware, a contoured neck heel and a 12\\"-radius 20-fret rosewood or maple fingerboard. It comes in 4 and 5-string versions and sports a three-band active circuit powered by two dual-coil ceramic Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups and an 18V power supply with an active/passive switch (as of 2016). The Custom Classic model was made at the Fender Custom Shop. This Custom Shop Jazz Bass was a cross between the American Vintage and the American Deluxe series. Features include an oversized select alder or premium ash body, a modern 34\\"-scale C-shape maple neck with an unbound rosewood, pau ferro or maple fingerboard featuring triangular pearloid block inlays and 21 medium-jumbo frets. Available in four- and five-string versions, all Custom Classic Jazz Basses came with a pair of custom-wound dual-coil Noiseless Jazz Bass pickups, a three-band active preamp, five-bolt neck plate, 18V power supply and a Deluxe string-through-body/top-load bridge with milled nickel- plated brass saddles. Models manufactured prior to 2003 (formerly known as American Classics) were identical to the mid-1990s American Deluxe basses in appearance, excepting the 22-fret bound maple neck featuring a rosewood fretboard and white block inlays. Fender discontinued the five-string version in 2009. The Custom Classic four-string Jazz Bass has been renamed Custom Active Jazz Bass as of 2010, featuring Fender's high-mass vintage (HMV) bridge and a 1960s Jazz Bass \\"U\\" shape neck. The Standard Jazz Bass model is sanded, painted and assembled in Ensenada, Baja California along with the other Standard Series guitars (replaced by the Player models in 2018). In December 5, 2008, the Standard J-Bass has given CBS era-style decals, a three-ply parchment pickguard and a tinted maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard (also available in a fretless version with a rosewood fingerboard and 20 inlaid white fretline markers). Other features included two staggered bi-pole single-coil pickups and a return to the black bakelite control knobs. Models produced before 2003 came for a period with black Stratocaster control knobs. The five-string version (introduced in 1992), available with pao ferro or rosewood fingerboard and a five-in-line tuner configuration with Gotoh Mini machineheads (c. 2006), has been updated with a tinted maple neck featuring a dark rosewood fingerboard and a 4+1 tuner configuration with Fender/Ping tuning machines as of 2009. In 2017 Fender switched to pao ferro fingerboards before discontinuing the Standard series in 2018. All five-string Jazz basses came with pau ferro fretboard since 1990 (some US Deluxe models were also available with a plain maple neck option). Fender offers its 5-string basses with rosewood or maple fretboard as of 2006 after discontinuing the pau ferro fingerboard option in late 2005. In 2008, Fender introduced the fretted and fretless Steve Bailey signature models, its first six-string Jazz Basses to feature a 9.5\\" to 14\\" compound-radius ebony fingerboard.

The Jazz Bass 24 featured a sleek alder body, a 34\\"-scale length, modern \\"C\\" shaped maple neck with a two-octave rosewood fingerboard, abalone dot inlays, 24 medium-jumbo frets, Hipshot-licensed tuners, Fender/Gotoh High Mass top-loading bridge, two custom-wound Seymour Duncan SJB-3 Quarter Pound pickups, a passive/active push/pull volume knob and a 3-band active EQ with a \\"slap\\" mid-scoop switch. It was available in the Fender price list as part of the Deluxe Series line, with Cherry Sunburst (discontinued as of 2007) and Tobacco Sunburst finishes over a quilted maple top and chrome-plated hardware. The 5-string version was introduced in 2007. In 2008, Fender offered both the four- and five-string versions of the 24-fret Jazz Bass in a stealthy Flat Black finish (with matching headstocks and hardware). These two-octave Jazz Basses were gone from the Fender pricelist as of 2009. Fender Jazz Bass 24 were made in Korea. Fender Jaguar Bass In 2005, Fender introduced the Fender Jaguar Bass, as of 2008 available in Hot Rod Red, Olympic White, Sunburst and Black finishes, with a three-ply white or tortoise pickguard. This is a variation on the traditional Jazz Bass design—differences being that it has only one master volume and tone, but additional on/off switches for pickup selection, series/parallel switching, and a two-band active preamp with bypass switch. The Jaguar bass retains the slim Jazz neck, bi-pole pickups, Jazzmaster/Jaguar body design and the trademark Jazz Bass growl. As of 2008, the Jaguar Bass comes in Olympic White and three-colour Sunburst finishes, together with a four-ply brown tortoise shell pickguard. These colours were previously available only for the Japanese domestic market. In 2012, Fender also introduced the Reverse Jaguar Bass in its line of Pawn Shop Series guitars. This special issue features a reversed body stock orientation, and also reverses the humbucking pickups for a unique tone. Fender also offers several models of the Jaguar Bass in the Squier line (and an American Standard version since 2014), most with a Precision/Jazz \\"P-J\\" pickup configuration.

It is the most active volcano in Indonesia and has erupted regularly since 1548. It is located approximately north of Yogyakarta city which has a population of 2.4 million, and thousands of people live on the flanks of the volcano, with villages as high as above sea level. Smoke can often be seen emerging from the mountaintop, and several eruptions have caused fatalities. Pyroclastic flow from a large explosion killed 27 people on 22 November 1994, mostly in the town of Muntilan, west of the volcano. Kompas (Yogyakarta) President Soeharto Really Concern. Saturday, 26 November 1994. Another large eruption occurred in 2006, shortly before the Yogyakarta earthquake. In light of the hazards that Merapi poses to populated areas, it has been designated as one of the Decade Volcanoes. On 20 October 2010, the Indonesian government raised the alert for Mount Merapi to its highest level and warned villagers in threatened areas to move to safer ground. People living within the range of a zone were told to evacuate. Officials said about 500 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 23–24 October, and that the magma had risen to about below the surface due to the seismic activity. On the afternoon of 25 October 2010, Mount Merapi erupted lava from its southern and southeastern slopes. The mountain was still erupting on 30 November 2010, but due to lowered eruptive activity on 3 December 2010, the official alert status was reduced to level 3. The volcano is now 2930 metres high, 38 metres lower than before the 2010 eruptions. After a large eruption in 2010, the characteristic shape of Mount Merapi was changed. On 18 November 2013, Mount Merapi erupted smoke up to 2,000 meters high, one of its first major phreatic eruptions after the 2010 eruption. Researchers said that this eruption occurred due to the combined effect of hot volcanic gases and abundant rainfall. The most recent eruptions so far were on 3 March 2020 and 27 March 2020.  Etymology  The name Merapi could be loosely translated as the Mountain of Fire. The etymology of the name came from Meru-Api; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and Javanese combined words; Meru means \\"mountain\\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and api means \\"fire\\".  History  = Geological history = Mount Merapi viewed from 9th-century Prambanan Hindu temple, built during Mataram Kingdom era Merapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern Java. It is situated at a subduction zone, where the Indo-Australian Plate is subducting under the Sunda Plate. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire–a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia. Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing lava emitted was basaltic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous andesitic lavas often generating lava domes. Dome collapse has often generated pyroclastic flows, and larger explosions, which have resulted in eruption columns, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse. Typically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10–15 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows. Merapi in 1930 The very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with ash. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the Hindu Kingdom of Mataram; however, the evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated. = 2006 eruption = In April 2006, increased seismicity at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation. On 19 April smoke from the crater reached a height of , compared to the previous day. On 23 April, after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma, some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated. By early May, active lava flows had begun. On 11 May, with lava flow beginning to be constant, some 17,000 people were ordered to be evacuated from the area and on 13 May, Indonesian authorities raised the alert status to the highest level, ordering the immediate evacuation of all residents on the mountain. Many villagers defied the dangers posed by the volcano and returned to their villages, fearing that their livestock and crops would be vulnerable to theft. Activity calmed by the middle of May. On 27 May, a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck roughly southwest of Merapi, killing at least 5,000 and leaving at least 200,000 people homeless in the Yogyakarta region, heightening fears that Merapi would \\"blow\\".Earthquake Leaves Thousands Dead in Indonesia, NY Times, 27 May 2006 URL Accessed 27 May 2006 The quake did not appear to be a long-period oscillation, a seismic disturbance class that is increasingly associated with major volcanic eruptions. A further 11,000 villagers were evacuated on 6 June as lava and superheated clouds of gas poured repeatedly down its upper slopes towards Kaliadem, a location that was located southeast of Mt. Merapi.., BreakingNews.ie, 6 June 2006 URL Accessed 6 June 2006 The pyroclastic flows are known locally as \\"wedhus gembel\\" (Javanese for \\"shaggy goat\\"). There were two fatalities as the result of the eruption. = 2010 eruption = Destroyed house in Cangkringan Village after the eruptions In late October 2010 the Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, Geological Agency (CVGHM), (Indonesian language—Pusat Vulkanologi & Mitigasi Bencana Geologi, Badan Geologi-PVMBG), reported that a pattern of increasing seismicity from Merapi had begun to emerge in early September. Observers at Babadan west and Kaliurang south of the mountain reported hearing an avalanche on 12 September 2010. On 13 September 2010 white plumes were observed rising above the crater. Lava dome inflation, detected since March, increased from background levels of to per day to a rate of per day on 16 September. On 19 September 2010 earthquakes continued to be numerous, and the next day CVGHM raised the Alert Level to 2 (on a scale of 1–4).'Global Volcanism Program, SI/USGS Weekly Volcanic Activity Reports Merapi, 22–28 September 2010, accessed 26 October 2010 Lava from Mount Merapi in Central Java began flowing down the Gendol River on 23–24 October signalling the likelihood of an imminent eruption. On 25 October 2010, the Indonesian government raised the alert for Mount Merapi to its highest level (4) and warned villagers in threatened areas to move to safer ground. People living within a zone were told to evacuate. The evacuation orders affected at least 19,000 people; however, the number that complied at the time remained unclear to authorities. Officials said about 500 volcanic earthquakes had been recorded on the mountain over the weekend of 23–24 October, and that the magma had risen to about below the surface due to the seismic activity After a period of multiple eruptions considered to exceed the intensity and duration of those in 1872 on 10 November 2010 the intensity and frequency of eruptions was noticed to subside. By this time 153 people had been reported to have been killed and 320,000 were displaced. Later the eruptive activities again increased requiring a continuation of the Level 4 alert and continued provision of exclusion zones around the volcano. By 18 November the death toll had increased to 275. The toll had risen to 324 by 24 November and Syamsul Maarif, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) explained that the death toll had risen after a number of victims succumbed to severe burns and more bodies were found on the volcano's slopes. In the aftermath of the more intensive eruptive activities in late November, Yogyakarta's Disaster Management Agency reported that there were about 500 reported cases of eruption survivors in Sleman district suffering from minor to severe psychological problems, and about 300 cases in Magelang. By 3 December the death toll had risen to 353. On Friday, 3 December 2010, the head of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), Dr. Syamsul Maarif, M. Si, accompanied by the head of the Centre for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation CVGHM (PVMBG), Dr. Surono made a joint press release at the BNPB Command Post in Yogyakarta. As of 3 December 2010, at 09.00 am, the CVGHM (PVMBG) lowered the status of Mount Merapi to the level of Caution Alert (Level III). They clarified that with this alert level the potential of hot ash clouds and projected incandescent material remained. The Geological Agency provided several recommendations including that there would be no community activities in the disaster prone areas and proclaimed an ongoing exclusion zone of radius. = 2018 eruption = A phreatic eruption began on the morning of 11 May 2018, prompting the evacuation of areas within a radius of the volcano. Adisutjipto International Airport in Yogyakarta was closed due to the eruption's ash plume.  Monitoring  This image shows some of the instruments deployed by the Deep Carbon Degassing Project in the vicinity of Mount Merapi in 2014. Mount Merapi is the site of a very active volcano monitoring program. Seismic monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between Merbabu and Merapi), and Plawangan monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into Kaliurang as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project. The eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 seismographs currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the hypocentres of tremors and quakes. A zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5 km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the magma reservoir which feeds the eruptions. Other measurements taken on the volcano include magnetic measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up. Lahars (a type of mudflow of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by rain remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-frequency seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50 mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.  Sabo Dam  There are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged. The cost for recovery is about Rp.1 trillion ($116 million).  Sterile zone  Following the 2010 eruption, three Indonesian government departments declared a prohibited zone which nobody can permanently stay and no infrastructure is allowed in 9 villages (dusun): Palemsari, Pangukrejo, Kaliadem, Jambu, Kopeng, Petung, Kalitengah Lor, Kalitengah Kidul and Srunen, all in Cangkringan district.  National park  In 2004, an area of 6,410 hectares around Mount Merapi was established as a national park. The decision of the Ministry of Forestry to declare the park has been subsequently challenged in court by The Indonesian Forum for Environment, on grounds of lack of consultation with local residents.P.C. Naommy:Walhi sues Cabinet minister over Merapi National Park in The Jakarta Post 7 October 2004. Retrieved 28 October 2010. During the 2006 eruption of the volcano it was reported that many residents were reluctant to leave because they feared their residences would be confiscated for expansion of the national park, meaning they wouldn't have a house.Slamet Susanto:Many still reluctant to leave Merapi in The Jakarta Post 5 April 2006.

The constant smoke from its summit is said to come from two sacred armourers living under the mountain. Merapi is very important to Javanese, especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi. = Creation = Although most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities. It is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, Java was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by Batara Guru) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred keris at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \\"fire of Rama and Permadi.\\" = Spirit Kraton of Merapi = The Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (makhluk halus). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in Javanese kraton) used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the Yogyakarta Sultanate, complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals. Besides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of ancestors who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (abdi dalem), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give prophecies or warnings. \\" = Spirits of Merapi = To keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of Yogyakarta's coronation. For Yogyakarta Sultanate, Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north-south axis line between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean (Indian Ocean). The sacred axis is signified by Merapi peak in the north, the Tugu Yogyakarta monument near Yogyakarta main train station, the axis runs along Malioboro street to Northern Alun-alun (square) across Keraton Yogyakarta (sultan palace), Southern Alun-alun, all the way to Bantul and finally reach Samas and Parangkusumo beach on the estuary of Opak river and Southern Ocean. This sacred axis connected the hyangs or spirits of mountain revered since ancient times—often identified as \\"Mbah Petruk\\" by Javanese people—The Sultan of Yogyakarta as the leader of the Javanese kingdom, and Nyi Roro Kidul as the queen of the Southern Ocean, the female ocean deity revered by Javanese people and also mythical consort of Javanese kings.Triyoga, Lucas Sasongko (1991) Manusia Jawa dan gunung merapi : persepsi dan kepercayaannya Yogyakarta : Gadjah Mada University Press. , see also Khairuddin, H.

Players began using the double bass in jazz in the 1890s to supply the low- pitched walking basslines that outlined the chord progressions of the songs. From the 1920s and 1930s Swing and big band era, through 1940s Bebop and 1950s Hard Bop, to the 1960s-era \\"free jazz\\" movement, the resonant, woody sound of the double bass anchored everything from small jazz combos to large jazz big bands. Beginning in the early 1950s,http://www.musicradar.com/news/bass/the- history-of-the-electric-bass-part-1-early-days-507234 some jazz bass players began to use the electric bass guitar in place of the double bass. The electric bass, which was easier to amplify to loud volumes onstage, gained particular prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s jazz subgenre which blended jazz with the powerfully amplified electric instruments of rock music, creating jazz fusion. Most jazz bassists specialize in either the double bass or the electric bass, although the ability to \\"double\\" (play both instruments) is common. A small number of players, such as Stanley Clarke and John Patitucci, have achieved virtuoso skill on both instruments. Whether a jazz bassist is \\"comping\\" (accompanying) with a walking bassline or soloing, or playing on a double bass or an electric bass, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and \\"timefeel\\" that creates a sense of swing and groove.  Double bass  Beginning around 1890, the African-American communities in early New Orleans used a jazz ensemble which played a mixture of marches, ragtime, and dixieland music. This ensemble was initially a marching band with sousaphone (or occasionally bass saxophone) supplying the bass line. As the music moved from playing for funerals on the street and into bars and brothels, the double bass gradually replaced these wind instruments. Many early bassists doubled on both the \\"brass bass\\" and \\"string bass,\\" as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played \\"walking\\" basslines—scale-based lines that outlined the harmony and provided a foundation for the tunes. Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style, slapping and pulling the strings to make a rhythmic \\"slap\\" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and make the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not capture low frequencies well.Historic Jazz Fotos For more about the slap style, see \\"Playing styles,\\" below. Double bass players who have contributed to the evolution of jazz include the Swing era player Jimmy Blanton, who played with Duke Ellington, and Oscar Pettiford, who pioneered the instrument's soloistic use in Bebop. The \\"cool\\" style of jazz was influenced by players such as Scott LaFaro and Percy Heath, whose solos were very melodic. Free jazz was influenced by the composer/bassist Charles Mingus (who also contributed to hard bop) and Charlie Haden, best known for his work with Ornette Coleman. In the 1950s, some big band bandleaders began to ask their upright players to use the then-newly available Fender bass, the first widely available electric bass. In the 1970s, as jazz and rock music were blended by performers to create the \\"fusion\\" genre, players such as Jaco Pastorius began to develop a unique sound using the electric bass. Apart from jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz, the double bass is still widely used in jazz in the 2010s. The deep sound and woody tone of the plucked double bass is distinct from the sound of the fretted bass guitar. The bass guitar produces a different sound than the double bass, because its strings are usually stopped with the aid of metal frets. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that the sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings. The solid body upright, also known as a \\"stick\\" bass or \\"EUB\\" variation is still widely used by bass players in salsa and timba bands, because its sound is so well suited to those styles. The EUB is smaller and lighter than a double bass, making touring and travelling easier, and its solid (or mostly solid) body enables bassists to play at a much higher volume with a bass amp without feedback. = Playing techniques = In jazz, since the 1950s, the double bass is usually played with amplification and it is mostly played with the fingers, pizzicato style, except during some solos, where players may use the bow. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes. An example of pizzicato jazz bass technique. Using amplification gives the player more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that can accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise). While jazz double bass players use amplification, they typically use much smaller, lower-powered bass amplifiers and smaller speaker cabinets than those used by an electric bass player playing in a jazz fusion show. An upright player performing at a small club may only bring a 1x12\\" combo amp to the gig. When a small jazz combo is playing in a small jazz club, the double bass player may use only a modest amount of amplification, so that the audience is hearing a mixture of the natural acoustic tone and the amplified sound; if that same band were to play on a huge jazz festival mainstage, all of the bass tone reaching the audience's ears will be from the sound reinforcement system. An unamplified acoustic bass' tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which evens out the frequency response. As well, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with long held notes. Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification, such as the jazz violin, a double bass is often plugged into a preamplifier, impedance-matching device, and/or a Direct Injection (DI box) box before it is routed to the PA system, electronic effects, or the bass instrument amplifier. In traditional jazz and swing it is sometimes played in the slap style. This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are \\"slapped\\" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a snare drum-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolate two, or even three more slaps in between notes of their bass line. = Variants = A five-string Electric Upright Bass (\\"EUB\\") In both jazz and jazz fusion bands, some jazz bassists use a modified type of double bass called the electric upright bass (abbreviated EUB and sometimes also called stick bass). The stick bass is also widely used in salsa, because its volume and tone are especially suited to that style of music, even in studio recording. It is an electronically amplified version of the double bass that has a minimal or 'skeleton' body, which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument. The EUB retains enough of the features of the double bass so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it. While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass, its electrically amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound. As well, an EUB is considerably easier to transport than its acoustic equivalent. The scale length of EUBs varies: some scales are 42\\", similar to most double basses, whilst other models have scale lengths of only 30\\" like a short scale bass guitar. The shorter scale can make it easier for bass guitarists to convert to the EUB. Solid bodied EUBs produce very little sound without electronic amplification. Hollow-bodied EUBs produce a quiet tone that is loud enough for individual practice. However, since hollow-bodied EUBs do not have a large resonant cavity like a double bass, they cannot reproduce the lowest notes of the instrument without an amplifier. To amplify the EUB, the string vibrations are sensed with a pickup. Early EUBs used magnetic pickups similar to those in electric guitars, or percussive magnetic diaghram pickups (e.g., the Ampeg \\"Baby Bass\\"). Many modern EUBs use piezoelectric pickups located in the bridge or a combination of pickup types. The signal from the pickup is usually preamplified and equalized with a preamplifier and then sent to a bass amplifier or a PA system. For silent practice in a hotel room or apartment, an EUB can also be connected to headphones. Preamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses can also be used to \\"roll off\\" the treble frequencies or \\"notch out\\" the \\"scratchy-sounding\\" frequencies. Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to audio feedback than the double bass when amplified. To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard must be radiussed (given a curve). EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs, or fly with on tours than a large, fragile double bass.  Electric bass  Jaco Pastorius, performing with Weather Report in Convocation Hall, Toronto, Canada November 27, 1977 The electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of jazz. Until the 1950s, the double bass was used to anchor jazz ensembles from small combos to huge big bands. The electric bass was introduced in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson (and later Monk Montgomery) first used the instrument in Lionel Hampton's big band. When the electric bass is used in jazz, it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role. When the bass is used to accompany, it may be used to perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and jazz standards, in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass. The electric bass player can play all of the same types of bass lines played by her upright bass cousin. However, due to the design of the electric bass as a guitar-family instrument, it is possible to play rapid bass lines that would be impossible on an upright bass. For example, an electric bassist in a fusion or Latin band can play a bassline composed entirely of rapid, syncopated sixteenth notes. For Latin or salsa tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play challenging, fast- moving rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove. In a fusion band, electric bass players have to provide a solid, heavy bass foundation for the band while a drummer, electric guitarist (amplified through a guitar amp) and synthesizer or electric piano player performing (amplified through a keyboard amp) are all playing. As well, fusion bands are more likely to play a rock-size venue, such as a large club or theatre, than a small jazz club. To provide a good bass sound, a fusion electric bass player will often use a powerful bass amplifier and a larger speaker cabinet than an upright player would use, such as a 4X10\\" cabinet, or even two 4X10\\" cabinets. In a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have much a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called \\"blowing\\" in jazz parlance. Among those who have spearheaded the bass guitar in jazz are Jaco Pastorius, Victor Wooten, and Marcus Miller. = Fretted and fretless bass guitars = Warwick Thumb bass guitar at the Jazzfestival Frankfurt, Germany 28 October 2006 One of the options for bass guitarists is whether to use an instrument with frets on the fingerboard or not. On a fretted bass, metal frets divide the fingerboard into semitone divisions (as on a guitar). The original Fender basses had 20 frets, but modern basses may have 24 or more. Fretless basses have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the double bass. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger. The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of glissando, vibrato and microtonal intonations such as quarter tones and just intonation. In a small combo, the bass player may alone determine which type of bass to use and for which tunes. In a band with a bandleader, the leader may provide guidance on what tunes are best suited to each type of bass. Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material they are performing. While fretless basses are often associated with jazz and jazz fusion, bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist Steve DiGiorgio. Fretless bass guitars are often used by jazz fusion bass guitar players; this fretless bass has flatwound strings; note the markers inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch. Bill Wyman takes credit for creating the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass guitar by removing the frets.Roberts, Jim (2001). 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' or Jon Sievert interview with Bill Wyman., guitar player magazine December (1978)This fretless bass can be heard on The Rolling Stones songs such as \\"Paint it Black\\". The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius created his own fretless bass guitar by removing the fretsIn interviews, Pastorius gave various versions of how he accomplished this; the versions mention the use of pliers, a putty knife, and, in at least one interview (Guitar Player magazine, 1984) he states that he bought the instrument with the frets already removed, badly, with the slots where the frets once were not yet filled in. from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with wood putty, and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin. Pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have \\"fret line\\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards to increase durability, enhance sustain, and give a brighter tone. Though most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as \\"boutique\\" or custom-made instruments.  Alternative instruments  Bassist- composer Esperanza Spalding performing on December 10, 2009 at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert. While the majority of jazz and jazz fusion recordings and live performances use either the double bass (or a related instrument such as an electric upright bass) or the electric bass to supply the \\"low end\\", there are some exceptions. In jazz organ trios, a Hammond organ player performs the basslines using the bass pedalboard or their lower manual, along with a drummer and a saxophonist. In some jazz fusion groups, the basslines may be played by a keyboard player on a bass synthesizer or other keyboard. As well, in some duos and other small groups, the basslines may be provided by a piano player; in a duo consisting of a jazz pianist and a jazz singer, the piano player plays a bassline with the left hand and chords in the right hand underneath the singer's voice. Similarly, in some duos or trios, a jazz guitarist may play basslines, a role that is especially feasible if the guitarist has a seven-string guitar with a low \\"B\\" string. In traditional Dixieland or New Orleans-style jazz groups, the basslines may be played by a tuba or other low brass instrument.

Speculative reason is contemplative, detached, and certain, whereas practical reason is engaged, involved, active, and dependent upon the specifics of the situation. Speculative reason provides the universal, necessary principles of logic, such as the principle of non-contradiction, which must apply everywhere, regardless of the specifics of the situation. On the other hand, practical reason is the power of the mind engaged in deciding what to do. It is also referred to as moral reason, because it involves action, decision, and particulars.

At , it is the second tallest building in Africa after The Leonardo and the tallest office building. The foundations of the two buildings in the complex are in diameter and extend down to the bedrock, below street level. The building houses both offices and shops, and has over 46 per cent of the floor area below ground level. The Carlton Centre is linked to the Carlton Hotel by a below-ground shopping centre with over 180 shops. History =Design and Construction= The Carlton Centre was designed by the US architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Anglo American Properties began construction in the late 1960s by demolishing the old Carlton Hotel and the closing roads to form a city superblock. Excavations for the Carlton began in January 1967, and took two years to complete. Although occupation of the Centre began in 1971, construction was not finally completed until 1974. The building officially opened in 1973 at a total cost of over R88 million. The design of the tower is very similar to that of One Seneca Tower in Buffalo, New York, completed in 1973. =Utilisation= The building is the head office of transport parastatal Transnet, who purchased it in 1999 from Anglo American Properties (Amprop). In June 2007, then Transnet group chief executive Maria Ramos revealed the company's intention to offer the building for sale. The Carlton Centre has served as Transnet's headquarters since 2000, after the parastatal purchased it for R33 million from Anglo American Properties. The disposal of the property forms part of Transnet's restructuring program which includes the disposal of non-core assets. Due to the economic downturn that began in 2008, the parastatal announced it would not seek a buyer until markets recovered. Although Transnet has given no indication of the price, the replacement cost of the building has been estimated at R1.5 billion. The centre, after being almost empty, has 93 percent occupancy of its office space and retail occupancy of 65 percent. Pick 'n Pay plans to take 3 000 square metres in the centre and the South African Revenue Service has moved from Rissik Street to its premises of 5 000 square metres in the centre. While there have been proposals to reinstate the Carlton Hotel at some stage, no official announcements to this end have been made. Other information The 50th and topmost floor of the Carlton Centre was called the Carlton Panorama and is known colloquially as the \\"Top of Africa\\". Once the tallest building in the Southern Hemisphere, the Carlton Centre opened with the 5-star and 30-story Carlton Hotel taking up most of the floor space of the complex. The hotel was popular among the rich and famous, hosting many famous guests over the years. Urban decay in the inner city during the 1990s affected the hotel, which ceased operations in 1998 after nearly 25 years of operation.

It is located south of Greymouth, close to the western end of , which leads across Arthur's Pass to Christchurch. The Taramakau River flows past to the north. The population was 309 in the 2013 census, a decrease of 6 from 2006. The name may come from the Māori language Kohe mara, which is the blossom of the tātarāmoa, or bush lawyer. The Coast to Coast annual multisport race starts at Kumara Beach. History Kumara was founded and became one of the country's chief gold mining centres following the discovery of gold at Dillmanstown, about to the south-east, in 1876. The tramline from Greymouth to Paroa was extended to Kumara the following year. The population was 4,220 in October 1877. The town became a borough in 1877.Dollimore, Edward Stewart. - \\"Kumara, Westland\\". - Encyclopedia of New Zealand (1966). Kumara Hospital was operating by 1881 and continued into the twentieth century. In 1882, the Kumara volunteer fire brigade was formed.Rogers, p. 115. Kumara was the home town of prominent politician Richard Seddon, who was elected mayor of the town in 1877,Rogers, pp. 71-72. and served as Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1893 until his death in 1906. In 1925, the manager of Pearns Hotel in Kumara was charged by police after she refused to supply accommodation to two visiting temperance lecturers. The Pearn's Brewery became part of Westland Ales around this time.Rogers, p. 160. Although the town once had 50 pubs, the numbers dwindled. In June 2009, the last remaining pub, the Empire Hotel, had its licence cancelled by the Liquor Licensing Authority. In 2010, the last store of the town faced closure, with only a few hundred inhabitants left, but it was hoped that one of the New Zealand Cycle Trails to run through the town would lift the settlement's fortunes again. In November 2012 the Theatre Royal Hotel reopened as the only pub serving Kumara, and in November 2013 the West Coast Wilderness Trail cycleway running from Greymouth to Ross was officially opened with a ceremony in Kumara.

The book focuses on a futuristic, steampunk version of London, now a giant machine striving to survive on a world running out of resources. Mortal Engines is the first book of a series, Mortal Engines Quartet, published from 2001 to 2006. It has been adapted as a 2018 feature film by Peter Jackson and Hollywood, though its movie universe is different from that of the book. The book won a Nestlé Smarties Book Prize and the 2003 Blue Peter Book Award. It was shortlisted for the 2002 Whitbread Award, the 2004 ALA's Notable Books for Children award and the 2020 Blue Peter Awards 20th anniversary prize. Synopsis =Setting= The book is set in a post-apocalyptic world, ravaged by the \\"Sixty Minute War\\", a conflict that was so violent it caused massive geological upheaval. To escape the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other instabilities, a Nomad leader called Nikola Quercus (known as god Nicholas Quirke by the time of the book) installed huge engines and wheels on London, and enabled it to dismantle (or eat) other cities for resources. The technology rapidly spread, and evolved into what is known as \\"Municipal Darwinism\\". Although the planet has since become stable, Municipal Darwinism has spread to most of the world except for some parts of Asia and Africa. Because scientific progress has almost completely halted and much technological and scientific knowledge was lost during the war, \\"Old Tech\\" is highly prized and recovered by scavengers and archaeologists. Europe, some of Asia, North Africa, Antarctica, and the Arctic are dominated by Traction Cities, whereas North America - often identified as \\"the dead continent\\" due to the extensive destruction it suffered during the war - and the rest of the world is the stronghold of the Anti-Traction League, which seeks to keep cities from moving and thus stop the intense consumption of the planet's remaining resources. London is the principal Traction City in the novel, which has returned to a Victorian-era society. London's society is divided into four major and a number of minor Guilds. The Engineers are responsible for maintaining the machines necessary for the survival of London, many of which are found by the Guild of Historians. The Historians are in charge of collecting and preserving highly prized, often dangerous artifacts. The Navigators are responsible for steering and plotting the course of London. The Merchants are in charge of running London's economy. London is officially ruled by an elected Mayor. The Lord Mayor is Magnus Crome, who is also the head of the Guild of Engineers. Like most Traction Cities, London is built on a series of tiers. This encourages the system of social classes, with the wealthier nobles at the top of the city and the lower classes further down, closer to the noise and pollution of the city's massive engines. Atop the whole of London sits St Paul's Cathedral: the only building known to have survived the Sixty Minute War. =Plot= The book starts with the traction city of London chasing and catching a small mining town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy, a teenage Apprentice Historian, is sent to the \\"Gut\\" of London, where towns are stripped for resources, after he skips a chore. Tom incidentally meets the Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine, along with his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook's residents, teenager Hester Shaw, attempts to assassinate Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a disfiguring scar on her face and claims Valentine caused it, before escaping the London police through a chute. When Tom informs Valentine of her name, Valentine pushes him down into the chute. Tom and Hester recover outside of London within the Hunting Ground, and after an argument start following the city's tracks to reboard it. The pair eventually boards a small town called Speedwell, where the owner Orme Wreyland drugs them and plans to sell the pair as slaves for profit at a trading cluster. Tom and Hester escape from Wreyland, meeting a friendly airship pilot called Anna Fang, who takes them in her airship the Jenny Haniver to the neutral flying city of Airhaven where they can find passage to London. At Airhaven, they are then attacked by a cyborg \\"Stalker\\" called Shrike, who was sent after them by the London Mayor Magnus Crome to kill them and bring their bodies to him. Tom and Hester escape by stealing a hot-air balloon and drift over the Hunting Ground. Hester reveals that when she was a child, her parents were killed by Valentine as they would not give up an Ancient machine. Valentine then injured her and believed that she was dead. Hester escaped, and Shrike took care of her for most of her childhood. Despite the fact that Shrike was not supposed to have feelings, he developed a fatherlike bond with her. Wanting to avenge her parents, Hester left Shrike despite his pleas for her to stay and travelled to London. Shrike followed her, reaching London first, but was captured by Crome and used to create more Stalkers for London. Hester sees that a London-built scoutship is following them and lowers the balloon onto the Hunting Ground. The scoutship, with Shrike on board, finds the pair and the Stalker confronts them. Before he can explain why he wants Hester to die, two chasing towns run over him, and Tom and Hester manage to board the second of these, a pirate town called Tunbridge Wheels. The mayor, Chrysler Peavy, who knows Hester from her days with Shrike, frees Tom as he is a resident of London and Peavy wishes to learn etiquette worthy of a Londoner gentleman. Tom convinces him to free Hester, and Peavy informs them that he plans to consume the downed Airhaven. While charging at it over shallow water, Tunbridge Wheels beaches on a coral reef, sinking it whilst the survivors escape inland with Tom and Hester. Whilst attempting to feebly retake Airhaven, Peavy gets stuck in a bog and his pirate subordinates shoot him, then attempt to execute Tom and Hester, but Shrike intervenes and kills the remaining pirates. Shrike explains to Hester that Crome had agreed to resurrect her as a Stalker similar to him after he brings back her body. She agrees to this, but Tom intervenes by stabbing Shrike in the eye, shutting him down and saving her life. Valentine is sent away by Crome on a \\"secret mission\\", much to Katherine's dismay. Suspicious of her father, Katherine begins investigating events in London with the help of Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod, whom she befriends after discovering he witnessed Tom chasing Hester. They discover that Valentine salvaged a monstrous ancient weapon called MEDUSA for London, and that the Guild of Engineers have reassembled it inside St Paul's Cathedral. The Cathedral's dome splits open to reveal MEDUSA, which is then used to destroy a much larger city pursuing London. Tom and Hester are rescued by Fang, who is revealed to be an Anti-Traction League agent, and takes them to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa which protects the nation-state of the League. Fang suspects that the weapon that London has reassembled will be used to destroy the Shield Wall, and warns League Governor Khan of MEDUSA. Khan is skeptical that London will attack, but Fang insists that they should bomb London to destroy the weapon. Convinced that the League will kill innocent people and angry at the idea of destroying his home, Tom storms out and discovers Valentine has infiltrated Batmunkh Gompa as a monk. Tom raises the alarm, but Valentine successfully cripples the League's northern fleet of airships. Valentine duels and kills Fang by stabbing her in the neck, before escaping in his own airship the 13th Floor Elevator. Tom and Hester take the Jenny Haniver and fly it back to London in the hope of stopping Valentine and MEDUSA themselves. With MEDUSA finally launched, Crome begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League's base behind the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa in order to destroy their defenses and devour all of their settlements. After Valentine returns, Katherine learns that MEDUSA was originally found by Hester's mother Pandora, and that he had killed her to steal it for London. He also admits that Katherine was likely Hester's half sister. Disillusioned, and horrified by the destructive power of the weapon, Katherine and Bevis conspire to plant a bomb to destroy MEDUSA, but are caught in their attempt. The Guild of Historians, led by Tom's boss Chudleigh Pomeroy, come to their aid, and battle with the Engineers. Katherine travels up to the Top Tier to Saint Paul's Cathedral, with Bevis disguised as her captor. Tom and Hester arrive, and Hester attempts to fight her way to Valentine to avenge her parents. Tom is attacked by the 13th Floor Elevator above London and shoots it down. Bevis is killed when the airship crushes him, but Katherine is able to reach Saint Paul's Cathedral. Inside, she sees Hester brought before Valentine. When he attempts to kill her, Katherine jumps in her father's way and is fatally wounded. She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly putting aside their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can reach him. Hester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city and killing Valentine. Hester tries to comfort a grief-stricken Tom as they fly away in the Jenny Haniver, apparently the only survivors of the incident, and make their way to the Bird Roads.

Title The title is a quotation from Act III, Scene iii of William Shakespeare's play Othello (\\"Othello: And O you mortal engines whose rude throats/Th'immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit...\\" – Line 352). In the novel, it refers to the fact that the society of Municipal Darwinism is not sustainable living and that the cities' engines are indeed mortal.  Development  Philip Reeve has stated that his plans to write a science fiction novel were laid in the late 1980s. The original drafts were intended to be an adult novel but after several rejections, Scholastic said they might be interested in Mortal Engines as a children's story. In the refactoring the story was simplified, removing several characters and much content such as the city politics that Reeve thought would not be interesting to children. The Mortal Engines world was originally written as an alternative universe set in the early 1900s, but Reeve says this turned out to require just too much explaining as how and where history could have diverged. He was inspired to start then due to The War of the Worlds. Critical reception On Goodreads, Mortal Engines has a score of 3.92 out of 5. Publishers Weekly praised the book, calling it \\"staggering feat of engineering ... [that] ... offers new wonders at every turn\\". Adaptation A film adaptation by Peter Jackson was announced in 2009. In October 2016, Jackson announced that the film would be his next project as producer and co-writer, alongside long-time collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The film was directed by Jackson's long-time collaborator Christian Rivers. The film premiered on 27 November 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2018, and on 14 December 2018 in the US, received negative reviews and was a commercial failure.

The ethnolect is often overlooked by linguists because the region is predominantly Muslim and because Dari is primarily spoken (rarely written). Dari is also known as Behdināni or pejoratively as Gabri (sometimes Gavrŭni or Gabrōni).. Dari has numerous dialects. there are certain differences compared to new Persian, though it is still a Persian dialect related to Middle Persian..cf. cited in . Genealogy Genealogically, Dari Persian is a member of the Northwestern Iranian language subfamily, which includes several other closely related languages, for instance, Zazaki and Balochi.. These Northwestern Iranian languages are a branch of the larger Western Iranian language group, which is, in turn, a subgroup of the Iranian language family. Name The language known as Zoroastrian Dari is also referred to as 'Behdinâni' (\\"language of the people of good religion\\") or pejorative yet common name, 'Gabri' (\\"language of the infidels\\"). The roots of the name 'Gabri' date back to the Muslim invasion of Iran and is resented by indigenous speakers of Dari to refer to their language. As Farudi and Toosarvandani point out: \\"For them, choosing to call their language Dari, the speakers of the language invoke their ancestral connections to a pre-Islamic Iran.\\" Dialects The main Zoroastrian fire temple in Yazd, Iran. The Dari language has traditionally been divided into two main dialects: the variety spoken in Yazd and the one spoken in Kerman. This division of the language, based on the division of its speakers into their two main cities of residence, conceals the complexity of the actual dialectical situation. The Yazdi dialect itself has some thirty varieties, each distinct and unique to one of the Zoroastrian neighborhoods in and around Yazd. The variation amongst the Yazdi dialects is so great that, were it not for their geographic proximity, they would no doubt be classified as distinct dialects. The Kermani dialect may also contain (or may have contained at one time) a comparable level of dialectical complexity. Endangered status Although Dari has been generally considered quintessential to Zoroastrian identity, but the vitality of it is being affected, or has been affected in the past, by two main types of pressure: economic and political. The pressures affecting the vitality of Dari Persian today are largely economic. In order to obtain an economic advantage, speakers are giving up their traditional language for the dominant language of Iran, standard new Persian. Parents intentionally do not transmit Dari to their children in order that they may have what is felt to be an advantage in school and in life. The language loss can also occur more indirectly and less visible when people move to larger urban centers or abroad in pursuit of better economic opportunities; the lack of a complete language environment in which to immerse a child decreases or completely inhibits the transmission of the language to new generations. In past times, Dari speakers have experienced political pressures to yield up their language as well. The period since the seventh-century Muslim conquest of Persia has been a time of great persecution for the Zoroastrians of Iran. Political pressures have directly resulted in language loss when Zoroastrians have deliberately abandoned their language as a means of hiding their identity so as to escape persecution. Political pressures have also led to language loss indirectly; the oppression the Zoroastrians have been experienced under Iran’s various rulers over the past thousand or so years has driven a steady stream of Zoroastrians to more tolerant areas, mostly the capital, Tehran, or abroad. Again, a complete language environment does not exist in these places, inhibiting the transmission of Dari to new generations. Linguists currently consider Dari to be in a state of language shift. Many of the language’s speakers have assimilated to the dominant culture of the society they live in and have given up—intentionally or unintentionally—their traditional language. Languages like Dari are transferring from a state of language maintenance, in which a language is being sustained in the face of pressure from a dominant culture, to language death, a state in which the language is no longer spoken. Many of Dari’s dialects are facing extinction at an even more rapid pace than the language as a whole. Since each of Dari’s many dialects has a smaller community of speakers, they are more susceptible to the forces driving the language towards extinction. Some dialects have already effectively reached extinction, for example, the Mohammadabad dialect, which, it is reported, possesses only a few speakers living in Tehran. The Kerman dialect, always susceptible because of the smaller size of its Zoroastrian population, also seems to be largely lost.

Based on the 1955 play The Reluctant Debutante by William Douglas-Home,First line of closing credits: based on the play \\"The Reluctant Debutante\\" by WILLIAM DOUGLAS HOME (sic) it is the second adaptation for the screen of this work. It stars Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, and Kelly Preston. The film was released on April 4, 2003, received mixed reviews and grossed $50 million worldwide. Plot In the year 2003, Daphne Reynolds is a 17-year-old American girl, living with her wedding singer mother, Libby, above a restaurant in New York City. Libby had met Englishman Henry Dashwood in Northern Africa, and they married in a Bedouin wedding ceremony of uncertain legality. They returned to his family estate in England. His father soon died, making Henry the Lord Dashwood. Alastair Payne, the family's aristocratic advisor, tricks Libby into leaving, telling her it is best for Henry's duties not to know she is pregnant, then he lies to Henry, hiding the pregnancy from him and saying that Libby claimed to be leaving because she was in love with someone else. Libby has always been honest with Daphne about who her father is, though Daphne feels a sense of emptiness without him. When Daphne graduates from high school, she runs off to London to try and meet her father. Henry has disclaimed his seat in the House of Lords to run for election to the House of Commons, hoping to eventually become Prime Minister. Henry is being pushed by Alistair, acting as his political advisor. Henry is engaged to Alistair's daughter, the snobby Glynnis, who has an equally snobby teenaged daughter, Clarissa. Checking into a London hostel, Daphne meets Ian Wallace, a local boy who works there to support his preferred dream of making it as a musician. After forming a friendship when Ian shows Daphne around London, they start dating. When Henry catches Daphne at his estate, he is stunned to learn he has a child, but his mother, Jocelyne, immediately welcomes her in, giving her a room at the estate. After confirming things in a phone call with Libby, Henry embraces the opportunity to connect with Daphne. Daphne tries to win the acceptance of her father's social circle, but is repeatedly thwarted by Glynnis and Clarissa. In addition, Daphne has to ward off the advances of Armistead Stewart, a sleazy and arrogant upper-class boy whom Clarissa fancies. Daphne eventually pushes him into the Thames. Daphne inadvertently wins over the aristocracy, including the elderly Princess Charlotte, whenever she interacts with them. However, Henry's political campaign suffers due to Daphne's flamboyant behavior, and his subsequent misbehavior with her. He asks her to assume the more dignified manner of the Dashwood lineage, after which Henry's polling numbers quickly improve. Ian is disappointed in her new behavior, made worse when she stands him up in favor of attending an upper-class social function. During her coming-out party, hosted by her father (who flies Libby over to attend), Daphne overhears Alastair telling Glynnis how he \\"got rid of\\" Libby seventeen years earlier. When Daphne confronts him, Glynnis locks her in another room. Glynnis then asks Ian, the band's lead singer, to announce the father–daughter dance, knowing Henry will have to dance with Clarissa. Libby frees Daphne, but when they see Henry dancing with Clarissa, Daphne rejects her new self, telling Henry she is returning to America. Some time later, Henry surprises everyone by announcing that he is withdrawing from the election. As he leaves the press conference, Henry discovers that Alastair knew about Libby's pregnancy and manipulated their separation. Henry punches Alastair in the face, then breaks off his engagement to Glynnis. Daphne is serving as a caterer at a wedding, where Libby is the singer. When the father–daughter dance begins, Henry shows up, telling Daphne that he loves her for who she is. Daphne embraces him, calling him \\"Dad\\" for the first time. Daphne finally gets the father–daughter dance she has been longing for her whole life. Henry informs Daphne that he has brought a large apology present for herat which point Ian appears and asks her to dance. As Ian and Daphne dance, Henry apologizes to Libby, and those two also start dancing. In the epilogue, Glynnis marries a wealthy nobleman, Clarissa marries Armistead, and Alastair works on a London tour bus. Libby and Henry are legally married in a Bedouin ceremony. Daphne is accepted into Oxford and is dating Ian.

He was known for his powerful and expensive Brough Superior motorcycles which were the first superbikes. George died in 1970 but his legacy lives on in the many Brough Superior motorcycles maintained by enthusiasts to this day. Early life George was the second son of motorcycle pioneer William Edward Brough and was born at 10 Mandalay Street, Basford, Nottingham on 21 April 1890. William Brough had been building motorcycles at his factory in Nottingham since the 1890s so it was expected that George and his brother would join in the family business. Business Brough Superior at the National Motorcycle Museum (UK) George wanted to develop his father's business and make high-performance motorcycles. His father was not convinced, however, so George set up his own factory nearby in 1919 at Haydn Road in Nottingham to produce what he called the Brough Superior range of motorcycles and motor cars. The name Superior was suggested by a friend but his father reputedly took it personally. George's motorcycles lived up to the claim, however, and he brought together the best components he could find and added distinctive styling details. He had a flair for marketing and in 1922 rode a Brough Superior SS80 which he called Spit and Polish at Brooklands. managing an unofficial lap. Brough Superior riders view 3,048 motorcycles of 19 models were made in 21 years of production. Most were custom built to customers' requirements and rarely were any two of the same configuration. Each motorcycle was assembled twice. The first assembly was for fitting of all components, then the motorcycle was disassembled and all parts were painted or plated as needed, then the finished parts were assembled finally. Every motorcycle was test ridden to ensure that it performed to specification, and was certified by George Brough. The SS100 model was ridden at 100 mph or more prior to delivery. The SS80 model was ridden at or more before delivery. If any motorcycle did not meet specification, it returned to the shop for rework until it performed properly. In 1929 an SS100 was purchased by Sir William Lyons who two years later applied the same name to his own first four-wheeled vehicle, much to Brough's disgruntlement at the time, though the two later became close friends. \\"S\\" and \\"S\\" were the first two initials of the Swallow Sidecar Company which Lyons had co-founded back in 1923. In 1940, World War II brought an end to production as the factory was turned over to produce Rolls- Royce Merlin aero-engines. After hostilities had ceased there were no suitable engines available so the company was wound up. Racing career In 1928, George Brough recorded at Arpajon, unofficially the world's fastest speed on a solo motorcycle. Brough was noted for riding wearing a flat-cap which he had specially made to his requirements.Motor Cycle, 22 December 1966, p.831 Hat Trick by Beresford, George.

It is oriented north-south, 8 km long and 2 km wide, and has a maximum depth of 195 m. Mount Graham and Mount Upright / Te Taumata o Uekanuku are on the west coast of the lake, Tūhua on the east. The lake is included in the Lake Kaniere Scenic Reserve. The road from Hokitika meets the northern shore of the lake at \\"The Landing\\" and splits; Dorothy Falls Road runs up the entire eastern side of the lake past Hans Bay and Dorothy Falls to the Styx River, while the other fork goes a short way west to Sunny Bight. A four-hour hiking trail continues down the west side of the lake before joining Dorothy Falls Road. Most of the houses at Lake Kaniere today are holiday homes, and there is a DOC campground at Hans Bay.  Geology  Lake Kaniere was created by the action of glaciers in the last ice age 14,000 years ago, like many West Coast lakes. It currently drains into the Tasman Sea at its northern end via the Kaniere River, but in the past its outlet was at the southern end, emptying into the Styx River. This exit was blocked by a landslide, diverting the water north.  Fauna  The streams that feed into the lake are home to several species of native fish, including common bullies, longfin eels, banded kokopu and giant kokopu. The lake has been stocked with fish in the past, and mostly contains brown trout and perch. Many species of native birds can also be found on and around the lake, such as little shags, black shags, New Zealand scaup, paradise shelducks and pūkeko, and also, rarely, grey ducks. There are several pairs of whio in the Styx River at the southern end of the lake. In the surrounding forest are yellow-crowned kākāriki, ruru, rifleman, brown creeper, and sometimes kea. Early Māori settlers found large numbers of kākāpō around the lake.  Flora  Lake Kaniere Scenic Reserve is largely composed of mature rimu, and is considered one of the most ecologically-significant areas of lowland forest in the central West Coast. The rimu forest composition varies: on the flat outwash terraces, it contains rātā (Metrosideros) and kaikawaka (Libocedrus bidwillii), while on the slopes there is more supplejack (Ripogonum scandens), kiekie (Freycinetia banksii), and miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea). In the swampier areas there are other tree species including manoao (Manoao colensoi), kaikawaka, and kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides).  Human history  1910 tourism postcard of the lake Painting by Alfred Walsh (1859–1916) Painting by Charles Blomfield (1848–1926) In pre-European times, Lake Kaniere was an important mahinga kai (food gathering place) for Māori, with longfin eels and weka being two of the most important food resources in and around the lake. In 1909 a small hydroelectric station was built on the Kaniere River, at a cost of £15,000, to power the pumping equipment at the Ross gold mine. Water is taken near the weir at the northern end of the lake and travels 9 km through a series of tunnels and flumes to a twin power plant capable of generating 520 kW; the water race was originally used for gold sluicing in the Kaniere area. The most prominent of the wooden flumes, Johnson's Flume, collapsed in 1973 and was replaced by earthworks. The Kaniere Forks power station later supplied the gold dredge at Rimu, and after 1931 exclusively generated power for Hokitika, today supplying 3.75 GWh annually to the town. A 3½ hour walkway follows the water race, part of the West Coast Wilderness Trail. Lake Kaniere is a popular location for leisure activities such as camping, picknicking, jetboating, jetskiing, and water skiing. It is also the main water supply for Hokitika.

The organ is located just in front of the kidney, or mesonephros. It is formed at the cranial tip of the male and female gonad during the larval stage. Its main function appears to be endocrine, taking part in regulating sex hormones. Normally, it contains miniature egg follicles which have the capability to mature (becoming active). Zoologists have experimented with the physiology of the organ by castrating male toads (removing the testes). In doing so, the Bidder's organ enlarges and produces viable oocytes (egg cells). Only rudimentary oviducts are developed, though, preventing eggs from actually being laid. The Bidder's organ only develops into an ovary analogue when testes are removed experimentally or not functioning properly (e.g. due to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals). Importantly, females can have Bidder's organs in addition to true ovaries, which suggests that the Bidder's organ might not be a rudimentary ovary. It is named in honour of Friedrich Bidder. Anatomy The organ's internal anatomy consists of two parts; the central portion, consisting of connective tissue and rich in blood vessels, and its periphery, consisting of the cortex, which contains follicles in various stages of development. Molecules of various proteins are present in the outer layer of the follicles, homologous to the zona pellucida of the ovum. The physiology of the Bidder's organ is unique, having no connection with temperature-dependent sex determination (i.e., reptiles, avians, and mammals). Location in a dissected toad The ideal specimen for dissection is Bufo marinus, or giant cane toad. In the male toad, the Bidder's organ is beneath the mesentery of the intestine, between the two mesonephros. It is a conspicuous organ, being colored red, and at the cranial poles of the large testes.

Background and life Hester Shaw, aged around fifteen at the beginning of the Quartet, is the daughter of Thaddeus Valentine and Pandora Shaw. She was raised by Shrike. Hester is portrayed as having copper hair and gray eyes. She has a scar which cut her face from forehead to jaw, a wrenched mouth, a stump nose, and a single eye. The character's surname comes from Shaugh Prior. Role In the first novel of the Mortal Engines Quartet (known in US as The Hungry City Chronicles), Mortal Engines, her botched assassination attempt on Thaddeus Valentine led to Tom Natsworthy and set off a chain of events that would change a course of history. In other media In the Mortal Engines student short film made in 2009, Alyssa Burnett plays Hester. One of her photos are mistakenly identified as a cosplay. There is a 28mm figure based on Hester Shaw. In Mortal Engines, the film adaptation of the first book, Hester is portrayed by twenty-eight- year-old Icelandic actress Hera Hilmar as an adult, while the young Hester is played by New Zealand child actress Poppy Macleod. Her scar is heavily toned down, and she is aged to her twenties. Hilmar described her character as challenging to play. Christian Rivers, the director of the film, addressed the fan criticism over Hester's scar, stating that audiences would be \\"put off the film\\" if it were more true to the books. The author acknowledged the difference. Many reviewers remarked that this rendition of Hester lacks character development. Other changes include: she lost her mother when she was eight and she fought Valentine aboard his airship.

An \\"economic minded\\" governors-general in Spanish-ruled Philippines, his rule tried to subjugate the Ivatan natives of Batanes, which led to the murder of Ivatan indigenous hero Aman Dangat. Governor General of the Philippines He established the Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País, or the Economic Society of Friends of the Country, which revived the tobacco industry in the Spanish Philippines. He established the basis for the takeoff of the agriculture of Philippine export with a tolerance policy towards the theoretically illegal activity of foreign retailers, mainly the English and North Americans who went to Manila to complete their product shipments. He also made the colony independent by freeing it from the control of New Spain and other Pacific Islands including the Philippines. Hoping to free the Philippines from Mexican and Chinese trade, Basco established reforms including incentivizing the production of cotton, spices, sugarcane, and mining, as well as rewarding scientific reforms. http://www.philippine- history.org/galleon-trade.htm In 1782, Basco sent an expedition to undertake the formalities of acquiring the consent of the Ivatans to become subjects of the king of Spain. The Ivatans, with their elders and leaders such as the hero Aman Dangat, revolted against Spanish rule. Regardless, onn June 26, 1783, Joseph Huelva y Melgarjo was declared by the Spanish government as first governor of Batanes. The new province was named Provincia de la Concepcion and Governor General Basco was named “Conde de la Conquista de Batanes” and the capital town, Basco, was named after him. By January 21, 1789, King Carlos III granted in prize to his numerous services the title of Count of Conquista of the Batanes Islands; grace to which he added to the appointments of Squad leader and Governor of Cartagena.

Itbayat, the largest island of the archipelago, is about northwest of the central part of Batan. Events The Japanese invasion of the Philippines began with the invasion of Batan Island by a 490-man naval combat unit and an indeterminate number of air corps troops, on two transports escorted by one destroyer and four torpedo boats. This was the first landing on American territory, the same day as the attack on Pearl Harbor. Japanese forces quickly secured the existing small airfield outside Basco without resistance and began expansion work immediately as a forward base for operations against Luzon. However, work was discontinued only a few days later as the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco redundant. On 10 December 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn.

The stadium reopened in 1982 after an extensive facelift. At the time it was one of the most modern stadiums in the world, especially due to the moat around the pitch. After twenty years FC Utrecht felt the need for expansion and renewal. The main stand was moved to the North side and opened for the start of the 2001–2002 season. The old main stand was rebuilt after that and a year later FC Utrecht had two new stands along the sides of the pitch. Last season, the goal stands were replaced, and the stadium now has 23,750 seats. Seven international matches of the Dutch national football team have been played in the stadium. The first was a friendly on 27 April 1983 against Sweden which ended 3–0 for the visitors. The most recent, played on 3 September 2004, was also a friendly: a 3–0 win against Liechtenstein. The stadium was also the host of 2 World Cup finals. In 1998, the Dutch hockey team became world champions, beating Spain in the final 3–2.

It was developed by Vincent Park and Scott Corson at the University of Maryland and the Naval Research Laboratory. Park has patented his work, and it was licensed by Nova Engineering, who are marketing a wireless router product based on Park's algorithm. Operation The TORA attempts to achieve a high degree of scalability using a \\"flat\\", non-hierarchical routing algorithm. In its operation the algorithm attempts to suppress, to the greatest extent possible, the generation of far-reaching control message propagation. In order to achieve this, the TORA does not use a shortest path solution, an approach which is unusual for routing algorithms of this type. TORA builds and maintains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) rooted at a destination. No two nodes may have the same height. Information may flow from nodes with higher heights to nodes with lower heights. Information can therefore be thought of as a fluid that may only flow downhill. By maintaining a set of totally ordered heights at all times, TORA achieves loop-free multipath routing, as information cannot 'flow uphill' and so cross back on itself. The key design concepts of TORA is localization of control messages to a very small set of nodes near the occurrence of a topological change. To accomplish this, nodes need to maintain the routing information about adjacent (one hop) nodes. The protocol performs three basic functions: * Route creation * Route maintenance * Route erasure During the route creation and maintenance phases, nodes use a height metric to establish a directed acyclic graph (DAG) rooted at destination. Thereafter links are assigned based on the relative height metric of neighboring nodes. During the times of mobility the DAG is broken and the route maintenance unit comes into picture to reestablish a DAG routed at the destination. Timing is an important factor for TORA because the height metric is dependent on the logical time of the link failure. TORA's route erasure phase is essentially involving flooding a broadcast clear packet (CLR) throughout the network to erase invalid routes =Route creation= A node which requires a link to a destination because it has no downstream neighbours for it sends a QRY (query) packet and sets its (formerly unset) route-required flag. A QRY packet contains the destination id of the node a route is sought to. The reply to a query is called an update UPD packet. It contains the height quintuple of the neighbour node answering to a query and the destination field which tells for which destination the update was meant for. A node receiving a QRY packet does one of the following: * If its route required flag is set, this means that it doesn't have to forward the QRY, because it has itself already issued a QRY for the destination, but better discard it to prevent message overhead. * If the node has no downstream links and the route-required flag was not set, it sets its route-required flag and rebroadcasts the QRY message. A node receiving an update packet updates the height value of its neighbour in the table and takes one of the following actions: * If the reflection bit of the neighbours height is not set and its route required flag is set it sets its height for the destination to that of its neighbours but increments d by one. It then deletes the RR flag and sends an UPD message to the neighbours, so they may route through it. * If the neighbours route is not valid (which is indicated by the reflection bit) or the RR flag was unset, the node only updates the entry of the neighbours node in its table. Each node maintains a neighbour table containing the height of the neighbour nodes. Initially the height of all the nodes is NULL. (This is not zero \\"0\\" but NULL \\"-\\") so their quintuple is (-,-,-,-,i). The height of a destination neighbour is (0,0,0,0,dest). Node C requires a route, so it broadcasts a QRY. The QRY propagates until it hits a node which has a route to the destination, this node then sends an UPD message. The UPD is also propagated, while node E sends a new UPD. =Route Maintenance= Route maintenance in TORA has five different cases according to the flowchart below: Example B still has a downstream link to the destination so no action is needed partition detection and route erasure he links D-F and E-F reverse. Node D propagates the reference level. Node E now \\"reflects\\" the reference level. The reference heights of the neighbours are equal with the reflection bit not set. E sets the reflection bit to indicate the reflection and sets its offset to 0. Node C just propagates the new reference level. Node A now propagates the reference level. =Route Erasure= When a node has detected a partition it sets its height and the heights of all its neighbours for the destination in its table to NULL and it issues a CLR (Clear) packet. The CLR packet consists of the reflected reference level (t,oid,1) and the destination id. If a node receives a CLR packet and the reference level matches its own reference level it sets all heights of the neighbours and its own for the destination to NULL and broadcasts the CLR packet. If the reference level doesn't match its own it just sets the heights of the neighbours its table matching the reflected reference level to NULL and updates their link status References External links *TORA Specification (Internet Draft 2001, expired) *MODIS Group Management of Data and Information Systems Category:Routing algorithms Category:Wireless networking Category:Ad hoc routing protocols ","title":"Temporally ordered routing algorithm"},{"id":"1126599","title":"Apple Cinema Display"},{"id":"1126605","text":"Alonso Jorge Solís Calderón (born October 14, 1978) is a Costa Rican football player and singer, who plays offensive midfielder or Striker, is currently looking for a team in the Costa Rican Primera División.

Kurland lives in San Luis Obispo, California. Writing career Kurland's early career was devoted to works of science fiction. His first published novel was Ten Years to Doomsday (written with Chester Anderson) in 1964. Other notable works include Tomorrow Knight, Pluribus, Perchance, and The Unicorn Girl. The Unicorn Girl was the middle volume of the Greenwich Village Trilogy by three different authors, the other two being Chester Anderson and T.A. Waters. (Anderson's book, The Butterfly Kid, was nominated for a Hugo Award). Kurland has also written two novels, Ten Little Wizards and A Study in Sorcery, set in the world of Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy, prefiguring his later success as a mystery writer. Following the success of The Infernal Device, which was nominated for an Edgar Award (as was his earlier A Plague of Spies), Kurland turned his attention to detective fiction. Several of his subsequent novels have been sequels to The Infernal Device, and feature Sherlock Holmes's nemesis, Professor Moriarty. In this series, Professor Moriarty is an antihero (and sometimes a real hero) who resignedly tolerates Holmes's obsessively exaggerated opinion of his criminal empire, and is often brought into reluctant alliance with his nemesis in order to counter menaces ranging from threats to their associates to threats to the nation. He has edited three themed anthologies of Sherlock Holmes short stories, My Sherlock Holmes (stories narrated by characters other than Watson or Holmes), Sherlock Holmes: The Hidden Years (stories set during the period in which Holmes was supposed to be dead) and Sherlock Holmes: the American Years (stories set in the time between Holmes' graduation from university and his meeting Dr. Watson). He is also the author of numerous non-fiction works, including How to Solve a Murder: the Forensic Handbook and How to Try a Murder: the Handbook for Armchair Lawyers.

After the Italian government took over control of the port in 5 July 1882 it laid the foundations for the formation of the colony of Italian Eritrea which became the independent country of Eritrea. Economy The port facilities were greatly expanded in the early 1990s, with the construction of the new terminal, but the port has declined since trade with Ethiopia was terminated in 1998 as a consequence of the Eritrean-Ethiopian War. The United Arab Emirates reportedly uses the port and airport for logistics, and as a detention center.

Miss Universe Sayalero showed enough of her legendary poise to become the indisputable leader of the night, winning the swimsuit, interview and evening gown competitions at the pageant held in Perth, Australia on July 19. She was the first titleholder from Venezuela. Immediately after the live telecast ended, the stage collapsed, as too many journalists and photographers had stormed on to get a photograph of the new queen. She managed to save a contestant (Miss Colombia) from falling into the gaping hole left in the middle of the set. Other delegates, including Miss Turkey and Miss Brazil, fell through the hole and were injured. Legacy Her victory began a national interest in beauty in Venezuela. Her name has become synonymous with beauty among Spanish language speakers, not only in Venezuela. Following her victory, in the 1980s, many parents named their daughters Maritza after her, especially if they shared the common family surname of Fernandez. At least one ship was named in her honour, Maritza Sayalero. Life after Miss Universe Maritza Sayalero is married to Mexican tennis player Raúl Ramírez and became a naturalized citizen of Mexico.

Blenny (SS-324) was launched 9 April 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Miss Florence King, daughter of CNO Admiral Ernest J. King; commissioned 27 June 1944, Lieutenant Commander W. H. Hazzard in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet. Between 10 November 1944 and 14 August 1945 Blenny conducted four war patrols in the Java and South China Seas. Blenny sank eight Japanese vessels totaling 18,262 tons. On 16 July 1945, she torpedoed and sank the gunboat Nankai at , 150 miles west of Surabaya. In addition, she is credited with destroying more than 62 miscellaneous Japanese small craft by gunfire, and rescuing a boarding party lost by the when that boat had to make an emergency dive to avoid strafing. With the cessation of hostilities Blenny returned to San Diego, arriving 5 September 1945. She operated locally from the San Diego area during the remainder of 1945. Between 1946 and 1951 Blenny made one cruise to China (August–November 1946); participated in a midshipman cruise to Canada; made two winter cruises in Alaskan waters (1947–48 and 1948–49); and participated in fleet maneuvers off Hawaii and local operations near San Diego. In 1951 Blenny underwent conversion to a GUPPY submarine and spent the remainder of the year operating in the San Diego area. Between May and November 1952 she cruised in the Far East during which time she conducted a 35-day reconnaissance patrol in support of the Korean operations. The boat spent 1953 conducting local operations along the west coast. On 24 May 1954 Blenny reported to the Atlantic Fleet. She operated out of New London, Conn., participating in Atlantic Fleet, NATO, and anti-submarine warfare exercises, in addition to operating with a submarine development group engaged in evaluating new equipment. Blenny was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine, AGSS-324, c. 1969. She was decommissioned, 7 November 1969 and laid up in the Reserve Fleet. Blenny was struck from the Naval Register, 15 August 1973. She was sunk to form part of an artificial reef about fifteen miles (24 km) off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland in June, 1989. Blenny received four battle stars for her World War II service and one battle star for Korean War service.

Martin James, Historical Dictionary of Angola, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 54 It was long the centre of an important trade, especially in slaves to Brazil and Cuba. Ships anchored about off the shore, in depths of and transferred loads to smaller boats which used five or six jetties in the town. However, the nearby deep-water sheltered harbour of Lobito was a much larger port. Besides the churches of S. Felipe and S. António, the hospital, and the fortress, there were, as of 1911, only a few stone-built houses. A short way beyond Benguela is Baía Farta, where salt was manufactured and sulphur was extracted. Close to Baia Farta was the beach of Baia Azul. The city prospered and grew in the following decades. The Benguela Railway was built in the early 20th century by Portugal to connect the city and Lobito to the interior, and it achieved great success when linked to the Copperbelt of Katanga, DR Congo and Zambia. Britannica, Benguela, britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 30, 2019 Starting in the early 20th century, Benguela attracted, developed, and retained quality businesses and professionals into its thriving and growing economy. Sisal and fishing industries expanded and the financial, construction and services market boomed until 1974.BenguelaAnosOuro.wmv, a film of Benguela, Overseas Province of Angola before 1975. =Post-independence= In 1975, after the April 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, Portugal, the Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola became independent. Benguela City Hall. Due to the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), which lasted more than 20 years after independence from Portugal, the important Benguela railway line closed, with only the short distance of between Benguela and Lobito remaining operational. In 1983 Benguela had a population of 155,000. During the civil war the city of Benguela increased its population due to refugees from the countryside. =21st century= In the mid-2000s, with a more peaceful environment, restoration of the railway between Benguela and Huambo commenced. While the colonial part of the city consists of relatively good-quality houses, as of 2011 most of the refugees live in slum areas. Transports The city has an airport, the Benguela Airport. The city is connected to the railway with the Benguela Railway. Economy Estádio Nacional de Ombaka. Benguela was one of the centres of Portuguese trade to the African interior. The city remains an important commercial link between western and eastern Angola. Coffee, corn, sisal, sugarcane, and tobacco are grown in the interior regions of Angola and widely traded in Benguela. Manganese from the interior is also traded in Benguela. Industries local to the city include fish processing and the milling of sugarcane; the city also produces pottery, soap, and tools. Foreign trade is handled through the deep-water port of Lobito, which is located north of Benguela. Lobito, once the busiest port in Angola, was severely disrupted during the Angolan Civil War.

Panorama Mesdag is a panorama by Hendrik Willem Mesdag. Housed in a purpose-built museum in The Hague, the panorama is a cylindrical painting (also known as a Cyclorama) more than 14 metres high and about 40 metres in diameter (120 metres in circumference). From an observation gallery in the centre of the room the cylindrical perspective creates the illusion that the viewer is on a high sand dune overlooking the sea, beaches and village of Scheveningen in the late 19th century. A foreground of fake terrain around the viewing gallery hides the base of the painting and makes the illusion more convincing. History Mesdag was a marine painter of the Hague School; in 1880 he was engaged by a Belgian company to paint the panorama, which with the assistance of his wife Sientje Mesdag-van Houten and some student painters (including George Hendrik Breitner), was completed by 1881. However, the vogue for panoramas was coming to an end, and the company went bankrupt in 1886. Mesdag purchased the panorama and met its losses from his own pocket.

Binger was born at Strasbourg in the Bas-Rhin . In 1887 he traveled from Senegal up to the Niger River, arriving at Grand Bassam in 1889. During this expedition he discovered that the Mountains of Kong did not exist. He described this journey in his work Du Niger au golfe de Guinée par le pays de Kong et le Mossi (From the Niger to the Gulf of Guinea though the land of the Kong and the Mossi) (1891). In 1892 he returned to the Guinea Coast to superintend the forming of the boundaries between the British and French colonies. In 1893 Binger was appointed governor of the Côte d'Ivoire, where he remained until 1898. He returned to France that year, to an administrative post in Paris at the French Colonial Ministry.

Invariance, as a broader term, also applies to the no change of form of physical laws under a transformation, and is closer in scope to the mathematical definition. Invariants of a system are deeply tied to the symmetries imposed by its environment. Invariance is an important concept in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their symmetries and invariants. Examples In classical and quantum mechanics, invariance of space under translation results in momentum being an invariant and the conservation of momentum, whereas invariance of the origin of time, i.e. translation in time, results in energy being an invariant and the conservation of energy. In general, by Noether's theorem, any invariance of a physical system under a continuous symmetry leads to a fundamental conservation law. In crystals, the electron density is periodic and invariant with respect to discrete translations by unit cell vectors. In very few materials, this symmetry can be broken due to enhanced electron correlations. Another examples of physical invariants are the speed of light, and charge and mass of a particle observed from two reference frames moving with respect to one another (invariance under a spacetime Lorentz transformation), and invariance of time and acceleration under a Galilean transformation between two such frames moving at low velocities. Quantities can be invariant under some common transformations but not under others. For example, the velocity of a particle is invariant when switching coordinate representations from rectangular to curvilinear coordinates, but is not invariant when transforming between frames of reference that are moving with respect to each other. Other quantities, like the speed of light, are always invariant. Physical laws are said to be invariant under transformations when their predictions remain unchanged. This generally means that the form of the law (e.g. the type of differential equations used to describe the law) is unchanged in transformations so that no additional or different solutions are obtained. Covariance and contravariance generalize the mathematical properties of invariance in tensor mathematics, and are frequently used in electromagnetism, special relativity, and general relativity.

Geography Fécamp is situated in the valley of the Valmont river, at the heart of the Pays de Caux, on the Alabaster Coast. It is around 35 km northeast of Le Havre, and around 60 km northwest of Rouen. History =Origin of the name= According to its late medieval founding legend, the trunk of a fig tree (ficus) carrying the Precious Blood of Christ collected by Joseph of Arimathea was washed ashore on the riverbank at Fécamp in the 1st century. Immediately, a fountain of holy blood gushed from the site; the relic attracted many medieval pilgrims, enhancing the reputation of the city. The monks' legend justified the artificial etymology of the name to Fici-campus, the camp of the fig tree. Fécamp, however, is mentioned in 875 as Fiscannum and in 990 as Fiscannus and as late as 1496Under 1496 Richard, duke of Normany apud Fiscannum sepulto, \\"buried at Fescamp\\", in Roger of Wendover, Flores historiarum. which stem from the Germanic root fisc (English \\"fish\\") with an unknown suffix. It used to be the name of the Valmont River. =Pre-history= The prehistoric site, on the high ground inland from the port of Fécamp, reveals human occupation dating back to Neolithic times. Spreading over 21 hectares, surrounded by walls and ditches for a length of nearly 2000 meters, including a praetorian door. Objects recovered range in date from the Neolithic until Roman times. =Roman times= Many items of the Gallo-Roman period have been found locally, particularly coins (including two gold Gallic coins found in 1839). A bronze axe, of Celtic design, was unearthed in 1859. Fécamp was on the ancient road linking Arques-la-Bataille and Lillebonne with the north of Gaul. The archaeological diggings around the Ducal palace (in the grounds of the present abbey) in 1973-1984 revealed some evidence of the La Tène Celtic culture and Gallo-Roman works. Two Gallo-Roman cemeteries have also been discovered. During Roman times, a road linked Fécamp to Étretat, passing through the present-day village of Fond-Pitron. The current D940 follows the original Roman road. =Middle Ages= Robert Antoine Pinchon, Le port de Fécamp, oil on canvas, 60 x 73 cm The Abbey =More from the Middle Ages= In the 6th century, Saint Leger was exiled to Fécamp. In 932, William I of Normandy (Long-Sword) founded the castle that was to be the residence of the Dukes of Normandy up until 1204, after which, the Norman Duchy was integrated within the French royal domain. The castle was the birthplace of many Norman dukes, including Richard I of Normandy (born 933) and Richard II of Normandy (who died 22 August 1027). In 1202, King John of England granted a community system to Fécamp. In 1410 the English razed the town. In 1449, Fécamp was freed from English occupation. For Fécamp, the Wars of religion finished in July 1593, when Captain de Bois-Rosé rallied the city to Henry IV of France after his conversion to Catholicism.Wars of religion by Pierre Miquel, p 388 It was at Fécamp that Charles II of England landed, on 16 October 1651, soon after the Battle of Worcester, where he had been finally defeated by Cromwell. =Modern era= A fishing boat returns to port Fishing boats return to port The history of Fécamp has always revolved around the fishing industry and its harbour (first mentioned in the 11th century). The reputation of the salt-herrings of Fécamp was established as early as the 10th century, that of smoked herrings from the 13th century. An association of whale fishermen was created in the 11th century. Fishing for cod started commercially in the 16th century, under the impetus of Nicolas Selles, an early shipping magnate. Throughout the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century, Fécamp had an important role as the chief fishing port in France for cod and cod-related fish. This was the case up until the 1970s, when Canada stopped all access to their fishing grounds. First practiced by three- masted sailing ships, Atlantic fishing trips could last more than six months, the time taken to fill the hold with cod, which were salted to preserve them. The fishing was actually carried out in small boats, carrying only two or three fishermen. Many of these small boats would be lost in the fog and never returned to the ship. As technology evolved, the three-mast boats disappeared, giving way to steamers, then to diesel-engined vessels. These days, only a small fishing fleet survives, restricted to fishing around coastal waters. In the harbour, pleasure-boats have taken the place of all but a few fishing- boats. * In the 19th century, the recipe for Benedictine liqueur was “rediscovered” by Alexandre Legrand.

During the Turko-Egyptian conquest of 1820, Wadi Halfa was used as a stopping point for troops headed south. Communications developed in the latter half of the 19th century, with a telegraph line to Egypt connected in 1866 and ill-fated attempts to build a railway to Kerma in 1873 and 1877.Budge, Ernest A.W.

The eventual establishment of the Sudanese rail head at Wadi Halfaconnected via steamer to the Egyptian network via a port just south of Asyutcaused the site to eclipse the former caravan site at Korosko. Chained Sudanese prisoners carrying British baggage through Wadi Halfa in 1898. In 1885, Wadi Halfa entered a period of turmoil after falling under the Mahdist War regime. Conflicts frequently broke out on the border, and in 1889, Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi's army entered the town on the way to the Battle of Tushki. Wadi Halfa was briefly the headquarters of the British-led Egyptian and British forces under Kitchener seeking to defeat the forces of Muhammad Ahmad, the Mahdi proclaimed by his disciples, from 1881 to 1885. The rail line up the Nile was originally begun in 1897 to support this military buildup; it extends, via Atbara, to El Obeid and beyond into southern and western Sudan. Wadi Halfa RR Hotel 1936 A river monitoring station functioned in Wadi Halfa between 1911 and 1931, to monitor changes associated with the Aswan reservoir, but from 1931 to 1962 it was moved to Kajnarty, 47 kilometres to the north of the town. A railroad hotel was built in the town during the 20th century, and during World War II, Wadi Halfa was a communications post for Allied forces in Africa. By 1956, the town had grown to a population of 11,000. On 8 November 1959, the signing of the Sudanese-UAR Nile Water Agreement brought the area into much debate, given that the agreement to flood the area upon the creation of the Aswan Dam would directly affect some 52,000 people in the area who would have to be resettled over a four-year period from 1960. Worst affected were the Nubians who demonstrated in Wadi Halfa on 23–24 October 1960 against being resettled, and on 26 October demonstrations took place in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, which had to be dispersed by police using tear gas. The government was quick to suppress the agitation, placing Wadi Halfa under martial law and terminating communications with the rest of the country. Protests in Khartoum, mainly by students, led to the temporary closure of the Khartoum campus of Cairo University and about 50 arrests. The old town was completely destroyed after the construction of the Aswan High Dam due to flooding in 1964. Most of the town was relocated, and by 1965 the population of New Halfa was just 3,200. During the 1970s, the area was under intense scrutiny by archaeologists working to protect ancient Nubian monuments. Wadi Halfa was featured in part 4, entitled \\"Shifting Sands\\", of the 8 part Michael Palin television documentary Pole to Pole released by the BBC in 1992. In 2005 a museum and interactive Nubian village were planned for Wadi Halfa but by 2014 nothing had been done.  Climate  Wadi Halfa has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) typical of the Nubian Desert. Wadi Halfa receives each year the highest mean amount of bright sunshine, with an extreme value of 4,300 h which is equal to 97–98 % of possible sunshine. In addition to this, the town receives a mean annual amount of rainfall of 0.5 mm and many years usually pass without any rainfall falling on the ground. Wadi Halfa experiences long, hot summers and short, warm winters. The annual mean temperature is about 27 °C. From May to September, inclusively, the averages highs exceed 40 °C. The annual mean rate of potential evaporation is also among the highest found throughout the world, with as much as 5,930 mm. Economy right Agriculture played an important role in local economy. The Chinese have invested in a fish processing plant in the town.

Known as Castrum Octavianum in antiquity (which literally means the castle of Octavianus) and as Pins del Vallès during the Second Spanish Republic, it is named after Saint Cucuphas, who is said to have been martyred on the spot now occupied by its medieval monastery. The final part of its toponym, del Vallès, is a reference to the historical county where the town is situated, Vallès. Description In addition to the monastery, the town's other notable buildings include the School of Architecture of the Vallès and the Centre d'Alt Rendiment (CAR, translit. High Performance Centre), a famous centre for professional sport training. Sant Cugat has become an affluent suburb of Barcelona due to its location (only 20 kilometres from the city), its natural surroundings, and its pedestrian shopping area. Sant Cugat also offers restaurants, a concert venue, two cinemas, and one large shopping centre. It is also a political stronghold for conservative Catalan nationalism, with Convergència i Unió dominating the town's politics for 32 years up until 2019 when Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya took control of the City Council with the support of other political forces (PSC and CUP). Sant Cugat has seen its population increase in recent years, with more births than bigger cities like Barcelona (2004). It has also practically merged with the nearby Rubí (population 72,987) and Cerdanyola del Vallès (population 58,747). The town has its own train station with a direct metro connection into Barcelona city centre and the nearby industrial cities of Terrassa and Sabadell.

Rocinha is built on a steep hillside overlooking Rio de Janeiro, and is located about one kilometre from a nearby beach. Most of the favela is on a very steep hill, with many trees surrounding it. Almost 100,000 people live in Rocinha, making it the most populous favela in Brazil.http://lista10.org/diversos/as-10-maiores-favelas-do-brasil/ Although Rocinha is officially classified as a neighbourhood, many still refer to it as a favela. It developed from a shanty town into an urbanized slum. Today, almost all the houses in Rocinha are made from concrete and brick. Some buildings are three and four stories tall and almost all houses have basic sanitation, plumbing and electricity. Compared to simple shanty towns or slums, Rocinha has a better developed infrastructure and hundreds of businesses such as banks, medicine stores, bus routes, cable television, including locally based channel TV ROC (TV Rocinha), and, at one time, a McDonald's franchise. These factors help classify Rocinha as a favela bairro, or favela neighborhood. Community There are a number of community organizations at work in Rocinha, including neighbourhood associations and numerous NGOs and non-profit educational and cultural institutions. Rocinha is home to most of the service workers in Zona Sul (the South Zone of Rio). In recent years, due to its relative safety in comparison to other favelas, Rocinha has developed tourism-oriented activities such as hostels, nightclubs and guided tours. In September 2017, between 150 and 600 tourists were estimated to visit the slum per day, despite foreign governments' and the Rio police's safety warnings recommending against it. In October 2017, a Spanish tourist died after being shot by the police while visiting Rocinha during a turf war. The slum is controlled by Amigos dos Amigos, although it is often caught in violent disputes among (and within) different criminal organizations. =Police and military operations= In November 2011, a security operation was undertaken where hundreds of police and military patrolled the streets of Rocinha to crack down on rampant drug dealers and bring government control to the neighbourhood. In December 2017, drug kingpin Rogério da Silva, known as Rogério 157, was arrested in Rocinha, in an operation involving 3,000 members of the Brazilian military and police forces. Rogério was wanted on charges of homicide, extortion, and drug trafficking.Dom Phillips, Rio police hail arrest of drug kingpin in 3,000-strong favela operation, The Guardian (December 6, 2017).Dom Phillips & Júlio Carvalho, Arrest of Rio drug kingpin brings fear of power grab – and further violence, The Guardian (December 10, 2017). Rocinha is the largest favela in Brazil and one of the most developed. Rocinha's population was estimated at between 150,000 and 300,000 inhabitants during the 2000s; but the IBGE Census of 2010 counted only 69,161 people. In 2017, The Economist reported a population of 100,000 in an area of 1 km² (250 acres). In literature, film and music Robert Neuwirth discusses Rocinha in his book entitled Shadow Cities. Rio de Janeiro was made the setting for the animation film Rio, where many scenes take place in Rocinha. Also, Rocinha is the setting of the book Nemesis: One Man and the Battle for Rio by Misha Glenny in which he describes the rise and fall of Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes. In 1998, Philip Glass wrote an orchestral piece titled \\"Days and Nights in Rocinha\\". It was meant as a reference to Ravel's Bolero, written for Dennis Russell Davies, to thank him for putting Glass' works on stage. He was inspired by dance music that he heard during the carnival, resulting in a samba-like rhythmical structure with a lot of time signature changes and varieties, such as 14/8, 15/8 and 9/8+4/4. The 2008 film The Incredible Hulk featured aerial footage of Rocinha, showing the large number of intermodal containers repurposed as housing, and included an extensive chase scene filmed in the favela on the ground and across rooftops. It was also featured in the 2011 film Fast Five. In mass media and popular culture thumb Many celebrities have visited Rocinha, including Mikhail Gorbachev (during the Earth Summit of 1992) and actor Christopher Lambert. Some episodes of the Brazilian television series Cidade dos Homens (City of Men) were filmed there. =Video games= *In the 2009 video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, two of main campaign missions and a multiplayer map based on it are set in a Favela of Rio de Janeiro that closely resembles Rocinha. *In the 2015 first-person shooter game Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Rocinha is mentioned as the hometown of the specialist Outrider. *In the 2015 tactical first-person shooter game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, a map called \\"Favela\\" is based on Rocinha.

Arnett's fans originate primarily from Arnett Gardens and its adjoining communities – Jones Town, Craig Town, Hannah Town & Admiral Town. The Junglists, as their fans are known, are very passionate and vociferous about their team and will travel all over the country in support of the team. The Arnett Gardens part of Kingston is popularly known as the Concrete Jungle, hence the nickname of the club. The club won the league in its very first season, 1978.

The Little Sioux River was known as Eaneah- waudepon or \\"Stone River\\" to the Sioux Indians. Its tributaries include the Ocheyedan River, Maple River and the West Fork of the Little Sioux River. The Little Sioux River is integral to the Nepper Watershed Project, a major Iowa flood control and soil conservation program that was introduced in 1947. At Turin, Iowa, the Little Sioux River has a mean annual discharge of 1,761 cubic feet per second.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ia/nwis/uv/?site_no=06607500&PARAmeter;_cd=00065,00060 The Little Sioux Valley was important in the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857, when the Santee Sioux chief Inkpaduta made forays as far downstream as Smithland. The river valley also figures prominently in folklore about the nineteenth century outlaw, Jesse James, who reportedly used the secluded valley, with its wooded ravines, as a hideout and a route north to Minnesota during the 1870s. Geologically, the Little Sioux rises in a region of glacial potholes near the \\"Iowa Great Lakes\\" (Spirit Lake, and East and West Okoboji). It then traverses a rich agricultural region on its way to the Loess Hills, from which it then flows out onto the floodplain of the Missouri River. Through much of its middle course (i.e., from Linn Grove to Smithland) the Little Sioux is a relatively wild meandered stream, with excellent canoeing, camping, and fishing opportunities. However, from Smithland downstream to its mouth, the river has been channelized and environmentally degraded. Flooding of the river is common in early to late spring, as the often-heavy winter snow melts. This has resulted in riparian woodlands of cottonwood trees adjacent to fertile farm ground on the bottomlands. Correspondingly, hunters are rewarded with a bounty of white-tailed deer, rabbits and pheasants during the fall hunting season. Fishing opportunities are best in late spring after flood waters have dissipated. Edible gamefish such as bullhead and channel catfish are frequently caught with nothing more than a hook and worm, with northern pike, walleye, and shovelnose sturgeon also available.

It is currently the only British university institute in continental Europe. History The University of London Institute in Paris is located on the Esplanade des Invalides in central Paris The institute was established by an English woman, Edith Williams, in 1894, with the support of the then British Ambassador, Lord Dufferin. It was originally known as the \\"Franco-British Guild\\", which from 1894 offered classes in conversational English to French students soon to qualify as teachers of English through more theoretical studies. In 1900, French classes were added, aimed at British students spending time in Paris, and thus a unique Franco-British community was created. In the same year, the Guild established itself in the rue de la Sorbonne, opposite the University of Paris. After the First World War the French and British governments, concerned by the lack of understanding between the British and French armies that had become apparent during hostilities, sought means of improving cultural and linguistic links between their countries. The French government founded an Institut français du Royaume-Uni in London (South Kensington), while another British Ambassador to France, Lord Crewe, launched a fund for the creation of a British Institute in Paris. This was to consist of a bi-cultural teaching establishment (the Guild, reorganised and expanded) and a Franco-British student hostel in the international Cité Universitaire, which was eventually opened in 1937 under the name Collège Franco-Britannique. As part of the new British Institute in Paris, the Guild received the support of a number of British universities, including the University of London, as well as forming an integral part of the University of Paris. In addition to facilities for teaching, a library and clubroom were added to the Guild's premises at this time and prominent French and British academics and intellectuals were invited to give lectures. The British Institute left its Sorbonne link to become incorporated into the University of London in 1969. The British Institute was renamed the University of London Institute in Paris in 2005. The Institute worked closely with Queen Mary University of London and Royal Holloway, University of London, who were members of a Consortium established with the Central University in 2004 to create mutual benefits in a number of areas of academic and support activity. From September 2016, Queen Mary University of London took over the functions provided by Royal Holloway and all students are now considered registered students of Queen Mary University of London. Although the Institute began life teaching oral English to the French, it was soon improving the oral French of visiting British students; currently the Institute's teaching centres around its BA courses in French Studies, complemented by a growing portfolio of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in International Relations, Urban Studies, Business, and Law. The English language programme has been discontinued – classes are now provided by the British Council – as ULIP has looked to develop itself as a research-led institute.https://www.britishcouncil.fr/en/english/schools/paris-invalides Today ULIP shares its building with the British Council, which The Independent newspaper has described as a \\"lovely, traditional Paris building, in a great location overlooking the Esplanade des Invalides\\". Its strength is that because it is a relatively small institution it can offer a more intimate learning experience than is available in a larger, more anonymous University. It has the unique advantage of allowing students to study French culture and language in the country itself whilst still offering the student support and quality assurance of a British educational institution. The quality of its degrees is ratified either by the University of London, or by Queen Mary University of London, depending on the programme studied. As a result of these advantages the entrance requirements for students are relatively high (AAB or ABB at A level (or equivalent) for undergraduate programmes and a 2:1 (or equivalent) for postgraduate programmes). 76% of its undergraduate students are women, 24% men; 65% of its postgraduate students are women and 35% are men.UCAS – uk map Academics The Institute's primary programme is a unique 3-year BA degree in French Studies, which can be combined with minors in History, Business, or International Relations. From September 2018, the Institute will also offer a BA in International Politics (taught in English), which can be studied with a minor in French, and with or without a year abroad in a different country.https://digital.ucas.com/search/results?SearchText=paris&AutoSuggestType;=&SearchType;=searchbarbutton&PreviouslyAppliedFilters;=D_0_Undergraduate__D_1_Postgraduate__&filters;=Destination_Undergraduate&ProviderText;=&SubjectText;=&DistanceFromPostcode;=1mi&RegionDistancePostcode;=&SortOrder;=0&CurrentView;=List At postgraduate level the Institute offers a Master of Arts in International Relations and in Urban History and Culture and a Master of Laws.

The Act was repealed on 28 July 1863. (Statute Law Revision Act 1863, section 1 and Schedule) However until 1967 it remained treason under the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 to say that Parliament could not control the succession to the Crown. Some of the wording of section V. of the Treasons Act of 1571 has drawn attention for its description of the legal line of succession. In the twenty-first century, academic scholarship and proponents of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespearean authorship noted the departure of the terms \\"heirs of the body\\" to the introduction of the phrase \\"natural issue\\" to refer to the line of succession, or Queen's heir to the throne: Proponents contend this wording meant that any illegitimate child, or \\"natural issue\\", born to Queen Elizabeth I, would then be legal successor to the monarchy. As of 2016, scholarship continues to debate the implications of the change in the legal language, but agree its inclusion in the Act was meant to prevent a crisis of succession.

In 2002, it was adapted as a documentary of the same title and later released on DVD. The Commanding Heights attempts to trace the rise of free markets during the last century as well as the process of globalization. Yergin attributes the origin of the phrase commanding heights to a speech by Vladimir Lenin referring to the control of perceived key segments of a national economy.. Transcript for Episode One: The Battle of Ideas.Video for Chapter 3: Communism on the Heights [6:16] (Quicktime 5 format).  Overview  The authors take the thesis that prior to World War I, the world effectively lived in a state of globalization, which they term the First Era of Globalization. The authors define globalization as periods in which free markets predominate and countries place few, if any, limits on exports, immigration, imports, or information exchanges. Overall, they see globalization as a positive movement that improves the standard of living for all the people connected to it, from the richest to the poorest. According to the authors, the rise of communism and fascism, not to mention the Great Depression, nearly extinguished capitalism, which rapidly lost popularity. After World War II, the authors note that the work of economist John Maynard Keynes came to be widely accepted in Western economies. Keynes believed in government regulation of the economy, which the authors underline as Keynes' great influence and prestige. The authors consider that the so-called commanding heights were often owned or severely regulated by governments in accordance with Keynes' ideas. The authors then discuss how the political changes of the 1980s ushered in accompanying changes in economic policy. The old trend changed when Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and when Ronald Reagan was elected President of the United States. Both leaders parted ways with Keynesian economics and governed more in the tradition of the works of Friedrich Hayek, who opposed government regulation, tariffs, and other infringements on a pure free market and those of Milton Friedman, who emphasized the futility of using inflationary monetary policies to influence rates of economic growth. In practice, Hayek's policies were applied only selectively, as Reagan's 1986 income tax reforms substantially increased taxes on the lowest quintile of wage-earners but dramatically decreased rates for the upper two quintiles. In contrast to Hayek's ideas, Reagan's policies also continued and expanded tax write-offs, rebates and subsidies for many large corporations. Friedman's monetarism was also abandoned in practice as government-issued debt as a percentage of GDP rose dramatically throughout the 1980s. While Thatcher, Reagan, and their successors made sweeping reforms, the authors argue that the current era of globalization finally began around 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then, they assert countries embracing free markets have prospered on the whole, and those adhering to central planning have failed. While strongly in favor of this trend, the authors worry that globalization will not last. More specifically, they believe that if inequality in economic growth remains high and if Third World nations are not offered the proper opportunities and incentives to support capitalism, the movement will end just as the first era did. The authors place so much emphasis on narrowing economic gaps because they believe, contrary to many of the people who are interviewed, that there is no ideological support for capitalism, only the pragmatic fact that the system works better than any other, as they remark:  International analysis  In the book, the authors examine briefly many different nations and regions and their economic development since World War II. (In the case of industrialized countries, they often begin before the war.) Admitting that the book cannot touch on every single aspect (Yergin remarks that the topic of their book constitutes an entire new academic discipline), the authors make many assertions. = United States = The robber barons were often condemned in the press, but the United States had much more commitment to industrialization and free markets than did other countries in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. Unlike many countries after World War I, the 1920s saw great economic expansion for upper-income individuals and a growth in median income. However, labor unrest continued to mount throughout the 1920s and the 1930s because of the lack of wage and hour rules, child labor protections, unemployment insurance, right to organize, workplace safety requirements, and social security, which all continued to exacerbate the discontents of the substantial numbers of working poor. The Great Depression caused massive unemployment and massive public distrust of corporations and wealthy individuals. In response, the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt went into effect with massive public support. Many lawyers and economists, influenced by Keynes, worked under the New Deal and believed that free markets would lead to disaster without proper regulation. The American economy boomed for about 30 years after World War II with the benefit of Keynesianism, robust antitrust regulation to promote competition and financial regulations preventing the most volatile forms of market speculation, high unionization rates and protections promoting the growth of domestic industry. However, during the 1970s, stagflation was brought on by the 1973 oil crisis and the shift from the gold standard to fiat currency, which discredited the policy consensus that was set in place by the New Deal Coalition. Eventually, Ronald Reagan was elected as president in 1980, and many of the statutes and organizations created by the New Deal were dismantled. = United Kingdom = London was the center of the so-called First Era of Globalization because of the power and resources of the British Empire. However, World War I severely weakened Britain, causing massive unemployment. The United Kingdom successfully held out during World War II and emerged victorious, but the war effectively caused the dismantling of its empire. Winston Churchill was influenced by the work of Hayek and opposed heavy government interference in the British economy. However, the Labour Party, led by Clement Attlee, came to power in force after the 1945 general election and was dedicated to government controls to prevent another economic crisis. The United Kingdom's major industries were nationalized over the following decades (including the Bank of England, electricity, water, natural gas, railways, mining, bus transport, telecommunications, along with large portions of the oil, shipbuilding, aerospace, automotive, and steel industries. Basic human services such as healthcare and university education were brought under government control and made available for free, while rents in the private housing market were regulated and council housing provided homes for around a third of the population by the late 1970s. Meanwhile, practically all occupations and wages were heavily regulated and unionized. The practices became so prevalent that even Conservative governments elected after the initial wave of nationalisations in the late 1940s kept them. However, during the 1970s, massive strikes by unions (see the Three-Day Week and Winter of Discontent) and other economic woes, such as the 1973 oil crisis, almost ground the British economy to a halt. Thatcher, an ardent admirer of Hayek, began privatizatizing industries. While her results were initially mixed, the Falklands War brought on a nationalistic fervor that kept Thatcher in office long enough to keep her reforms in place. Even when the Labour Party later came back to power, it did not attempt to challenge the key principles of Thatcherism. = Soviet Union and Russia = Within a few years of the rise of the Russian Revolution, the Soviet economy went into a major crisis. Lenin responded with the New Economic Policy, a program that allowed limited capitalistic activity, which resulted in what he would call state capitalism, and the economy began to improve. Lenin's commanding heights speech was his attempt to defend himself against accusations that he sold out the principles of the revolution by implementing the new policy. Under Joseph Stalin, the Soviet agricultural and heavy manufacturing sectors were largely centralized. During the 1940s to the 1970s, the Soviet economy grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations. By the 1980s, however, the Soviet economy was in shambles. Because of a lack of incentives and, ironically, a more tolerant central government, workers did not put much effort into their duties. Nonetheless, the Soviet Union continued to build the military even though at times such spending took up half the country's revenue. Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform the economy, but he took only limited steps (see perestroika and glasnost). When he lifted the Brezhnev Doctrine and allowed Poland's Solidarity to usurp that country's communist regime, the entire Warsaw Pact collapsed, soon followed by the Soviet Union itself. However, even with the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the relatively free market- minded Boris Yeltsin, former members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union maintained much power in Russia, blocked free-market movements, and forced the resignation of Yeltsin's free-market allies such as Yegor Gaidar. During the 1996 presidential election, Yeltsin was forced to accept support from Russian oligarchs to counter the growing power of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. While Yeltsin remained in power, the privatization of industries proceeded extremely unequally. = Germany = As had been predicted by Keynes, the hyperinflation caused by the Treaty of Versailles devastated the German economy and created political instability. In addition to widespread unemployment, the hyperinflation effectively wiped out the country's middle class. That environment made it easy for the Nazi Party to gain power. The authors also argue that the Nazis practiced central planning although industries were privatized en masse. After the war and the division of Germany, East Germany came under the rule of the Soviets, and West Germany remained part of the Western powers. When economic conditions in occupied West Germany failed to improve, Ludwig Erhard completely destroyed price controls in 1948 without consulting the occupying powers. Western Germany underwent a fast massive economic recovery, but such free-market reforms were largely confined to that country for many years. By the time of German reunification in 1989, West Germany was an economic power, and East Germany faced many problems because of the collapse of the central planning authority. = India = Unlike Mahatma Gandhi, who supported a village-centric economy, after India's independence in 1947, its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, promoted industrialization. However, he supported government-controlled development and the bureaucracy that developed stifled innovation (the authors of The Commanding Heights sarcastically claim that the British Raj was replaced by a permit Raj). Bribery and delays became common in the Indian economy while many prominent economists studied the country and attempted to finetune its central planning. By the 1990s, the Indian government began to relax these stringent regulations mainly under the influence of Finance Minister and later Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Indian economy bloomed under the effects of exports and outsourcing, and political parties since then have continued to promote those changes. The free-marketer Singh was appointed prime minister when his party won the elections in 2004 although he was not the victorious United Progressive Alliance's stated candidate, and the general expectation was that Sonia Gandhi would take the seat. = South America = Under the influence of dependency theory, a Marxist approach to international economics, many Latin American countries attempted to industrialize by limiting imports of manufactured goods and subsidizing their own industries. However, companies had little incentive to become efficient or innovative in the absence of competition and because of government subsidies. By the 1980s, the economic problems of the countries became obvious, and much of the West's investment was lost. Chile unwittingly became an experiment in free markets when Augusto Pinochet called in followers of Friedman to evaluate the economy, the so-called Chicago boys. The authors argue that the economic reforms proved successful, but since Pinochet was a dictator who came to power in a coup and had many political opponents murdered, the whole idea of free-market reform became linked to fascism. The authors and Friedman claim that the reforms eventually promoted democracy, they acknowledge that the issue and their interpretation of events are extremely controversial. Bolivia was hit with hyperinflation as well. During the 1980s, economist Jeffrey Sachs was sent as a consultant and new President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada reined in inflation in the 1990s by severely cutting government spending. While Bolivia remained a very poor country, the authors argue that it is better off now because its inflation was curtailed. They also argue that Bolivia's example vindicates the bad reputation that free-market economics acquired in Chile as Bolivia's reforms came after a democratic election. = Other countries = The authors argue that Africa's economic development was severely hindered by central planning, socialist ideas, and political dictatorships that promoted warfare and other conflicts. While Japan was seen for many years as an economic success story as late as the early 1990s, the authors argue that its ongoing recession since then resulted from its governments refusal to stop subsidies to many of its industries and companies (the issue is ongoing). Poland's free- market reforms pushed by Solidarity and Lech Wałęsa were initially mixed and criticized by its citizens, but by the late 1990s, the Polish economy was doing much better than other former communist states in the Eastern Bloc. One feature of the Polish economy that makes it different from other capitalistic countries is that it is dominated by small business rather than corporations or conglomerates. China is another major ongoing issue. While Deng Xiaoping, after the death of Mao Zedong, gradually freed the economy, he did not promote civil liberties or other political freedoms, as was demonstrated by his willingness to crush pro-democracy demonstrators. While the authors hope according to Friedman's ideas that free markets would eventually promote a free society, it has not yet happened although China's economy continues to grow.  Documentary  In 2002, PBS aired a six-hour documentary based on the book. This documentary was later sold on DVD and is available to view for free at PBS's website.Each of the chapters, ranging from about 1 to 9 minutes, is available in the Quicktime 5 format (extension .mov) and so it is necessary to have a player that supports that format. One can download them manually and then use a playlist to watch an entire episode without needing to switch for each chapter, or alternatively write a small script to automate the downloads. Episode 1 has 19 chapters, Episode 2 has 21 chapters, and Episode 3 has 23 chapters. The general URL is https://www- tc.pbs.org/media/commandingheights/ch_pPP_CC_qt_300.mov where PP is the episode number (01, 02, or 03) and CC (01-23) is the chapter number. It may not be necessary to have a playlist at all if the player automatically moves on to the next file in the directory in lexicographic order. The documentary is narrated by David Ogden Stiers. Its later date allowed the documentary film to address many of the items that Yergin and Stanislaw missed in their original book, including the collapse of Asian economies, the anti- globalization movement and the September 11 attacks. All told, two of the documentary's six hours (the entire final third) address things that happened since the original book was published. They also include free market solutions to international poverty that was not included in the book, and they interview economist Hernando de Soto, whose book on the subject was not published until after the initial printing of The Commanding Heights. Like the book, the documentary attracted more support and criticism. One example is the anti- globalization movement, which argued they were portrayed unfairly. In the documentary, James Wolfensohn, then President of the World Bank, is interviewed and says that such protesters are attacking people \\"who are devoting their lives to addressing the very questions that these people claim to be addressing\\". The documentary includes a scene of Wolfensohn getting hit in the face with a pie by a protester. Unlike the book, the PBS documentary is far more wary of the possible end of the current era of globalization. For example, they include a parallel between radio stocks of the 1920s and dot com stocks of the 1990s: both were industries built on new technology that had little capital, but fell prey to a market bubble. Likewise, the documentary draws an unsettling parallel between the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the terrorist assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. The documentary is also accused of further oversimplifying the so-called battle of ideas between John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek. For example, in the DVD version, Keynes is named together with Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin as supporters of controlled economies. However, Keynes saw himself as a liberal in both the political party and the economic senses of the term.Keynes sat on the Liberal benches and even Hayek wrote, \\"Keynes believed that he was fundamentally still a classical English liberal and wasn't quite aware of how far he had moved away from it. His basic ideas were still those of individual freedom\\" (in Reason Magazine, \\"The Road to Serfdom, Foreseeing the Fall\\". Hayek interviewed by Thomas W. Hazlett).

He is frequently referred to by his well-known idiolect \\"Panie Kochanku\\" (\\"My Dear Sir\\") to distinguish him from his earlier namesake.:pl:Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł Panie Kochanku Prince Radziwiłł held several important posts in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1752 he was the Master Swordbearer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On 3 August 1757 he was awarded the Order of the White Eagle and was officially one of that decoration's first recipients. From 1762 he was Voivode of Vilnius. In 1767 he became Marshal General of the Radom Confederation and, the following year, Marshal of the Bar Confederation. After its fall in 1772 he emigrated, but in 1777 returned to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and resumed all his previous posts after having first pledged his loyalty to Polish King Stanisław II Augustus, whom he had previously opposed. During the Great Sejm from 1788 until his death in 1790 he was a leading opponent of reform, King Stanisław Augustus and his allies; the members of the so-called Familia political party headed by the Czartoryski family. Radziwiłł was the wealthiest magnate in Poland, in the second half of the 18th century, and one of the richest men in Europe. His private properties and wealth, including 16 cities, 683 villages and 25 counties, both in Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, could have been compared to those of the King himself. Legends about him abounded, and he was featured in historical novels and poems reflecting his contributions to the nation. On one hand, he was pictured as a drunkard and degenerate reveler; on the other, as a flamboyant character, the best representative of Sarmatism in the country, and a great patriot who fought for a free nation, that soon after his death would be partitioned between the Habsburg Monarchy, Prussia and the Russian Empire. He was popular among the poorer nobility and remains today a symbol of his era. The prince owned a house on the Rue Neuve des Bons Enfants in Paris. The street is now called Rue Radziwill. Early life and studies Karol Stanisław was born on 27 February 1734 to General-Hetman Michał Kazimierz \\"Rybeńko\\" Radziwiłł and Princess Urszula Franciszka Wiśniowiecka and spent his childhood in Nieśwież, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was then part of the mighty Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Because of his Polish noble and aristocratic background, he was provided with the best educational services in the country, however, historians often point out that Karol's father complained about the education of his son and accused the governess, tutors and teachers for neglected upbringing. Marcin Matuszewicz wrote in his diary about Karol and his twin brother Janusz: \\"Everything was obvious at once, quite promiscuous education, without any discipline. The infants were mischievous, without manners, nor respect towards the elders and people of higher standards.\\" \\"He studied only when told, but with great dissatisfaction\\" – stated one of the members of the household, who also witnessed Karol's unpredictable and bad behaviour. Karol's most prominent teacher and tutor was Jesuit Mikołaj Kuczewski, who – as claimed by Matuszewicz – could not educate the child properly because of his \\"wilderness.\\" According to Edward Kotłubaj, from 1743 to 1746 Radziwiłł studied at the private Jesuit college in Nieśwież, but after a long illness (smallpox) he did not return to school. In 1739 Radziwiłł, along with his brother Janusz, received from the Palatine of Rhine the Order of St. Hubert and in 1748, while still being a minor, he was officially accepted into the Polish parliament, but he was still not allowed to vote because of his age. The fourteen-year-old son of a Hetman was met with the highest honors, when was appointed one of the deputies of a statesman that took part in the selection of the Speaker of the Sejm. Now allowed to vote and express his viewpoints in the parliament, Radziwiłł strongly opposed the destruction of an army garrison responsible for defending the city of Brest near the river Bug. In 1750 he was chosen to be a member of the Lithuanian Tribunal, representing the city of Pińsk. On April 20, 1751, he was appointed the \\"second colonel\\" of the national forces in the Grand Duchy. He accompanied his father on a trip to Wschowa, where the King of Poland Augustus III signed, on June 7, a parliamentary act. In 1752 Radziwiłł became the Cupbearer of Lithuania. As a member of the Vilnius parliament, in early 1752 he was appointed the Deputy Speaker of the Sejm and in October, during a Parliament sitting, he was promoted to Master Swordbearer of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Marriage, family and disputes =Unsuccessful ties with the Lubomirski family= An early depiction of Karol Stanisław dating from 1758 Throughout his life Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł lived mostly in the Nieśwież area and often visited his numerous estates in the Eastern Borderlands of the Commonwealth. His parents always believed that he would marry young, but Karol had no interest in relationships and love. In 1752 Karol's father, Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł, desperately asked if Isabella Czartoryska would marry his son, but Isabella's father, August Czartoryski, refused believing that the couple was too young and undisciplined. Soon after, Michał Kazimierz began negotiations with Frederick William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, and proposed a marriage between his eldest daughter and his son. Prussian King Frederick II the Great agreed to the proposition as the head of the House of Hohenzollern, however, demanding in return Michał's support for the unfavorable Prussian policy. Eventually the Margrave refused as his daughter, a strong, patriotic, young woman with anti-Polish sentiment refused to convert to Catholicism, the state religion of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Later that year, Michał Kazimierz suggested that his son marries Maria Lubomirska, the only daughter of Governor of Bolimów, Jan Kazimierz Lubomirski and his wife Urszula Branicka, the sister of famous and wealthy Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. Karol himself, was more interested in marrying Teofila Potocka, the daughter of Stanisław Potocki, Voivode of Kiev, and was reluctant to marriage with Maria, but – in this case having the support of his mother – the father after his wife's death (May 23, 1753) led to the engagement, and soon after to the wedding (23 October 1753 in Mościska). The marriage from the beginning was unfortunate, mostly caused by the rivalry of the two families. In 1756, in Lwów, Michał Kazimierz sought to annul the marriage in order to preserve his young son's good mental health and strength. The process continued for several years and, according to Matuszewicz, the dispute concerned only money matters. Eventually Michał Kazimierz asked the Primate of Rome for help and on November 5, 1760, the Vatican annulled the marriage. On the basis of the judgment Radziwiłł was forced to pay Lubomirska 228,000 złotys as compensation for the time and the maintenance of marriage. This tense situation between the two houses, however, brought some good aspects, as from that day Hetman Branicki became a close friend and supporter of the Radziwiłł family. =Effect on behaviour and social status= Karol claimed that the failed marriage turned him into an alcoholic and a vulgar human being, surrounding himself with young adventurers with similar life issues. Following some public, embarrassing and violent situations that Karol encountered on the streets, while being under the influence of alcohol (most notably he became violent in a bar and threw fists at an elderly nobleman of higher status), he found himself under the direct control of his father. However, because of his public functions, he was still protected by the Crown and still highly respected among the civilians and nobility, even though he, even in the parliament, publicly compromised himself by his \\"drunken-foolish\\" conduct and behaviour. For these functions, moreover, he was rather a figurehead or de facto officially did not hold the post at all. Dn. On May 1, 1754, he was appointed major general of the army, and, in the same year, he represented the town of Nowogródek in the parliament. In 1755 as Deputy of Kowno (now Kaunas) he became the Tribunal Speaker from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, however, he strongly neglected his position, and gave the control over to Deputy Marshal Jan Abramowicz, his brother Jerzy and Ignacy Bohusz. The reaction to this \\"Radziwiłł\\" tribunal was the mobilization of the forces of the Czartoryski family, the dominating family of the Grand Duchy, who having won the next tribunal election, replaced Karol Stanisław with Georg Detlev von Flemming (Jerzy Flemming). Subsequently, during one of the tribunal sittings, Karol publicly accused his father of cowardice, because he was not able to stand up against Czartoryski's policy. In 1755 Radziwiłł purchased from Joachim Potocki the city of Lwów and in 1757 he received (personally from the king) the Order of the White Eagle. In 1759, in Warsaw, he received the title of a Prince and a claim on the Duchy of Courland. Inheritance and conflict with Count Brühl Count Heinrich von Brühl, who attempted to imprison K.S. Radziwiłł and deprive him of all titles. =Fortune and jealousy of the royal court= After his father's death (15 May 1762) Karol inherited a colossal fortune (half-brother Hieronim, being still a minor, remained under his care and under his control) and became one of the first \\"celebrities\\" in Poland, after the king, who protected and favoured the Czartoryski family turned against them and instead supported Karol. Initially, Polish-Saxon Minister Heinrich von Brühl (in Poland known as Henryk Bruhl), one of the most loyal people to the monarch, was against the king's decision and hesitated in breaking the ties with the Czartoryskis. Instead, he even tried to imprison Radziwiłł and deprive him of all titles, but he was unsuccessful, because Radziwiłł had previously invested in the support of Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki, a powerful, wealthy and very influential magnate who opposed royal policies and personally hated Heinrich von Brühl. Following this Branicki threatened Brühl that a mutiny would erupt in the east against the king. In June, Radziwiłł went to Warsaw, where he met with Branicki and despite bribing Minister Brühl to regain his position in the Sejm and several estates in the Vilnius region he did not succeed. Upon returning to Nieśwież, Radziwiłł sought to increase the power and influence of small deputy-voting chambers in the Grand Duchy. He wished that the king and his ministers, including Brühl, would take into consideration the votes from the Grand Duchy when introducing new policies and laws. =Help from the East and final resolution= At the beginning of August, under the pretext of receiving the Order of St. Andrew, Radziwiłł secretly sent an envoy to Catherine II the Great, asking her for the protection of his position in the parliament and for the protection of his assets in the G. Duchy and in Poland, if, by any chance, a conflict would erupt between him and the monarch, and the ministers would deprive him of all titles and fortune. On August 24 he became the representative (poseł) of Livonia from Lithuania. Arriving at the parliament in Warsaw, in the company of a large army, possibly sent by Catherine who agreed to help, he made an agreement with Brühl and in October Radziwiłł received the entire province of Vilnius (Województwo Wileńskie), instead giving Eustachy Potocki the city of Lwów, as it was located in Ruthenia and was not part of the Grand Duchy, therefore after Radziwiłł's death, the Potocki family would inherit the city. When, under the influence of the Czartoryski family, Stanisław Poniatowski demanded the removal of Alois Friedrich von Brühl from the Chamber of Deputies, because of not having Polish noble background or heritage, surprisingly Radziwiłł stood in his defense, accusing the Czartoryskis and S. Poniatowski of breaking the liberum veto (\\"golden liberty\\" - freedom policy of the Polish Commonwealth). Politics and rivalry with the Czartoryski family After spending time in the capital, Radziwiłł visited his estates in Wołyń (Volhynia), where he was falsely informed of Hetman Michał Massalski's death. Believing in the message, he sent letters to the Sejm asking if he could inherit the title of a Hetman from Massalski. When he returned in December to Nieśwież, he vigorously began the expansion of Lithuanian voting chambers and in this case sought the support of the royal court, explaining that he was wrongly accused of binge drinking and \\"wild adventures\\" during his stay in Ołyka, while travelling to Nieśwież from Wołyń. In March 1763 he again returned to Warsaw and suggested the reconsideration of changing any laws and policies which coincided with Lithuanian freedom and sovereignty. During this sitting, the members of the Czartoryski family offended and angered Radziwiłł by saying that the Grand Duchy has no right to sovereignty. Radziwiłł later threatened that he would mobilize his forces and invade the Czartoryski estates near Vilnius, but he was unable to do so because of the king, who previously invested in them, and Radziwiłł was afraid that it would anger the royal court. Radziwiłł led a series of unsuccessful attempts to destroy the Czartoryski \\"alliance\\" against him, but he could not have done so because of the Saxon-Russian intervention led by Russian Colonel Puchkov, a close friend of the Czartoryski clan, who brought terror to the Eastern parts of the Commonwealth and was a threat to Radziwiłł's possessions in the eastern parts of the Duchy. On April 18, Radziwiłł made a coalition with other noble families of the Duchy and created a manifesto against the Great Sejm of Poland that considered the secret tribunal sittings in Lithuania illegal and that they should be forbidden. Czartoryski, though without much success, tried to carry out a boycott of the Radziwiłł tribunal. He later announced the formation of a confederation and asked Catherine II to send Russian troops to Lithuania in the hope that they would destroy the tribunal and even perhaps execute its leaders, however, Catherine has decided not to undertake such drastic actions and only sent troops to Ruthenia. Karol Stanisław, after the founding of the national tribunal in Nieśwież that was focused on anti-Russian sentiment, returned to Vilnius and directed his militia troops to Białystok on a conference of the party leaders. Czartoryski tried to convince Russian ambassador Kayserling that Radziwiłł has gone mad and would start a civil war in order to break the Russian-Polish friendship truce and asked if he could convince Catherine to destroy Radziwiłł's plans. On the Nieśwież tribunal, Karol proposed a war against Russia, but the majority of nobles gathered at the tribunal disagreed with him and believed that it would cause a bloodshed. Eventually Catherine II, worried about her popularity among other European leaders, withdrew from the Eastern Borderlands and Radziwiłł emerged triumphant over the Czartoryski family. He increased the influence of his own party and optimistically strengthened the importance of Lithuanian tribunals, proving it to be fruitful for the Commonwealth's economy, as he said in the Polish parliament. He was now considered one of the wisest and most respected men in the country, a man of freedom and Polish sovereignty, however ironically, Matuszewicz noted that at most of the tribunal sittings and political gatherings he was not sober. Death of Augustus III and neglected duties Augustus III of Poland. The death of King Augustus III in 1763 did not change Radziwiłł's obscure behaviour and addiction to alcohol, which now negatively influenced his highly successful policies and political campaigns. Furthermore, ambassador Kayserling demanded his separation from Hetman Branicki. Unlike Czartoryski, who constantly improved and participated in local councils, Radziwiłł neglected his duties, and, on the advice of one of his companions, he concluded several treaties with his closest allies, which eventually resulted in the weakening of his political party and proved to be a harm for the peasants supporting the policies issued by the Lithuanian councils under Radziwiłł's control. As a result, the election of deputies and court marshals were mostly influenced by the Czartoryskis. Radziwiłł, trying to repair his delicate and temporary reputation, travelled to Vilnius and in 1764 he established a new, illegal council and proclaimed himself marshal. The council was mostly focused on diminishing the power of Polish nobility, supportive of the Russian control over the Commonwealth, that resided in the Grand Duchy. The following day, drunk Radziwiłł broke into the home of Countess Anna Tyszkiewicz, and then to the palace of Bishop Ignacy Massalski where he insulted the royal court and humorously threatened to burn the property. The sober prince later apologized to the bishop. Having given up the duties of marshal, in March Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł left Vilnius. He later sent his militia (approx. 300 men) to defend the Polish diplomatic position at the Prussian council in Grudziądz. On April 8, 1764 Radziwiłł married Teresa Karolina Rzewuska, the daughter of Hetman Wacław Rzewuski. Struggle against the Grodno Confederation and exile On April 16, 1764, in the city of Grodno, a General Confederation against Radziwiłł was formed under the control of Michał Brzostowski. It was mostly focused on Radziwiłł's actions against the state and the Confederation believed that he was a threat to the monarchy, rather than a supporter of Polish sovereignty. On May 5 he travelled to Warsaw with his militia (approx. 1,000 men) in order to calm down the court and demand the destruction of the so-called \\"foolish Grodno confederation\\" and the Convocation Sejm. At the meeting in the Royal Castle, Radziwiłł reportedly demanded from Jan Klemens Branicki the use of force as a result of this alliance, however, on May 7 Radziwiłł, together with other leaders of the Republican camp and the Saxon Cabinet, signed a peace treaty and the next day, together with Branicki, left Warsaw with his militia. A few days later he separated from the Hetman, and went to the town of Biała, previously having received 11,000 ducats from the Saxon court. Radziwiłł spent a few weeks in Biała and in late May he sent Michał Pac as an envoy to Dresden and Berlin to discuss the protection of his possessions by the Prussian state and government, but he was unsuccessful. After the royal court in Warsaw heard the news that he was secretly negotiating with Prussia (a political and cultural enemy of the Commonwealth) for his own benefit, the Convocation Sejm ordered the Hetmans (all of the finest generals in the country) to work with the Russian army against Radziwiłł. Furthermore, the royal court wanted to seize all of his estates in the Grand Duchy. Upon hearing the news that the Confederates were seeking the help of the Russian army to capture Nieśwież, Radziwiłł went to Lithuania, on the way defeating the militia and troops of Treasurer J. Flemming in Terespol and partly (probably unintentionally) burning the city. Radziwiłł's victorious militia was eventually defeated on June 26 by the Russian army in Słonim (Radziwiłł himself did not participate in the battle), forcing him to retreat to Wołyń (Volhynia). In July he arrived in Ołyka. After a few days, to the news of the impending Russian army and the nearby forces of Franciszek Ksawery Branicki (a relative and great adversary of Jan Klemens Branicki) Radziwiłł moved towards the Turkish border. On July 14, having passed the Dniester river, the infantry and artillery of Radziwiłł surrendered near the town of Mohylow. He later fled to the Principality of Moldavia; first he was in Ottaka, and then in Soroca. He begged the Moldavian governor and the Ottoman authorities if he could be allowed to travel to Turkish-occupied Hungary, where he wanted to meet with the Jan Klemens Branicki, and asked if his troops and cavalry could station in Soroca. Radziwiłł constantly hoped for a positive change of the political situation in the Commonwealth, and therefore remained loyal to some of the Hetmans, however, he refused military aid for the Confederation of Marian Potocki (August 6), although he expressed sympathy towards his policies. In early September, after receiving permission to travel, he crossed the Hungarian border and took part in a forty-day conference in Transylvania. In the first decade of November, he went to Presov to meet his most trusted friend and military commander, Hetman Branicki. The Grodno Decree and confiscation of estates by the Czartoryski family =Intervention of the competitive opposition= In June, 1764, the Russian troops captured Nieśwież and Słuck. The Grodno Confederation issued a Decree on August 16 stating that Radziwiłł committed many crimes against the government, mostly for his own benefit, and declared him an enemy of the country, and ordered the confiscation of all personal assets and estates, but the death penalty was not mentioned in the document. All past curators, and also the former guardians of Hieronim Wincenty Radziwiłł were imprisoned, and young Hieronim was now under the care of Bishop Massalski, Chancellor Michał Czartoryski and Józef Radziwiłł. Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, if captured, was to be imprisoned in the Słuck fortress. The Decree also deprived him authority of the Vilnius province and questioned the legal basis for the regulations of the Nieśwież province. The document also mentioned the confiscation of Radziwiłł's troops and artillery and requested punishment for numerous supporters of Radziwiłł, primarily on I. Bohusz. Undoubtedly, Czartoryskis' intention was to destroy the enormous fortune that Radziwiłł possessed, and thus stabilize the weak economy of the Commonwealth by selling his assets to foreign investors. The Sejm approved all of the Decrees of the confederation and agreed to confiscate his goods and sell them to his former business partners, who were now his enemies, and furthermore, the document enhanced foreign traders and politicians to also be part of the \\"share\\". Even the normal judicial tribunals, supportive of Radziwiłł's policies, were now in the hands of the Czartoryski family. By doing this, the Czartoryskis rewarded their clients, allies and supporters (especially the Massalski family), antagonizing them against Radziwiłl, who were once his own clients and old friends. Most notably Eustachy Potocki, who loyally supported Radziwiłł in 1763, received the city of Żółkiew. =Radziwiłł, Catherine the Great and request for forgiveness= Radziwiłł lived almost a year in Presov, with the hope of acquiring the protection of the Habsburg Monarchy, France, Turkey, Saxony and Prussia. On August 11, 1764, he wrote to M. Pac to ask him if he could seek the help of the Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, by coaxing her. In the last paragraph of the letter to Catherine, Radziwiłł wrote: \\"Such a great monarch, the brightest lady, Russian Empress. It would be a great honor to seek your protection MY QUEEN, LOVE K. S. RADZIWIŁŁ\\" He even offered to pay the Russian Imperial Court for service. Radziwiłł also remained in contact with some of his supporters in the Commonwealth, mostly near the Turkish-Hungarian border, and often asked them for loans. Initially, many of his adherents accompanied him in exile, but left soon after worried for their reputation. In November, 1764 M. Pac and Stanisław Ferdynand Rzewuski left Presov once in for all leaving Radziwiłł without moral support. Also, his wife, whom he accused of having an affair with Bohusz, left for Warsaw and when she returned to Presov Radziwiłł refused to see her. Later Bohusz, barely defended himself from the attack of Radziwiłł's men. Following this event, Bohusz left Presov and unsuccessfully asked the newly elected king Stanisław II Augustus for forgiveness. Radziwiłł rejected the proposal of the Royal Court of Vienna (August 1765) to return to Poland and to sell his valuable goods to the Habsburg King in return for protection. In early September 1765 Radziwiłł was persuaded by John Baptist Aloy to go to Saxony, in order to get closer to Berlin, and ask for the patronage of Frederick II. In mid-October, he arrived in Prague, but it turned out that the Royal Court of Dresden at the moment does not wish for his arrival. He eventually arrived in Dresden on February 6, 1766. From then on Radziwiłł sent letters to king Stanisław II Augustus and begged him for the final abolition of the Confederation, however, the king, who somewhat favoured Radziwiłł, was under the constant pressure and control of the Czartoryski family. Therefore, his requests were rejected once more. Catherine's aid and return to the country Catherine the Great aided Radziwiłł in returning to Poland from exile. Already in August 1766, through the Saxon government, Radziwiłł came into contact with the newly appointed Russian envoy in Dresden, A. Beloselsky. Beloselsky, which heavily criticized Radziwiłł's poor living conditions in Dresden, also demanded Russian support for him. As a result of declining confidence of the imperial court of St. Petersburg towards the Polish king and Czartoryski, on October 18, 1766 Russian foreign minister allowed the ambassador to engage with Radziwiłł and facilitate his return to the Poland. On October 27 Radziwiłł, with the support of Jerzy Mniszech, turned for protection to politicians Nikita Ivanovich Panin and Nicholas Repnin. In 1767 he renewed the request, promising with his family and \\"friends\\" undying loyalty. At that time, the court of St. Petersburg finally ended the cooperation with the Czartoryski family. Eventually Radziwiłł left Dresden and on May 22 he arrived in the city of Słupsk, having passed the Polish territory with the Russian convoy. On May 25, he entered Gdańsk, where he met with representatives of the Prussian \\"patriots\\" party, discussing with them political matters concerning Prussia and the Elbing-Ermland (now Warmia- Masuria) disputes. According to the court of St. Petersburg Radziwiłł then traveled, bypassing Königsberg, to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Near the border Colonel Karr's troops joined the main convoy. On June 3, he was enthusiastically greeted by the citizens of Vilnius, while entering the city. He then travelled from Vilnius to Białystok to meet Branicki, who a month earlier, in a letter, expressed his joy for the Russian-Prussian demand of \\"restoration of ancient rights and liberties\\", and for \\"oppressed patriots to return to total wealth and prerogatives.\\" On the June 11, in Brańsk, he was elected the Speaker of the newly created by Branicki Podlaski Confederation. Inauguration act of the confederation which called for the defense \\"of faith and freedom\\", was later supported by the Bar Confederation. On 13 June he arrived in Radom. All the time he was accompanied by Col. Karr and his soldiers. He then was appointed the Speaker of the General Confederation and foretold that he would obey all of the demands of Repnin. On June 21, under the command of Karr, Radziwiłł wrote a short letter to Stanisław Augustus, declaring his \\"faithfulness to the king and the Crown\\". On June 23, after the official establishment of the General Confederation in Radom, Radziwiłł was elected its marshal - the same day he sent a letter to Catherine, thanking her for the aid. General Radom Confederation =Struggle against foreign influence= The General Radom Confederation, at the point of its inauguration, cancelled the Grodno Decree of 1764. Radziwiłł received all of his lost titles, however, Repnin kept him under strict surveillance and did not allow him to receive the seized goods and estates until 23 June. Later the General Confederation issued a policy that annulled all the decrees against Radziwiłł and he finally regained his \\"lost\\" fortune. The General Court of the confederation approved on July 13, the acquisition of goods ex possesso from curators rewarded by the Czartoryski family, making an exception for the Massalski family that previously resigned from the position. Radziwiłł, reluctant like the other leaders residing in Radom to Repnin's decision of moving the generality seat and headquarters to Warsaw, tried to dissuade him (On July 21 he even a letter to Rzewuski in this matter), pointing out the alleged danger lurking on the Confederation from the furious and aggressive Czartoryski clan in the capital, as most of the residences and palaces in Warsaw belonged to Czartoryski and the family possessed the largest army reserves in all of Europe. The fear of the \\"Czartoryski army and influence\\" has gone so far that Colonel Karr stated that he prefers to leave everything and flee abroad, rather fight alongside Radziwiłł and declare himself the detainee. Repnin persuaded Karr that under the protection of Catherine II, he is secure in the Commonwealth, and that the allied army of Russia, Prussia and Austria would make Czartoryski \\"crawl\\" on the floor. Additionally, Radziwiłł specifically requested that the Russian infantry would guard his Warsaw residence, rather than the Polish Royal Guard forces of the King. On 27 July Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł left Radom and already 3 days later he sent, from Warsaw to determined Brzostowski, Repnin's list of future members of parliament and specific instructions. After Radziwiłł performed all of the demands, Repnin was convinced that with the help from the \\"East\\" and the help from the Prussian king, the power and influence of the mighty and wealthy Czartoryski family will soon die and with it the entire \\"King Poniatowski\\" era. Although not a member of the political party or the social movement, Radziwiłł soon became the Marshal General of the entire Radom Confederation. In this function, because of the intensifying political atmosphere in the country, he was always obedient to the orders of General Repnin. =Interference of the Imperial Court= As the Imperial Court of St. Petersburg wanted to share the responsibility for the resolution of parliament that was under the heavy influence of the Czartoryski clan, Radziwiłł was forced to bribe or threaten some of the notable members of the family. This took place on October 8 when Radziwiłł, assisted by a small group of soldiers and militia, visited Czartoryski in his palace and pathetically stated that in the name of the ministry and the government he was to prevent him from participating in the Diet. He did the same to the Vice-Chancellor A. Przeździecki. Radziwiłł would then receive from the parliament and the Treasury of the Commonwealth 7,346 Polish złotys. On March 5, 1768, Radziwiłł received the long lost Province of Vilnius. The same day he came to Repnin and thanked him for the aid. Soon after, while under the influence of alcohol, Radziwiłł fought with and accused Col. O. Igelströmow for having slandered him before Catherine II as an alcoholic. On March 10, Radziwiłł left Warsaw in order to sign important and valid parliamentary constitutions in the country and to deliver any documents to the monarch. In the letters to the Polish king, Repnin assured that such documents would not be connected in any way with the Confederation of Bar and that their purpose was to restrain the unhappy \\"society\\" with the new laws, and that it favors seeking to peace in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Radziwiłł arrived on May 30 and signed the newly established constitution. For this Karol Stanisław lost the title of the protector of the Commonwealth and was now to be hated by the peasantry and the upper-middle classes. Once known to be the saviour of Poland, Radziwiłł now was a traitor in the king's eyes. Financial difficulties and debts Despite the difficult financial situation of the Radziwiłł family that was caused by the recent conflicts between St. Petersburg and Warsaw, Karol Stanisław never gave up hope and he soon was to seek a loan from one of the royal courts of Western Europe. Most of all he wished to get the loan from the Saxon royal family, the Wettin dynasty that once ruled Poland, by making weak promises and blandishing Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony. Hoping for favorable judgments of both committees and the Treasury Radziwiłł denied his involvement in any of the Confederations against the Polish king that have occurred. Additionally, he was accused for not paying his taxes on time (some historians suggested that he did not pay his taxes at all). The Commission that was supposed to be held in Lwów, never occurred because of the outbreak of the Bar Confederation. A new \\"anti- Radziwiłł\\" Commission started its operation in Vilnius (Wilno) on June 6, 1768, and ordered the confiscation of any goods and estates. Radziwiłł constantly declaring his loyalty to Repnin, asked for permission to go abroad for medical treatment, but in fact he was to arrive in the Holy Roman Empire and secretly receive money from the royal court. Panin, Repnin and their subordinates did not have the confidence in Radziwiłł (he was usually humiliated by them and often called nicknames like \\"The Bear\\", \\"Coot\\" and \\"Puppet\\") and believed that he would only make the political and financial situation of his family even worse. Already in September 1767 Repnin concentrated his troops towards Nieśwież. In early October 1768 the Tsarist army, already occupying and controlling nearly half the Grand Duchy, moved on Veras and clashed with Radziwiłł's militia and privately owned troops. On October 13 Radziwiłł sent a letter to Repnin, ensuring him that he is innocent and that the militia did not obey his orders and commands. Later Karol Stanisław promised the general that he would go to the Polish parliament in Warsaw in order to sign new documents and treaties concerning his finances. During this hearing of parliament, Radziwiłł was forced by the Lithuanian faction to change his will. The cities of Veras and Slutsk were to be now protected by Russian guards and Radziwiłł's private militia was to be reduced to 560 men. Gathered in Nieśwież, the members of Parliament signed, on October 29, a document that would reduce Radziwiłł's influence on politics. In November he left Nieśwież declaring that he is going to Warsaw, however, he stopped in his estates in Mazovia and from there he sought permission to go to the city of Biała (today Biała-Podlaska). In mid-December, during his stay in Biała, he was forced by royal Königsberg merchant of the Court of Berlin, F. Saturgus, to immediately pay off his family's large debts (including the debts of his deceased father). For this he was to go abroad and sell in the Netherlands, for 150,000 Dutch guilders, any jewels and valuable church ornaments belonging to his ancestors and deceased relatives. Conflict in the Grand Duchy and granted asylum from Frederick the Great =Unexpected Prussian support= Frederick the Great granted asylum to Radziwiłł following his second exile. In early July 1769 the Confederate troops under the command of Casimir Pulaski, his brother Franciszek and Józef Bierzyński entered the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Following this new reforms and laws came into effect that greatly angered the Russian-Saxon faction. Bierzyński quickly seized the majority of Radziwiłł's troops and militia. As soon as the news reached Radziwiłł, he secretly left Biała for East Prussia and arrived on July 20. On July 22, he demanded asylum from Frederick II the Great. His officials in Poland announced that he was going to stay in Saxony with his old stepmother. Frederick II indeed granted him asylum, but was determined to ally Karol Stanisław with Austrian supporters of the Bar Confederation in Silesia. On July 31 he wrote a letter about it to A. Krasiński, T. Wessel and J. Mniszech. Bishop Krasiński, a close supporter of Radziwiłł, was responsible for negotiating peace between the Russian court and the Confederates, however, he was not very successful. Through Prague Radziwiłł came in the last days of August to Cieszyn, where he met with A. Krasiński and discussed political matters. On September 7 he left for Presov in order to later settle (from November 1769) in the nearby town of Sebeș. =Necessary alliances= Radziwiłł was extremely pleased when he found out about the new establishment of the Generality under the leadership of M. Pac and his secretary I. Bohusz, with whom Radziwiłł reconciled after an argument and later promised undying loyalty. Karol Stanisław considered (revealed in a letter to his stepmother from 20 December 1769) Pac a \\"reliable friend\\" and thought that he'd become independent from other conflicted leaders of the Confederation like Krasiński and Wessel who both disagreed with each other. His initiative also attributed the decision to move to the Generality from Bielsko to Presov, and Pac with Bohusz assured him that shortly after he would become \\"one of the leaders of free Europe.\\" Radziwiłł's intellectual level, however, prevented him from playing the leading role in the league, and Pac with Bohusz, despite their alliance with him, were able to maintain their independent status. Initially Karol wanted his militia, who had arrived with General Bierzyński, to focus on the estate in Żmigród and further enlist around 600 men, but with the Russian army approaching he ordered them to withdraw to Muszynka where Józef Miączyński was named commander. To \\"friends\\" in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania he wrote letters calling for the establishment of the Confederation/Generality in those counties and provinces that have not done so. He later sent marshals and officials to break down any resistance that would have occurred. Catherine's warning and temporary Prussian support On February 11, 1770 Radziwiłł received a letter from his stepmother about Empress Catherine, who was planning to confiscate all of his goods, possessions and estates in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in eastern Commonwealth. In May, due to the Prussian intervention, an act against Karol's creditor Saturgus from Königsberg, Radziwiłł surprisingly received a loan from Berlin to pay off any debts. Soon afterwards the financial conflict has been restored, and regardless of what the Russian authorities demanded, the Kingdom of Prussia condemned these actions and considered Radziwiłł an ally, although Frederick II greatly supported the idea of the future First Partition of Poland in order to restore Prussia's former military glory and to commemorate the defeated Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald. Furthermore, Frederick had despised Polish people since his youth, and numerous statements are known in which he expressed anti-Polish prejudice,Polish Western Affairs, Volume 32 Instytut Zachodni 1991, page 114 calling Polish society \\"stupid\\" and stating that \\"all these people with surnames ending with -ski, deserve only contempt\\"Przegląd humanistyczny, Tom 22,Wydania 3-6 Państwowe Wydawn. Naukowe, 1978 page 104 He passionately hated everything associated with Poland, while justifying his hatred with ideas of Enlightenment.Przegląd humanistyczny, Tom 22, Wydania 3-6 Państwowe Wydawn. Naukowe, 1978, 108 He described Poles as \\"slovenly Polish trash\\".Localism, Landscape and the Ambiguities of Place: German-Speaking Central Europe, 1860-1930 By David Blackbourn and James Retallack German and European Studies University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division, page 157 Frederick often compared the peasants of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to aggressive American Indians.\\"Ritter192\\" Polish authors and historians have argued that already during his early days Frederick detested Poles, referring to them in a letter, dating from 1735, as \\"dirty\\" and \\"vile apes\\".Przegląd humanistyczny, Tom 22, Wydania 3–6 Jan Zygmunt Jakubowski Państwowe Wydawn. Naukowe, 2000, page 105 Diplomatic mission of the Confederation =Prague, Presov and audition with Joseph II of Austria= Joseph II of Austria visited Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł during his stay in Presov. In February 1770 Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł agreed to deliver the Confederation's private message to the government of Turkey (then the Ottoman Empire). In late April, on his way, Radziwiłł went to Prague in order to visit his brother and sickly stepmother. The Confederates believed that this was highly suspicious and that possibly he was bribed by Szymon Kossakowski to resign from this diplomatic mission. As soon as those allegations and rumours reached Karol, he sharply reacted by declaring that he is not obliged to listen to anyone's orders and embarrass himself by performing such insane, purposeless and fruitless activities that would not benefit the Ottomans and the Poles, but the Russians instead. The Generality tried to appease him by sending additional money, jewelry and alcoholic beverages. On June 6, 1770 Radziwiłł returned to Presov, where he had a brief audience with Emperor Joseph II of Austria who was staying there for two days, however, the point of this audience and the topics discussed during his visit are unknown to modern historians and theologians. =Ottoman Empire and Sultan Mustafa III= In late July, he again decided to continue his journey to Ottoman Turkey. He requested, however, that this diplomatic mission was to be short, not because he wished to stay away from the Generality and the dangerous or risky politics, but fearing that A. Krasiński might attract the adherents of the Czartoryski family. On September 20 Radziwiłł sent one of his private diplomats from Czernihów province to the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans in order to arrange an anti-Russian coalition - an alliance between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire to repel the Russian aggressors and halt the numerous threats that haunted the inhabitants of the Eastern Borderlands (Kresy) of the Commonwealth and the northern territories of Turkey. Radziwiłł's second goal was to convince Sultan and Caliph of Islam, Mustafa III, to recognize the Czartoryski clan as enemies and to ensure that the upcoming war or conflict would be profitable for both Poland and Turkey. Additional instructions from Karol Stanisław also contained blackening of the opinions of the Generality and M. Krasiński, who attempted to persuade Turkey not to recognize Radziwiłł as the marshal (and even to assassinate him), which would enhance Radziwiłł to take up Krasiński's position. Under pressure from the Generality, Radziwiłł sent a letter to the Vizier recognizing the authority of M. Krasiński and ordering the return of Mr Horwatt. His efforts to raise 15,000 ducats for an unexpected conflict with the Generality was unsuccessful, though he searched for a loan from J. Mniszech and previously from his dear friend and close ally Jan Klemens Branicki. Eventually, in unknown circumstances, the control of the Generality was taken over by the Czartoryski family and Radziwiłł's position as envoy and diplomat was immediately terminated. =Issues surrounding the diplomatic mission= Radziwiłł's costly visit in Sebeș, where he kept the exceptionally well- trained dragoons as bodyguards, that have personally accompanied him to Ottoman Turkey and joined the Confederate in the spring of 1771, lavish lifestyle and hosting or supporting many wealthy, but demanding members of the Generality forced him into ever greater debt, however, Radziwiłł successfully defended himself from selling any personal assets. He rather preferred to increase the debt instead. Upon receiving the news about his stepmother's rapidly deteriorating health, he left in March 1771 for Dresden. Because of the vivid support of the commander of the Prussian army, occupying the Pomeranian provinces in the northern part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Radziwiłł was able to keep the city of Człuchów following his stepmother's sudden death on March 19, 1771. Radziwiłł strengthened the local garrison stationing in the town and ignored several threats from the authorities of Warsaw, that did not recognize the decision. Towards the end of June 1771, Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł returned to Sebeș, but on 1 September, together with the members and diplomats of the Generality, he went to Cieszyn, which was located on the border of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Habsburg Monarchy. He was convinced that through \\"proper alliances with former enemies\\" the Confederation would succeed (such topic was discussed in a letter dating from December 11 addressed to the Castellan of Bracław A. Czarnecki) and was assured that the maintained contacts with several county officials of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania could possibly interfere with the controversial political system of the government in Warsaw. Radziwiłł's support helped to rehabilitate the Generality headed by S. Kossakowski at the beginning of 1772. He also attempted to recruit new units of militia for personal causes. On March 23, 1772, offended by the Confederate Military Council, Radziwiłł announced that he is withdrawing his private militia and decided that the Confederation has no right to control any his private military units. On May 1, 1772, in a letter to commander J. Schütz, Radziwiłł explained that he will recruit even more units and begin preparations for a possible invasion of the Commonwealth, however, he later disarmed the units, which angered and confused many of the hired officers. On May 28 he left Cieszyn and went back to Prague where he met his dear brother Hieronim. From Prague, on June 15, Radziwiłł went to Frankfurt am Main, with the hope of huge financial benefits from the court of Versailles, but his letters to d'Aiguillon and other personalities of the French court, as well as a diplomatic mission led by A. Gietulewicz to the secretary of Prince Charles did not convince the French government. Radziwiłł, however, constantly filled with illusions about political developments and long-lasting alliances, did not give up and still believed in the favors and patronage of the Versailles. Diplomacy within the Holy Roman Empire and succession In Frankfurt, and in the nearby town of Schlangenbad, Radziwiłł spent the first days of October 1772. He then settled in Mannheim, where he was kindly greeted by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria. From there, strongly enhanced by the Confederate emigrants, he arrived in the town of Landshut in Bavaria, where he was one of the most intransigent opponents of instigating a project to reconcile France with the King of Poland Stanisław II Augustus. Through Munich, he returned, at the beginning of 1773, to Mannheim, where he met with the eldest son of his stepmother from her first marriage in order to prepare a testament; his last will where all his possessions would be left to his inexperienced brother Hieronim, and his legal guardian in matters of property was to be Mikołaj. Having secured his fortune Radziwiłł formally refused to get involved in any diplomacy that could directly affect his \\"wealth succession\\", rejecting an offer made in February 1773 by the royal court in Dresden to hand over, following his death, the enormous fortune to the Czartoryski family, and condemned the purposeless actions of the Confederates, who opposed the final testament. Mikołaj's rights to the wealth were eventually accepted by the Poniński's Confederation in 1774 with a statement that he has the right to assume all the goods \\"only ... except those that were lost by Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł during the numerous conflicts with the monarch and were officially acquired by the Commonwealth government\\". In reality, however, the situation during the period of Poniński's Confederation was unfavorable for Radziwiłł and wished to see that the majority of shares would go to the Czartoryski clan or at least the Pro-Tsarist Potocki family, who were in the possession of several large estates in western and central Ruthenia, modern-day Ukraine, and greatly favoured Russian intervention in the politics of the country, especially the family representative, Count Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, who, after the final Partition of Poland, stated that \\"Each true Pole, not blinded by the Prussian and royalist cabal, is convinced, that our Fatherland can only be saved by Russia, otherwise our nation will be enslaved\\". Furthermore, Potocki added that \\"About past Poland and Poles [I don't want to talk anymore]. Gone is this country, and this name, as many others have perished in the world's history. I am now a Russian forever.\\" He was later condemned for these words, but avoided persecution. Journey to France, Italy and Bavaria. Issues with Turkey Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł depicted on a painting dating from the late 18th century. Similar artworks exist, however, each one being unique with showing Radziwiłł either in a different position or wearing different attire. On April 30, 1773 Radziwiłł moved to Strasbourg and in October, he went to Paris (dressed in a French- outfit that he only wore once in his lifetime) in order to receive France's support for a planned trip to the Ottoman Empire in connection with the resumption of hostilities and news about the alleged Turkish decrees in support of the migrating Confederates. Radziwiłł made plans to recruit troops in order to fight on the Turkish side against the Russian-backed Confederation, but instead, he created a separate political alliance, the so- called \\"Radvila Party\\" named after the Radziwiłł family but in the Latin language, that neither had the support of the French nor Russians or the representatives of the Ottoman Empire. Thus he was left without any moral support, which greatly affected his rapidly deteriorating mental and physical health. Radziwiłł imagined that the resources for a possible war would be provided by Turkey alone, and also by the city of Gdańsk in exchange for a promise to develop the Turkish support against the hostile intentions of Prussia to annex northern parts of the Commonwealth with economically important cities and towns such as Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) and Toruń (Thorn), that also had a great cultural significance to the Polish nation. The royal court of Versailles agreed to enlist several officers and diplomats that would be in the service of Radziwiłł's ambassadors in Istanbul, then Constantinople. This enhanced Karol to travel around Turkey with several officials of the Polish Royal Army, including the notable Polish war hero Casimir Pulaski (Kazimierz Pułaski), also named the father of American cavalry. On November 10, 1773 Radziwiłł sent a letter to the Sultan and Caliph of Islam asking him to \\"sign a treaty in order to save his beloved homeland from Russian aggressors, the pro-Tsarist Potocki plague and the adherents of the Czartoryskis.\\" He also requested a loan from the ruler of the Ottomans. A similar letter was sent to the Khan of the Tartars, the Grand Vizier and other Islamic dignitaries, who opposed Russian domination in Europe, as well as the upcoming foreign partitions of Poland. On February 10, 1774 Radziwiłł travelled to Venice, where he arranged a meeting with an adventuress, called Duchess Tatarkova, who presented herself as the daughter of Russian Empress Elizabeth and who would help him in arranging a possible diplomatic relation with the Imperial Court of St. Petersburg. On April 16,1774, having previously sent his court marshal M. Radziszewski to Istanbul, Radziwiłł left Venice and travelled with Duchess Tatarkova to Ragusa, where he arrived on June 30. Despite the ultimate defeat of Turkey and negotiated peace, he stayed there until November 1774 without receiving any loan and salary from the Sultan, to which he demanded Radziszewski to immediately return from his secret diplomatic mission to the Ottoman Empire. Furthermore, the Turkish government advised Radziwiłł to reconcile with Stanisław II Augustus and return to the country not counting on any mediation or additional funding. After returning to Venice, Radziwiłł hoped for more favourable news from Istanbul, however, Radziwiłł later decided to break all ties with the Sultan and on March 22, 1775 he wrote a letter to Catherine II, in which, he recalled his service during the Radom Confederation and tried to justify his lengthy participation in the Confederation of Bar, thus leaving his fate in the hands of the Russian Empress. At the same time he contacted Frederick II the Great and requested further protection. On March 31, at a dinner with Russian officials in Venice, he incidentally met General Orlov, who promised to help him with the ongoing issue concerning Radziwiłł and the Russian Imperial Court that constantly refused to offer protection. In June Karol Stanisław moved from Venice to Bavaria, where he was kindly greeted and accepted by Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria, who remembered the gracious dedication and sacrifice of King John III Sobieski and his loyal troops at the Battle of Vienna. Radziwiłł lived in the town of Moosburg an der Isar, from where he travelled several times to nearby Munich and Regensburg. Opposition to the king and financial demise =As an opponent to Stanisław II Augustus= Prince Michał Kazimierz Ogiński, a member of the Patriotic Party, often cooperated with Radziwiłł.:pl:Michał Kazimierz Ogiński The upcoming autumn Radziwiłł spent in Saxony, however, in December he travelled to the Netherlands. The money sent from the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, mainly from his private estates in eastern Galicia and the Kresy region, were not enough to pay the large debts. Furthermore, the expenses rapidly increased after Hieronim's wedding to Princess Sophie Friederike of Thurn and Taxis, the daughter of Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis and his wife Duchess Auguste of Württemberg. On February 17, 1776, in Moosburg an der Isar, Radziwiłł signed a manifesto protesting against the improper care of Hieronim by Mikołaj Radziwiłł and proclaimed that he shall now be in charge of his higher education that could affect politics and diplomacy of the future heir to the family fortune, and therefore on the destiny of the Radziwiłł clan as well. Encouraged by several magnates, Karol was determined to settle the issues surrounding the confiscated properties by the Polish Crown and wished to regain them from Stanisław II Augustus. At one point he dared to bribe treasurer Antoni Tyzenhauz and threatened to organize anti-royalist party in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which hopefully would attract many former supporters and customers. Radziwiłł also gave him a loan of 2,000 ducats. With offers of assistance and cooperation he also addressed the emerging leaders of the opposition like Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (former opponent), Michał Kazimierz Ogiński, Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Seweryn Rzewuski and Szymon Juda Marcin Korwin-Kossakowski, who all shared an interest in dethroning the king. Radziwiłł and the majority of his advisers hesitated to decide what steps to take and whom to trust among the nobility. On February 18, 1776, he sent letters (from abroad) to the voivodes of the provinces and districts in which he highlighted his sacrifices to improve the political situation of the Commonwealth, begged for the return on assets of the Radziwiłł family and asked to be paid 14 million Polish zlotys as re compensation. He repeated these calls on a larger scale, trying to embrace the Crown and, in the summer of 1776, the members of parliament and smaller sejmiks. Although his sacrifice and patriotism was deeply acknowledged by politicians and officials, the parliament failed to pass a constitution that ensured his safe return to the country, possibly due to his vivid involvement in the Bar Confederation. =Consequences and repayment= Radziwiłł had great difficulty in repaying the debts incurred in Bavaria (30,000 ducats); he was also looking for an overseas cheap credit or loan. In 1776 Radziszewski calculated his overall debt to be over 12 million Polish zlotys. On June 13, 1777 Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, brother Hieronim and his wife arrived in Vienna where they were warmly greeted by Queen Maria Theresa of Austria. On June 28 he came to Żmigród, where he stayed for several months, meanwhile his brother Hieronim stayed in the town of Żółkiew. All of the luggage that Radziwiłł brought with him was firstly transported by the Danube River to Budapest and from there it was sent to Galicia. In October he moved to Żółkiew and in November he was in Lwów. In March 1778 he came to Ołyka, and at the beginning of May to Warsaw, where he was received by King Stanisław Augustus, who demanded his cooperation with Antoni Tyzenhauz and requested that he'd emphasize his loyalty to the Crown. Radziwiłł, in an interview with the king, declared that he will reject the proposal of recruiting, in Poland, several thousand volunteers for the Habsburg Monarchy in connection with the impending Austrian war with Prussia. In May he left the capital. At the end of September he was in Vilnius and, through Grodno, returned to Warsaw for an important sitting of parliament, however, the envoys, members of parliament and the Sejm Marshal requested his immediate removal from the room, where the session took place. Eventually, since his return to the country, Radziwiłł become loyal to King Stanisław II Augustus. Final attempts at reclaiming stolen goods from Catherine Nieśwież Castle has been the seat of the Radziwiłł family for centuries. Throughout his later life, Radziwiłł struggled with the constant financial difficulties and lived with the fear of not repaying his enormous debt. An investigation began in Nowogródek on August 12, 1777, which slowly continued for many years and had no result on the situation. Radziwiłł made ineffective attempts to recover all the estates in the Russian partition of Poland; he was refused to travel to St. Petersburg and was denied permission to visit Catherine II during her travels to Belarus in 1780. Potemkin also denied to help Radziwiłł. Furthermore, he was offered some of those estates by the government of the Russian Empire. Radziwiłł's attempts to receive loans abroad, in the Netherlands, in Genoa and in Germany, were purposeless. Some of his closest friends and supporters promised to develop a loan of 100,000 ducats, however, this also failed. Between 1780 and 1784 Radziwiłł was forced to sell some of his estates in Volhynia (Wołyń) and later the entire city of Żółkiew. Karol Stanisław progressed slowly in rebuilding the Nieśwież residence that was devastated by the Russian forces. He was responsible for resurrecting the local theater and establishing the new repertoire, mainly based on ballet led by renowned ballet masters like G. Pettinati and F. Casella. In 1783 he employed a team of Polish professional actors led by L. Pierożyński. Radziwiłł also hired an orchestra from abroad to play during balls and organized several gatherings, which were attended by the greatest writers, artists and mathematicians of his era. Although he suffered great losses, following his return to Poland, Radziwiłł once more became one of the most influential diplomats in the country. In 1790 he instructed to sell his possessions in the Vilnius region to nobleman and composer Michał Kleofas Ogiński. Last years and death In 1788, upon hearing the news about the outbreak of the Russo-Swedish War, as recalled by King Stanisław Augustus, Radziwiłł once more began to involve himself in the risky politics of foreign nations. Furthermore, without hesitation, Radziwiłł sent his loyal militia, mostly composed of privately financed soldiers and farmers from the estates, to Riga in modern-day Latvia. Subsequently, Karol, together with his close friend Michał Kazimierz Ogiński, planned to organize a pro-Prussian confederation, which would enable Radziwiłł to once more gain control over the Sejm, which opposed the influence of the Russian Empire over the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. During several parliamentary assemblies, the closest supporters of Radziwiłł often boycotted the session by throwing rotten fruit and vegetables at the marshal and other politicians or diplomats that were not showing any affection towards his policies and views or strongly refused to listen to Radziwiłł's sermons about the instability of the country. Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł would personally spit on the robes of the pro- Russian Marshal of Sejm Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha, while he was exiting the chamber. Radziwiłł stayed in Warsaw until March 1789. Having already lost his eyesight, he travelled in the summer for treatment to Wrocław (at that time Breslau) in Lower Silesia. Between August 25 and 27 he was received by the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm II. The financed medical treatment did not show any results and only made the matters worse, eventually leaving Radziwiłł completely blind. In autumn he returned to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where he remained in contact by mail with G. Lucchesini. On March 5, 1790, in a letter addressed to Lucchesini, Radziwiłł stated that he does not believe in the King of Prussia demanding the annexation of Gdańsk and Toruń for a potential alliance with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Suffering from obesity and the after-effects of alcoholism, in the spring of 1790 Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł moved to the town of Biała Podlaska in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, where he died on November 21 leaving no issue to inherit his enormous wealth. Legacy and symbolism Rejtan, the Fall of Poland by Jan Matejko. Jacek Małachowski is engaged in discussion with Samuel Korsak, while below Radziwiłł amusingly observes the situation, pulling his head out. Radziwiłł, although highly disliked by the Polish royal court and the general public in support of the king, was one of the most influential Polish personalities of his era and perhaps the best representative of Sarmatism. Even during his lifetime Radziwiłł became almost a legendary figure, devoted to the country and the nation. Despite his fame, Radziwiłł was often portrayed as a drunkard, whose low intellectual level and severe mental illness caused many misfortunes. Furthermore, the European press have reported and often exaggerated his political \\"wilderness\\" and accused Karol of bragging about his wealth and power. Most of the attacks were from publishers, who were either in support of the Czartoryskis or King Stanisław II Augustus. Radziwiłł's participation in the Confederation of Bar made the public aware of his services to the country and following his sudden death, Prince Karol was hailed the defender of \\"faith and freedom\\". Such opinions were shared by the iconic personalities of the Enlightenment period. Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz stated that Radziwiłł was a \\"citizen with a heart of stone whose sacrifices for the Polish nation were remarkable and unforgettable\\". He also recalled with delight his impressive silhouette of an old Polish senator of the Sigismundian era, the times of King Sigismund III Vasa. Stanisław Augustus, in his private diaries and notes, described Karol as \\"cruel and stupid drunkard who was a victim of improper education and the vile society by which he was surrounded in his youth\\". Radziwiłł was immortalized in Rejtan, the Fall of Poland, an oil painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko, finished in 1866, depicting the protest of Tadeusz Rejtan against the First Partition of Poland during the Partition Sejm of 1773. Both a depiction of a historical moment, and an allegory for the surrounding period of Polish history, the painting is one of Matejko's most famous works, and an iconic picture of an emotional protest. Pantler Horeszko, from the epic poem Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz, was loosely based on Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł.

The word lead may also refer to the largest role in the piece and leading actor may refer to a person who typically plays such parts or an actor with a respected body of work. Some actors are typecast as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and supporting or character roles in others. Sometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play co-leads; a large supporting role may be considered a secondary lead. Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities. Thus, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated for Best Actor or Best Actress -- categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone were each nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for Mutiny on the Bounty. There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Best Supporting ActressActress category; for instance The Godfather's Al Pacino boycotted the 45th Academy Awards ceremony as he was insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor award, noting that he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor winner Marlon Brando and thus he should have received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.Grobel; p. xxi A title role is often but not necessarily the lead. A lead role must also be differentiated from a starring role, which means that an actor is credited as a part of the main cast, but not that he necessarily plays the main character.

His father was a lawyer and former classmate of Hugo von Hofmannsthal and his mother was a distinguished pianist who graduated from the Vienna Conservatoire with the School's Medal of Distinction. At the Conservatoire she was a pupil of, amongst others, Anton Bruckner. However, rather than follow a career as a concert pianist (which would have been difficult to combine with her family life in this period) she became an assistant of Theodor Leschetizky. She also knew Arnold Schoenberg, Gustav Mahler, Hugo Wolf and Johannes Brahms.Eribon, D. A Lifelong Interest London: Thames & Hudson, Rudolf Serkin was a close family friend. Adolf Busch and members of the Busch Quartet regularly met and played in the family home. Throughout his life Gombrich maintained a deep love and knowledge of classical music. He was a competent cellist and in later life at home in London regularly played the chamber music of Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven and others with his wife and his elder sister Dea Forsdyke, a concert violinist. Gombrich was educated at Theresianum Secondary School and at Vienna University, where he studied art history under Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, Julius von Schlosser and Josef Strzygowski, completing a PhD thesis on the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano, supervised by Von Schlosser. Specialized in caricature, he was invited to help Ernst Kris, who was then keeper of decorative arts at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, on his graduating in 1933. In 1936 he married Ilse Heller, a pupil of his mother, and herself an accomplished pianist. Their only child, Richard Gombrich, went on to become a noted Indologist and scholar of Buddhism, acting as the Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University in 1976–2004. Their grandson, Carl Gombrich, was born in 1965 and went on the found the UCL Arts and Sciences degree program in 2010, as well as the London Interdisciplinary School in 2017. Lady Gombrich died in 2006. After publishing his first book A Little History of the World in German in 1936, written for children and adolescents, and seeing it become a hit only to be banned by the Nazis for pacifism, he fled to Britain in 1939 to take up a post as a research assistant at the Warburg Institute, University of London. During World War II, Gombrich worked for the BBC World Service, monitoring German radio broadcasts. When in 1945 an upcoming announcement was prefaced by Bruckner's seventh symphony, written for Wagner's death, Gombrich guessed correctly that Hitler was dead and promptly broke the news to Churchill. Gombrich returned to the Warburg Institute in November 1945, where he became Senior Research Fellow (1946), Lecturer (1948), Reader (1954), and eventually Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition and director of the institute (1959–72). He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1960, made CBE in 1966, knighted in 1972, and appointed a member of the Order of Merit in 1988. He continued his work at the University of London till close to his death in 2001. He was the recipient of numerous additional honours, including Goethe Prize 1994 and Balzan Prize in 1985 for History of Western Art. Gombrich was close to a number of Austrian émigrés who fled to the West prior to the Anschluss, among them Karl Popper (to whom he was especially close), Friedrich Hayek and Max Perutz. He was instrumental in bringing to publication Popper's magnum opus The Open Society and Its Enemies. Each had known the other only fleetingly in Vienna, as Gombrich's father served his law apprenticeship with Popper's father. They became lifelong friends in exile.  Work  Gombrich remarked that he had two very different publics: amongst scholars he was known particularly for his work on the Renaissance and the psychology of perception, but also his thoughts on cultural history and tradition; to a wider, non-specialist audience he was known for the accessibility and immediacy of his writing and his ability to present scholarly work in a clear and unfussy manner. Gombrich's first book, and the only one he did not write in English, was Eine kurze Weltgeschichte für junge Leser (\\"A short history of the world for young readers\\"), published in Germany in 1936. It was very popular and translated into several languages, but was not available in English until 2005, when a translation of a revised edition was published as A Little History of the World. He did most of this translation and revision himself, and it was completed by his long-time assistant and secretary Caroline Mustill and his granddaughter Leonie Gombrich after his death.Leonie Gombrich in the Preface to A Little History of the World New Haven and London: Yale University Press, The Story of Art, first published in 1950 and currently in its 16th edition, is widely regarded as one of the most accessible introductions to the history of visual arts. Originally intended for adolescent readers, it has sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 30 languages. Other major publications include Art and Illusion (1960), regarded by critics to be his most influential and far-reaching work, and the essays gathered in Meditations on a Hobby Horse (1963) and The Image and the Eye (1981). Other important books are Aby Warburg: An Intellectual Biography (1970), The Sense of Order (1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (posthumously in 2002). The complete list of his publications, E.H. Gombrich: A Bibliography, was published by Joseph Burney Trapp in 2000.  Thought  = Psychology of perception = When Gombrich arrived in England in 1936, the discipline of art history was largely centred around connoisseurship. Gombrich, however, had been brought up in the Viennese culture of Bildung and was concerned with wider issues of cultural tradition and the relationship between science and art. This latter breadth of interest can be seen both in his working relationship with the Austrian psychoanalyst and art historian, Ernst Kris, concerning the art of caricatureE. H. Gombrich (with Ernst Kris), \\"The Principles of Caricature\\", British Journal of Medical Psychology, Vol. 17, 1938, pp. 319–342. and his later books, The Sense of Order (1979) (in which information theory is discussed in its relation to patterns and ornaments in art) and the classic Art and Illusion (1960).E H Gombrich. Art and Illusion Princeton:Princeton University Press, It was in Art and Illusion that he introduced the ideas of 'schemata', 'making and matching', 'correction' and 'trial and error'Richter, P. On Professor Gombrich's Model of Schema and Correction British Journal of Aesthetics (1976) 16 (4): 338–346 influenced by 'conjecture and refutation', in Popper's philosophy of science. In Gombrich's view, the artist compares what he has drawn or painted with what he is trying to draw/paint, and by a 'feedback loop' gradually corrects the drawing/painting to look more like what he is seeing. The process does not start from scratch, however. Each artist inherits '\\"schemata\\" that designate reality by force of convention'.Wood, Christopher S, E.H. Gombrich’s ‘Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation’, 1960'' The Burlington Magazine, December 2009 These schemata, plus the techniques and works of previous masters, are the starting points from which the artist begins her own process of trial and error. :\\"This [Popperian description of conjecture and refutation, trial and error] is eminently applicable to the story of visual discoveries in art. Our formula of schema and correction, in fact, illustrates this very procedure. You must have a starting point, a standard of comparison, to begin that process of making and matching and remaking which finally becomes embodied in the finished image. The artist cannot start from scratch, but he can criticise his forerunners\\"Quoted in The philosophical conceptions developed by Popper for a philosophy of science meshed well with Gombrich's ideas for a more robust explanation of the history of art. Gombrich had written his first major work The Story of Art in 1950, ten years before Art and Illusion. The earlier book has been described as viewing the history of art as a narrative moving 'from what ancient artists \\"knew\\" to what later artists \\"saw\\"'.Obituary, Daily Telegraph And as Gombrich was always more concerned with the individual rather than mass movements (the famous first line of The Story of Art is 'There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists'Gombrich, E H. The Story of Art London:Phaidon Press Ltd, ), he saw the use of scientific and psychological explanations as key to understanding how these individual artists 'saw', and how they built upon the traditions they had inherited and of which they were a part. With the dialectics of making and matching, schema and correction, Gombrich sought to ground artistic development on more universal truths, closer to those of science, than on what he regarded as fashionable or vacuous terms such as 'zeitgeist' and other 'abstractions'.Sir Ernst Gombrich OM, Obituary, Daily Telegraph = Renaissance studies = Gombrich's contribution to the study of Renaissance art began with his doctoral dissertation on mannerism. In this he argues that the work of Giulio Romano, at the Palazzo del Tè, was not the work of a decadent Renaissance artist but rather showed how the painter responded to the demands of a patron 'eager for fashionable novelty'Dictionary of Art Historians The four-volume series Studies in the Art of the Renaissance (1966) comprises the volumes Norm and Form; Symbolic Images; The Heritage of Apelles; and New Light on Old Masters, and made a major contribution to the study of symbolism in the work of this period. Gombrich was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci and wrote extensively on him, both in these volumes and elsewhere.Ernst Gombrich  Influence  Gombrich has been called 'the best known art historian in Britain, perhaps in the world'Sir Ernst Gombrich OM, Obituary, Daily Telegraph and also 'one of the most influential scholars and thinkers of the 20th century'.The Essential Gombrich  Criticism  Gombrich was sensitive to the criticism that he did not like modern art and was obliged to defend his position on occasion.Ernst Gombrich He has also been criticised for taking what is now viewed as a eurocentric—not to say neo-colonialist—view of art, and for not including women artists in much of his writing on Western art. His answer to the latter was that he was writing a history of art as it was, and that women artists did not feature widely in the West before the 20th century. He admired 20th-century female artists such as Bridget Riley, whose work was included in a revised edition of The Story of Art. While several works of Gombrich (especially Art and Illusion in 1960) had enormous impact on art history and other fields, his categorical attacks on historism have been accused (by Carlo Ginzburg) of leading to \\"barren\\" scholarship;Ginzburg, Carlo. \\"From Aby Warburg to E.H. Gombrich.\\" In Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method, 43. Baltimore: JHU Press, 1989. many of his methodological arguments have been superseded by the work of art historians like Svetlana Alpers and Michael Baxandall.Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds..

Source and route  The Liri's source is in the Monte Camiciola, elevation , in the Monti Simbruini of central Apennines (Abruzzo, comune of Cappadocia). It flows at first in a southeasterly direction through a long trough-like valley, parallel to the general direction of the Apennines, until it reaches the city of Sora. Liri falls in Isola del Liri In the upper part of Isola del Liri it receives the waters of Fibreno and then it divides into two branches which then rejoin, surrounding the lower part of the town (Isola del Liri stands for Liri Island). One branch makes a high waterfall situated in the centre, a unique case in Europe. A dam is built on the river after the confluence with the Sacco at Ceprano. The last important Liri's tributary is the Melfa, with which it joins near Aquino. After Cassino it receives the waters of the Gari, and afterwards it is known as Garigliano. The Liri-Garigliano system has a total water drainage basin of . History Both Strabo and Pliny tell us that it was originally called Clanis, a name which appears to have been common to many Italian rivers (see for ex. Clanio and Lagni); the former writer erroneously assigns its sources to the country of the Vestini; an opinion which is adopted also by Lucan. cites Strab. v. p. 233; Lucan ii.425.

Accessed 24 Jan 2013. The Liris is noticed by several of the Roman poets, as a very gentle and tranquil stream, cites Horace Carm. i. 31. 8; Silius Italicus iv. 348. a character which it well deserves in the lower part of its course, where it was described by a nineteenth century traveller as a wide and noble river, winding under the shadow of poplars through a lovely vale, and then gliding gently towards the sea. cites John Chetwode Eustace's Classical Tour, vol. ii. p. 320. At the mouth of the Liris near Minturnae, was an extensive sacred grove consecrated to Marica, a nymph or local divinity, who was represented by a tradition, adopted by Virgil, as mother of Latinus, while others identified her with Circe. cites Virgil Aeneid vii. 47; Lactantius Institionum Divinarum i. 21. Her grove and temple cites Lucus Maricae; Greek: , Plutarch Mar. 39. were not only objects of great veneration to the people of the neighboring town of Minturnae, but appear to have enjoyed considerable celebrity with the Romans themselves. cites Strabo v. p. 233; Livy xxvii. 37; Servius ad Aeneidos vii. 47. Immediately adjoining its mouth was an extensive marsh, formed probably by the stagnation of the river itself, and celebrated in history in connection with the adventures of Gaius Marius. About upstream from its mouth, the river passes what used to be Lake Fucino, separated from the lake basin by the mountain ridge of Monte Salviano. The Roman emperor Claudius had a tunnel dug through the ridge in an attempt to drain the lake, which had no natural outlet, to the Liri. The later emperor Hadrian tried to improve the tunnel but, after the fall of the empire, tunnel maintenance was not maintained and it was blocked by silt and debris, allowing the lake to refill. A new tunnel was completed in the 1860s, and the basin of the former lake still drains to the Liri via that tunnel, through the ridge near the town of Avezzano. During the Italian Campaign of the Second World War, the German defenses of the Gustav Line followed the Liri valley.

The modern city of Setouchi was founded on November 1, 2004, by the merger of the former towns of Oku, Osafune and Ushimado (all from Oku District). Its city hall is the former town hall of Oku. The name Setouchi is derived from Seto Inland Sea (in Japanese: Setonaikai). The city faces the Inland Sea on its eastern and southern parts. The climate is moderate. Its main industries are fishery, agriculture, pottery, and sightseeing. History Port Ushimado was a famous port till the early modern era. It served messengers from Korea to the Tokugawa Shogunate. The port is today a good spot for sightseeing and sailing. Osafune was famous for the production of katana in the 12th century under the name of Bizen Osafune (Osafune, Bizen Province). Fukuoka District, which flourished as a trade center and later a political center along the Seto Inland Sea until the beginning of the Edo period, served by the Yoshii River and the Seto Inland Sea, is also included as a part of the city. The Fukuoka Market (Fukuoka no Ichi) was recorded in the scroll Ippen Shonin Emaki, drawn in the 13th century. At the end of the Kamakura period a castle was built in Fukuoka. In the middle Muromachi period, the daimyō who governed Bizen province took this castle as their site, rebuilt and fortified it more than before. Because the Yoshii river changed its course and most of Fukuoka including the castle sank under the river, the castle was abandoned.

Biography Montague was born and brought up in London, the son of an Irish Roman Catholic priest who had left his vocation to marry.Barbara Korte and Ann-Marie Einhaus (eds.) The Penguin book of First World War Stories. London ; New York : Penguin Books, 2007. (pp. 396-7) He was educated at the City of London School and Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford he gained a First in Classical Moderations (1887) and a Second in Literae Humaniores (1889).Oxford University Calendar 1895, Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1895, pp.261, 345. In 1890 he was recruited by C. P. Scott to The Manchester Guardian, where he became a leader writer and critic; while Scott was an M.P. between 1895-1906 he was de facto editor of the paper. He married Scott's daughter Madeline in 1898. While working at the paper, Montague became a supporter of Irish Home Rule. Montague was against the First World War prior to its commencement, but once it started he believed that it was right to support it in the hope of a swift resolution. In 1914, Montague was 47, which was well over the age for enlistment. But in order to enlist, he dyed his white hair black to enable him to fool the Army into accepting him. H. W. Nevinson would later write that \\"Montague is the only man I know whose white hair in a single night turned dark through courage.\\" He began as a grenadier-sergeant, and rose to lieutenant and then captain of intelligence in 1915. Later in the war, he became an armed escort for VIPs visiting the battlefield. He escorted such personalities as H.G. Wells and Bernard Shaw. After the end of World War I he wrote in a strong anti-war vein. He wrote that \\"War hath no fury like a non-combatant.\\" Disenchantment (1922), a collection of newspaper articles about the war, was one of the first prose works to strongly criticise the way the war was fought, and is regarded by some as a pivotal text in the development of literature about the First World War.John Lucas, The Radical Twenties. Rutgers University Press 1999. (pp. 59-60).Peter Buitenhuis,The Great War of Words: British, American, and Canadian propaganda and fiction, 1914-1933. Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1987. (pp. 149–52). Disenchantment criticised the British Press' coverage of the war and the conduct of the British generals. Montague accused the latter of being influenced by the \\"public school ethos\\" which he condemned as a \\"gallant robust contempt for \\"swats\\" and for all who invented new means to new ends and who trained and used their brains with a will\\". He returned to The Manchester Guardian, but felt that his role was diminishing as the years passed. He finally retired in 1925, and settled down to become a full-time writer in the last years of his life. He died in 1928 at the age of 61. Montague was the father of Evelyn Montague, the Olympic athlete and journalist depicted in the 1981 film Chariots of Fire.

The vineyards are located just south of Vienne in the communes of Saint-Cyr-sur-le-Rhône, Ampuis, and Tupin-et- Semons.Inter Rhône: Côte-Rôtie Retrieved 19 January 2010 The vineyards are unique because of the steep slopes facing the river and their stone walls. Côte-Rôtie can be rendered in English as \\"the roasted slope\\" and refers to the long hours of sunlight that these steep slopes receive.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing- Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 127-128 Wiley Publishing 2001 The wines are red, made with Syrah grapes and up to 20% Viognier, a white grape used for its aroma. According to appellation rules, Syrah and Viognier must be fermented at the same time, a process known as cofermentation. Because of this combination, Côte-Rôtie wine typically exhibits an almost paradoxical pairing of meat aromas (including bacon) and floral aromas. Climate and geography Location of the Côte-Rôtie AOC among the major in wine regions of the Northern Rhône The Côte-Rôtie has a continental climate that is very different from the more Mediterranean climate of the southern Rhône. Winters are wet and marked by the cold mistral winds that can last into the spring. During the late spring and early autumn, fog can settle on the vineyards making ripening of the grapes a challenge.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 235-239 Workman Publishing 2001 The wine region covers 202 hectares (nearly 500 acres) along the western bank of the Rhône River near the village of Ampuis. In the Côte-Rôtie, the Rhône flows southwest for . To maximize the amount of sunshine that the vines receive (especially with that fog that often develops near the grapeharvest time), vineyards will more often be planted on the south or southeast facing slopes along this part of the river. The Côte-Rôtie is sub-divided into two main sections of varying soil compositions-The Côte Brune (\\"brown slope\\") in the north on dark, iron-rich schist and the Côte Blonde with its pale granite and schist soil. Erosion is a common viticultural hazard on these steep vineyards. The granite and schist soils are vital in retaining heat throughout the day to protect the vines from the chilly temperatures during the mistral seasons. Stone walls are built around the lands and the hillsides are often heavily terraced to try and counter the issues. Some vineyard owners gather the eroded soils and rocks in buckets and carry them back up the slope to the vines. Grapes and wine Syrah vine. Syrah and Viognier are the two main grape varieties of the Côte-Rôtie. While many of the region's wines are made of 100% Syrah, up to 20% of Viognier can be added to the wine. The wines are often meant to be consumed 5–6 years after vinification but well-made examples can need 10–15 years to fully develop their flavors with some wines having the aging potential of over 20 years. The most distinctive characteristic of all Côte-Rôtie wine is the aroma. The fragrant notes of these wines often include green olives, raspberry, violets, and meaty bacon. Other flavors commonly associated with Côte-Rôtie wine include black pepper, white pepper, blueberry, blackberry, plum, and leather. The vines of the region are very old, with 40 years being an average and some vines being over 100. This produces low wine yields of very flavor-concentrated fruit. Most of the vineyards used for producing Côte-Rôtie AOC are planted on the slopes of nearly 60° incline. The appellation extends to the flatter plateau above the slopes but the wine there is generally of lower quality and is sold with the more generic Côtes du Rhône AOC. Legend has that the two sub-regions of the Côte-Rôtie, Côte Blonde and Côte Brune, were named after the blonde and brown hair colored daughters of a local lord who had two very different personalities. Similarly, the wines of both regions also have different characteristics. Wines of the Côte Blonde are often more balanced, elegant and meant to be consumed earlier. Wines of the iron-rich Côte Brune contain more tannins, are full-bodied and meant to age longer in the bottle prior to being consumed. Traditionally, most Côte-Rôtie wines are blends of grapes from the two sub-regions, incorporating both sets of distinctive qualities. In recent years, more single vineyard designated wines have been produced that emphasize the terroir of that vineyard. Marcel Guigal was an early pioneer in single vineyard bottling.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 186 Abbeville Press 2003 Some of the most prestigious vineyards in the Côte-Rôtie include, La Chatillone, La Chevalière, La Garde, La Landonne, La Mouline, La Turque. =Winemaking= The Côte-Rôtie is one of the few wine appellations that allow white wine grapes to be used in a blend of red wine. (The southern Rhône region Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC is another.) The region was also one of the first Rhône regions to make use of new oak barrels for aging, though the practice did fall out of favor in the late 19th century following the phylloxera epidemic. Négociants revived the practice in the 1980s and today its use varies according to the producer. History Côte-Rôtie vineyards near Vienne The earliest record of viticulture in the region dates to the 2nd century BC when the Romans first encountered the Allobroges tribe whose territory included the regions around Vienne. While winemaking continued to have a long history in the region, the Côte-Rôtie did not receive much recognition until the 18th century when Parisians began discovering the wines of Beaujolais and Rhône. Around the same time, the British also discovered the wines with the purchase logs of John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol providing one of the earliest English records of \\"Côte-Rôty\\" (sic) wine.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 89, 283 & 299 Simon and Schuster 1989 There were added considerations with the transportation of Côte-Rôtie wine, with the region using 20-U.S. gallon (76 liter) amphora-like vases for transport instead of barrels or early wine bottles.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 131-132 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Until a few decades ago, Côte-Rôtie was not a serious competitor to Hermitage, which was the best-known northern Rhône vineyard internationally. Demand for Rhône wines began to grow in the early 1970s, and this growth accelerated from the late 1970s/early 1980s. For Côte-Rôtie it was the wines of Marcel Guigal which gave the appellation increased attention from the early 1980s. This included top marks from international wine critics for Guigal's wines La Mouline and La Landonne. This increase in demand led to new vineyards being created. From 1982 to 2005, the area with planted vines increased from to . The origins of the Côte-Rôtie most famous planting--Syrah --is confirmed to be indigenous to the Rhone valley. Syrah has been genetically shown to be a cross between Mondeuse Blanche and Dureza.Bowers, J.E., Siret, R., Meredith, C.P., This, P. and Boursiquot, J.-.M. (2000).

Condrieu (From the French coin de ruisseau meaning \\"corner of the brook\\")K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 235-240 Workman Publishing 2001 is a French wine-growing Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) located in the northern Rhône, near Vienne and to the south of the Côte-Rôtie AOC. The vineyards are situated in the seven communes of Limony, Chavanay, Malleval, Saint-Michel-sur-Rhône, Saint-Pierre-de Boeuf, Vérin, and Condrieu. These communes are in the French departments of Ardèche, Rhône and Loire on the steep slopes of the foothills of the Massif Central on the right bank of the Rhône. The four southernmost communes can also produce wine under the Saint- Joseph AOC. The wines made in this AOC are exclusively white, from the Viognier grape, which may have originated in the region. Within Condrieu is the enclave AOC of Château-Grillet, producing wines that are also 100% Viognier. The Condrieu AOC was officially created in 1940. History Viticulture in the area around Condrieu has existed since at least Roman times and it is possible that the area was first cultivated by the native Allobroges tribe.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 89 Simon and Schuster 1989 In the 18th century, Condrieu enjoyed a period of popularity as it gained access to the lucrative Parisian market. The wine was transported north by land to the city of Saint-Étienne where the Loire would carry the wine to the Canal de Briare and then to Paris. During periods of peace between France and Great Britain, Condrieu would find its way to the London market.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 283 & 299 Simon and Schuster 1989 For most of the 20th century before the early 1970s, the only northern Rhône wine well-known far from the region was Hermitage, and there was little demand on the export market for Rhône wines. Producing wine from hillside vineyards requires more labour than on flat vineyards, and is therefore economically difficult when demand and prices are low. This was particularly felt by some Rhône appellations in the early post-World War II era, including Condrieu and its neighbour Côte-Rôtie, with the 1950s and 1960s a particularly difficult time. Rhône wines in general started to be more in demand from the early 1970s, and stronger so from the late 1970s/early 1980s. From this time, the négociant business of Marcel Guigal at Ampuis was important in expanding the market for Condrieu wines. Guigal primarily made his name with his Côte-Rôtie wines which then paved the way for his bottlings from other appellations, which also includes a significant portion of white wine. Guigal's Condrieu was sourced from small growers in the appellation. The increase in demand led to new plantations inside the appellation's border, which was far from fully exploited and at one stage included many abandoned vineyards. The area under vine was less than in the 1960s, in 1982, at the end of the century and in 2005.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 132 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Climate and geography As in much of Northern Rhone, the climate of Condrieu is continental and characterized by cold wet winters and hot summers. Ideally situated vineyards are planted on granite soils and face south, which aids growth during the cool months of late spring and early autumn. The well-drained granite soil retains heat during the day and reflects it back to the vines at night. In some areas the soil includes a fine layer of decomposed chalk, flint and mica which is known in the region as arzelle.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 215-216 Dorling Kindersley 2005 The best vineyards have some natural shelter from the fierce northern winds that blow through the region and wreak havoc during flowering. The steep incline of many vineyards introduces the potential hazard of soil erosion.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 192 Oxford University Press 2006 The Condrieu AOC covers more than 500 acres (202 ha)J. Molesworth \\"Vintage Analysis: Northern Rhône 2003 and 2004 \\" Wine Spectator December 06, 2005 of hilly terrain located along a 12 miles (19 km) stretch of the Rhône.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 132-133 Wiley Publishing 2001 The AOC region begins at the town of Condrieu and extends south along the west bank of the river to the town of Limony. Within the AOC is 8.5 acres (3.4 ha) of Château-Grillet, which has its own micro- appellation. Wine A Condrieu wine The only AOC wine permitted in the region is a white wine made entirely from Viognier. The clone of Viognier grown in Condrieu produces low yields of small berries and is less productive than the clones planted in other regions of France, such as the vin de pays wine of the Ardèche department. This contributes to the rarity and expense of Condrieu AOC wine, of which only 30 000 or so cases are produced annually. In the early to mid 20th century, Condrieu producers tended to make wines that were off-dry to sweet but by the end of the century the trend was to produce mostly dry wines. In particularly favourable vintages some producers will make a late harvest wine. Condrieu wine is often characterised by delicate aromatics of peaches, dried fruit and white flowers. Some examples also have notes of anise, star fruit and melons. Often the wine is full bodied and rich in a style that is texturally similarly to Chardonnay. Normally the wine is made dry but the fruitiness and perfume of the bouquet can suggest sweetness. The Viognier grape is naturally low in acidity which challenges growers and winemakers to keep the wine from becoming flabby and bleak. Some winemakers in the region use malolactic fermentation and some do not. The delicate flavors of the wine can be overwhelmed by too much oak during the winemaking process. =Aging= In the wine industry the ability of Condrieu to age is much discussed and opinions differ. Some experts like Master of Wine Mary Ewing- Mulligan believe that it is best consumed within three years of harvest. The Oxford Companion to Wine describes Condrieu as one of the few luxury wines that is meant to be consumed young, typically within two to four years. Wine writer Tom Stevenson recommends drinking Condrieu within four to eight years of harvest and notes that its freshness and purity can be lost as the wine ages. James Molesworth of Wine Spectator notes that some vintages of Condrieu, such as the 2004, will produce more intense, concentrated wines that will age gracefully.  Appellation regulations  Viognier grapes The Condrieu AOC can only be used for still white wines made from Viognier. The planting density must be at least 6 500 vines per hectare, and the base yield is 41 hectoliter per hectare. The grape must reach a maturity giving at least 178 g/l sugar in the must (corresponding to 10.5 per cent potential alcohol) and the finished wines must have at least 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume, but no more than 14 per cent after any chaptalisation. If the wine has more than 45 grams per liter of sugar (only applicable for rare sweet Condrieu wines), it must not have been chaptalised to reach that sugar level.Appellation regulations, version of October 28, 2009 on Légifrance References * Cotes du Rhone Wines Website Category:Rhône wine AOCs Category:1940s establishments in France ","title":"Condrieu AOC"},{"id":"1126759","text":"North East Stars Football Club is a Trinidad and Tobago professional football club, based in Arima, Trinidad, that plays in the TT Pro League.

Château-Grillet is a wine-growing AOC in the northern Rhône wine region of France, near Vienne, which produces white wine from Viognier grapes. The whole appellation, which is only in size, is owned by a single winery, Château-Grillet. The appellation was officially created in 1936.Appellation regulations, version of October 28, 2009 on Legifrance Château-Grillet AOC is effectively an enclave of the Condrieu appellation, which also produces Viognier-only white wines. These appellations are located just south of Vienne in the northern part of the Rhône valley. The production of white wine in the Rhône region is relatively small compared to the red wines. Condrieu and Château-Grillet are the only appellations in northern Rhône that are exclusively white wine appellations. The situation of an AOC (or other official wine designation) owned by a single estate is a situation known as a monopole. There are several other monopole estates in France including Romanée-Conti, La Tâche, La Romanée, Clos de Tart, and Clos de la Coulée de Serrant. The Neyret-Gachet family acquired the Château-Grillet estate in 1830, and the family retained ownership until the estate was purchased by French billionaire François Pinault in 2011. Today, Isabelle Baratin manages the production and sale of the estate's single wine: Vin Blanc de Château-Grillet. Only 10,000 bottles are produced each year. The estate also produces two Brandies: Fine du Château-Grillet and Marc du Château- Grillet. The former is distilled from the Château-Grillet wine while the latter is a pomace brandy. The vineyards stretch over two communes: Saint- Michel-sur-Rhône and Vérin. The vines are situated in terraces on steep granite cliffs surrounding the estate where the soil is lighter and more fragmented than in the Condrieu AOC. The slopes are shaped in the form of a natural amphitheater with south-southeastern sun exposure. The estate's vines average 40 years of age, and as a result produce very low yields. The slim brown bottles of Château-Grillet are easily recognised and are used by no other French winery. Until 1987, 70 centiliter bottles were used, but 75 cl bottles have been used since. Vineyard The Château-Grillet AOC (marked in red) within the Condrieu AOC (marked in green) among other wine regions of the northern Rhone. Château-Grillet is one of the smallest appellations in France, but the area under vine expanded in the 1970s and 1980s (the era when Rhône wines started to see an increase in demand), from in 1971, to in 1977, in 1982 and in 1991, which has remained the vineyard area until at least 2005. This was achieved by actually planting the full area within the appellation border, and this is now practically fully planted to vines. Château-Grillet is sometimes erroneously claimed to be the smallest appellation in France, which is incorrect since several Burgundy Grand Cru appellations are smaller. At the start of the 1970s expansion, Château-Grillet was actually of the same size as Romanée-Conti, but its neighbour La Romanée is only of half as large, or .Burgundy Report: Domaine du Vicomte Liger-Belair Wine style Château- Grillet is by tradition a wine which is intended to be drunk with some maturity, often around 10 years or more from the vintage year. This style has been kept by the appellation's single producer and sets Château-Grillet apart from the Condrieu wines from most producers, or indeed almost all wines produced from Viognier grapes, which are styled to be drunk fairly young and often aims more for opulence. Aromas present in a good vintage Château-Grillet is typically apricot, truffle, and honey on the nose, and apricot, orange and tangerine on the palate. More floral aromas are present on the nose with some aging, typically eight years or more. The fruit aromas associated with Château-Grillet are therefore somewhat different than from those typically found in Condrieu, where pear is often found. Château-Grillet cellars its wines for at least 24 months in a combination of new and old oak barriques. =Appellation regulations= Viognier is the only grape variety permitted for Château-Grillet AOC wines. The Château-Grillet AOC can only be used for still white wines made from Viognier. The planting density must be at least 8 000 vines per hectare, and the base yield is 37 hectoliter per hectare. The grape must reach a maturity giving at least 178 g/l sugar in the must (corresponding to 10.5 per cent potential alcohol) and the finished wines must have at least 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume, but no more than 14 per cent after any chaptalisation. The wines must be dry, with a maximum of 4 grams per liter of sugar.

This is so it can first be compiled to ensure that all required dependencies are present, and possibly tested to show no bugs have been introduced. The daily build is also often publicly available allowing access to the latest features for feedback. In this context, a build is the result of compiling and linking all the files that make up a program. The use of such disciplined procedures as daily builds is particularly necessary in large organizations where many programmers are working on a single piece of software. Performing daily builds helps ensure that developers can work knowing with reasonable certainty that any new bugs that show up are a result of their own work done within the last day. Daily builds typically include a set of tests, sometimes called a \\"smoke test.\\" These tests are included to assist in determining what may have been broken by the changes included in the latest build. The critical piece of this process is to include new and revised tests as the project progresses.  Continuous integration builds  Although daily builds were considered a best practice of software development in the 1990s, they have now been superseded. Continuous integration is now run on an almost continual basis, with a typical cycle time of around 20-30 minutes since the last change to the source code. Continuous integration servers continually monitor the source code control system. When these servers detect new changes, they use a build tool to rebuild the software. Good practice today is also to use continuous integration as part of continuous testing, so that unit tests are re-run for each build, and more extensive functional testing (which takes longer to perform than the build) performed as frequently as its duration permits.

The appellation is the largest in the northern Rhone, and its wines are less highly regarded than those from the nearby appellations of Côte-Rôtie or its near-namesake Hermitage. Most of the wines produced here are red wines made from the Syrah grape, sometimes blended with small quantities of white Roussanne or Marsanne grapes. Some white wines are also made, based on Marsanne and/or Roussanne.Niels Lillelund: Rhône- Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 93-96 History In 1846, a panel of tasters commended the wine for its likeness to Hermitage wines.John Livingstone-Learmonth: The Wines of the Rhône Faber & Faber, London 1992. The appellation was officially defined in 1937 and was expanded in 1952.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 93 Climate and geography While red wines dominate, white wines are also produced. Crozes-Hermitage, along with the rest of northern Rhône has a continental climate that differs from its southern neighbour, which has a more Mediterranean climate. Winters are wet and marked by the cold le mistral winds that can last into the Spring. The appellation is fairly large by Northern Rhône standards, with its 1,238 hectares accounting for approximately half of the entire region's 2,400 hectares. The appellation's boundary begins around 10 km north of Tain-l'Hermitage, extends around the village of Gervans with its south- and south-western granite slopes and then spreads south around Larnage where the land flattens and consists of more clay. Approaching Tain and the village of Mercurol the land rises again and the appellation spreads east. In this region, the soil is mostly rocks, sand and clay. Just south of Tain galets roulés, small surface stones also found extensively in Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the southern Rhône, appear. The southernmost part of the appellation is flat and newly planted. Grapes and wine As with the northern Rhône in general, Crozes-Hermitage produces primarily red wines, with Syrah the only red grape permitted under appellation rules. The rules allow the addition of up to 15% of the white grapes Marsanne and Roussanne. Those two varieties are also used in the white wines in the appellation. The more notable vineyards in Crozes-Hermitage include Les Chassis, Les Sept Chemins and Les Meysonniers. Many of the red wines are relatively light and intended for early drinking, while others will keep and improve in bottle for several years.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 94 =Winemaking= Crozes-Hermitage is notable for the large amount of cooperative wine. Cave de Tain, a large cooperative, takes half of the grapes grown. Another large producer, Jaboulet, takes a lot of the other half, and also owns its own vineyards.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 93-94 Although a small amount of white grapes can be included when making red wines in this AOC, more and more varietal 100% Syrah wines are being made.

However unlike some of the other northern Rhône appellations, Cornas is mostly shielded from the cold le mistral winds that can last into the Spring, and is often the first appellation in the north to begin the harvest.

Grapes and wine Along with most wines produced in the northern Rhône, Cornas is a red wine made from the Syrah grape. No white wines are produced. Any wines designated Cornas AOC will be made from 100% Syrah by law. Although growers could plant different grape varieties in Cornas, the appellation is planted exclusively with Syrah as any wine made from other grapes would have to be sold under a different label, probably Côtes du Rhône AOC and as a result would fetch a lower price. Cornas used to produce wines which required long ageing, but a new more fruit forward style has emerged under the impulse of winemaker Jean-Luc Colombo. Several producers still produce a more traditional style which typically requires 6–7 years in barrel and bottle before it is approachable.

He was the Marshal of the Permanent Council (Rada Nieustająca) in 1778–1782, Grand Clerk of Lithuania from 1773, Court Marshal of Lithuania from 1783, Grand Marshal of Lithuania from 16 April 1791 to 1794. He was an educational activist, member of the Commission of National Education and the initiator and president of Society for Elementary Textbooks. He was an opponent of king Stanisław II August in the 1770s and 1780s, and a major figure in the Polish politics of that era. During the Great Sejm he was a leader of the Patriotic Party and the reform movement and eventually backed the King in many reform projects. An advocate of a pro-Prussian orientation, he helped conclude an alliance with Prussia in 1790. He co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791. Life =Youth= Potocki was born in Radzyń on 28 February 1750 into the influential magnate Potocki family. He was the son of Eustachy Potocki and Marianna Kątska, brother of Jerzy Michał Potocki, Jan Nepomucen Eryk Potocki and Stanisław Kostka Potocki. Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, where he was a student in the years 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied theology and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769. His parents intended for him to join the ranks of clergy, but he refused to follow this path. After traveling through Italy and Germany, he returned to Poland around 1771. On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus' Thursday Dinners. =Political career= As a member (1772–1791) of Poland's Commission of National Education (') – the world's first ministry of education – he was the initiator of and presided over the Society for Elementary Textbooks (', founded in 1775). He presided over the renovation of the Załuski's Library (in 1774). He was involved in the development of numerous projects, such as the history curriculum. In 1781 he reviewed and endorsed Hugo Kołłątaj's work at the Cracow Academy. His involvement with the educational projects earned him a nickname bakałarz (holder of baccalarius degree, teacher). His involvement with the educational reforms lessened only during the era of the Great Sejm (1788–1792), when he became increasingly involved with the wider reform program. Ignacy Potocki by Anna Rajecka On 29 May 1773 he received the office of Great Clerk (Writer) of Lithuania, a relatively low-ranked position that was seen by some as below the magnates of the Potocki family. He participated in the Partition Sejm of 1773, where he sat on several commissions. Seeing himself in opposition to the king, he refused a seat on the Permanent Council that he was offered in March 1774. The king tried to appease him with the Order of Saint Stanislaus on 14 July that year, but that failed to bring Potocki to his side. Instead, Potocki became, for the next decade and half, one of his chief political critics and opponents; on 1776 he went to Moscow to argue, unsuccessfully, for limiting the power of king and the Russian ambassador, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. Later that year, his election to the Sejm was disputed, and the king and Stackelberg managed to block his election. In 1778 however, the growing rift between the king and Stackelberg allowed him to take, through political maneuvering, the chairmanship of the Permanent Council Marshal of the Sejm. That year he also became a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. In 1779 Potocki joined the freemasonry, and by 1780 he advanced to the head of a freemasonry lodge. He became de facto head of the \\"Familia\\", and of anti-royal opposition (succeeding its previous leader, Stanisław Lubomirski, upon his death in 1783). That year also saw the sudden death of his wife. During a trip to Italy and France, in absentia, the influence of the Familia resulted in his appointment to the office of the Court Marshal of Lithuania. He continued to oppose various royal projects at the Sejms of 1784 and 1786. In 1785 he lost some face for his involvement in the Dogrumowa affair, in which the king was falsely accused of an instigation of a poisoning attempt. Disappointed with Russia's lack of support for any serious reforms in Poland, he shifted to favoring an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia instead. Although this resulted in the split of the anti-royalist opposition, he was seen as the leader of opposition (the Patriotic Party) when the Great Sejm begun in 1788. After some initial political manevrouving, the issues of a closer relation with Prussia (that would eventually grew into the Polish-Prussian alliance) and a major reform of the government, both with which he was closely involved, begun accelerating in 1789. At first supportive more of a republican form of a government, political reality (such as royal faction victory at the elections of 1790) resulted in his acceptance of a more constitutional monarchy approach. In 1790, through the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, the king and Potocki begun drifting closer together, working on a draft document that would eventually become the 3 May 1791 constitution. Alongside Poniatowski, Kołłątaj and Piattoli, he is seen as one of the major authors of that document. He supported the quasi-coup d'état in which the constitution was passed on 3 May 1791. On 17 May 1791, he resigned his position in the Commission of National Education to take an appointment (Minister of Police) in the newly created government, the Guard of Laws. From March 1792 he also held the position of Minister of War. During the War in the Defence of the Constitution in 1792, he went on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to Berlin to request assistance from the Prussian government. On 4 July 1792, a sudden depression made him resign his ministerial positions. A vocal opponent of the Targowica Confederation and likely an author of an anonymous anti-Targowica brochure, he was specifically requested by the Russian government to not be involved in the negotiations; he also refused to join the Targowica Confederation, even after Poniatowski's accession to it. =Final years= Following the victory of the Targowica Confederation and the abrogation of the May 3rd Constitution, Potocki emigrated from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, settling in Leipzig. Together with Tadeusz Kościuszko, he proposed a plan for a French-Polish alliance of republics, that was however not met with much support in France. He co-authored a work with Hugo Kołłątaj, On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish Constitution of 3 May (O ustanowieniu i upadku Konstytucji Polskiej 3-go Maja, 1793). Potocki participated in preparations for the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794. In early April he left Leipzig and arrived in Kraków. He was involved in unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations with various foreign powers, in a vain attempt to gain support for the insurgents. During the Uprising he served as a member of the Supreme National Council ('), as a chief of its diplomatic department. Upon suppression of the Uprising, instead of emigrating again, he took part in the surrender negotiations, which gained him respect in many quarters. Eventually on 21 December 1794 he was imprisoned by the Tsarist Russian authorities. He has lost most of his wealth following the Uprising, as most of his estates were confiscated. Near the end of his life he would be troubled by his inability to pay off debts from the 1780s. Released in 1796, following the death of Catherine the Great, Potocki retired to Kurów, Puławy county (central Poland). There he devoted himself to historical studies, publishing several books, translations and commentaries. He also wrote poems, but those were never published during his lifetime. Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works (primarily political brochures). He distanced himself from activists discussing a new insurrection, but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798–1800. In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society. He returned to politics shortly after much of Galicia was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw. During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809. He was buried in Wilanów. He had no direct descendants, his only surviving daughter, Krystyna, (born 1778) died in 1800. His reduced estates were inherited by a nephew, Aleksander Potocki. Remembrance In private life, he is said to have had a weakness for gambling, but he also had a reputation of an honest reformer, who puts the good of the country above his own. He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of 3 May 1791.

Anderson (1840October 26, 1864), known by the nickname \\"Bloody Bill\\" Anderson, was one of the deadliest and most notorious pro-Confederate guerrilla leaders in the American Civil War. Anderson led a band of volunteer partisan rangers who targeted Union loyalists and federal soldiers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. Raised by a family of Southerners in Kansas, Anderson began supporting himself by stealing and selling horses in 1862. After his father was killed by a Union loyalist judge, Anderson killed the judge and fled to Missouri. There he robbed travelers and killed several Union soldiers. In early 1863 he joined Quantrill's Raiders, a group of pro- Confederate guerrillas which operated along the Kansas–Missouri border. He became a skilled bushwhacker, earning the trust of the group's leaders, William Quantrill and George M. Todd. Anderson's bushwhacking marked him as a dangerous man and eventually led the Union to imprison his sisters. When there was a building collapse in the makeshift jail and one of them died in custody and another permanently maimed, Anderson devoted himself to revenge. He took a leading role in the Lawrence Massacre and later participated in the Battle of Baxter Springs, both in 1863. In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders spent the winter in Sherman, Texas, animosity developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri as the leader of his own group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate supporters in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864, Anderson led a raid on the town of Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, his men were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In what became known as the Centralia Massacre, Anderson's bushwhackers executed 24 unarmed Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day which killed more than a hundred Union militiamen. Anderson himself was killed in battle a month later. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, but for others his actions cannot be separated from the general desperation and lawlessness of the time. Early life William T. Anderson was born in 1840 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to William C. and Martha Anderson. His siblings were Jim, Ellis, Mary Ellen, Josephine and Janie. His schoolmates recalled him as a well-behaved, reserved child. During his childhood, Anderson's family moved to Huntsville, Missouri, where his father found employment on a farm and the family became well-respected. In 1857, they relocated to the Kansas Territory, traveling southwest on the Santa Fe Trail and settling east of Council Grove. The Anderson family supported slavery, though they did not own slaves. Their move to Kansas was likely for economic rather than political reasons. Kansas was at the time embroiled in an ideological conflict regarding its admission to the Union as slave or free, and both pro-slavery activists and abolitionists had moved there in attempts to influence its ultimate status. Animosity and violence between the two sides quickly developed in what was called Bleeding Kansas, but there was little unrest in the Council Grove area. After settling there, the Anderson family became friends with A.I. Baker, a local judge who was a Confederate sympathizer. By 1860, the young William T. Anderson was a joint owner of a property that was worth $500; his family had a total net worth of around $1,000. On June 28, 1860, William's mother, Martha Anderson, died after being struck by lightning. In the late 1850s, Ellis Anderson fled to Iowa after killing an Indian. Around the same time, William T. Anderson fatally shot a member of the Kaw tribe outside Council Grove; he claimed that the man had tried to rob him. He joined the freight shipping operation for which his father worked and was given a position known as \\"second boss\\" for a wagon trip to New Mexico. The trip was not successful and he returned to Missouri without the shipment, saying his horses had disappeared with the cargo. After he returned to Council Grove he began horse trading, taking horses from towns in Kansas, transporting them to Missouri and returning with more horses. Horse trading and outlawry Anderson in an ambrotype photograph, early 1860s After the Civil War began in 1861, the demand for horses increased and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them as far away as New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861, Anderson traveled south with Jim and Judge Baker in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had told a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons rather than out of loyalty to the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing loyalty to the Union. One way he sought to prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover. Upon his return to Kansas, Anderson continued horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862, Judge Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront the elder William Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day, the elder Anderson traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. The younger Anderson buried his father and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to a problem with the warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves. On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson returned to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house claiming to be a traveler seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement. The Andersons barricaded the door to the basement and lit the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail. William and Jim Anderson soon formed a gang with a man named Bill Reed; in February 1863, the Lexington Weekly Union recorded that Reed was the leader of the gang. William Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla leader, later claimed to have encountered Reed's company in July and rebuked them for robbing Confederate sympathizers; in their biography of Anderson, Albert Castel and Tom Goodrich speculate that this rebuke may have resulted in a deep resentment of Quantrill by Anderson. Anderson and his gang subsequently traveled east of Jackson County, Missouri, avoiding territory where Quantrill operated and continuing to support themselves by robbery. They also attacked Union soldiers, killing seven by early 1863. Quantrill's Raiders A photograph of William Quantrill, under whom Anderson served in 1863 Missouri had a large Union presence throughout the Civil War, but was also inhabited by many civilians whose sympathies lay with the Confederacy. From July 1861 until the end of the war, the state suffered up to 25,000 deaths from guerrilla warfare, more than any other state. Confederate General Sterling Price failed to gain control of Missouri in his 1861 offensive and retreated into Arkansas, leaving only partisan rangers and local guerrillas known as \\"bushwhackers\\" to challenge Union dominance. Quantrill was at the time the most prominent guerrilla leader in the Kansas–Missouri area. In early 1863, William and Jim Anderson traveled to Jackson County, Missouri, to join him. William Anderson was initially given a chilly reception from other raiders, who perceived him to be brash and overconfident. In May 1863, Anderson joined members of Quantrill's Raiders on a foray near Council Grove, Kansas, in which they robbed a store west of the town. After the robbery, the group was intercepted by a United States Marshal accompanied by a large posse, about from the Kansas–Missouri border. In the resulting skirmish, several raiders were captured or killed and the rest of the guerrillas, including Anderson, split into small groups to return to Missouri. Castel and Goodrich speculated that this raid may have given Quantrill the idea of launching an attack deep in Kansas, as it demonstrated that the state's border was poorly defended and that guerrillas could travel deep into the state's interior before Union forces were alerted. In early summer 1863, Anderson was made a lieutenant, serving in a unit led by George M. Todd. In June and July, Anderson took part in several raids that killed Union soldiers, in Westport, Kansas City and Lafayette County, Missouri. The first reference to Anderson in Official Records of the American Civil War concerns his activities at this time, describing him as the captain of a band of guerrillas. He commanded 30–40 men, one of whom was Archie Clement, an 18-year-old with a predilection for torture and mutilation who was loyal only to Anderson. By late July, Anderson led groups of guerrillas on raids and was often pursued by Union volunteer cavalry. Anderson was under Quantrill's command, but independently organized some attacks. Quantrill's Raiders had an extensive support network in Missouri that provided them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union-controlled territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr. attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City with a number of other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted after the death of his sister, arguing that killing then became his focus, and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that by then killing had become more than a means to an end for Anderson: it became an end in itself. =Lawrence Massacre= A painting of the Lawrence Massacre, in which Anderson played a leading role Although Quantrill had considered the idea of a raid on the pro- Union stronghold that was the town of Lawrence, Kansas before the building collapsed in Kansas City, the deaths convinced the guerrillas to make a bold strike. Quantrill attained near-unanimous consent to travel into Union territory to strike Lawrence. The guerrillas gathered at the Blackwater River in Johnson County, Missouri. Anderson was placed in charge of 40 men, of which he was perhaps the angriest and most motivated—his fellow guerrillas considered him one of the deadliest fighters there. On August 19, the group, which proved to be the most guerrillas under one commander in the war, began the trip to Lawrence. En route, some guerrillas robbed a Union supporter, but Anderson knew the man and reimbursed him. Arriving in Lawrence on August 21, the guerrillas immediately killed a number of Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform (guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers). They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but taking care not to shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, only relenting when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more than any of the other group. They left town at 9:00am after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union- allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping. Texas A painting by George Caleb Bingham depicting General Order No.11, which was prompted by the Lawrence Massacre Anderson around the time of his wedding in Sherman, Texas Four days after the Lawrence Massacre, on August 25, 1863, General Ewing retaliated against the Confederate guerrillas by issuing General Order No.11, an evacuation order that evicted almost 20,000 people from four counties in rural western Missouri and burned many of their homes. The order was intended to undermine the guerrillas' support network in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill's leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County and left for Texas. They departed earlier in the year than they had planned, owing to increased Union pressure. En route, they entered Baxter Springs, Kansas, the site of Fort Blair. They attacked the fort on October 6, but the 90 Union troops there quickly took refuge inside, suffering minimal losses. Shortly after the initial assault, a larger group of Union troops approached Fort Blair, unaware the fort had been attacked and that the men they saw outside the fort dressed in Union uniforms were actually disguised guerrillas. The guerrillas charged the Union forces, killing about 100. Anderson and his men were in the rear of the charge, but gathered a large amount of plunder from the dead soldiers, irritating some guerrillas from the front line of the charge. Not satisfied with the number killed, Anderson and Todd wished to attack the fort again, but Quantrill considered another attack too risky. He angered Anderson by ordering his forces to withdraw. On October 12, Quantrill and his men met General Samuel Cooper at the Canadian River and proceeded to Mineral Springs, Texas to rest for the winter. During the winter, Anderson married Bush Smith, a woman from Sherman, Texas. Anderson ignored Quantrill's request to wait until after the war and a dispute erupted, which resulted in Anderson separating his men from Quantrill's band. The tension between the two groups markedly increased—some feared open warfare would result—but by the time of the wedding, relations had improved. In March 1864, at the behest of General Sterling Price, Quantrill reassembled his men, sending most of them into active duty with the regular Confederate Army. He retained 84 men and reunited with Anderson. Quantrill appointed him a first lieutenant, subordinate only to himself and to Todd. A short time later, one of Anderson's men was accused of stealing from one of Quantrill's men. Quantrill expelled him and warned him not to come back, and the man was fatally shot by some of Quantrill's men when he attempted to return. It is likely that this incident angered Anderson, who then took 20 men to visit the town of Sherman. They told General Cooper that Quantrill was responsible for the death of a Confederate officer; the general had Quantrill arrested. Sutherland described Anderson's betrayal of Quantrill as a \\"Judas\\" turn. Quantrill was taken into custody but soon escaped. Anderson was told to recapture him and gave chase, but he was unable to locate his former commander and stopped at a creek. There, his men briefly engaged a group of guerrillas loyal to Quantrill, but no one was injured in the confrontation. Upon returning to the Confederate leadership, Anderson was commissioned as a captain by General Price. Return to Missouri Anderson and his men rested in Texas for several months before returning to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the border area, Anderson led raids in Cooper County and Johnson County, Missouri, robbing local residents. On June 12, 1864, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and robbing 12. After the attack, one of Anderson's guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in southeast Jackson County, Anderson's group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce to declare that rebels had taken over the area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed hand signals to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas. On July 6, a Confederate sympathizer brought Anderson newspapers containing articles about him. Anderson was upset by the critical tone of the coverage and sent letters to the publications. In the letters, Anderson took an arrogant and threatening yet playful tone, boasting of his attacks. He protested the execution of guerrillas and their sympathizers, and threatened to attack Lexington, Missouri. He concluded the letters by describing himself as the commander of \\"Kansas First Guerrillas\\" and requesting that local newspapers publish his replies. The letters were given to Union generals and were not published for 20 years. In early July, Anderson's group robbed and killed several Union sympathizers in Carroll and Randolph counties. On July 15, Anderson and his men entered Huntsville, Missouri and occupied the town's business district. Anderson killed one hotel guest whom he suspected was a U.S. Marshal, but spoke amicably with an acquaintance he found there. Anderson's men robbed the town's depository, gaining about $40,000 () in the robbery, although Anderson returned some money to the friend he had met at the hotel. =Growing infamy= Jesse and Frank James in 1872, eight years after they served under Anderson In June 1864, George M. Todd usurped Quantrill's leadership of their group and forced him to leave the area. Todd rested his men in July to allow them to prepare for a Confederate invasion of Missouri. As Quantrill and Todd became less active, \\"Bloody Bill\\" Anderson emerged as the best-known, and most feared, Confederate guerrilla in Missouri. By August, the St. Joseph Herald, a Missouri newspaper, was describing him as \\"the Devil\\". As Anderson's profile increased, he was able to recruit more guerrillas. Anderson was selective, turning away all but the fiercest applicants, as he sought fighters similar to himself. His fearsome reputation gave a fillip to his recruiting efforts. Jesse James and his brother Frank were among the Missourians who joined Anderson; both of them later became notorious outlaws. General Clinton B. Fisk ordered his men to find and kill Anderson, but they were thwarted by Anderson's support network and his forces' superior training and arms. Many militia members had been conscripted and lacked the guerrillas' boldness and resolve. In 1863, most Union troops left Missouri and only four regiments remained there. These regiments were composed of troops from out of state, who sometimes mistreated local residents, further motivating the guerrillas and their supporters. The Union militias sometimes rode slower horses and may have been intimidated by Anderson's reputation. On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing stores and tearing down telegraph wires on the way. They had hoped to attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town and took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot the Union horses before reinforcements arrived; three of Anderson's men were killed in the confrontation. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well- equipped soldiers and 650 other men after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson and some of his men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, saying such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men they killed. In early August, Anderson and his men traveled to Clay County. Around that time, he received further media coverage: the St. Joseph Morning Herald deemed him a \\"heartless scoundrel\\", publishing an account of his torture of a captured Union soldier. On August 10, while traveling through Clay County, Anderson and his men engaged 25 militia members, killing five of them and forcing the rest to flee. After hearing of the engagement, General Fisk commanded a colonel to lead a party with the sole aim of killing Anderson. =Missouri River and Fayette= On August 13, Anderson and his men traveled through Ray County, Missouri to the Missouri River, where they engaged Union militia. Although they forced the Union soldiers to flee, Anderson and Jesse James were injured in the encounter and the guerrillas retired to Boone County to rest. On August 27, Union soldiers killed at least three of Anderson's men in an engagement near Rocheport. The next day, the 4th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry pursued them, but Anderson launched an ambush that killed seven Union soldiers. Anderson's men mutilated the bodies, earning the guerrillas the description of \\"incarnate fiends\\" from the Columbia Missouri Statesman. On August 30, Anderson and his men attacked a steamboat on the Missouri River, killing the captain and gaining control of the boat. They used it to attack other boats, bringing river traffic to a virtual halt. In mid-September, Union soldiers ambushed two of Anderson's parties traveling through Howard County, killing five men in one day. They found the guerrillas' horses decorated with the scalps of Union soldiers. A short time later, another six of Anderson's men were ambushed and killed by Union troops; after learning of these events, Anderson was outraged and left the area to seek revenge. Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; although they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together again. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion as they approached the town, even though it had received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry garrisoned in the town quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson. On September 26, Anderson and his men reached Monroe County, Missouri and traveled towards Paris, but learned of other nearby guerrillas and rendezvoused with them near Audrain County. Anderson and his men camped with at least 300 men, including Todd. Although a large group of guerrillas was assembled, their leaders felt there were no promising targets to attack because all of the large towns nearby were heavily guarded. Raid on Centralia On the morning of September 27, 1864, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at the small town of Centralia and proceeded to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated into the lobby of the town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty, unarmed Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war. Anderson ordered his men not to harass the women on the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 () and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the captured Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted to the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods. =Battle with Union soldiers= Anderson arrived at the guerrilla camp and described the day's events, the brutality of which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw a group of about 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops to the top of a hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first volley of Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed. Anderson's men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors. By the end of the day, Anderson's men had killed 22 soldiers from the train and 125 soldiers in the ensuing battle in one of the most decisive guerrilla victories of the entire war. It was Anderson's greatest victory, surpassing Lawrence and Baxter Springs in brutality and the number of casualties. The attack led to a near-complete halt in rail traffic in the area and a dramatic increase in Union rail security. Anderson achieved the same notoriety Quantrill had previously enjoyed, and he began to refer to himself as \\"Colonel Anderson\\", partly in an effort to supplant Quantrill. Sutherland saw the massacre as the last battle in the worst phase of the war in Missouri, and Castel and Goodrich described the slaughter as the Civil War's \\"epitome of savagery\\". However, Frank James, who participated in the attack, later defended the guerrillas' actions, arguing that the federal troops were marching under a black flag, indicating that they intended to show no mercy. =Aftermath= Anderson left the Centralia area on September 27, pursued for the first time by Union forces equipped with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the massacre, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs. Anderson visited Confederate sympathizers as he traveled, some of whom viewed him as a hero for fighting the Union, whom they deeply hated. Many of Anderson's men also despised the Union, and he was adept at tapping into this emotion. The Union soldier held captive at Centralia was impressed with the control Anderson exercised over his men. Although many of them wished to execute this Union hostage, Anderson refused to allow it. On October 6, Anderson and his men traveled to meet General Price in Boonville, Missouri. Price was disgusted that Anderson used scalps to decorate his horse, and would not speak with him until he removed them. He was, however, impressed by the effectiveness of Anderson's attacks. Anderson presented him with a gift of fine Union pistols, likely captured at Centralia. Price instructed Anderson to travel to the Missouri railroad and disrupt rail traffic, making Anderson a de facto Confederate captain. Anderson traveled east with 80 men to New Florence, Missouri. The group then traveled west, disregarding the mission assigned by General Price in favor of looting. Anderson reached a Confederate Army camp; although he hoped to kill some injured Union prisoners there, he was prevented from doing so by camp doctors. After Confederate forces under General Joseph O. Shelby conquered Glasgow, Anderson traveled to the city to loot. He visited the house of a well-known Union sympathizer, the wealthiest resident of the town, brutally beat him, and raped his 12- or 13-year-old black servant. Anderson indicated that he was particularly angry that the man had freed his slaves, then trampled him with a specially trained horse. Local residents gathered $5,000, which they gave to Anderson; he then released the man, who died of his injuries in 1866. Anderson killed several other Union loyalists and some of his men returned to the wealthy resident's house to rape more of his female servants. He left the area with 150 men. Death Anderson's body several hours after he died Union military leaders assigned Lieutenant Colonel Samuel P. Cox to kill Anderson, providing him with a group of experienced soldiers. Soon after Anderson left Glasgow, a local woman saw him and told Cox of his presence. On October 26, 1864, he pursued Anderson's group with 150 men and engaged them in battle. Anderson and his men charged the Union forces, killing five or six of them, but turned back under heavy fire. Only Anderson and one other man, the son of a Confederate general, continued to charge after the others had retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet behind an ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion. Union soldiers identified Anderson by a letter found in his pocket and paraded his body through the streets of Richmond, Missouri. The corpse was photographed and displayed at a local courthouse for public viewing, along with Anderson's possessions. Union soldiers claimed that Anderson was found with a string that had 53 knots, symbolizing each person he had killed. Union soldiers buried Anderson's body in a field near Richmond in a fairly well- built coffin. Some of them cut off one of his fingers to steal a ring. Flowers were placed at his grave, to the chagrin of Union soldiers. In 1908, Cole Younger, a former guerrilla who served under Quantrill, reburied Anderson's body in the Old Pioneer Cemetery in Richmond, Missouri.Browning James A. Violence Was No Stranger (1993). Barbed Wire Press. . In 1967, a memorial stone was placed at the grave. Archie Clement led the guerrillas after Anderson's death, but the group splintered by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas had lost heart by then, owing to a cold winter and the simultaneous failure of General Price's 1864 invasion of Missouri, which ensured the state would remain securely under Union control for the rest of the war. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson's men joined Quantrill's forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters. Legacy After the war, information about Anderson initially spread through memoirs of Civil War combatants and works by amateur historians. He was later discussed in biographies of Quantrill, which typically cast Anderson as an inveterate murderer. Three biographies of Anderson were written after 1975. Asa Earl Carter's novel The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales (1972) features Anderson as a main character. In 1976, the book was adapted into a film, The Outlaw Josey Wales, which portrays a man who joins Anderson's gang after his wife is killed by Union-backed raiders. James Carlos Blake's novel Wildwood Boys (2000) is a fictional biography of Anderson. He also appears as a character in several films about Jesse James. Historians have been mixed in their appraisal of Anderson. Wood describes him as the \\"bloodiest man in America's deadliest war\\" and characterizes him as the clearest example of the war's \\"dehumanizing influence\\". Castel and Goodrich view Anderson as one of the war's most savage and bitter combatants, but they also argue that the war made savages of many others. According to journalist T.J. Stiles, Anderson was not necessarily a \\"sadistic fiend\\", but illustrated how young men became part of a \\"culture of atrocity\\" during the war. He maintains that Anderson's acts were seen as particularly shocking in part because his cruelty was directed towards white Americans of equivalent social standing, rather than targets deemed acceptable by American society, such as Native Americans or foreigners. In a study of 19th-century warfare, historian James Reid posited that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks of the Ottoman Army and Anderson's guerrillas, arguing that they behaved similarly. See also * William Quantrill * George M.

Kołłątay, (1 April 1750 – 28 February 1812) was a prominent Polish constitutional reformer and educationalist, and one of the most prominent figures of the Polish Enlightenment. He served as Deputy Chancellor of the Crown, 1791–92. He was a Roman Catholic priest, social and political activist, political thinker, historian, philosopher, and polymath. Biography =Early life= Hugo Kołłątaj was born 1 April 1750 in Dederkały Wielkie (now in Western Ukraine) in Volhynia into a family of minor Polish nobility. Soon after, his family moved to Nieciesławice, near Sandomierz, where he spent his childhood. He attended school in Pińczów. He began his studies at the Kraków Academy, subsequently, Jagiellonian University, where he studied law and gained a doctorate. Afterwards, around 1775 he took holy orders. He studied in Vienna and Italy (Naples and Rome), where he would have encountered Enlightenment philosophy. He is thought to have gained two further doctorates abroad in philosophy and theology. Returning to Poland, he became a canon of Kraków, and parish priest of Krzyżanowice Dolne and Tuczępy. He was active in the Commission of National Education and the Society for Elementary Books, where he took a prominent role in the development of the national network of schools. He spent two years in Warsaw, but returned to Kraków where he reformed the Kraków Academy, on whose board he sat from 1777, and whose rector he was between 1783-1786. The reform of the Academy was very substantial. It established innovative standards. Notably, he substituted Polish for Latin which till then was used for lectures. The removal of Latin in favour of a national language in higher education was then still uncommon in Europe. The reform proved so controversial that his political enemies plotted successfully to have him temporarily removed from Kraków in 1781, on grounds of corruption and immorality. Although in 1782 the decision was rescinded. =Reforms of the Great Sejm= Kołłątaj Kołłątaj was also active politically. In 1786 he assumed the office of the Referendary of Lithuania, and moved to Warsaw. He became prominent in the reform movement, heading an informal group that was on the radical wing of the Patriotic Party, and labelled by their political enemies as \\"Kołłątaj's Forge\\". As leader of the Patriotic Party during the Great Sejm, he set out its programme in his Several Anonymous Letters to Stanisław Małachowski (1788–1789) and in his essay, The Political Law of the Polish Nation (1790). In his works he advocated a republican-tinged constitutional reform and the need for other social reforms. Among the goals he pursued were the strengthening of the king's constitutional position, a larger national army, abolition of the liberum veto, the introduction of universal taxation, and the emancipation of both townspeople and the peasantry. An organizer of the townspeople's movement, he edited a text that demanded reform and which was delivered to the king during the Black Procession of 1789. Kołłątaj co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791. He also founded the Friends of the Constitution to assist in the document's implementation. In 1786 he received the Order of Saint Stanislaus and in 1791, the Order of the White Eagle. In 1791-92 he served as Crown Vice Chancellor (Podkanclerzy Koronny). During the Polish-Russian war that broke out over the 3 May Constitution, Kołłątaj, along with other royal advisers, persuaded King Stanisław August, himself a co-author of the Constitution, to seek a compromise with their opponents and to join the Targowica Confederation that had been formed to bring down the Constitution. However, in 1792, when the Confederates' won, Kołłątaj emigrated to Leipzig and Dresden, where in 1793 he wrote, with Ignacy Potocki, an essay entitled, On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish May 3 Constitution. =Exile and final years= Kołłątaj, by Jan Pfeiffer, 1810 In exile, his political views became more radical and he became involved with the preparation for an insurrection. In 1794 he took part in the Kościuszko Uprising, contributing to its Uprising Act on 24 March 1794 and to the Połaniec Manifesto on 7 May 1794. He headed the Supreme National Council's Treasury Department, and backing the Uprising's wing of Polish Jacobins. After the suppression of the Uprising in the same year, Kołłątaj was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1802. In 1805, with Tadeusz Czacki, he organized the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Volhynia. In 1807, after the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw, he was initially involved in its government, but was soon excluded from it through the intrigues of political opponents, and soon afterwards, was interned and imprisoned by the Russian authorities until 1808. On his release he found himself barred from public office. Despite that he sought to present a programme for rebuilding and developing Poland in his \\"Remarks on the Present Position of That Part of the Polish Lands that, since the Treaty of Tilsit, have come to be called the Duchy of Warsaw\\", (1809). In 1809 he became a member of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning. In the years 1809-1810 he was once again involved with the Kraków Academy, bringing it back from its temporarily Germanized form. Kołłątaj, Jordan Park, Kraków In his The Physico- Moral Order (1811), Kołłątaj sought to create a socio-ethical system emphasizing the equality of all people, based on the physiocratic idea of a \\"physico-moral order\\". Steeped in the natural sciences, geology and mineralogy in particular, he went on to write A Critical Analysis of Historical Principles regarding the Origins of Humankind, published posthumously in 1842. In this work he put forward the first Polish presentation of ideas of social evolution based on geological concepts. This work is also seen as an important contribution to cultural anthropology. In The State of Education in Poland in the Final Years of the Reign of Augustus III, published posthumously in 1841, he argued against the Jesuit domination of education and presented a study of the history of education. He died on 28 February 1812,\\"forgotten and abandoned\\" by his contemporaries. He was buried in the Powązki Cemetery. Remembrance Despite his lonely death, Kołłątaj became an influence on many subsequent reformers and is now recognized as one of the key figures of the Enlightenment in Poland, and \\"one of the greatest minds of his epoch\\".

They play their home games in Paramaribo at André Kamperveen Stadion to a capacity of 7,100. The team is one of Suriname's most successful, having won their first league championship in 1925, and having won a total of 19, good for second most in Suriname after Robinhood. Transvaal have also won the Beker van Suriname (Surinamese Cup) three times and the Suriname President's Cup twice (1997 and 2008). The biggest international successes were in 1973 and 1981, both resulting in CONCACAF Champions Cup victories. To date, they are the only Surinamese club to win the Champions' Cup (now Champions League). SV Tranvaal were appointed by the IFFHS, as one of the top ten football clubs in CONCACAF of the 20th century standing in fifth position. The club kit manufacturer was Topper (sports). History =Early years= Former logo Founded on 15 January 1921 by Hendrik School students, a middle school in Paramaribo, Suriname, S.V. Transvaal is unusually named after the former province of South Africa, Transvaal Province. It was founded in the same year as two other clubs from Paramaribo, namely Olympia and Ajax. The first three years prior to the foundation of organized football in Suriname, Transvaal played on the Gouvernementsplein in Paramaribo amongst various other clubs, competing in leagues of different associations. 1923 marked the official start of organized football in Suriname, with Transvaal starting in the Tweede Klasse (present day Eerste Klasse), the second flight of football in Suriname. 1923 also marked the inauguration of the Cultuurtuinlaan, the new football facility, built by Dr. E. Snellen, the director of agriculture in Suriname. Transvaal participated in the inaugural ceremony, where they beat Juliana in a 2–0 win. Transvaal remained tenants of the Cultuurtuinlaan for the next 30 years until completion of the National Stadium. In 1924, Transvaal won their first title, winning the Tweede Klasse undefeated in its maiden season. The club were able to win all six matches played, earning 12 points in the competition, and scoring 16 goals while conceding none. It was the first time a team had gone undefeated or played a season without conceding any goals. Transvaal were subsequently promoted to the SVB Hoofdklasse, the top flight of football in Suriname, after only one season in the second tier. In 1925, SV Transvaal won their second consecutive title and first national championship, winning the Hoofdklasse in its third season. After a period of dominance by Ajax and Cicerone, Transvaal won the title once more in 1937. That same year the SVB organized their first trip to Brazil, with Transvaal player Waldy Goedhart joining the national team to play exhibition matches against Tuna Luso, Paysandu and Remo. On 28 March 1947 matches were played at night in Suriname for the first time, with light fixtures assembled at the Cultuurtuinlaan, the matches played on that night were NAKS vs. Robinhood at 19:00 and Transvaal vs. Paramaribo at 20:00. Key players of the forties and fifties include Tjokrosendjojo Kamsoe, Ronald Breinburg and Walther Braithwaite, who would later become manager of the club. =Rise to dominance= The 1960s marked a decade of success for Transvaal, winning 7 out of 10 titles beginning in 1962, only conceding the 1961 and 1963 titles to Leo Victor and the 1964 edition to Robinhood. The team was managed by André Kamperveen, one of the country's most famous players and Transvaal's most famous managers, who had taken over the position in 1958. In 1967 he was succeeded by Ronald Kolf who helped Transvaal to two national titles before relinquishing the position to Jules Lagadeau. Both Kolf and Lagadeau earned their stripes as players on the pitch prior to taking their respective managerial roles. Transvaal boasted some of the country's best players at the time, with players such as Edwin Schal, Iwan Fränkel, Harald Reumel, Roy Vanenburg and Armand Sahadewsing. Matches against Brazilian clubs (1960–1967) Throughout the 1960s the SVB organized friendly tournaments and exhibition matches with the Suriname national team and invited clubs from Brazil to partake. Aside from the national team, clubs from the Hoofdklasse were invited to participate as well, including Transvaal, Robinhood and Leo Victor. In 1962 Transvaal participated in the first edition of the Paramaribo Cup. They played Fortaleza, losing 2–1 to the visiting team from Brazil. On 10 April 1962 they played Santa Cruz from Brazil, losing 2–1 as well. The 1964 edition of the Paramaribo Cup saw Transvaal losing to visitors Botafogo from Brazil in a 4–1 loss. Apart from a 4–0 win against Olaria, Transvaal were unable to secure any wins in the series. =Match results= \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- =1968: First trip to Europe= In 1968, Transvaal travelled to Europe for the first time, scheduling games in the Netherlands and Belgium, against Dutch Eredivisie clubs Sparta, Ajax, Elinkwijk, AZ'67 and NAC, and against Belgian Pro League side Royal Antwerp. Transvaal were able to secure 4 wins, and 1 draw only losing to Ajax on their tour. Tour results \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- \\\\---- =1968 CONCACAF Champions' Cup= In 1968, Transvaal participated in their first Continental tournament, qualifying for the 1968 CONCACAF Champions' Cup. The team were able to make it to the final in their first berth in the competition, defeating Scherpenheuvel from the Netherlands Antilles 4–2 on aggregate score and Aurora from Guatemala 3–1 on aggregate score in the process thus qualifying for the finals. The final against Toluca from Mexico however never happened due to a brawl that had ensued after the final match against Aurora when supporters from both clubs had invaded the pitch. Transvaal were disqualified for disorderly conduct. In 1969, Flamengo from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil came to Paramaribo to play pre-season friendly matches against Robinhood and Transvaal at the National Stadium. Brazilian International Garrincha was playing for Flamengo at the time. While Robinhood lost the first match 3–1 to the visitors, Transvaal were able to secure a 3–2 win against the visiting team. \\\\---- =1971: Pelé's 1000th match= On 27 January 1971, O Rei himself Pelé and Santos F.C. from Santos, São Paulo came to Suriname to play Transvaal at the National Stadion. The match on 28 January 1971 was of historic significance as it was the 1000th career match played by Pelé. The Transvaal line-up included Emile Barron, Nortan, Gesser, Sordam, Boschman, Lagadeau, Bundel, Vanenburg, Schal, Brammerloo and Klimsop, while Santos line-up for the match included Cejos. Lima, Ramon Delgodo, Olando, Hildo Leo, Mene, Arken, Pi Colé, Pelé and Edu. Santos won the match 4–1 against Transvaal. \\\\---- In 1972, Edwin 'Wiene' Schal became the first Transvaal player to be called up for the CONCACAF All-Star team, considered to be one of the top players in the confederation at the time. =1973 Season: Highest accolades= The team from the 1973 CONCACAF Champions' Cup, at the National Stadion in Paramaribo Showing steady improvement by each season, the 1973 season proved to be Transvaal's most successful to date. Under guidance of Jules Lagadeau, Transvaal went on to win the national title undefeated also winning the country's first ever CONCACAF Champions' Cup following the withdrawal of both Costa Rican clubs Alajuelense and Saprissa. Accolades of the 1973 season include: * Undefeated champions of the SVB Hoofdklasse. * Undefeated champions in the SVB Junior League (youth team). * Undefeated champions in the Sterrentoernooi (English, Stars Tournament). * Undefeated champions of the Caribbean region (CFU). * Undefeated winners of the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. * Edwin 'Wiene' Schal finished as top scorer of the Hoofdklasse with 20 goals. * Dennis van la Parra finished as top scorer of the Junior League. * Imro Pengel wins Surinamese Goalkeeper of the Year, having conceded the fewest goals. * Ricardo Sylvester wins Surinamese Goalkeeper of the Year in the Junior League. * Dutch footballer and Transvaal striker Theo Klein is voted Surinamese Footballer of the Year. * Match of the Year: Robinhood vs. Transvaal ended in a 1–1 draw with Transvaal winning 4–2 on penalties The Transvaal first team players who contributed to the 1973 season were Wiene Schal (captain), Castillion, Theo Klein, Wensley Bundel, Gesser, Pauli Corte, Headly, Roy Vanenburg, Nortan, Del Prado, Lagadeau, Sordam, Monsanto, Grootfaam, Schenkers, Anches and Boschman. The manager of the club in 1973 was Jules Lagadeau. To this date no club in Suriname have been able to match the success of Transvaal in the 1973 season. =1981 Season: The Golden Age= By 1981, Transvaal had become one of the most successful sides in Surinamese football. They had amassed 14 league titles already and held the only CONCACAF Champions League win for a Surinamese side back in 1971. With this season they would add their most recent international triumph over none other than Atlético Marte of El Salvador. The 1981 CONCACAF Champions' Cup final took place in the city of Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname. According to former players, the onset of civil war in El Salvador was the reason CONCACAF decided to hold both games in the Andre Kamperveen Stadion in Suriname. The first game was played with great difficulty. \\"The lawn was ugly [for lack of rain] and affected both teams,\\" says Wensley Bundel, a midfielder who played in both games. \\"Atlético Marte wanted to play short passes, but could not, so we took advantage of them,\\" he said. Wensley Bundel scored for Transvaal in the first game, which ended in 1–1 draw. Regarding the shot, he said, \\"It was a free throw. I remember that was barely hit the mark, but I gave it my all and I think [the] goalie is still looking for where the ball went.\\" For the second game, Johan Leisberger scored the winner. Transvaal played quick and fast and it paid off with raising the trophy under guidance of coach Humbert Boerleider. Thanks to an excellent performance, striker Theo Klein was hailed as the man of the match and was awarded player of the year in Suriname as well. Wensley Bundel to have won both CONCACAF titles with Transvaal. There is a rumor amongst supporters of the club, that Transvaal actually defeated Cruz Azul from Mexico in the 1970 edition of the cup. This is not a known fact, but should this be the case then Bundel was the only player to have played in all three cup matches. The Transvaal Lineup 1981: * Emile Barron (GK) * Jules Lagadeau (DF) * Edwin Schal (DF) * Remie Olmberg (DF) * Harald Brammerloo (DF) * Wensley Bundel (MF) * Johan Leisberger (MF) * Roy Vanenburg (MF) * Wong Sai Sang (MF) * Pauli Corte (FW) * Theo Klein (FW) * Humbert Boerleider Coach =1986 CONCACAF Champions' Cup= In 1986, Transvaal made it to the finals of the Continental tournament for the fourth time. By defeating SV Juventus (Netherlands Antilles), UNDEBA (Netherlands Antilles) and rivals Robinhood (Suriname), thus clinching the Caribbean region, Transvaal then defeated Trintoc (Trinidad and Tobago) in the semi-final to face Alajuelense (Costa Rica) in the final. Losing the series 4–2 on aggregate score, it would be the fourth time the two clubs would be drawn together in the history of the tournament. =1990–2000s and the end of an era= SV Transvaal team that played rivals SV Robinhood in the André Kamperveen Stadion, March 2012 Although Transvaal were unable to proceed past the rounds of the Caribbean region in the CONCACAF Champions' Cup during the nineties, the club did win five national titles in the decade, winning the Hoofdklasse in 1990, 1991, 1996, 1997 and 2000. The closest Transvaal came to advancing in the Continental tournament was a 10–0 aggregate defeat against the Seattle Sounders in the USA/Caribbean playoff round introduced to the tournament that year. The loss against the team from Seattle marked the end of Transvaal's firm presence within the tournament, having suffered an unprecedented loss. A year later a new format to the tournament was introduced as well as the CFU Club Championship. Transvaal failed to advance past the first group stage of the tournament. They qualified for the 2001 edition but were forced to withdraw due to complications in their domestic league which saw no matches contested that year. Transvaal have not qualified for CFU Club Championship since. =New ownership, new coaches 2015-present= After witnessing how Transvaal almost relegated to the Eerste Klasse in the 2014-15 season, many people wonder if Transie would rise to dominance again. On 22 December 2015, Rudisa bought the club and in 2016 appointed Dennis Baino as head coach. The new owner and manager brought some changes to the club, one of the changes was that players would now train four times a week. At the end of the 2016 season, Transie ended in second and qualified themselves to the CFU Club Championship, being the first time in 20 years that they have qualified themselves. On 29 January 2017, the board of Transvaal decided to replace Baino, after eight games played in the new Topklasse league, because he failed to keep the club in mid table. Two days later the board appointed Baino's assistant, Raymond Mannen as the new head coach. The next day Transie played against SNL under the new manager and won the match with two goals to one. In September 2019 Transvaal signed a 3-year contract with trainer Kenneth Jaliens. Jaliens is considered to be the most educated trainer from Suriname and his objective is to bring back the glory from the old days that this club has seen. Stadium Transvaal play their home matches at the André Kamperveen Stadion (formerly known as the National Stadion) in Paramaribo to a capacity of 7,100 people. They share the stadium with the Suriname national team. Transvaal have been tenants of the AK Stadium since construction was completed in 1953. Prior to the National Stadium, Transvaal played their home games on the Cultuurtuinlaan, across the street from where the stadium sits today. From 1953 to 2014, Transvaal shared the stadium with rivals S.V. Robinhood, before they suffered relegation in 2014, moving to the Frank Essed Stadion, together with S.V. Walking Boyz Company who had played at the Kamperveen stadium since 1997. =Youth stadium= Due to the high volume of activity at the clubs' home stadium, a result of the stadium being shared with the Surinamese athletics and cycling associations, a new stadium was erected in 1966 to serve as the training grounds for the youth teams of various clubs around Paramaribo. Transvaal were amongst the first tenants of the George W. Streepy Stadion, which serves as additional training facilities, as well as being the official stadium for the SVB Junior League, the youth league of the Surinamese Football Association. Crest and colors The club colors are green and white and the team is named after the former province of South Africa, Transvaal Province. The badge white and green stripes with 'S.V.

He directed \\"Submission: Part 1\\", a short film written by Somali writer and politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which criticized the treatment of women in Islam in strong terms. On 2 November 2004, van Gogh was assassinated by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch-Moroccan who objected to the film's controversial message. The last film van Gogh had completed before his death, 06/05, was a fictional exploration of the assassination of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn (1948–2002). It was released posthumously in December 2004, a month after van Gogh's assassination. Early life Theo van Gogh was born on 23 July 1957 in The Hague, Netherlands, to Anneke and Johan van Gogh. His father served in the Dutch secret service ('AIVD', then called 'BVD'). He was named after his paternal uncle Theo, who was captured and executed while working as a resistance fighter during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. Theo van Gogh was a great-grandson of Theo van Gogh, art dealer and brother of painter Vincent van Gogh. Career After dropping out of law school at the University of Amsterdam, van Gogh became a stage manager. His self-proclaimed passion was film-making, and he made his debut as a director with the movie Luger (1981). He was awarded a Gouden Kalf for Blind Date (1996) and In het belang van de staat (\\"In the Interest of the State,\\" 1997). For the latter, he also received a \\"Certificate of Merit\\" from the San Francisco International Film Festival. As an actor, he appeared in the film, De noorderlingen (\\"The Northerners\\", 1992). He made numerous films (see below), many on political themes. From the 1990s, van Gogh also worked in television. His last book (2003) was Allah weet het beter (\\"Allah Knows Best\\"), in which he strongly condemned Islam. He was a well-known critic of Islam, particularly after the Iranian Revolution and the September 11 attacks. He supported the nomination of writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali for the Dutch parliament, who was elected. Born in Somalia, she had immigrated to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage. She became a writer and liberal (former PvdA Labour Party) politician. In the 1980s, van Gogh became a newspaper columnist. Through the years he used his columns to express his frustration with politicians, actors, film directors, writers and other people he considered to be part of \\"the establishment\\". He delighted in provocation and became a controversial figure, frequently criticizing Islamic cultures. He used his website, De Gezonde Roker (\\"The Healthy Smoker\\"), to express harsh criticism of multicultural society. He said the Netherlands was so rife with social turmoil that it was in danger of turning into \\"something Belfast-like\\". =Submission= Working from a script written by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, van Gogh created the 10-minute short film Submission. The movie deals with violence against women in some Islamic societies; it tells the stories, using visual shock tactics, of four abused Muslim women. The title, Submission, is a translation of the word \\"Islam\\" into English. In the film, women's naked bodies, with texts from the Qur'an written on them in henna, in an allusion to traditional wedding rituals in some cultures, are veiled with semi-transparent shrouds as the women kneel in prayer, telling their stories as if they are speaking to Allah. In August 2004, after the movie's broadcast on Dutch public TV, the newspaper De Volkskrant reported that the journalist Francisco van Jole had accused Hirsi Ali and van Gogh of plagiarism, saying that they had appropriated the ideas of Iranian-American video artist Shirin Neshat, whose work used Arabic text projected onto bodies. Following the broadcast, both van Gogh and Hirsi Ali received death threats. Van Gogh did not take the threats seriously and refused any protection. According to Hirsi Ali, he said, \\"Nobody kills the village idiot\\", a term he frequently used about himself. Personal life Van Gogh was a member of the Dutch Republican society Republikeins Genootschap, which advocates the abolition of the Dutch monarchy. He was a friend and supporter of the controversial Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002. Murder Place where Van Gogh was killed Ten years after the murder, the bullet holes were still visible in the bicycle lane in front of Linnaeusstraat 22 (2014) Demonstration at the Dam square after Van Gogh was killed Demonstrators. The sign, translated, says \\"Theo has been murdered\\". Van Gogh was shot and stabbed by Mohammed Bouyeri while cycling to work on 2 November 2004 at about 9 o'clock in the morning. Bouyeri also injured some bystanders and left on the scene a note containing death threats to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who went into hiding. The note also threatened Western countries and Jews, and referred to ideologies of the Egyptian organization Takfir wal-Hijra. Bouyeri, a 26-year-old Dutch-Moroccan citizen, was apprehended by police after a chase. Authorities alleged that he had terrorist ties with the Dutch Islamist Hofstad Network. He was charged with the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders, illegal possession of a firearm, and conspiring to murder others, including Hirsi Ali. He was convicted at trial on 26 July 2005 and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole. The murder sparked outrage and grief throughout the Netherlands. Flowers, notes, drawings and other expressions of mourning were left at the scene of the murder.Expressions of mourning for Theo van Gogh, kept at the Amsterdam City Archives =Funeral= The cremation ceremony took place on 9 November. Fearing he might not survive a planned flight to New York, Van Gogh had spoken about his funeral wishes with friends shortly before his death. Maarten van Rossem was asked by Van Gogh's relatives to speak, something he found difficult in that he wanted to avoid sounding apocalyptic. Van Gogh's father suggested that his son would have liked the media attention provoked by his murder. = Aftermath = The day after the murder, Dutch police arrested eight people allegedly belonging to a group later referred to as the Hofstad Network. Six detainees were Dutch-Moroccans, one was Dutch- Algerian, and one had dual Spanish-Moroccan nationality. The Dutch Complaints Bureau for Discrimination on the Internet (MDI) received many complaints about websites allegedly praising the murder and making death threats against other people. At the same time, starting with four attempted arson attacks on mosques in the weekend of 5–7 November, there were retaliatory violent incidents against Muslims, including a bomb that exploded at a Muslim school in Eindhoven. The Dutch Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia recorded a total of 106 violent incidents in November against Muslim targets. The National Dutch Police Services Agency (KLPD) recorded 31 occasions of violence against mosques and Islamic schools between 23 November and 13 March 2005. An arson attack destroyed a Muslim primary school in Uden in December 2004. By 8 November, Christian churches were reported as targets of vandalism and arson attacks in turn. A report for the Anne Frank Foundation and the University of Leiden, accounted for a total of 174 violent incidents between 2–30 November; it said that mosques were the target of violence 47 times, and churches 13 times. The murder widened and polarized the debate in the Netherlands about the social position of its more than one million Muslim residents. It also put the country's liberal tradition further into question, coming only two years after Pim Fortuyn's murder. In an apparent reaction against controversial statements about the Islamic, Christian, and Jewish religions—such as those van Gogh had made—the Dutch Minister of Justice, Christian Democrat Piet Hein Donner, suggested Dutch blasphemy laws should either be applied more stringently or made more strict. The liberal D66 party suggested scrapping the blasphemy laws altogether. De Schreeuw (The Scream) is a memorial for Theo van Gogh and a symbol of the freedom of speech Geert Wilders, at the time an independent member of the House of Representatives, advocated a five-year halt to immigration from non-Western societies, saying: \\"The Netherlands has been too tolerant to intolerant people for too long. We should not import a retarded political Islamic society into our country\\". Wilders and Ayaan Hirsi Ali went into hiding for several weeks. Wilders has been under the protection of bodyguards ever since, and Hirsi Ali eventually relocated to the United States. Theo van Gogh's son claims he has been attacked on several occasions by young people of Moroccan and Turkish descent, and that the police did not provide him with help or protection. The police denied receiving any report of attacks. Legacy and honors On 18 March 2007, a sculpture honoring Theo van Gogh, entitled De Schreeuw (\\"The Scream\\"), was unveiled in Amsterdam. It is located in the Oosterpark, a short distance from where van Gogh was murdered. A private trust, the Foundation for Freedom of Expression, was established to help fund protection for critics of Islam and Muslims. =Reactions= In the English-speaking world, controversy arose after Rohan Jayasekera's article on van Gogh was published in Index on Censorship. The Associate Editor of the magazine said that van Gogh was a \\"free-speech fundamentalist\\" who had been on a \\"martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities\\" in an \\"abuse of his right to free speech\\". Describing van Gogh's film Submission as \\"furiously provocative\\", Jayasekera said his death was: Both left- and right-wing commentators criticized the article. In December 2004, Nick Cohen of London's Observer wrote: Cohen's account of the conversation was repudiated by the editor of the Index on Censorship, who responded with a letter to The Observer.

It is located in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It lies within the historic county boundaries of Cumberland and the modern council area of Cumbria. The summit, at , is a stony plateau, part of a 7.8-mile-long (12.6-kilometre-long) ridge running north-west to south-east, which also incorporates Little Dun Fell at and Great Dun Fell at . The three adjoining fells form an escarpment that rises steeply above the Eden Valley on its south-western side and drops off more gently on its north-eastern side towards the South Tyne and Tees Valleys. Cross Fell summit is crowned by a cross- shaped dry-stone shelter.Historic shelter restored to celebrate iconic trail’s anniversary On a clear day there are excellent views from the summit across the Eden Valley to the mountains of the Lake District. On the northern side of Cross Fell there are also fine views across the Solway Firth to the Southern Uplands of Scotland. The fell is prone to dense hill fog and fierce winds. A shrieking noise induced by the Helm Wind is a characteristic of the locality. It can be an inhospitable place for much of the year. In ancient times it was known as \\"Fiends Fell\\" and believed to be the haunt of evil spirits.North Pennines AONB Partnership article on Cross Fell St Augustine of Canterbury is said to have blessed the hill when he arrived here on his travels so it became known as Cross Fell in the Christian tradition, although it has been speculated that the fell became known as Cross Fell (\\"cross\\" meaning \\"angry\\") because of the evil spirits. Local geography The summit of Cross Fell with Great Dun Fell and its radar station in the background. The object in the centre foreground is a triangulation point Cross Fell and the adjoining fells are mainly a bed of hard, carboniferous limestone. Where this bed surfaces, there are steep rock faces. There are also strata of shale and gritstone that surface on the fell. On the south and west facing slopes of Cross Fell the rock faces have been broken up by frost action to give a scree slope made up of large boulders. The local terrain shows obvious evidence of recent glaciation and is covered by thin soil and acidic peat. Cross Fell, Great Dun Fell and Little Dun Fell form a block of high terrain which is all over in altitude. This is the largest block of high ground in England and tends to retain snow-cover longer than neighbouring areas. Snow can be found in gullies on the north side of Cross Fell as late as May in most years. In some years, lying snow has been known to persist until July and fresh snowfall in June (mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere) is common. Precipitation on Cross Fell averages around per year. Local flora includes a number of rare alpine plants such as the Starry Saxifrage and a mountain Forget-me-not.Cumbrian Wildlife: plants Cross Fell is covered by what is known as \\"siliceous alpine and boreal grassland\\". It is the southernmost outlier of this vegetation type, which is common to highlands in Scotland and Scandinavia. It is a designated Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Local farmers are required to keep free-roaming sheep off the tops of the fells in order to avoid damaging the natural flora. Cross Fell is a conspicuous feature in the landscape. It dominates the skyline on almost the entire length of the A66 trunk road between Penrith and Stainmore. It can also be seen from many points in the Lake District, including the Helvellyn summit, and from high ground throughout Dumfriesshire and Northumberland. Most remarkably, it is claimed that it is visible in exceptional circumstances from the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn in Snowdonia (Wales) at a distance of .

Douglas had allegedly robbed a couple in bed at knifepoint hours earlier. Trouble broke out after what had been a peaceful protest outside the Brixton Police Station where the death occurred. With several hundred people involved, the riot resulted in damage to property and vehicles in the area. Police sealed off a three-kilometre (2 mile) area around Brixton in south London. The riot lasted for five hours. 22 people were arrested and charged with public order offences, theft and criminal damage. Three police officers were hurt. The then-Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, condemned the riots and said \\"efforts to improve Brixton would continue\\".The New York Times, \\"Man's Death Sets Off Riot In London\\"  Death of Wayne Douglas  Wayne Douglas was in police custody to be questioned about a burglary. Police reported that he collapsed in Brixton Police Station. The police statement said that Douglas died after collapsing while being questioned. Although the post-mortem on Douglas revealed that he had died of heart failure, the inquest into his death showed that he had been held face-down with his hands cuffed behind his back on four occasions. The post-mortem also revealed that Douglas had suffered from heart disease.  The Riots  The picketing of Brixton Police Station over the death of Douglas reportedly developed into a march down Brixton Road (Brixton High Street). Violence was triggered by a standoff between the police and about 100 demonstrators. Witnesses have reported hearing groups of black youths shouting \\"Killers, killers\\" at the police. Some eyewitness accounts describe the police presence at the demonstration as \\"incredibly heavy-handed\\". The BBC reported that \\"hundreds\\" of black and white youths participated in the riot. Rioters attacked police, ransacked shops and burned cars. According to the police \\"Officers were wearing protective clothing because we had reports of missiles being thrown.\\" In an attempt to contain the riot around 50 police officers in riot gear formed lines to close Brixton's main road (Brixton Road), preventing anyone from entering the area. The street had been the scene of rioting in 1981. Police also sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton and closed Brixton and Stockwell stations. A police helicopter was dispatched over Brixton. It was reported that shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved into the area of the Ritzy Cinema. It was also reported that a crowd of at least ten rioters pulled a police motorcyclist from his machine. The Dogstar, Coldharbour Lane was among the businesses attacked by the rioters. Formerly The Atlantic, a predominantly black pub, and recently refurbished.A Brixton Renaissance The riot later developed into what police called \\"sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town centre\\". The police stated that \\"We gave them every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn't done so.\\" One police officer suffered a broken shoulder, fractured ribs and bruising during the riots. He praised the Territorial Support Group for protecting him from rioters after he was knocked off his motorbike and beaten.  Causes  The New York Times reported that local residents were outraged by the death of a black man in police custody and saw the riots as expression of alienation in an impoverished area devastated by race riots in 1981. It quotes Harold Douglas, 39, as saying: > Last night happened because the only time a black man is seen and listened > to is when he comes out on the street...They cause a million pounds of > damage and then people start taking notice. At a news conference at the time, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon is quoted to have said: > It was not Brixton rioting last night. It was a small minority of thugs and > criminals who, as ever, were looking for the opportunity to embark on > criminal activities. A local resident at the time stated: > Local people are not only pissed off with the death of Wayne Douglas but the > whole gentrification of Brixton.

An M1919 Browning machine gun is mounted to the right. A flame tank is a type of tank equipped with a flamethrower, most commonly used to supplement combined arms attacks against fortifications, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the Second World War, during which the United States, Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the British Commonwealth) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks. A number of production methods were used. The flamethrowers used were either modified versions of existing infantry flame weapons (Flammpanzer I and II) or specially designed (Flammpanzer III). They were mounted externally (Flammpanzer II), replaced existing machine gun mounts, or replaced the tank's main armament (Flammpanzer III). Fuel for the flame weapon was either carried inside the tank, in armoured external storage, or in some cases in a special trailer behind the tank (Churchill Crocodile). Combat effectiveness The M4A3R3 variant of the Sherman tank on exercise in Korea In comparison to man- portable flamethrowers, flame tanks carried much more fuel, and could fire longer-ranged bursts. Due to their ability to get in range of enemy positions in comparative safety, they were invaluable for rooting out heavy infantry fortifications. For example, as the main guns of US tanks were largely unsuccessful in penetrating the thick bunkersZaloga (M3/M5 Stuart) p. 35 created by the Japanese defenders on islands such as Tarawa or Iwo Jima, flame throwing tanks were used instead while infantrymen provided the necessary security during their deployment. On Iwo Jima the Marines learned that conventional firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight Sherman M4A3R3 medium tanks equipped with a flamethrower (\\"Ronson\\" or \\"Zippo\\" tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where they would face the full firepower of Marine rifle and machine gun fire. The maximum range of a flamethrower was typically less than 150 metres. Because of this limitation, the flamethrower was virtually useless on an open battlefield. However, they proved a potent psychological weapon against fortified troops. In many instances, troops surrendered or fled upon seeing a flame tank fire ranging shots, rather than risk being burned alive. Experience of combat use of flamethrower tanks was mixed. German flamethrower variants of Panzer II and Panzer III were both discontinued due to unsatisfactory performance and converted into assault guns or tank destroyers. The Panzer IV was never converted into a flame variant, despite having been configured for many other roles. The mixed results were in part due to the development of infantry anti- tank weapons. At the start of the Second World War most infantry units had weapons with some effectiveness against armoured targets at ranges of thirty to fifty meters, like anti-tank rifles. Towards the end of the war, more powerful anti-tank weapons such as the bazooka, Panzerschreck, and PIAT were introduced which were fatal to tanks at ranges longer than the tank's flamethrower could reach. British Churchill Crocodiles supported the U.S. Army in the summer of 1944 during the fight over the Normandy hedgerows or 'The Bocage Country' and used a squadron during the fighting at the Battle for Brest, notably aiding in the defeat of a Fallschirmjäger garrison at the siege of Montbarey fortress on 16 September 1944. The US Army received a smaller American designed flamethrower mounted upon the M4 Sherman tank during the same month of September 1944, assigned to the US Army's 70th Tank Battalion, the flamethrowing tanks went into action on 18 September 1944, where it was found that the weapons had a very short range as compared to the British Crocodiles, and consequently were not very popular amongst US troops.Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) 215, 216 The Canadian and Dutch armies became two of the most active users of the Wasp variant of universal carriers equipped with a flamethrower. While fighting in Europe, the Wasp was found to be extremely effective in prying German soldiers from their defenses. Indeed, the mechanical flamethrowers, although not impressive by themselves, struck horror into the minds of German troops, who feared them more than any other conventional weapon.Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p.216 Canadian troops used them during the Battle of the Scheldt. Canadian 4th Armoured Division demonstrating the use of flame throwers across a canal, Maldegem, October 1944. In contrast to man-portable flamethrowers that were vulnerable to bullets and shrapnel making them extremely dangerous to their operators, flame tanks were extremely difficult to catch on fire or explode unless hit with an armor piercing round or explosive reaching the ammunition and engine fuel inside the tank's main hull. Tanks such as the Churchill 'Crocodile', which towed the flamethrower liquid container behind the actual tank, held no greater risk of fire than standard tanks. Although the towed container itself could be easily targeted, the tank and its crew remained well protected. The armored trailer and armored coupling of the Churchill Crocodile could be jettisoned from inside the tank if necessary. Crews of 'flame' tanks were not necessarily more vulnerable than those crews in the regular tanks, standard version of the tank (a Churchill 'Crocodile' flame tank being more or less as vulnerable to anti-tank weapons as the standard Churchill), but the crews of flamethrowing tanks were often treated differently should they be captured alive by enemy troops. Due to the perceived inhumanity of the weapon itself, captured crews of such tanks were often treated much less humanely than crews of regular tanks. Instances of 'flametankers' being executed by the opposite troops upon capture were not uncommon. Subsequently, British tank crews received sixpence a day extra 'danger money' due to the threat of arbitrary execution. Flame tanks also suffered from the fact, along with flamethrower- armed troops, that all enemy within range would usually open up on them due to the fear of the weapon.

L. Bachs (Joe Lunch Box), was an American motorcycle mechanic, artist, pin striper, metal fabricator, knifemaker and gunsmith. His father, Wally Howard, was a Los Angeles sign painter; and, by the age of 10, the young Howard was able to paint and letter at a professional level. Complex Von Dutch Pin Stripe on Blue Velvet Early life As the son of a sign painter, Howard learned to letter and pinstripe professionally by the age of 10. While attending Compton High School, Howard excelled in track and field and was referred to as \\"the fastest man in LA.\\" Family members gave him the nickname \\"Dutch\\" because he was \\"as stubborn as a Dutchman,\\" he added the \\"Von\\" prefix later as an artistic signature. Work Howard started earning money in the 1950s by pin-striping along with fellow striper Dean Jeffries.St. Antoine, Arthur. - \\"Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend\\". - Motor Trend Magazine Von Dutch has been a major influence in the customizing of vehicles from the 1950s to today. Some of his famous works include the flying eyeball and the custom Kenford truck, along with numerous custom motorcycles and many award-winning custom cars. Among many custom car and motorcycle enthusiasts, he is thought of as one of the fathers of Kustom Kulture. An avid gunsmith and knife maker, Von Dutch made numerous art knives and embellished firearms. Most of these were adaptations of existing items to which he added his artistic flair. In 1958, Von Dutch designed and produced the \\"Mare's Leg\\", a cut-down Winchester rifle for the television series Wanted: Dead or Alive. Von Dutch completed pin striping the well known \\"Blue Velvet\\" Pontiac Firebird in 1979, which is complete with two perfectly parallel pin stripes 16 and a half feet long down each side of the vehicle. These pin stripes were completed by hand and attained a level of perfection that gave rise to the legend of Von Dutch as a pin striper. Von Dutch Blue Velvet Pontiac Firebird Death Von Dutch's lifelong alcoholism led to major medical issues later in life. He died on September 19, 1992 from alcohol-related complications, leaving behind his two daughters, Lisa and Lorna. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.  Von Dutch Originals, LLC  After his death, his daughters sold the \\"Von Dutch\\" name to Michael Cassel and Robert Vaughn. Von Dutch is now an American multinational brand licensing company named after Kenny Howard. Considering that the Von Dutch name is now a lucrative, licensed brand, it is ironic that Kenny Howard had famously stated: \\"Use any of my stuff you want to. Nothing is original. Everything is in the subconscious, we just \\"tap\\" it sometimes and \\"think\\" we have originated something. Genes make us more or less interested in certain things but nothing is truly original! Copyright and patents are mostly an ego trip.\\"  Racism and anti-sociality  In January of 2004, an OC Weekly article alleged Howard's violent and racist tendencies. Robert Williams, a friend and fellow artist, said Howard was \\"...quite a racist; didn't like anybody. Howard was accused of having all the trappings of being a neo-Nazi. Another accusation suggested he could not tolerate black people.\\" The article alleges that a letter written shortly before Howard's death in 1992, when he was in the hospital, closed with “Bye, Heil Hitler.” After the publication of the article, a number of retailers removed Von Dutch from their inventory despite its profitability. In May 2004, Los Angeles Magazine profiled Howard similarly describing his alcoholism and anti-social behavior. Von Dutch clothing founder Ed Boswell described Howard as \\"...an artistic Nazi, an aesthetic Nazi and a racist. But he was not a white-power guy. He hated everybody too much to be one of those. He was a provocateur.\\" See also *Hot rod *Ed Roth References Further reading * External links * A documentary of the life of Kenneth Howard, a.k.a.

Biography Preparations for departure Pinks in the breakers, c. 1880 He was born in Groningen, the son of the banker Klaas Mesdag and his wife Johanna Wilhelmina van Giffen. Mesdag was encouraged by his father, an amateur painter, to study art. He married Sina van Houten in 1856, and when they inherited a fortune from her father, Mesdag retired from banking at the age of 35 to pursue a career as a painter. He studied in Brussels with Willem Roelofs and in 1868 moved to The Hague to paint the sea. In 1870 he exhibited at the Paris Salon and won the gold medal for The Breakers of the North Sea. In 1880 he received a commission from a Belgian company to paint a panorama giving a view over the village of Scheveningen on the North Sea coast near The Hague. With the help of Sina and students he completed the enormous painting, Panorama Mesdag,-- 14 m high and 120 m around -- by 1881. However, the vogue for panoramas was coming to an end, and when the company operating it went bust in 1886, Mesdag purchased the painting at auction and thereafter funding its operating losses from his own pocket. He joined the art society of The Hague (the Pulchri Studio) and in 1889 was elected chairman. In 1903 he gave his house at Laan van Meerdervoort and his collection of paintings to the Netherlands; the house is now the Museum Mesdag.

The summum bonum is generally thought of as being an end in itself, and at the same time containing many other pursuits typified as Good by philosophers of the time. The term was used in medieval philosophy. In the Thomist synthesis of Aristotelianism and Christianity, the highest good is usually defined as the life of the righteous and/or the life led in communion with God and according to God's precepts. In Kantianism, it was used to describe the ultimate importance, the singular and overriding end which human beings ought to pursue. Plato and Aristotle Plato's The Republic argued that, \\"In the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen...to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right\\".B. Jowett trans, The Essential Plato (1999) p. 269 517b,c (Stephanus)Silent contemplation was the route to appreciation of the Idea of the Good.A. Kojeve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel (1980) p. 108 Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics accepted that the target of human activity, \\"Must be the 'Good', that is, the supreme good.\\", but challenged Plato's Idea of the Good with the pragmatic question: \\"Will one who has had a vision of the Idea itself become thereby a better doctor or general?\\".H, Tredennick revd, The Ethics of Aristotle (1976) p. 63 and p. 72 However, arguably at least, Aristotle's concept of the unmoved mover owed much to Plato's Idea of the Good.Tredennick, p. 352 Hellenic syncretism Philo of Alexandria conflated the Old Testament God with the unmoved mover and the Idea of the Good.J. Boardman ed., The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 703 Plotinus, the neoplatonic philosopher, built on Plato's Good for his concept of the supreme One, while Plutarch drew on Zoroastrianism to develop his eternal principle of good.Boardman, p. 705-7 Augustine of Hippo in his early writings offered the summum bonum as the highest human goal, but was later to identify it as a feature of the Christian GodJ. McWilliam, Augustine (1992) p. 152-4 in De natura boni (On the Nature of Good, c. 399). Augustine denies the positive existence of absolute evil, describing a world with God as the supreme good at the center, and defining different grades of evil as different stages of remoteness from that center. Later developments The summum bonum has continued to be a focus of attention in Western philosophy, secular and religious. Hegel replaced Plato's dialectical ascent to the Good by his own dialectical ascent to the Real.Kojeve, p. 181-4 G. E. Moore placed the highest good in personal relations and the contemplation of beauty – even if not all his followers in the Bloomsbury Group may have appreciated what Clive Bell called his \\"all- important distinction between 'Good on the whole' and 'Good as a whole'\\".Quoted in H. Lee, Virginia Woolf (1996) p. 253 Immanuel Kant The doctrine of the highest good maintained by Immanuel Kant can be seen as the state in which an agent experiences happiness in proportion to their virtue. It is the supreme end of the will, meaning that beyond the attainment of a good will, which is moral excellence signified by abiding by the categorical imperative and pure practical reason, the attainment of happiness in proportion to your moral excellence is the supreme, unconditional motivation of the will. Furthermore, in virtue of the doctrine of the highest good, Kant postulates the existence of God and the eternal existence of rational agents, in order to reconcile three premises: (i) that agents are morally obligated to fully attain the highest good; (ii) that the object of an agent’s obligation must be possible; (iii) that an agent’s full realization of the highest good is not possible. Judgments Judgments on the highest good have generally fallen into four categories: * Utilitarianism, when the highest good is identified with the maximum possible psychological happiness for the maximum number of people; * Eudaemonism or virtue ethics, when the highest good is identified with flourishing; * Rational deontologism, when the highest good is identified with virtue or duty; * Rational eudaemonism, or tempered deontologism, when both virtue and happiness are combined in the highest good.

Most notably, Lugné-Poe introduced French audiences to the Scandinavian playwrights August Strindberg and Henrik Ibsen. Life and career At age nineteen he entered the Paris Conservatoire and joined the Théâtre Libre, a private naturalist theatre run by André Antoine. He adopted the stage name Lugné-Poe in homage to Edgar Allan Poe, to whom he sometimes claimed to be distantly related. He organized a group of painters known as The Nabis, publicizing their work in a series of articles. He created La Maison de l'Œuvre, also known as Le Théâtre de l'Œuvre, a private group of spectators and experimental theatre that went against the naturalist movement and contributed to the symbolist movement in theatre and to the discovery of new playwrights. In 1895, Jakub Grein and the Independent Theatre Society invited Lugné-Poe and his troupe to present a season of Ibsen's Rosmersholm, The Master Builder, and Maurice Maeterlinck's symbolist L'Intruse and Pelléas and Mélisande in London.Styan, J.

He supported the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, and headed a diplomatic mission to Dresden, attempting to convince Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony to support the Commonwealth and accept its throne (after Poniatowski's future death). He refused to join the Targowica Confederation established to bring the Constitution down. He received the Order of the White Eagle on 25 November 1764. He was Marshal of the Convocation Sejm of 7 May - 23 June 1764, and of the Extraordinary Sejm of 26–28 June 1812, held in Warsaw. Thus he became Marshal of General Confederation of Kingdom of Poland.

In this transitional area between the northern and southern Rhône wine regions that constitutes the northern limit of the Provence, the climate in Baume-le-Transit and St Paul are more typically Mediterranean climate than the slightly cooler areas dominated by the Lance mountain.Inter Rhône Retrieved 19 January 2010 According to archeological finds, particularly the remains of the largest Roman wine villa in Donzère dating from the 1st century BC, wine has been produced in the region since the antiquity. Tricastin wines were mentioned in the writings of the Marquise de Sevigné in the 16th century. The wines were accorded an AOVDQS on 19 March 1964, and were awarded their AOC on 27 July 1973. Wines A characteristic of the wines from this appellation is their great diversity due to the many and mixed soil types and varied climates. The central part of the region comprises sandstone hills, while the southeast is covered with stones or gravel. The west is mainly alluvial soil with calcairous stones, and the north is covered with large glacial pebbles. Red wines which comprise 95% of the total production, are made from the principal varieties of Grenache noir and Syrah (10% minimum), with secondary varieties of Cinsault, Mourvèdre Carignan. No single variety may be present at more than 80%. A non defined quantity of secondary varieties must not exceed 30%, or if declared separately, not more than 15% each. Rosé: The same varieties in the same permitted proportions are used as for the red. White wines are produced from Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Clairette blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne, and Viognier. No variety may be present in excess of 60% All wines must contain a minimum of 11% alcohol.

Following an accident at the Tricastin Nuclear Power Plant in July 2008, when uranium was released, the sale of Coteaux du Tricastin wine decreased. The wine growers therefore wished to change the name of the appellation to something without \\"Tricastin\\", to avoid being associated with the nuclear power plant.

Centuries later, it became an important place under the French monarchy, as a royal hotel. It would also be used as a post relay, the first one on the road to Fontainebleau. It became a major road and railway junction in the 1840s after its railway station was built in 1840, and after 1893 was the first city surrounding Paris with a bridge crossing the river Seine. Most of the city was destroyed in April 1944 by an Allied bombing as the city was the only one surrounding Paris that had such a big railway station and had railway lines going to most of France's major cities.

At the , Uki had a population of 203 people. The town's name may have come from an aboriginal word for \\"small water plant (like a fern) with a yellow flower and edible root\\". There are three approaches to Uki village; from the North it is approximately 15 minutes by road south of the main township of Murwillumbah along the Kyogle Road and 4 km past the turnoff to the World Heritage listed Mount Warning National Park, from the South West along the Kyogle Road from Lismore, Kyogle and Nimbin and from the East along Smiths Creek Road linking Uki to the village of Stokers Siding and the Tweed Valley Way to coastal towns including Brunswick Heads and Byron Bay. It is also possible to travel to Mullumbimby from Uki using gravel back roads and fire trails through the Mount Jerusalem National Park. Clarrie Hall Dam is located 10 km from Uki, and the area is described as \\"one of New South Wales’ finest fishing destinations\\". Today Prominent buildings in the village include the historical 'Old Butter Factory' and a primary school. There are several stores including a post office, general store, café, bakery, pharmacy, guesthouse and laundromat. The Mount Warning Hotel, which is a weekend lunch 'stop-over' for touring motorbikes and those out for a weekend drive, burnt down in February 2013. It was subsequently re-built and opened again for business in mid-2015. Uki is the town on which the village of Yurriki in Robert G. Barrett's book The Godson is based. History Early pioneers were either timber cutters (usually Australian Red Cedar) or dairy farmers. Photos of The Sisters and Mt Uki near Uki in the early 1900s show these cleared of nearly all vegetation. Following a rationalisation of the dairy industry in the 1960s, many dairies closed down with farmers turning to beef cattle, which remains a feature of the region today. Tropical fruits have also been grown in the area and cane farming is a prominent agricultural activity in the Tweed Valley itself. The last remaining sawmill is located on the Smith's Creek Road towards the north of the village. Demographics In the , Uki recorded a population of 765 people, 50.5% female and 49.5% male.

It is named after the village of Lirac. Bordering on the neighbouring cru of Tavel AOC, a rosé-only cru in the next village, Lirac is one of the 13 crus of the Rhône valley family. Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC is across the Rhône from it. History Lirac wines were appreciated by the royal and papal courts in Avignon at the time of the schism. Pope Innocent IV ordered 20 casks of wine from there in 1357 and Henry IV of France and Louis XIV served them regularly at court, where they were called simple Rhône wine.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 166 In the mid-17th century the right-bank district of the Côte du Rhône had issued regulations to govern the quality of its wine and in 1737 the king ordered that casks of Lirac wine shipped from the nearby river port of Roquemaure should be branded with the letters CDR to introduce a system of protecting its origin. The rules for its Côte du Rhône thus formed the very early basis of today's nationwide AOC system governed by the INAO.Institut National des Appellations d'Origine Contrôlée et de la Qualité Production was very high in those days: in 1774 the vintage yielded more than 8000 hl. of wine. In 1863 phylloxera arrived in Lirac. In fact, a winemaker at Château de Clary may have been responsible for introducing it. The name was changed to Côtes du Rhône when the left-bank wines were included in the appellation some hundred years later. The appellation received full recognition by a High Court decision in 1937.Maison de Vins, Avignon In the 1930s, Count Henri de Régis, the owner of the Château de Ségriès in the heart of the village of Lirac improved the quality of his wines until in 1945 he obtained the highest distinction, a cru, of the Côtes du Rhône. Two years later in 1947 the appellation was confirmed by government decree. Lirac is the oldest wine in the Côtes du Rhône region and was the first to be produced in all three colours: red, rosé, and white. In recent years, the planted vineyard area of Lirac has been increasing, and more high- quality wines are being produced. Climate and geography The village of Lirac lies to the west of the Rhone in the department of Gard, a little over 10 km due west of Châteauneuf-du-Pape which is on the opposite side of the river. Besides Lirac itself, the appellation includes the villages of Saint Laurent des Arbres, Saint Géniès de Comolas and Roquemaure which forms a girdle around the appellation. The terroir in Lirac is somewhat similar to Châteauneuf-du-Pape both in variety and hours of sun (2700). The best terroir for red wine is perhaps on the windy plateau Vallongue, shared with Tavel that is only 5 km. away. In the relatively newly planted vineyards one finds plenty of galets roulés that retain heat. The area is slightly cooler that the lowlands. Wines Detailed map of the Rhône wine region, with separate maps of Southern Rhône (\\"Zoom A\\") and Northern Rhône (\\"Zoom B\\"). The Lirac AOC is marked in brown on \\"Zoom A\\" and is situated between Orange and Avignon. Red wines are made from Grenache noir (minimum 40%), Syrah and Mourvèdre (minimum of 25% together), Cinsault, and Carignan (maximum 10%). Rosé: The same varieties are used as for the red, and up to 20% of the allowed varieties for white wine may be used. White wines are produced from Clairette, Grenache blanc and Bourboulenc. No variety may be used in a proportion greater than 60%. The minimum alcohol for all three colours is decreed at 11.5%. The style of red Lirac often resembles a soft Côtes du Rhône-Villages, but the more ambitious wines are often similar to Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Rosé Lirac is usually similar to Tavel. Economy The Lirac wines are produced by a total of 100 concerns which include 93 growers, 43 private wineries, 6 cooperative wineries, and one producer/merchant.INAO, April 2007 Many producers in Châteauneuf-du-Pape also produce Lirac wine.

History Former 118th General Hospital, Now used by the Australian Air League Belmore Road and Conca D'oro Lounge (right) The area was originally known as Herne Bay and comprised small land grants between 30 and . When the East Hills railway line came through the area in 1931, the station was called Herne Bay. The area was subdivided in 1919 and redeveloped in 1942 during World War 2, when the Government of Australia and the Allied Works Council establish an army base hospital barracks for the United States Army, the 118 General Hospital. The hospital was built at a cost of one- million pounds and consisted of 490 barrack type buildings containing approximately four-thousand-two-hundred and fifty beds. The hospital was staffed by doctors and nurses from The Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. The Americans, who at the time, were using the Hydro Majestic Hotel in Medlow Bath as a hospital, relocated and moved into the first section of the Herne Bay premises in May 1943. By November, 1700 beds were being utilised. The site was visited by General MacArthur, First Lady Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt, Artie Shaw’s Band and Bob Hope. In October 1944 the main US hospital left for the liberation of the Philippines, although some American patients and staff remained on site until January 1945. In that same month, the Royal Navy (United Kingdom) opened a hospital to treat wounded members of the British Pacific Fleet in the vacated buildings. It received and treated 9003 patients. The Australian army occupied some of the other sections. One of the sections in use was located in Cullens Road, between Canterbury Road and Wiggs Roads Punchbowl and used up until March 1947. Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and robertson) 1990, page 222 After the war the military departed, and the hospital barrack buildings of timber and corrugated iron (some of which still survive today) were handed over to the Housing Commission from March 1946 and converted into public housing to relieve housing shortages. Some of the street names recall the American presence such as Pennsylvania Road, Kentucky Road, Wyoming Place, Idaho Place, Michigan Road, Montana Crescent, Roosevelt Avenue and Truman Avenue. Now the Herne Bay Hospital is the headquarters for the Australian Air League Riverwood Squadron. The suburb developed an unsavoury reputation for poverty, overcrowding and violence, and its name was changed to Riverwood in 1957, in large part to remove the stigma associated with living there. This helped to change the reputation of the area. From the 1950s onwards, purpose- built utilitarian public housing apartment blocks and freestanding bungalows replaced most of the former military buildings on the northern side of the railway line, while the southern part of the suburb was mostly privately developed..

The parish is located on the southward slope of the Greensand ridge, south of Maidstone on the A229 Hastings road. The name Linton comes from Old English, probably meaning Lilla's village. The steepness of the hill through it is explained because of its position on the slope of the ridge. The village has a population of about 500.

It served as headquarters to the army encampment at neighbouring Coxheath during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. There is one public house 'The Bull' which is opposite the church. There is a children's playground off a lane near the bottom of the hill which can be found at the end of a path just above the turning for Wheelers Lane. Cornwallis Academy is a secondary school located in the village. Linton Park Cricket Club play within the grounds of Linton Park country home. The team have won the National Village Cup on two occasions. Linton is in a conservation area and most of the village has great views across to the Weald of Kent.

London: Dorling Kindersley, 2005, p. 261. History The wine of Tavel is historically famous. Philip IV is supposed to have travelled through Tavel on one of his tours of the kingdom. He was reportedly offered a glass, which he emptied without getting off his horse and afterwards proclaimed Tavel the only good wine in the world. The Sun King, Louis XIV, is also supposed to have been fond of the wine, which helped maintain its reputation until the vineyards were affected by the phylloxera epidemic. Tavel achieved AOC status in 1936 when the system was introduced. At that point the grapes were mostly grown on the sandy flat lands closer to town, where vines were easier to cultivate but produced a lower quality of wine. In 1965 the hillsides were cleared of forest and prepared for growing vines.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger – JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. Climate and geography In Tavel there are three types of soil, one west of the village is dominated by limestone and slate. Here, low-yielding vines grow giving deep and aromatic wines. Another type is the flat sandy rocky fields, easy to cultivate and good for ripening. The third is dominated by galets roulés, the smooth round stones also found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape and is located east of the town in the direction of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Grapes and wine Grenache and Cinsault are the main grapes used in the appellation's wines, along with Syrah and Mourvedre, although the latter two were not permitted until 1969. Tavel wines are dry and tend to have more body and structure than most rosés. They can be cellared, but are usually drunk young. =Winemaking= Rosé wine cannot legally be made in France by blending red and white wines together, with the sole exception of Champagne. However, rosé wine can blend red and white grapes (before fermentation), pressed to remove the juice from the skins after a short period of maceration (10–36 hours) in order to extract some colour. In Tavel, some of the must is kept with the skins longer and then blended into the lighter must, which is what makes the wine more powerful, more tannic and darker than other rosés. The potential alcohol is high, with an upper limit of 13.5% for the appellation.

Vacqueyras received the A.O.C.

It is primarily a red wine region, with a very small amount of rosé wine produced. No white wines carry the Gigondas appellation.

History The name of the appellation is of Roman origin. Jocunditas means great pleasure and enjoyment in Latin with the town being founded as a recreational site for the soldiers from the Roman Second Legion. The finding of a Bacchus-head indicates that wine was already grown at this time. Later the fields went to the church and later still, one finds the Prince of Orange to be a large land owner in the area. As early as 1894 the wines from the region won a gold medal at the agricultural fair in Paris. But until the beginning of World War II, the wines were used as reinforcement to thin Burgundies. In 1956, a bitter winter caused the production of wine to experience a renaissance, as the olive trees had died from the cold. In 1971 the appellation left the other Côtes du Rhône-Villages behind, and became a proper appellation in its own right.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 151 Climate and geography Gigondas, along with the rest of Southern Rhône has a Mediterranean climate that differs from its northern neighbour, which has a more continental climate. The main geographical feature in Gigondas is the Dentelles de Montmirail, a small range of mountains that divide the appellation into two distinct areas – one with a cooler climate and one with a hotter. But elevation is also an important factor, as wine is being harvested as high as 600 meters.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 152 Grapes and wine Detailed map of Rhône wine In 1592, white wine from Gigondas is mentioned. However, no white wine is produced today. The appellation is growing red grapes only, and mostly making only red wine, though some rosé is also produced. According to the INAO, Gigondas Rouge is to be made from a maximum 80% Grenache, a minimum 15% Syrah and/or Mourvedre, and a maximum 10% from the other Rhône varietals, minus Carignan., INAO Gigondas. The greatest Gigondas’ can be kept for 10 years or more in the cellar and usually benefits from at least three years in the cellar. Being primarily Grenache does, however, mean that the lesser wines are not recommended for extended bottle aging.Niels Lillelund: Rhône-Vinene JP Bøger - JP/Politikens Forlagshus A/S, 2004. , p. 152-153 =Winemaking= Gigondas is known for its power rather than its elegance. Some parts of the appellation are warmer than Châteauneuf-du-Pape, bringing the generous Grenache grape close to fortified strength in alcohol.

Development and service The project was initiated in response to a request in 1938 from the Swedish air force for a reconnaissance aircraft that could replace the Fokker S 6. Design work began at the end of the 1930s as the L 10 by ASJA, but after the merger with Saab in 1939 it was renamed Saab 17. The wings were reinforced to make it possible for use as a dive bomber. Since there was a shortage of engines the aircraft were flown to their destination, where the engines were removed and returned for use by the next delivery. The aircraft was also made in three versions with different engines. Two prototype L-10 aircraft were ordered, the first being powered by a Nohab-built Bristol Mercury XII and the second by a Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp. The production B 17A used a Swedish-built Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp, the B 17B a Svenska Flygmotor AB (SFA)-built Bristol Mercury XXIV, and the B 17C a Piaggio P.XI. The aircraft could be fitted with wheels, skis or floats. A unique feature of the Saab 17 was its use of the extended landing gear assembly, with its large covers, as dive brakes. Operational history The first test flight was on 18 May 1940 and first deliveries to the Flygvapnet (Swedish Air Force) were in 1942. The development of the turbojet meant it had a short service history, but when the B 17 ended Swedish service in 1947–50, 46 were sold to Ethiopia, remaining in service until 1968. Two B 17As were sold to Finland in 1959 and 1960, serving as target tugs for the Finnish Air Force, both succumbing to accidents fairly quickly. For some months from very early 1945 fifteen B 17As were issued to DANFORCE (Danish Brigade of 5000 men in Sweden). However, as things unfolded with the German surrender, there was no need for them in the liberation of Denmark, and the aircraft were returned to the Flygvapnet a couple of months after the surrender.

The name came about on air after the station had played a promo for Triple J's metal show, Full Metal Racket. The pair had an impromptu conversation, making reference to the names of many metal bands. Anderson asked Spencer what his favourite metal band was, and Spencer, put on the spot, gave the fake name \\"Salmon Hater\\", as a \\"premier fishcore\\" band with a lead singer named Torv. Other details made up about the band were that they hailed from the hills of Glenelg (in Adelaide, South Australia. Glenelg is quite a flat suburb - when informed of this, Spencer stated that they were \\"underground hills\\") where they were part of the local \\"Fish Metal\\" scene (along with other non-existent bands such as \\"Trout Destroyer\\" and \\"Red Goering\\") and that their latest single was \\"6.66 - One Hundredth of the Number of the Beast\\". The title originated from the stereotypical \\"satanic\\" metal theme (e.g. Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast, etc.), and Spencer's love for mathematics. Within a couple of days, a listener, Mitch Hertz had created a metal song by the given title for the duo to play on-air. Spencer and Anderson encouraged listeners to vote for the song in the annual Triple J Hottest 100 poll, for which votes were only a few days away from closing. Many people were surprised that the track reached number 26 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2002, and some fans of other bands were upset that Anderson and Spencer had influenced the music poll. Other Triple J fans felt that the orchestrated campaign and the eventual ranking of the song reduced respect for the Hottest 100, and proved it as a sham. Lead singer \\"Torv\\" gave a studio interview, and fans wore Salmon Hater t-shirts to the Big Day Out on the Gold Coast and in Melbourne. The Australian music television program Rage usually plays the Hottest 100 a couple of months after the countdown. This meant there would be an opportunity for a music video to accompany the track to be broadcast. Many volunteers assembled for the filming of the music video, which was broadcast not only on Rage, but is available on the Hottest 100 Vol. 10 DVD release as well. Salmon Hater produced three other songs, two with video clips 'You are what I eat' and 'codpiece face' both clips can be found on YouTube the other song - titled \\"Shark Sandwich\\" - but have not released any further works, though unverified details of its past discography have been published on many fan sites.

History  The production of fortified wine was introduced in 1934, and in 1944, the Rasteau AOC for VDN wines was created, with effect from the 1943 vintage. Dry red wines from the same area traditionally had to be sold under the Côtes du Rhône Villages designation. From 1996, Rasteau was one of the village names that could be added to Côtes du Rhône Villages. In 2002, the Rasteau winegrower's syndicate requested that Rasteau should become its own appellation. This was finally approved by INAO in 2010, effective from the 2009 vintage.  Grape varieties  A vin doux naturel from Rasteau made from Grenache Main grape varieties for the fortified wines are Grenache noir, Grenache gris and Grenache blanc. All grape varieties allowed for red, rosé or white Côtes du Rhône (a total of 18 varieties in addition to the Grenaches) are also allowed as accessory grape varieties for Rasteau AOC, and are limited to a total of 10%. Red Rasteau is typically produced from 100% Grenache noir.  Appellation regulations  The fortified wines are produced from grape which must reach a maturity of at least 252 grams sugar per liter must, or close to 15 per cent of potential alcohol, which corresponds to very mature grapes. The allowed base yield is 30 hectoliter per hectare. The wine must be fortified by the addition of neutral alcohol (with a minimum strength of 96 per cent by volume), the volume of which must correspond to 5 to 10 per cent of the volume of the grape must. The alcohol level of the finished wine must be at least 15 per cent, and a maximum of 21.5 per cent by volume, and the sugar content at least 45 grams per liter. There are two special designations which can be used for Rasteau wines: * Wines marked Hors d'âge must be stored for five years before it is sold. * Wines marked Rancio must have been subjected to the typical oxidative treatment of that wine style.

Originally produced from 100% Clairette, Aligoté and Muscat are now included. It is usually drunk as an aperitif but it can equally accompany a meal. It contains less alcohol then most other sparkling wines : ca. 7 or 8 % where 12 is usual for some other sparkling wines. Location, soil and history East of the town of Valence, the vineyards of Die in the French department of the Drôme on the border area between the northern and southern sub-regions of the Côtes du Rhône AOC area, in the Rhône wine region, at altitudes of up to 700 metres are among the highest in France.Official web site: Soils Retrieved 13 October 2009 The chalky argilliferous soil has the feature of being able to retain enough of its rainwater to maintain a constant supply to the vines during the long dry summers. Although the Die region stands isolated in an area of otherwise very little wine production between the northern and southern wine producing parts of the Rhône valley, the making of Clairette de Die can be traced back over two thousand years.Official web site: Origins Retrieved 13 October 2009 In 1971, the method of production of Clairette de Die wine was officially recognised as the \\"ancestral Dioise process\\" in 1971. Clairette received its first distinction, the AO (appellation d'origine) in 1910, and the AOC was established in 1942.Syndicat de l'AOC de Die Local lore According to one vineyard that operates a private museum in Le Diois France, the process was found accidentally by a Gallic shepherd. The shepherd was using the cool waters of La Drôme river to chill a bottle of local wine. The bottle was forgotten and left in the cold water over the Winter. Upon finding it in the Spring it was found to be carbonated or in French pétillant, a word that roughly translates into the common English word sparkling. Subsequent to the original discovery, Gallic tribes left jars of the wine in rivers over the winter and then recovered them in the spring. The first documented description of the wine came from Roman author Pliny the Elder. Other wines from the Die region Coteaux de Die - A still (non sparkling) dry white wine produced from 100% clairette that was accorded an AOC in 1993. The low annual production is about 144 hectolitres. Characterised by green tints, it is usually drunk chilled and can accompany seafood. Châtillon-en-Diois - A still (non sparkling) wine available in three colours that was accorded an AOC in 1975. The red and rosé are produced from gamay, pinot noir and syrah and are produced only from the vineyards around the village of the same name while the white wine is produced by thirteen communes.

She was brought up mainly in Brussels, and educated there, at Somerville College, Oxford and University College, London. During World War II she worked at Bletchley Park as a WAAF in intelligence, later completing her university degree. She then worked for a time in London as a literary journalist and scholar. She was married three times: to Rodney Bax, whom she met at Bletchley Park; to the poet Jerzy Pietrkiewicz; and briefly to Claude Brooke. On separating from Pietrkiewicz in 1968 she moved to France, teaching at the University of Paris, Vincennes, from 1968 to 1988. After she retired she lived in the south of France. During Brooke-Rose's time at Bletchley Park \\"assessing intercepted German Communications\\", she mentioned how being exposed to that otherness, helped her in constructing her journey into becoming a novelist, making her aware of the \\"viewpoint of the other\\". In 1968, Brooke-Rose crossed the Channel, by this time Brooke-Rose had already separated from her second husband, Claude Brooke, this added to what was \\"Brooke-Rose's third marriage\\". Whilst teaching \\"linguistics and English literature at the University of Paris\\", in 1975, she became \\"professor of English and American literature and literary theory\\". In 1988, Brooke-Rose decided to \\"settle down in a village near Avignon\\", after deciding to retire from teaching in 1988. Her novel Remake (1996) is an autobiographical novel: :It is an autobiographical novel with a difference, using life material to compose a third-person fiction, transformed in an experiment whose tensions are those of memory – distorting and partial – checked by a rigorous and sceptical language which probes and finds durable forms underlying the impulses and passions of the subject. It is not a simple process of chronological remembering. Remake captures not facts but the contents of those facts, the feelings of a war-time child, the textures of her clothing, tastes and smells, her mother, an absent father, a gradual transformation into adulthood. She shared the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction for Such (1966). She was also known as a translator from French, in particular of works by Robbe-Grillet.

Support The City of Sydney is a major supporter of the Sydney Peace Prize. This involves a significant financial contribution along with other in-kind support in order to foster peace with justice. The prize Over three months each year, the Sydney Peace Prize jury – comprising seven individuals who represent corporate, media, academic and community sector interests – assesses the merits of the nominees' efforts to promote peace with justice. It is awarded to an organisation or individual: * who has made significant contributions to global peace including improvements in personal security and steps towards eradicating poverty, and other forms of structural violence * whose role and responsibilities enable the recipient to use the prize to further the cause of peace with justice * whose work illustrates the philosophy and principles of non-violence Considerations The jury has been prepared to make some controversial choices. Sydney Peace Foundation Founder, Emeritus Professor Stuart Rees, said, \\"The initiators of the Sydney Peace Prize aimed to influence public interest in peace with justice, an ideal which is often perceived as controversial. The choice of a non-controversial candidate for a peace prize would be a safe option but unlikely to prompt debate or to increase understanding.

It had 1 (model ZL-1) or 2 MB (model ZL-2) of RAM, ran MS-DOS 3.3 Plus from ROM, had a 640×200 LCD display and CGA and composite monochrome outputs. The Minisport was one of the first actual subnotebooks, apart from a contemporary NEC model. Features * Internal 2-inch \\"LT\\" floppy disk drive (793 KB formatted, double-sided, double-density, 80 tracks, 245 tpi, media: Fujifilm LT-1). The floppy disks typically cost $80 for ten of them. The disks were not compatible with two-inch \\"VF\\" video floppy diskettes. * An external standard 3.5-inch 720 KB double-density floppy drive was available as well. * Built-in FastLynx transfer software that could install itself on any other DOS computer over a serial cable without the need for any pre-existing software on the remote system. It relied on the user typing in a DOS mode command on the other computer, which transferred control of that computer's command line to the Zenith over the serial line. The software then copied itself across, and the user could then move files. This to some extent compensated for the fact that no other computer ever used the 2-inch floppy disks, thus rendering floppy transfers impractical. * The ability to set aside some of its upper memory (typically the 384 KB area between 640 KB and 1 MB) as a battery-backed RAM disk; this was relatively unique in DOS-based laptops (others, like the Toshiba T1000 also supported RAM disks). The RAM disk appeared as C: in DOS and enabled the computer to run with no spinning disks, extending battery life and increasing reliability. Contents were preserved with the power off, though using a minuscule amount of current from the main battery. * Later versions included an integral 20 MB hard disk.

The term is a bahuvrihi compound from: **'Gaura' (Sanskrit गौर) which means 'fair', 'gold', 'yellow', and 'saffron' (in complexion) ** 'Anga' (or 'aGga', Sanskrit अङ्ग) which means 'limb', 'constituent', and 'component part' (of Krishna)  Gaudiya Vaishnavism  The deity of shadabhuja gauranga to commemorate Chaitanya Mahaprabhu manifesting as Vishnu at the Ganga mata math in Puri the term 'Gauranga' is relevant in Gaudiya Vaishnavism due to scriptural verses such as the following found in the Bhagavata Purana (Disciples of Swami Prabhupada translation; Sankrit in square brackets \\"[ ]\\" and emphasis added): 'Krsna' (or 'Krishna', Sanskrit कृष्ण) means 'black'; 'Akṛṣṇam' ('a-krsna-m') means 'not black' or 'golden'. 'Gauranga' refers to the golden skin complexion of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, most notable for popularising the 16 syllable \\"Hare Krishna\\" maha-mantra, also known as the Nama-Sankirtan (congregational chanting of the Holy-names of the Lord): On this kind of scriptural basis, Lord Chaitanya is considered to be an avatar of the Supreme Lord Krishna. In essence, Lord Chaitanya appeared by His causeless mercy in this age of Kali Yuga to deliver us by spreading Yuga- Dharma (dharma, or duty, relevant to a given age), in this instance via chanting of the Holy names of the Lord as the easiest means of achieving liberation (moksha). This mantra is intended to spread love for God without seeing any mundane qualification or characteristic such as color, cast, creed, or nationality. He came as a devotee of the Lord to teach the conditioned souls how to discharge devotional service properly. The master is teaching the servant by his own example. Therefore, the path chalked out by Lord Chaitanya is taken as the most perfect by all the acharyas (learned authorities from disciplic sucession). Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Prabhupada, the spiritual master of A.C. Bhativedanta Swami Prabhupada has sung: Śrī-kṛṣṇa- Caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya (Lord Shri Krishna Caitanya is non-different from Radha-Krishna) - as He Lord Chaitanya is Krishna himself in the mood of his best devotee - Shrimati Radharani - who excels everyone in her service, love and devotion to the Lord. His principle teachings are that the soul or the living entity is the eternal servant of Lord Krishna and it can obtain true happiness only by serving him with love and devotion and that the chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the only means of spiritual realization in this age. =Hare Krishna movement= Within ISKCON, A. C.

Therefore one should not consider one name to be more potent than the other.\\" A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada from Chaitanya Charitamrita purport, Adi-Lila, Chapter 8, Text 31. . A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada distributed Krishna Consciousness throughout the entire world in only ten short years after he had departed from India on His preaching mission as instructed by his Guru Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupada.

A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada promoted singing Gauranga's Name and dancing in the streets as one of the most important and effective ways to help distribute the mercy of Lord Gauranga.

In 1946, with the birth of the Italian Republic (Repubblica Italiana), the Regia Marina changed its name to Marina Militare (\\"Military Navy\\"). Origins Regia Marina naval jack until 1900 The Regia Marina was established on 17 March 1861 following the proclamation of the formation of the Kingdom of Italy. Just as the Kingdom was a unification of various states in the Italian peninsula, so the Regia Marina was formed from the navies of those states, though the main constituents were the navies of the former kingdoms of Sardinia and Naples. The new Navy inherited a substantial number of ships, both sail- and steam-powered, and the long naval traditions of its constituents, especially those of Sardinia and Naples, but also suffered from some major handicaps. Firstly, it suffered from a lack of uniformity and cohesion; the Regia Marina was a heterogeneous mix of equipment, standards and practice, and even saw hostility between the officers from the various former navies. These problems were compounded by the continuation of separate officer schools at Genoa and Naples, and were not fully addressed until the opening of a unified Naval Academy at Livorno in 1881. Secondly, unification occurred during a period of rapid advances in naval technology and tactics, as typified by the launch of by France in 1858, and later by the appearance of, and battle between, and in 1862. These innovations quickly made older warships obsolete. Italy did not possess the shipyards or infrastructure to build the modern ships required, but the then Minister for the Navy, Admiral Carlo di Persano, launched a substantial programme to purchase warships from foreign yards. =Seven Weeks War= The Sea Battle of Lissa, by Carl Frederik Sørensen, 1868 The new navy's baptism of fire came on 20 July 1866 at the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence (parallel to the Seven Weeks War). The battle was fought against the Austrian Empire and occurred near the island of Vis in the Adriatic sea. This was one of the few fleet actions of the nineteenth century, and as a major sea battle that involved ramming, it is often considered to have had a profound effect on subsequent warship design and tactics. The Italian fleet, commanded by Admiral Persano, mustered 12 ironclad and 17 wooden-hulled ships, though only one, , was of the most modern turret ship design. Despite a marked disadvantage in numbers and equipment, superior handling by the Austrians under Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff resulted in a severe defeat for Italy, which lost two armoured ships and 640 men. =Decline and resurgence= After the war, the Regia Marina passed through some difficult years as the naval budget was substantially reduced, thus impairing the fleet's efficiency and the pace of new construction; only in the 1870s, under Simone Pacoret de Saint Bon's ministry, did the situation begin to improve. In 1881, the battleship was commissioned, followed in 1882 by the battleship ; at the time these were the most powerful warships in the world, and signalled the Italian fleet's renewed power. In 1896 the corvette Magenta completed a circumnavigation of the world. The following year the Regia Marina conducted experiments with Guglielmo Marconi in the use of radio communications. 1909 saw the first use of aircraft with the fleet. An Italian naval officer, Vittorio Cuniberti, was the first in 1903 to envision in a published article the all-big gun battleship design, which would be later come to be known as dreadnought. =Italo-Turkish War= In 1911 and 1912, the Regia Marina was involved in the Italo-Turkish War against forces of the Ottoman Empire. As the majority of the Ottoman fleet stayed behind the relative safety of the Dardanelles, the Italians dominated the Mediterranean during the conflict winning victories against Ottoman light units at the battles of Preveza and Beirut. In the Red Sea the Italian forces were vastly superior to those of the Ottomans who possessed only a squadron of gunboats there. These were destroyed while attempting to withdraw into the Mediterranean at the Battle of Kunfuda Bay. World War I MAS boats Before 1914, the Kingdom of Italy built six dreadnought battleships: ( as a prototype; , and of the ; and and of the ), but they did not participate in major naval actions in World War I, as they were positioned to intercept a major sortie of the Austro-Hungarian Navy which never came. During the war, the Regia Marina spent its major efforts in the Adriatic Sea, fighting the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The resulting Adriatic Campaign of World War I consisted mainly of Austro-Hungarian coastal bombardments of Italy's Adriatic coast, and wider-ranging German/Austro-Hungarian submarine warfare into the Mediterranean. Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the German/Austro-Hungarian navies in the Adriatic, which was successful in regards to surface units, but failed for the submarines, which found safe harbours and easy passage into and out of the area for the whole of the war. Considered a relatively minor part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces. For most of the war the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies each kept a relatively passive watch over their adversaries. The Italian fleet lost the pre-dreadnought battleship at Brindisi (27 September 1915) and the dreadnought at Taranto (2 August 1916) due to a magazine explosion (although there were rumours of Austrian sabotage). In the last part of the war, the Regia Marina developed new weapons: the MAS boats, that sank the Austro-Hungarian battleship in the Adriatic Sea on 10 June 1918; and an early type of human torpedo (Mignatta) entered the harbour of Pula and sank the Austro-Hungarian flagship on 1 November 1918 shortly after the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy was turned over to the newly founded neutral State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The battleship (sister of the former two) was handed over to Italy as a war prize in 1919. Interwar years During the interwar years the Italian government set about modernizing the Regia Marina in a way that could enable it to reach dominance over the Mediterranean Sea. Italian naval construction was limited by the Washington Naval Conference. The 1922 treaty required a parity in naval forces between the Italian and French navies, with equality in total displacement in battleships and carriers. The treaty influenced the development of the Italian fleet over the years between the two world wars. Between the late twenties and early thirties a construction program began, focusing first on cruisers up to 10,000 tons, followed by the building of destroyers and submarines, and lastly the construction of the new s; plans were also put in place to modernize the and s. Much of these new naval units were responses to French naval constructions, as the Marine nationale was seen until the mid 1930s as the most likely enemy in a hypothetical conflict. The Regia Marina chose to build fast ships armed with longer ranged guns to give the Italian vessels the ability to minimize close contact with vessels of the Royal Navy, whose crews were more experienced. In theory this would allow them to engage or break off at their own choosing, and would allow them to hit the enemy when he could not yet hit back. New guns were developed with longer ranges than their British counterparts of similar caliber. Speed was emphasized in their new construction. Italian cruisers built in the 1920s, such as were built with a newly designed and relatively thin armour.. This would have a decisive role in a number of naval battles, including the Battle of Cape Spada. Later classes, such as the and classes, were built to a more balanced design with thicker armor. Caio Duilio after refitting The modernization work on the four Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305 mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320 mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated. To increase speed the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters were added to the ship's length to improve the coefficient of fineness. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the s and the s, both of which carried larger guns and heavier armour. Though scientific research on tracking devices such as radar and sonar was being conducted in Italian universities and military laboratories by men such as Ugo Tiberio and Guglielmo Marconi, the conservative Italian leadership had little interest in these new technologies, and did not use them to improve the effectiveness of the Italian vessels. This was mainly due to the influence of Admiral Domenico Cavagnari, whom Mussolini appointed as Chief of Staff of the Navy in 1933, and whom he later promoted to Secretary of the Navy. Likewise technological advancement in radio range finders and gunnery control devices for night combat were not incorporated. Regarding such devices, Cavagnari emphasized \\"not wanting traps in your way\\". Writing to Admiral Iachino, he wrote \\"procedere con estrema cautela nell'accettare brillanti novità tecniche che non siano ancora collaudate da una esperienza pratica sufficientemente lunga\\", which can be translated to \\"proceed with extreme caution regarding brilliant technical innovations that have not yet been tested or with which there is no practical experience\\". Thus, the Italian navy entered the Second World War with a marked technical inferiority to the British Navy. German General Albert Kesselring, overall commander of Axis forces in the Mediterranean, observed that the Italian navy was \\"a good weather\\" force, unable to operate effectively at night or in heavy seas. New York, 1976 Two training ships were built during this period, in addition to the effort to modernize and re-equip the combat vessels of the navy. These were square rigged school ships the Regia Marina ordered in 1925. The sailing ships followed a design by Lieutenant Colonel Francesco Rotundi of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, reminiscent of ships of the line from the Napoleonic era. The first of these two ships, , was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy for training until 1943. After World War II, this ship was handed over to the Soviet Union as part of war reparations and was shortly afterwards decommissioned. The second ship of the design was . The ship was built in 1930 at the (formerly Royal) Naval Shipyard of Castellammare di Stabia (Naples). She was launched on 22 February 1931, and was put into service in July of that year. She is still being used to this day. In 1928, the unified command of the \\"Armata Navale\\" was abolished, and the fleet was divided in two squadrons (Squadre navali), one based at La Spezia and the other based at Taranto. =Italo-Ethiopian War= Cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli during a visit to Australia in 1938 The Regia Marina played a limited role in the invasion of Ethiopia. While the Ethiopian Empire was landlocked, the navy was instrumental in delivering and supplying the invasion forces through Somali and Eritrean ports. =Spanish Civil War= At the time of the Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Regia Marina sent naval units in support of the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie). Approximately 58 Italian submarines took part in operations against Republican naval forces of Spain. These submarines were organized in a Submarine Legion and complemented German U-boat operations as part of Operation Ursula. At least two Republican freighters, one Soviet and another Panamanian were either sunk or forced to run aground by Italian destroyers near the Strait of Sicily.Greene and Masignani, pp. 22–23 Two light cruisers took part in the shelling of Barcelona and Valencia in 1937, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 civilians.Greene and Massignani, p. 22 =Albania= In 1939, the Regia Marina supported the invasion of Albania. All ground forces involved in the invasion had to cross the Adriatic Sea from mainland Italy and the crossings were accomplished without incident. World War II Vittorio Veneto and Littorio on trials The Italian landing at Sitia, Crete, on 27 May 1941, was one of the few amphibious operations carried out by Italian forces. On 10 June 1940, following the German invasion of France and the lowlands, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom and entered World War II. Italy went to war with the fourth largest navy in the world. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini saw the control of the Mediterranean Sea as an essential prerequisite for expanding his \\"New Roman Empire\\" into Nice, Corsica, Tunis and the Balkans. Italian naval building accelerated during his tenure. Mussolini described the Mediterranean as \\"Mare Nostrum\\" (Our Sea).Mollo, p.94 Before the declaration of war, Italian ground and air forces prepared to strike at the beaten French forces across the border in the Italian invasion of France. By contrast, the Regia Marina prepared to secure the lines of communications between Italy, Libya and the East African colonies. The Italian High Command (Comando Supremo) did not approve of the plan devised by the Italian Naval Headquarters (Supermarina) to occupy a weakly defended Malta,Piekalkiewicz, p. 82 which proved a crucial mistake. The British, thinking Malta could not be defended due to the proximity of Italian air bases in Italy, Sicily, and Libya, had put little effort into bolstering the islands' defences. Thus, at the outset of the war there were only 42 anti- aircraft guns on the island and twelve Gloster Sea Gladiators, half sitting in crates at the wharf.Taylor 1974, p. 181. Entering the war, the Regia Marina was operating under a number of limitations. Though significant assets were available to challenge the Royal Navy for control of the Mediterranean, there had been a lack of emphasis on the incorporation of technological advances such as radar and sonar. This meant that in night engagements or foul weather, the Italian ships were unable to detect the approach of their British adversaries. When engaged, they could only range their guns if they were able to visually locate their targets. The Regia Marina had six battleships with which to contend for control of the Mediterranean, the four most modern of which were being re-fitted at the outbreak of the war. In addition to the six capital ships, the Italians had 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Though the Regia Marina had a number of fast new cruisers with good range in their gunnery, the older classes were lightly built and had inadequate defensive armor. Numerically the Italian fleet was formidable, but there were a large number of older vessels, and the service suffered in general from insufficient time at sea for crew training. Italy's lack of raw materials meant that they would have great difficulty building new ships over the course of the war. Thus, the assets they did have were handled with caution by Supermarina. Whereas Allied commanders at sea had a fair degree of autonomy and discretion to fight their vessels as circumstance allowed, Italian commanders were required to confer with their headquarters before committing their forces in an engagement that might result in their loss. This led to delays in arriving at decisions and actions being avoided, even when the Italians had a clear advantage. An example occurred during \\"Operation Hats\\", in which the Regia Marina had superior forces but failed to commit them to take advantage of the opportunity.Tobagi pp. 30–31 A further key disadvantage in the convoy support and interception battles that dominated the Battle of the Mediterranean was the intelligence advantage granted to the British in intercepting German Ultra and, through this, the key information on Italian convoy routes, times of departure, time of arrival, and make up of the convoy. The warships of the Regia Marina had a general reputation as being well-designed. Italian small attack craft lived up to expectations and were responsible for many successful actions in the Mediterranean. Though Italian warships lacked radar, this was partly offset in fair weather by good optical rangefinder and fire-control systems.Luciano Garibaldi, Century of War (2001) The Italian Navy lacked a fleet air arm. The high command had reasoned that since the Italian navy would be operating solely in the Mediterranean, their vessels would never be far from an airfield, thus the time and resources needed to develop a naval air arm could be directed elsewhere. This proved problematic on a number of occasions. Though the Italians did have the aircraft carriers and under construction at the start of the war, neither one was ever completed. Lastly, the lack of natural oil reserves and subsequent shortage of oil precluded extensive fleet operations. =Mediterranean= in Alexandria harbour surrounded by anti-torpedo nets. Regia Marina divers heavily damaged her on 19 December 1941. The Regia Marina and the Royal Navy engaged in a two-and-a-half-year struggle for control of the Mediterranean. The Regia Marinas primary goal was to support the Axis forces in North Africa while obstructing the supply route to Alexandria and cutting off supplies to Malta. The Royal Navy's major effort was to maintain supply to the military forces and people of Malta, and secondarily to interdict convoy shipments to North Africa.Coggins p. 179 The first major action occurred on 11 November 1940 when the British aircraft carrier launched two waves of Swordfish torpedo-bombers in a surprise raid against the Italian Fleet moored at the naval base of Taranto. The raid came in undetected, and three battleships were sunk. Another major defeat was inflicted on the Regia Marina at Cape Matapan, where the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy intercepted and destroyed three heavy cruisers (, and ; all of the same class) and two s in a night ambush, with the loss of over 2,300 seamen. The Allies had Ultra intercepts, which uncovered the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the Italian debacle. On 19 December 1941, the battleships and were sunk in shallow water by limpet mines planted by Italian manned torpedoes, knocking both out of the conflict for almost two years. This action, coming on the heels of the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse in the South China Sea, significantly weakened the surface strength of the Royal Navy, making it difficult for them to challenge control of the eastern Mediterranean. On the night of 19 December, Force K, comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at Malta, ran into an Italian minefield off Tripoli. Three cruisers struck mines, with the cruiser lost, along with the destroyer . In addition, another destroyer was seriously damaged. All told 800 seamen were lost, and Force K, which had been effectively interdicting Axis convoys, was put out of action. This series of successes allowed the Regia Marina to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean. Coupled with an intensive bombing campaign against Malta, the Axis supply routes from southern Europe to North Africa were almost untouched by the Royal Navy or its allies for the next several months. sinking after Italian naval and aerial attack during Operation Harpoon The Italian fleet went on the offensive, blocking or mauling three large Allied convoys bound for Malta. This led to a number of naval engagements, including the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, Operation Harpoon and Operation Vigorous, (known as the \\"Battle of Mid-June\\") and Operation Pedestal (the \\"Battle of Mid-August\\"). All of these engagements were favourable to the Axis. Despite this activity, the only real success of the Italian Fleet was the surface attack on the Harpoon convoy, supported by Axis aerial forces. These attacks sank several Allied warships and damaged others. Only two transports of the original six in the convoy reached Malta. This was an undisputed squadron- sized victory for Italian surface forces in World War II. Despite the heavy losses suffered by the merchantmen and escorting forces of convoy Pedestal, the oil and supplies brought through allowed the near starving island of Malta to continue to hold out. With Allied landings in North Africa, Operation Torch, in November 1942, the fortunes of war turned against the Italians. Their sea convoys were harassed day after day by the aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies. The maritime lane between Sicily and Tunisia became known as the \\"route of death\\". After years of back and forth, the Axis forces were forced to surrender in Tunisia, bringing the campaign for North Africa to a close. The Regia Marina performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on speed but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced its main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany.Garibaldi, Century of War (2001) p. 151 =Atlantic= From 10 June 1940, submarines of the Regia Marina took part in the Battle of the Atlantic alongside the U-Boats of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. The Italian submarines were based in Bordeaux, France at the BETASOM base. While more suited for the Mediterranean Sea than the Atlantic Ocean, the thirty-two Italian submarines that operated in the Atlantic sank 109 Allied ships for a total of 593,864 tons. The Regia Marina even planned an attack on New York harbor with midget submarines for December 1942, but this plan was delayed for many reasons and was never carried out.Borghese, p. 262 =Red Sea= Initially, Italian forces enjoyed considerable success in East Africa. From 10 June 1940, the Regia Marina's Red Sea Flotilla, based at Massawa, Eritrea, posed a potential threat to Allied shipping crossing the Red Sea between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. This threat increased in August 1940 with the Italian conquest of British Somaliland, which allowed the Italians the use of the port of Berbera; in January 1941, however, British and Commonwealth forces launched a successful counterattack in East Africa and the threat posed by the Red Sea Flotilla disappeared. Much of the Red Sea Flotilla was destroyed by hostile action during the first months of war or when the port of Massawa fell in April 1941. However, there were a few survivors. In February 1941, prior to the fall of Massawa, the colonial ship and the auxiliary cruisers and broke out and sailed to Kobe, Japan. While Ramb I was sunk by the New Zealand cruiser off the Maldives, Eritrea and Ramb II made it to Kobe. As the port of Massawa was falling, four submarines—Guglielmo, Gauleo Ferraras, , and —sailed south from Massawa, rounded the Cape of Good Hope and ultimately sailed to German occupied Bordeaux, France. One or two Italian merchant ships from the Red Sea Flotilla made it to Vichy French-controlled Madagascar. On 10 June 1941 the British launched Operation Chronometer, landing a battalion of troops from the British Indian army at Assab, the last Italian-held harbour on the Red Sea.Rohwer & Hümmelchen (1992), p. 78 By 11 June, Assab had fallen. Two days later, on 13 June, the Indian trawler Parvati became the last naval casualty of the East African Campaign when it struck a moored mine near Assab.Shah, Mian Zahir (2001). Anecdotes of the Pakistan Navy. PN Book Club Publication, pp. 3–6. =Black Sea= \\"Dazzle\\" painted Italian World War II MAS boat. In May 1942, at German request, the Regia Marina deployed four 24 ton anti- submarine motorboats (Motoscafo Anti Sommergibile, MAS), six s, five torpedo motorboats, and five explosive motorboats to the Black Sea. The vessels were transported overland to the Danube River at Vienna, Austria, and then transported by water to Constanța, Romania. The flotilla had an active and successful campaign, based at Yalta and Feodosia. After Italy quit the war, most of the Italian vessels on the Black Sea were transferred to Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. In early 1944, six MAS boats were transferred to the Royal Romanian Navy.Antony Preston, Warship 2001–2002, Conway Maritime Press, 2001, p. 81 By August 1944, they were ultimately captured by Soviet forces when Constanța was captured. The five surviving midget submarines were transferred to the Royal Romanian Navy.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922–1946, Naval Institute Press, 1980, pp. 311 and 361W.M.

As part of Naval Detachment K, German, Italian, and Finnish vessels operated against Soviet gunboats, escorts and supply vessels during the Siege of Leningrad between 21 June and 21 October 1942. The Italian vessels were ultimately turned over to Finland. =Far East= The Regia Marina had a naval base in the concession territory of Tientsin in China. The primary Italian vessels based in China were the mine-layer Lepanto and the gunboat . During World War II, Italian supply ships, auxiliary cruisers and submarines operated throughout the waters of the Far East, often in disguise. The Italians also utilized Japanese- controlled port facilities such as Shanghai, China, and Kobe, Japan. Seven Italian submarines operating from France were converted by the Italians into \\"transport submarines\\" in order to exchange rare or irreplaceable trade goods with Japan. The submarines , , , , , , and were converted for service with the Monsun Gruppe (\\"Monsoon Group\\"). The name of Comandante Cappellini was changed to . Twelve additional R-class blockade running transport submarines were specifically designed for trade with the Far East, but only two of these vessels were completed before Italy quit the war. Both of these submarines were destroyed by Allied action almost as soon as they were launched. =Armistice of 1943= In 1943, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was deposed and the new Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. Under the terms of this armistice, the Regia Marina had to sail its ships to an Allied port. Most sailed to Malta, but a flotilla from La Spezia headed towards Sardinia. This was intercepted and attacked by German aircraft and the battleship was sunk by two hits from Fritz X guided glide-bombs. Among the 1600 sailors killed on board Roma was the Italian Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Carlo Bergamini.Carlo Bergamini, Biography by Pier Paolo Bergamini As vessels became available to the new Italian government, the Italian Co- Belligerent Navy was formed to fight on the side of the Allies. Other ships were captured in port by the Germans or scuttled by their crews. Few Regia Marina crews chose to fight for Mussolini's new fascist regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI). Mussolini's pro-German National Republican Navy (Marina Nazionale Repubblicana) hardly reached a twentieth the size attained by the co- belligerent Italian fleet.Mollo, p. 100 In the Far East, the Japanese occupied the Italian concession territory of Tiensin. There was little use for the surrendered Italian battleships and there was doubt about the loyalties of the crews, so these ships were interned in Egypt. In June 1944, the less powerful battleships (Andrea Doria, Caio Duilio and Giulio Cesare) were allowed to return to Augusta harbour in Sicily for training. The others, and Italia (ex-), remained at Ismaïlia in the Suez Canal until 1947. After the war, Giulio Cesare was passed to the Soviet Union. In the Co-belligerency period, until \\"VE\\" (Victory in Europe) Day, Italian light cruisers participated in the naval war in the Atlantic Ocean with patrols against German raiders. Smaller naval units (mainly submarines and torpedo boats) served in the Mediterranean Sea. In the last days of war, the issue of whether Italian battleships and cruisers should participate in the Pacific War was debated by the Allied leaders. There were also Italian naval units in the Far East in 1943 when the new Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. The reactions of their crews varied greatly. In general, surface units, mainly supply ships and auxiliary cruisers, either surrendered at Allied ports (Eritrea at Colombo, Ceylon) or, if in Japanese controlled ports, they were scuttled by their own crew (Conte Verde, Lepanto, and Carlotto at Shanghai). Ramb II was taken over by the Japanese in Kobe and renamed Calitea II. Four Italian submarines were in the Far East at the time of the armistice, transporting rare goods to Japan and Singapore: , (), , and . The crew of Ammiraglio Cagni heard of the armistice and surrendered to the Royal Navy off Durban, South Africa. Comandante Cappellini, Reginaldo Giuliani, and Luigi Torelli and their crews were temporarily interned by the Japanese. The boats passed to German U-boat command and, with mixed German and Italian crews, they continued to fight against the Allies. The German navy assigned new officers to the three submarines. The three were renamed , and and took part in German war operations in the Pacific. Reginaldo Giuliani was sunk by the British submarine in February 1944. In May 1945, the other two vessels were taken over by the Japanese Imperial Navy when Germany surrendered. About twenty Italian sailors continued to fight with the Japanese. Luigi Torelli remained active until 30 August 1945, when, in Japanese waters, this last Fascist Italian submarine shot down a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber of the United States Army Air Forces.Willmott, H p (2009). The Last Century of Sea Power: From Port Arthur to Chanak, 1894–1922. Indiana University Press, p. 276.  After World War II  After the end of hostilities, the Regia Marina started a long and complex rebuilding process. At the beginning of the war, the Regia Marina was the fourth largest navy in the world with a mix of modernised and new battleships. The important combat contributions of the Italian naval forces after the signing of the armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 and the subsequent cooperation agreement on 23 September 1943 left the Regia Marina in a poor condition. Much of its infrastructure and bases were unusable and its ports mined and blocked by sunken ships. However, a large number of its naval units had survived the war, albeit in a low efficiency state. This was due to the conflict and the age of many vessels. The vessels that remained were: * 2 incomplete and damaged aircraft carriers * 5 battleships * 9 cruisers * 11 destroyers * 22 frigates * 19 corvettes * 44 fast coastal patrol units * 50 minesweepers * 16 amphibious operations vessels * 2 school ships * 1 support ship and plane transport * various submarine units On 2 June 1946, the Italian monarchy was abolished by a popular referendum. The Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia) ended and was replaced by the Italian Republic (Repubblica Italiana). The Regia Marina became the Navy of the Italian Republic (Marina Militare).  Peace treaty  On 10 February 1947, a peace treaty was signed in Paris between the Italian Republic and the victorious powers of World War II. The treaty was onerous for the Italian Navy. Apart from territorial and material losses, the following restrictions were imposed: * A ban on owning, building or experimenting with atomic weapons, self-propulsion projectiles or related launchers * A ban on owning battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines and amphibious assault units. * A ban on operating military installations on the islands of Pantelleria and Pianosa; and the Pelagie Islands. * The total displacement, battleships excluded, of the future navy was not allowed to be greater than 67,500 tons, while the staff was capped at 25,000 men. The treaty also ordered Italy to put the following ships at the disposals of the victorious nations United States, Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Albania as war compensation: * 3 battleships: , , ; * 5 cruisers: , , , and ; * 7 destroyers; 5 of the , and ; * 6 minesweepers; * 8 submarines, including three of the ; * 1 sailing school ship: .

Kathrada's involvement in the anti-apartheid activities of the African National Congress (ANC) led him to his long-term imprisonment following the Rivonia Trial, in which he was held at Robben Island and Pollsmoor Prison. Following his release in 1990, he was elected to serve as a member of parliament, representing the ANC. He authored a book, No Bread for Mandela – Memoirs of Ahmed Kathrada, Prisoner No. 468/64. Early life Ahmed Kathrada was born in the small country town of Schweizer-Reneke in the Western Transvaal,Kathrada 2004, p. 373 the fourth of six children in a Gujarati Bohra family of South African Indian immigrant parents from Surat, Gujarat. Owing to his Indian origin and the policies of the time, he could not be admitted to any of the \\"European\\" or \\"African\\" schools in the area and thus he had to move to Johannesburg, 200 miles to the east, to be educated, where his best friend's name was Fali. Once in Johannesburg, he was influenced by leaders of the Transvaal Indian Congress such as Dr. Yusuf Dadoo, IC Meer, Moulvi and Yusuf Cachalia, and JN Singh. Consequently, he became a political activist at the early age of 12 when he joined the Young Communist League of South Africa. He took part in various activities such as handing out leaflets and performing volunteer work in the individual passive resistance against the Pegging Act in 1941. During World War II, he was involved in the anti-war campaign of the Non-European United Front. Political activist At the age of 17 he left school to work full-time for the Transvaal Passive Resistance Council in order to work against the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, commonly referred to as the \\"Ghetto Act\\", which sought to give Indians limited political representation and restricted where Indians could live, trade and own land. Kathrada was one of the two thousand volunteers imprisoned as a result of the campaign; he spent a month in a Durban jail. This was his first jail sentence for civil disobedience. Later, he was elected as the chair of the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress. While Kathrada was a student at the University of the Witwatersrand he was sent as a delegate of the Transvaal Indian Youth Congress to the 3rd World Festival of Youth and Students in East Berlin in 1951.Kathrada 2004, p. 374 He was elected as the leader of the large multi-racial South African delegation. He remained in Europe in order to attend a congress of the International Union of Students in Warsaw, and finally travelled to Budapest and worked at the headquarters of the World Federation of Democratic Youth for nine months. As result of the growing co-operation between the African and Indian Congresses in the 1950s, Kathrada came into close contact with African National Congress leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. He was one of 156 accused in the four- year Treason Trial which lasted from 1956 to 1960. Eventually, all of the accused were found not guilty. After the ANC and various other anti-apartheid organisations were banned in 1960, Kathrada continued his political activities despite repeated detentions and increasingly severe house arrest measures against him. To be free to continue his activities, Kathrada went underground early in 1962. Rivonia trial On 11 July 1963, Kathrada was arrested at the South African internal headquarters of Umkhonto we Sizwe (\\"The Spear of the Nation\\" – the military wing of the ANC) in Rivonia, near Johannesburg. Although Kathrada was not a member of Umkhonto we Sizwe, he became one of the accused in the famous Rivonia Trial, which started in October 1963. He was charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government and to start a guerrilla war. The trial ended in June 1964; Kathrada was sentenced to life imprisonment along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Andrew Mlangeni, Billy Nair, Elias Motsoaledi, Raymond Mhlaba and Denis Goldberg. Imprisonment Kathrada giving a tour of the Robben Island, where he was imprisoned between 1964 and 1982, to the then US President Barack Obama's family in 2013. For the following 18 years, Kathrada was confined to the Robben Island Maximum Security Prison off Cape Town along with most of his Rivonia Trial co-defendants. In October 1982, he was moved to Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison near Cape Town. While in jail on Robben Island and in pollsmoor, Kathrada completed Bachelor's degrees in History/Criminology as well as three other degrees, thanks to his family who paid the tuition fee. On 15 October 1989 Kathrada, along with Jeff Masemola, Raymond Mhlaba, Billy Nair, Wilton Mkwayi, Andrew Mlangeni, Elias Motsoaledi, Oscar Mpetha, and Walter Sisulu were released from Johannesburg prison.Mandela 1996, p. 174 Activities after release After the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990, Kathrada served on the interim leadership committees of both the ANC and the South African Communist Party. He resigned from the latter position when he was elected to the ANC National Executive Committee in July 1991. During the same year, he was appointed as head of ANC public relations as well as a fellow of the University of the Western Cape's Mayibuye Centre. Kathrada went on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1992. In the first all-inclusive democratic South African elections in 1994, Kathrada was elected as a member of parliament for the ANC. After refusing to accept a position in Mandela's cabinet as minister of correctional services stating that \\" I joined the struggle not for positions\\" in September 1994 he was appointed as the political advisor to President Mandela in the newly created post of Parliamentary Counsellor. In June 1999, Kathrada left parliamentary politics. In 1994 and 1995, Kathrada was elected as chairperson of the Robben Island Council. He remained the chairperson of the Robben Island Museum Council. On 27 October 2013, on the island, he launched the International Campaign to Free Marwan Barghouthi and All Palestinian Prisoners. Kathrada was married to Barbara Hogan, a recent Minister of Public Enterprises. In 2008 he founded the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation to continue his life's work. In 2017 Kathrada appeared along with remaining surviving co-defendants at the Rivonia Trial, Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg, along with lawyers Joel Joffe, George Bizos and Denis Kuny in a documentary film entitled “Life is Wonderful”, directed by Sir Nicholas Stadlen, which tells the story of the trial. The title reflects Goldberg's words to his mother at the end of the trial on hearing that he and his comrades had been spared the death sentence. Death Kathrada died at a medical centre in Johannesburg from complications of a cerebral embolism on 28 March 2017, aged 87. He was buried the next day in Johannesburg in accordance with Islamic rites at Westpark Cemetery where his funeral also took place there. The BBC described the funeral as \\"simple\\" with \\"nothing lavish or grand\\" in sight, and there was a tent \\"filled with people\\" who paid their last tribute. His funeral was attended by veterans of the struggle for freedom, ANC stalwarts, South African politicians, civil society and ordinary South Africans. Notable mourners were Former President Thabo Mbeki, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, last two remaining Rivonia trialists Denis Goldberg and Andrew Mlangeni, former South African lawyer of Rivonia trialists George Bizos, Graca Machel , Winnie Mandela, Sophia De Bruyn, EFF leader Julius Malema, including the Gauteng Premier David Makhura who made welcoming and the Former President Kgalema Motlanthe who was keynote speaker for the funeral and the Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan but he did not receive special attention, and he was axed the following day by president through cabinet reshuffle. President Jacob Zuma Kathrada's opponent did not attend the funeral in accordance with the family's wishes. Zuma ordered the South African flag to be flown at half-mast to mark Kathrada's death and postponed a cabinet meeting in order to allow cabinet members to attend the funeral. Honours and awards In addition to receiving the Isitwalandwe Award (the ANC's highest possible accolade) whilst still in prison in 1988, Kathrada has also been awarded four Honorary Doctorates, including the University of Missouri, Michigan State University, and the University of Kentucky. Kathrada was voted 46th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004. He was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman by the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs in 2005. On 18 July 2011, he and his wife were the chief guests on Nelson Mandela International Day at the United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, where he shared his views with children.

It is an arboreal and diurnal primate that lives in the forests of southern Nigeria. It should not be confused with the closely related species, the white-throated guenon (Cercopithecus erythrogaster), which occurs in Nigeria and Benin. Sclater's guenon was formerly classified as a subspecies of the red-eared guenon (C. erythrotis). The diet of Sclater's guenon is unknown. The species is likely primarily a frugivore that supplements its diet with other plant parts and insects, based on data from closely related species. Sclater's guenon was thought to be nearly extinct until the late 1980s. The species is now known to occur in several isolated populations between the Niger and Cross Rivers in southern Nigeria. This region falls in the Guinean Forests of the West Africa biodiversity hotspot. The species does not occur in any officially protected areas, but three populations of Sclater's guenon are known to be protected by local people who consider the monkeys to have sacred status. Mostly because of hunting and habitat fragmentation and loss, thus increasing population isolation and decline, Sclater's guenon is listed as a vulnerable species.

He was appointed Great Crown Podstoli in 1764, Ambassador to Berlin in 1765, Master of the Hunt of the Crown in 1766–1773, Artillery General of Lithuania in 1768–1773, Ambassador to Moscow in 1771, Crown Hetman in 1773 and was Great Crown Hetman of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth between 1774 and 1794.http://www.wilanow- palac.pl/franciszek_ksawery_branicki_ok_1730_1819_awanturnik_i_zdrajca.html In 1774 Stanisław August Poniatowski ceded to him, as mark of his confidence and esteem, the immense estate of Bila Tserkva in the Kiev Oblast.The estate remained in the Branicki family until the Russian Revolution He opposed the reforms of the Great Sejm (1788–1792), and supported the Hetman Party instead. During the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) he was sentenced by the Supreme Criminal Court, in absentia, to hang for treason, witness his decades long pro-Russian stance and anti-patriotic politics and plotting against the state, the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, he escaped the death penalty. Branicki was awarded the Order of the White Eagle in December 1764. He married Aleksandra von Engelhardt, a supposed niece of Prince Potemkin, in 1781 making him the putative son-in-law of Empress Catherine of Russia. Account of Branicki's deal with Prince Potemkin, followed by a quick trip to a spa for his \\"STD\\", then swift courtship of Alexandra Vasilyevna, the monstrous dowry and Catherine and prince Nikolai Vasilyeich Repnin's presence at the private wedding in the court chapel at St Petersburg. Biography Franciszek Ksawery was the son of Piotr Branicki, Chorąży of Halicz, and Melania Teresa Szembek, the chatelaine of Oświęcim. He started his career as a soldier in the Seven Years' War, firstly in the Russian Imperial army and later with the French. He distinguished himself at the battle of Sarbinowo (Zorndorf) in 1758 while commanding a squadron of Russian cavalry. For his services in the French army Louis XV awarded him the title of count, however, in Poland, prior to the partitions, the title was not officially recognized by parliament. In 1765 he became a Knight of the Order of Saint Stanislaus. He became a member of the Polish Sajm in 1762 representing the Russian voevodship (later known as Galichina). He inherited his father's noble titles. In 1764, Branicki was one of the Electors of Stanisław August Poniatowski who reigned as Stanisław II August. Branicki later became a member of the Military Commission of the Crown. In 1766, he gave a speech in the Sejm on behalf of Halicz county. Branicki was a strong supporter and member of the Radom Confederation and mostly focused on how to weaken the influence of Karol Stanisław \\"Panie Kochanku\\" Radziwiłł and possibly, on how to deprive Radziwiłł of his fortune. In 1767, as a member of the Repnin Sejm of Sochaczew, he became a member of the pro-Russian delegation, which was created under the Russian envoy Nikolai Repnin in order to review the function of the government of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a commander, Branicki decided to side with the king and faithfully led the Royal Polish Army in the years 1768–1772 and helped to suppress the supporters of the Bar Confederation who were Polish patriots. On June 19, 1768, together with Russian troops, he captured the city of Bar in Ruthenia, which served as the Bar's headquarters. Franciszek Ksawery Branicki In 1770, during the crisis in Russian-Polish relations, king Stanisław II Augustus, appointed him as his envoy to the Russian Empire, without consulting with the powerful Czartoryski family, who were normally responsible for nominating envoys, Sejm Marshals and Hetmans. On January 18, 1771 Branicki arrived in St. Petersburg, from where he warned king Stanisław that if the Russian delegation in Warsaw headed by general Kasper von Saldern could not reach agreement with the Polish Sejm, the Russian Empress would partition the country. So it came to pass. He and Suvorov armed the Jews in Crackow, the ancient capital of Poland for the seige of the Crackow castle. The French and Bar confederation garrison of the castle were kept as prisoners, but he declared that Poland had never been at war with France. In 1772 he went on a diplomatic mission to Paris to receive the French aid against partitions similar to the French aid to Bar confederation but in vain. Between 1773 and 1775 he was a member of a newly established secret party, responsible for confiscating the assets of the Society of Jesus in the entire country. For his \\"services\\", Stanisław Augustus rewarded him in 1774 by ceding to him the immense estate that was the county of Biała Cerkiew and appointed him Crown Hetman. In 1776 Branicki became a member of Andrzej Mokronowski's controversial political party. At the 1778 Sejm Branicki was appointed the adviser to the \\"Permanent Council's\\" Chief Marshal. Later he became a member of the Great Sejm and chairman of the Military Commission of the Commonwealth. He was an implacable opponent of the reforms proposed by the Sejm in its Constitution of May 3. In league with the Russian envoys in Warsaw, he co- founded the traitorous Confederation of Targowica.http://www.bryk.pl/s%C5%82owniki/s%C5%82ownik_historyczny/87875-branicki_franciszek_ksawery_1730_1819_herbu_korczak.html Branicki was included on Yakov Bulhakov's list, which included the names of people, mostly senators and deputies, on whom the Russians could rely and were keen to overthrow the latest Constitution, and possibly even the monarch himself. Throughout his career, Branicki had been one of the leaders of the pro-Russian political tendency. As a conservative, along with the founder of Bar confederation Bishop Kajetan Sołtyk, Branicki tried everything to keep his former Hetman privileges. Even as a determined counter-revolutionary, he supposedly refused to sign any treaty that sanctioned the partitioning of his homeland. However, because of his sympathies and cooperation with the Russians, Branicki was considered throughout the nineteenth century as a national traitor, along with all the leaders and members of the Targowica Confederation, which was essentially a conspiracy against the state and led to second and third partitions of Poland. Branicki held several important posts in the Commonwealth, as Crown Hetman, then Great Hetman. Additionally, he was commander of the Lithuanian artillery. On August 13, 1793, he resigned from that position in order to become a general in the Russian army. The ownership of vast estates, towns and villages in Ruthenia (Polish Ukraine) made him one of the most powerful and wealthy Polish magnates. His enduring rival was Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł, a zealous patriot and one of the richest men in Europe. After 1775 Branicki took up residence in Biała Cerkiew near Kiev, where he spent the last years of his life, having retired from politics and military service. Family Alexandria In 1781 already aged 51, Branicki contracted a strategic marriage with one of the leading members of the imperial court, Alexandra von Engelhardt, almost 25 years younger, the niece of Potemkin and, according to court gossips, his lover and even the illegitimate daughter of Catherine the Great. Reprint: Zakład Narodowy im. Ossolińskich, Kraków 1989, Though she most probably was not the daughter of Catherine II, the marriage sealed the Tsarina's foothold in the Commonwealth of Two Nations, already in the process of disintegration. The new Countess Branicka, who was inordinately close to Prince Potemkin until his death, became the Chatelaine of Biała Cerkiew amidst many other possessions across Poland and in what has now become the Ukraine. Despite her extra-marital interest, the marriage was said to be harmonious. Due to her business acumen and contacts, she was able to cover her husband's colossal debts. In return, he spent even more money in creating Alexandria, an impossibly lavish summer palace and park in her honour, making it the epitome of Polish classicism. They had five surviving children: Katarzyna Branicka Aleksander Branicki Władysław Grzegorz Branicki Zofia Branicka Elżbieta Branicka.Władysław Konopczyński, \\"Franciszek Ksawery Branicki”, Dictionary of National Biography, vol. II, Kraków: Polish Academy of Learning – Skład Główny w Księgarniach Gebethner i Wolff. 1936, p. 398. As a memorial to their children who did not survive, the couple had a waterfall and Folly constructed in the grounds of Alexandria. Treason =Death sentence= During the Kościuszko Insurrection, the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Poland sentenced him to death by hanging, to eternal infamy and to the confiscation of all his property and titles. Because of the absence of the accused, the sentence was carried out symbolically in absentia on September 29, 1794. His portrait, painted by an anonymous artist was hung from the gallows. The portraits of Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki and Hetman Seweryn Rzewuski, who were not captured either, but were convicted for treason, were also hung the same day. =Infamy= Constitution of 3 May 1791 by Jan Matejko Branicki's reputation was subsequently immortalized as a symbol of national treason by Poland's leading writers and artists, most notably by Stanisław Wyspiański. Branicki had been a brawler, but a close friend of King Stanisław II Augustus. He liked to give the impression of a great military strategist and leader – but according to historians, he hardly equalled the ability of Russian cavalry colonels, despite his supposed bravery during the Seven Years' War.http://www.historycy.org/index.php?showtopic=56486 After that conflict he was praised by some but hated by others, especially among the Polish royal court, who considered him an enemy to be quickly eliminated. He was seen as a stubborn and obstinate man, always claiming to know best. He was also generally disliked by the Polish nobility. Branicki was described as selfish and prone to overweening pride. He was in constant rivalry with other powerful magnates such as, Karol Stanisław \\"Panie Kochanku\\" Radziwiłł. Trivia In 1766, as a result of a pistol duel over an Italian actress in Warsaw with the adventurer and notorious predator, Giacomo Casanova, who happened to be in Poland at that time, Branicki sustained a serious wound to his stomach. Casanova was injured in the hand and was recommended an amputation which he declined. They both survived. Representations in art He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of May 3, 1791. Branicki's greed, treason and baronial excesses appear in Stanisław Wyspiański's drama, The Wedding (Wesele).

Introduction The Norman language was introduced to England during the rule of William the Conqueror. Following the Norman conquest, the Norman language became the language of England's nobility. During the whole of the 12th century the Anglo-Norman language (the variety of Norman used in England) was similar to Latin in the distinction of being the literary language of England, and it was in use at the court until the 14th century. During the reign of Henry IV, English became the native tongue of the kings of England. The language had undergone certain changes which distinguished it from the Old Norman spoken in Normandy, as can be seen from graphical characteristics, from which certain rules of pronunciation are to be inferred. An Anglo-Norman variety of French continued to exist into the early 15th century, though it was in decline at least from the 1360s, when it was deemed insufficiently well known to be used for pleading in court. Great prestige continued to be enjoyed by the French language, however; in the late 14th century, the author of the Manière de language calls French: :...le plus bel et le plus gracious language et plus noble parler, apres latin d'escole, qui soit au monde et de touz genz mieulx prisée et amée que nul autre (quar Dieux le fist si douce et amiable principalement à l'oneur et loenge de luy mesmes. Et pour ce il peut comparer au parler des angels du ciel, pour la grand doulceur et biaultée d'icel), which means: :...the most beautiful and gracious language, and the most noble speech in the world, after school Latin; better prized and loved by all people over any other (for God made it so sweet and lovable mainly for his own honour and praise. And it can thus be compared to the angels' speech in heaven for its great sweetness and beauty). Somewhat ironically, the text contains many features that distinguish insular from continental French. The most flourishing period of Anglo-Norman literature was from the beginning of the 12th century to the end of the first quarter of the 13th. The end of this period coincides with the loss of the French provinces to Philip Augustus, and is more accurately denoted by the appearance of the history of William the Marshal in 1225 (published for the Société de l'histoire de France, by Paul Meyer, 3 vols., 1891–1901). It owes its brilliancy largely to the protection accorded by Henry II of England to the men of letters of his day. :\\"He could speak French and Latin well, and is said to have known something of every tongue between the Bay of Biscay and the Jordan. He was probably the most highly educated sovereign of his day, and amid all his busy active life he never lost his interest in literature and intellectual discussion; his hands were never empty, they always had either a bow or a book\\". Wace and Benoît de Sainte-More compiled their histories at his bidding, and it was in his reign that Marie de France composed her poems. An event with which he was closely connected, viz. the murder of Thomas Becket, gave rise to a whole series of writings, some of which are purely Anglo-Norman. In his time appeared the works of Béroul and Thomas of Britain respectively, as well as some of the most celebrated of the Anglo-Norman romans d'aventure. It is important to keep this fact in mind when studying the different works which Anglo-Norman literature has left us. We will examine these works briefly, grouping them into narrative, didactic, hagiographic, lyric, satiric and dramatic literature.  Narrative literature  = Epic and romance = The French epic came over to England at an early date. It is believed that the Chanson de Roland (Song of Roland) was sung at the battle of Hastings, and some Anglo- Norman manuscripts of chansons de geste have survived to this day. The Pélérinage de Charlemagne (Eduard Koschwitz, Altfranzösische Bibliothek, 1883) for instance, is only preserved in an Anglo-Norman manuscript of the British Museum (now lost), although the author was certainly a Parisian. The oldest manuscript of the Chanson de Roland that we possess is also a manuscript written in England, and amongst the others of less importance we may mention La Chançun de Willame, the MS. of which has (June 1903) been published in facsimile at Chiswick. cite cf. Paul Meyer, Romania, xxxii. 597–618. Although the diffusion of epic poetry in England did not actually inspire any new chansons de geste, it developed the taste for this class of literature, and the epic style in which the tales of the Romance of Horn, of Bovon de Hampton, of Gui de Warewic, of Waldef, and of Fulk Fitz Warine are treated, is certainly partly due to this circumstance. Although the last of these works has come down to us only in a prose version, it contains unmistakable signs of a previous poetic form, and what we possess is really only a rendering into prose similar to the transformations undergone by many of the chansons de geste. The interinfluence of French and English literature can be studied in the Breton romances and the romans d'aventure even better than in the epic poetry of the period. The Lay of Orpheus is known to us only through an English imitation, Sir Orfeo; the Lai du cor was composed by Robert Biket, an Anglo-Norman poet of the 12th century (Wulff, Lund, 1888). The Lais of Marie de France were written in England, and the greater number of the romances composing the matière de Bretagne seem to have passed from England to France through the medium of Anglo-Norman. The legends of Merlin and Arthur, collected in the Historia Regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth (died c. 1154), passed into French literature, bearing the character which the bishop of St Asaph had stamped upon them. Chrétien de Troyes's Perceval (c. 1175) is doubtless based on an Anglo-Norman poem. Robert de Boron (c. 1215) took the subject of his Merlin (published by G. Paris and J. Ulrich, 1886, 2 vols., Société des anciens textes français) from Geoffrey of Monmouth. Finally, the most celebrated love-legend of the Middle Ages, and one of the most beautiful inventions of world-literature, the story of Tristan and Iseult, tempted two authors, Béroul and Thomas, the first of whom is probably, and the second certainly, Anglo-Norman (see Arthurian legend; Holy Grail; Tristan). One Folie Tristan was composed in England in the last years of the 12th century. (For all these questions see Soc. des Anc. Textes, Ernest Muret's ed. 1903; Joseph Bédier's ed. 1902–1905). Less fascinating than the story of Tristan and Iseult, but nevertheless of considerable interest, are the two romans d'aventure of Hugh of Rutland, Ipomedon (published by Eugen Kölbing and Koschwitz, Breslau, 1889) and Protheselaus (published by Kluckow, Göttingen, 1924) written about 1185. The first relates the adventures of a knight who married the young duchess of Calabria, niece of King Meleager of Sicily, but was loved by Medea, the king's wife. The second poem is the sequel to Ipomedon, and deals with the wars and subsequent reconciliation between Ipomedon's sons, Daunus, the elder, lord of Apulia, and Protesilaus, the younger, lord of Calabria. Protesilaus defeats Daunus, who had expelled him from Calabria. He saves his brother's life, is reinvested with the dukedom of Calabria, and, after the death of Daunus, succeeds to Apulia. He subsequently marries Medea, King Meleager's widow, who had helped him to seize Apulia, having transferred her affection for Ipomedon to his younger son (cf. Ward, Cat. of Rom., i. 728). To these two romances by an Anglo-Norman author, Amadas et Idoine, of which we only possess a continental version, is to be added. Gaston Paris has proved indeed that the original was composed in England in the 12th century (An English Miscellany presented to Dr. Furnivall in Honour of his Seventy-fifth Birthday, Oxford, 1901, 386–394). The Anglo-Norman poem on the Life of Richard Coeur de Lion is lost, and an English version only has been preserved. About 1250 Eustace of Kent introduced into England the roman d'Alexandre in his Roman de toute chevalerie, many passages of which have been imitated in one of the oldest English poems on Alexander, namely, King Alisaunder (P. Meyer, Alexandre le grand, Paris, 1886, ii. 273, and Weber, Metrical Romances, Edinburgh). = Fableaux, fables and religious tales = In spite of the incontestable popularity enjoyed by this class of literature, we have only some half-dozen fableaux written in England: *Le chevalier à la corbeille, *Le chevalier qui faisait parler les muets, *Le chevalier, sa dame et un clerc, *Les trois dames, *La gageure, *Le prêtre d'Alison, *La bourgeoise d'Orléans (Bédier, Les Fabliaux, 1895). As to fables, one of the most popular collections in the Middle Ages was that written by Marie de France, which she claimed to have translated from King Alfred. In the Contes moralisés, written by Nicole Bozon shortly before 1320 (Soc. Anc. Textes, 1889), a few fables bear a strong resemblance to those of Marie de France. The religious tales deal mostly with the Mary Legends, and have been handed down to us in three collections: # The Adgar's collection. Most of these were translated from William of Malmesbury (d. 1143?) by Adgar in the 12th century. (\\"Adgar's Marien-Legenden\\", Altfr. Biblioth. ix.; J. A. Herbert, Rom. xxxii. 394). # The collection of Everard of Gateley, a monk of St. Edmund at Bury, who wrote c. 1250 three Mary Legends (Rom. xxix. 27). # An anonymous collection of sixty Mary Legends composed c. 1250 (Brit. Museum Old Roy. 20 B, xiv.), some of which have been published in Hermann Suchier's Bibliotheca Normannica; in the Altf. Bibl. See also Mussafia, \\"Studien zu den mittelalterlichen Marien-legenden\\" in Sitzungsh. der Wien. Akademie (t. cxiii., cxv., cxix., cxxiii., cxxix.). Another set of religious and moralizing tales is to be found in Chardri's Set dormans about the Seven Sleepers and Josaphat about Barlaam and Josaphat c. 1216 (Koch, Altfr. Bibl., 1880; G. Paris, Poèmes et légendes du moyen âge). = History = Of far greater importance, however, are the works which constitute Anglo-Norman historiography. The first Anglo-Norman historiographer is Geoffrey Gaimar, who wrote his Estoire des Engleis (between 1147 and 1151) for Dame Constance, wife of Ralph FitzGilbert (The Anglo-Norman Metrical Chronicle, Hardy and Martin, i. ii., London, 1888). This history comprised a first part (now lost), which was merely a translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, preceded by a history of the Trojan War, and a second part which carries us as far as the death of William Rufus. For this second part he has consulted historical documents, but he stops at the year 1087, just when he has reached the period about which he might have been able to give us some first-hand information. Similarly, Wace in his Roman de Rou (ed. Anthony Holden, Paris, 1970–1973), written 1160–1174, stops at the battle of Tinchebray in 1106 just before the period for which he would have been so useful. His Brut or Geste des Bretons (Le Roux de Lincy, 1836–1838, 2 vols.), written in 1155, is merely a translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth. :\\"Wace,\\" says Gaston Paris, speaking of the Roman de Rou, \\"traduit en les abrégeant des historiens latins que nous possédons; mais çà et là il ajoute soit des contes populaires, par exemple sur Richard 1er, sur Robert 1er, soit des particularités qu'il savait par tradition (sur ce même Robert le magnifique, sur l'expédition de Guillaume, &c.;) et qui donnent à son oeuvre un réel intérêt historique. Sa langue est excellente; son style clair, serré, simple, d'ordinaire assez monotone, vous plaît par sa saveur archaïque et quelquefois par une certaine grâce et une certaine malice\\". The History of the Dukes of Normandy by Benoît de Sainte- More is based on the work of Wace. It was composed at the request of Henry II. about 1170, and takes us as far as the year 1135 (ed. by Francisque Michel, 1836–1844, Collection de documents inédits, 3 vols.). The 43,000 lines which it contains are of but little interest to the historian; they are too evidently the work of a romancier courtois, who takes pleasure in recounting love-adventures such as those he has described in his romance of Troy. Other works, however, give us more trustworthy information, for example, the anonymous poem on Henry II.'s Conquest of Ireland in 1172 (ed. Francisque Michel, London, 1837), which, together with the Expugnatio hibernica of Giraud de Barri, constitutes our chief authority on this subject. The Conquest of Ireland was republished in 1892 by Goddard Henry Orpen, under the title of The Song of Dermot and the Earl (Oxford, Clarendon Press). Similarly, Jourdain Fantosme, who was in the north of England in 1174, wrote an account of the wars between Henry II., his sons, William the Lion of Scotland and Louis VII., in 1173 and 1174 (Chronicle of the reigns of Stephen ... III., ed. by Joseph Stevenson and Fr. Michel, London, 1886, pp. 202–307). Not one of these histories, however, is to be compared in value with The History of William the Marshal, Count of Striguil and Pembroke, regent of England from 1216–1219, which was found and subsequently edited by Paul Meyer (Société de l'histoire de France, 3 vols., 1891–1901). This masterpiece of historiography was composed in 1225 or 1226 by a professional poet of talent at the request of William, son of the marshal. It was compiled from the notes of the marshal's squire, John d'Early (d. 1230 or 1231), who shared all the vicissitudes of his master's life and was one of the executors of his will. This work is of great value for the history of the period 1186–1219, as the information furnished by John d'Early is either personal or obtained at first hand. In the part which deals with the period before 1186, it is true, there are various mistakes, due to the author's ignorance of contemporary history, but these slight blemishes are amply atoned for by the literary value of the work. The style is concise, the anecdotes are well told, the descriptions short and picturesque; the whole constitutes one of the most living pictures of medieval society. Very pale by the side of this work appear the Chronique of Peter of Langtoft, written between 1311 and 1320, and mainly of interest for the period 1294–1307 (ed. by T. Wright, London, 1866–1868); the Chronique of Nicholas Trevet (1258?–1328?), dedicated to Princess Mary, daughter of Edward I. (Duffus Hardy, Descr. Catal. III., 349-350); the Scala Chronica compiled by Thomas Gray of Heaton († c. 1369), which carries us to the year 1362-1363 (ed. by J. Stevenson, Maitland Club, Edinburgh, 1836); the Black Prince, a poem by the poet Chandos Herald, composed about 1386, and relating the life of the Black Prince from 1346-1376 (re-edited by Francisque Michel, London and Paris, 1883); and, lastly, the different versions of the Brutes, the form and historical importance of which have been indicated by Paul Meyer (Bulletin de la Société des anciens textes français, 1878, pp. 104–145), and by F. W. D. Brie (Geschichte und Quellen der mittelenglischen Prosachronik, The Brute of England or The Chronicles of England, Marburg, 1905). Finally we may mention, as ancient history, the translation of Eutropius and Dares, by Geoffrey of Waterford (13th century), who gave also the Secret des Secrets, a translation from a work wrongly attributed to Aristotle, which belongs to the next division (Rom. xxiii. 314).  Didactic literature  Didactic literature is the most considerable, if not the most interesting, branch of Anglo-Norman literature: it comprises a large number of works written chiefly with the object of giving both religious and profane instruction to Anglo-Norman lords and ladies. The following list gives the most important productions arranged in chronological order: *Philippe de Thaun, ', c. 1119 (edited by E. Mall, Strassburg, 1873), poem on the calendar; *', c. 1130 (ed. by E. Walberg, Paris, 1900; cf. G. Paris, Rom. xxxi. 175); *' (redaction between 1150 and 1170, ed. by J. E.

J. Furnivall, Robert of Brunne's Handlying Synne (Roxb. Club, 1862); In the 14th century we find: *Nicole Bozon's ' (see above); *' (Rom. xiii. 508); *Sermons in verse (P. Meyer, op. cit. xlv.); *' (op. cit. xlvi.). We have also a few handbooks on the teaching of French. Gautier de Biblesworth wrote such a treatise ' (T. Wright, A Volume of Vocabularies; P. Meyer, Rec. d'anc. textes, p. 360 and Romania xxxii, 22); ' (J. Stürzinger (editor), Altfranzösische Bibliothek herausgegeben von Dr. Wendelin Foerster. Achter Band. Orthographia Gallica. Ältester Traktat über französische Aussprache und Orthographie. Nach vier Handschriften zum ersten Mal herausgegeben, Heilbronn, 1884, and R.C. Johnston, ANTS. Plain Texts 1987); ', written in 1396 (P. Meyer, Rev. crit. d'hist. et de litt. vii(2). 378). In 1884, Meyer noted no fewer than fourteen manuscripts containing this treatise; ', c. 1399 (Stengel, Z. für n.f. Spr. u. Litt. i. 11). The important ', by John Gower, contains about 30,000 lines written in very good French at the end of the 14th century (Macaulay, The Complete Works of John Gower, i., Oxford, 1899).  Hagiography  Among the numerous lives of saints written in Anglo- Norman the most important ones are the following, the list of which is given in chronological order: *Voyage de Saint Brandan (or Brandain), written in 1121, by an ecclesiastic for Queen Aelis of Louvain (Rom. St. i. 553-588; Z. f. r. P. ii. 438-459; Rom. xviii. 203. C. Wahlund, Die altfr. Prosaübersetz. von Brendan's Meerfahrt, Upsala, 1901); *life of St. Catherine by Clemence of Barking (Rom. xiii. 400, Jarnik, 1894); *life of St Giles, c. 1170, by Guillaume de Berneville (Soc. Anc. Textes fr., 1881; Rom. xi. and xxiii. 94); *life of St. Nicholas, life of Our Lady, by Wace (Delius, 1850; Stengel, Cod. Digby, 66); Uhlemann, Gram. Krit. Studien zu Wace's Conception und Nicolas, 1878; *life of St. George by Simon de Fresne (Rom. x. 319; J. E. Matzke, Public. of the Mod. Lang. Ass. of Amer. xvii. 1902; Rom. xxxiv. 148); *Expurgatoire de Ste. Patrice, by Marie de France (Jenkins, 1894; Eckleben, Aelteste Schilderung vom Fegefeuer d.H. Patricius, 1851; Ph. de Felice, 1906); *La vie de St. Edmund le Rei, by Denis Pyramus, end of the 12th century (Memorials of St. Edmund's Abbey, edited by T. Arnold, ii. 1892; Rom. xxii. 170); *Henri d'Arci's life of St. Thais, poem on the Antichrist, Visio S. Pauli (P. Meyer, Not. et Extr. xxxv. 137–158); *life of St. Gregory the Great by Frère Angier, 30 April 1214 (Rom. viii. 509–544; ix. 176; xviii. 201); * The Vie de seint Clement, early 13C (D. Burrows, Vie de seint Clement, 3 vols., Anglo-Norman Text Society: London, 2007-9/10); a version of the Pseudo- Clementine Recognitiones and Epistula Clementis ad Iacobum translated by Rufinus of Aquileia, and the Passio sanctorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli attributed to Pseudo-Marcellus; *life of St. Modwenna, between 1225 and 1250 (Suchier, Die dem Matthäus Paris zugeschriebene Vie de St. Auban, 1873, pp. 54–58); *Fragments of a life of St Thomas Becket, c. 1230 (P. Meyer, Soc. Anc. Text. fr., 1885); and another life of the same by Benoit of St. Alban, 13th century (Michel, Chron. des ducs de Normandie; Hist. Lit. xxiii. 383); *a life of Edward the Confessor, written before 1245 (H. R. Luard, Lives of Edward the Confessor, 1858; Hist. Lit. xxvii. 1), by an anonymous monk of Westminster; life of St. Auban, c. 1250 (Suchier, op. cit.; Uhlemann, \\"Über die vie de St. Auban in Bezug auf Quelle,\\" &c.; Rom. St. iv. 543-626; ed. by Atkinson, 1876). *The Vision of Tnudgal, an Anglo-Norman fragment, is preserved in MS. 312, Trinity College, Dublin; the MS. is of the 14th century; the author seems to belong to the 13th (La vision de Tondale, ed. by Friedel and Kuno Meyer, 1906). In this category we may add the life of Hugh of Lincoln, 13th century (Hist. Lit. xxiii. 436; Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, 1888, p. v; Wolter, Bibl. Anglo-Norm., ii. 115). Other lives of saints were recognized to be Anglo-Norman by Paul Meyer when examining the MSS. of the Welbeck library (Rom. xxxii. 637 and Hist. Lit. xxxiii. 338-378).  Lyric poetry  The only extant songs of any importance are the seventy-one Ballads of Gower (Stengel, Gower's Minnesang, 1886). The remaining songs are mostly of a religious character. Most of them have been discovered and published by Paul Meyer (Bulletin de la Soc. Anc. Textes, 1889; Not. et Extr. xxxiv; Rom. xiii. 518, t. xiv. 370; xv. p. 254, &c.). Although so few have come down to us such songs must have been numerous at one time, owing to the constant intercourse between English, French and Provençals of all classes. An interesting passage in Piers Plowman furnishes us with a proof of the extent to which these songs penetrated into England. We read of: One of the finest productions of Anglo- Norman lyric poetry written in the end of the 13th century, is the Plainte d'amour (Vising, Göteborg, 1905; Romania xiii. 507, xv. 292 and xxix. 4), and we may mention, merely as literary curiosities, various works of a lyrical character written in two languages, Latin and French, or English and French, or even in three languages, Latin, English and French. In Early English Lyrics (Oxford, 1907) we have a poem in which a lover sends to his mistress a love- greeting composed in three languages, and his learned friend replies in the same style (De amico ad amicam, Responcio, viii and ix).  Satire  The popularity enjoyed by the Roman de Renart and the Anglo-Norman version of the Riote du Monde (Z. f. rom. Phil. viii. 275-289) in England is proof enough that the French spirit of satire was keenly appreciated. The clergy and the fair sex presented the most attractive target for the shots of the satirists. However, an Englishman raised his voice in favour of the ladies in a poem entitled La Bonté des dames (Meyer, Rom. xv. 315-339), and Nicole Bozon, after having represented \\"Pride\\" as a feminine being whom he supposes to be the daughter of Lucifer, and after having fiercely attacked the women of his day in the Char d'Orgueil (Rom. xiii. 516), also composed a Bounté des femmes (P. Meyer, op. cit. 33) in which he covers them with praise, commending their courtesy, their humility, their openness and the care with which they bring up their children. A few pieces of political satire show us French and English exchanging amenities on their mutual shortcomings. The Roman des Français, by André de Coutances, was written on the continent, and cannot be quoted as Anglo-Norman although it was composed before 1204 (cf. Gaston Paris: Trois versions rimées de l'évangile de Nicodème, Soc. Anc. Textes, 1885), it is a very spirited reply to French authors who had attacked the English.  Drama  This must have had a considerable influence on the development of the sacred drama in England, but none of the French plays acted in England in the 12th and 13th centuries has been preserved. Adam, which is generally considered to be an Anglo-Norman mystery of the 12th century, was probably written in France at the beginning of the 13th century (Romania xxxii. 637), and the so-called Anglo-Norman Resurrection belongs also to continental French. It is necessary to state that the earliest English moralities seem to have been imitations of the French ones.

It belongs to the Plagiorchiata, a large suborder of the digenean fluke order Plagiorchiida. M. piriformes is unusual among the flukes in having only one intermediate host rather than two, and no free-swimming cercarian stage.McCarthy et al. (2000) It is most notable, however, for modifying the behaviour of its intermediate host in a way that increases its chance of transmission to the primary host. This has been researched by Helen O. McCarthy and her team of University of Ulster scientists both in the laboratory and at Muck Island in Scotland. Ecology herring gull (here: Larus argentatus argenteus) often eats periwinkles during breeding season, but only rarely at other times The life cycle of M. piriformes requires two hosts: the rough periwinkle Littorina saxatilis (a littoral snail) and the herring gull Larus argentatus (and perhaps other members of the herring gull complex). The immature flukes live in the snail, and the adult flukes live in the bird. Normally, rough periwinkles are rarely eaten by herring gulls. This is due to two reasons: First, the birds forage in the snails' rocky shore habitat mainly during the breeding season (which lasts about 4 months each summer) but not at other times. Second, periwinkles move with the tides to stay at the water line. Thus, even when the gulls forage in periwinkle habitat, the snails tend to stay out of easy reach of the birds. It is not precisely known how the snails are infected; probably they eat the eggs directly from the gulls' feces. The eggs hatch into a miracidium stage, which develops into multiple sporocysts. Rather than further developing into a cercaria which leaves the snail to infect the second intermediate host as usual for trematodes, they directly develop into encysted metacercariae in the snail. Infection castrates the periwinkles; brooding L. saxatilis generally move only to avoid being left above water by the tide while non-brooding (including castrated) periwinkles are more active. As soon as the flukes have reached the metacercarian stage, they alter the periwinkles' behaviour: Rather than moving to stay near the water line, the infected snails develop a pronounced tendency to move upwards. This becomes most pronounced shortly before high tide, and thus the periwinkles carrying mature metacercariae are left a considerable distance above water when the tide recedes. This makes them far more accessible to the foraging gulls than uninfected conspecifics, which will often move up when the tide is highest to feed on algae which they cannot otherwise access, but return underwater as soon as the tide recedes to avoid desiccation. Once the snails are eaten by herring gulls, the metacercariae hatch into mature flukes. These mate and produce eggs which are shed with the bird's feces. Their adult lifespan is a mere two weeks; several generations are thus produced each summer. It is unknown whether M. piriformes spends the winter as resting eggs in the habitat, or as sporocysts in already-infected periwinkles. In any case, snails harboring metacercariae generally die of desiccation before winter if they are not eaten.

Francesa Marciano and Niccolò Ammaniti wrote the script, basing it on Niccolò Ammaniti's successful 2001 Italian novel with the same name. The story is set during Italy's \\"Years of Lead\\", a time in the 1970s riddled with terrorism and kidnapping, and tells the story of a nine-year-old boy who discovers a terrible crime committed by the entire population of his southern Italian town. Plot The action of the film takes place in 1978, in a fictional town called Acqua Traverse in Southern Italy, during the hottest summer of the century and the infamous Years of Lead. A nine-year-old boy named Michele Amitrano and a group of his friends set out on a race across scorched wheat fields to a deserted farmhouse. Michele's sister tags along but falls over, breaking her glasses, and she calls out to Michele, who runs back to her. Michele quickly calms her worries about the glasses, and they continue running. They are the last of the group to arrive at the farmhouse, which means that she and Michele must pay a forfeit. However, the leader of the group, Skull, chooses the only girl in the group apart from Michele's sister to pay up instead. He instructs her to expose herself to the boys, and she looks to the others for help, but they refuse to meet her gaze. She reluctantly and hesitantly begins to take off her clothes, when Michele pipes up that he was the one to arrive last and he should be the one to pay. As his punishment Michele walks the length of a beam, high up in a rickety old barn- like building at the deserted farmhouse, and after that the group is seen going home. As Michele and his sister set off, she asks him where her glasses are, and he goes back to fetch them. While searching for the glasses at the farmhouse, Michele discovers a hole in the ground covered with a sheet of metal. He opens it and sees part of a bare human leg; horrified, due to the limited time he had to investigate the situation, he decides to keep this a secret from the others. He feels threatened by Skull and doesn't want such a big discovery to be taken away from him. The next day, he returns to the place, throwing rocks at the leg. As he moves to pick up another rock, the camera pans to him, on the ground, searching around him in the dirt, where Michele finds another rock to throw. As the camera pans back into the hole, the leg is out of sight. Startled, Michele is suddenly staring down at a zombie-like young boy stumbling out of the darkness and into view. Terrified, Michele hurries home once more, but then his bicycle chain breaks and he is thrown off his bike. As he returns home he is scolded for being late. The next day while playing with friends Michele thinks about the boy and later he decides to visit the zombie-like boy again. Michele finds that the boy is actually alive, although he is very weak. He brings him water and later food. One day, Michele goes to buy bread, to feed the boy. On the way he sees the familiar face of Skull's older brother driving away from the house and thinks this may be the person who has imprisoned the boy. He returns home, making sure that his own presence is not discovered by whoever put the boy there. Michele climbs down to collect the bread back from the boy. During this time Michele's undaunted curiosity leads him to begin questioning the confused, possibly delusional, and traumatized boy. To Michele's annoyance, the boy thinks he is dead and asks Michele if he is his guardian angel. The boy walks over to him and Michele sees him at his full size, as going crazy the boy cries out \\"I'm Dead\\"! He screams louder and louder, making Michele climb back up the rope quickly and return home. One night, Michele sees his parents watching on the television news that a child named Filippo belonging to the Carducci family has been kidnapped from Milan, and the boy in the pictures shown looks just like the boy in the hole. He overhears his parents and their friends talking about keeping the boy hidden. The next morning, he discovers his parents are hosting late-night meetings with the parents of his playmates and one domineering visitor \\"from the North\\" who now sleeps in his room. Michele, to his shock, gradually comes to realize that his own father is involved in the kidnapping, as well as some other men in the town. He visits the boy and tells him he knows his name and informs the boy of his mother and the message she left on the TV about him. This message was not received well by the boy, who still believes he is dead. Until Michele told him that he is a guardian angel and comes visits him, he promise to visit again. He continues visiting Filippo (Mattia di Pierro) and one day he lets him out for some hours of play in the wheat fields together, and then he returns him back to the hole. To win a toy as a present for Filippo, he barters with his best friend Salvatore for a toy blue van by offering to share a secret, and reveals to him Filippo's existence, but Salvatore is uncomfortable about the news, even though he surrenders the van and promises Michele that he will not share his secret with anyone else. On Michele's next visit to Filippo, he is caught by one of the kidnappers (the older brother of Skull), who finds him in the hole with Filippo and punches him, then hauls him out and drives him home. It turns out that Michele's friend Salvatore has revealed his secret to Skull's brother. His parents have contrasting reactions to his being apprehended. His mother defies Michele's attacker, in defense of her son, but his father, on learning that he has been visiting Filippo, threatens to beat him if he ever goes back to visit the boy again. Michele promises to obey his father. But then one day Skull cajoles his peers into again visiting the farmhouse, where Michele discovers the hole empty and Filippo gone. His friend-turned-traitor Salvatore readily tells him he knows where Filippo has been moved, having overheard his father tell Michele's father, and will tell him if Michele will forgive his betrayal. The next night, Michele overhears the adults discussing who will kill Filippo, and Michele sets out immediately to find Filippo — who is now in a \\"cave\\" — and save him. He hoists him out over a gate and tells him to run for his life, while Michele tries to find a way out for himself with no one to hoist him over the gate. Meanwhile, Michele's father has drawn the short straw and shows up at the cave to kill Filippo. Michele sees it is his father and runs toward him across the cave just as his father fires his gun, shooting his own son in the leg. In the film's last scene, Michele's father runs with Michele in his arms in search of medical aid, as the ringleader from the North (Milan) finds him and insists he has to resume his assigned task of killing Filippo. However, Filippo appears and risks his own life to show gratitude to Michele, just as helicopters arrive and track down the ringleader trying to escape. The film ends with a repentant Pino clutching his son and Michele reaching out to Filippo.

Ammaniti got the idea for the book during a road trip to Apulia in the late 1990s. The novel won the 2001 Viareggio-Repaci Prize for Fiction. Since its publication in 2001, the novel sold nearly 700,000 copies and was published in over twenty languages. Jonathan Hunt wrote the English translation, which is available as hardcover and paperback by Canongate, 2003.Website for English-language mystery novels set in Italy The story is set in the fictional town of Acqua Traverse (literally water crossings) in the equally fictitious province of Lucignano (not to be confused with the real town of Lucignano, Tuscany). The film was shot in Basilicata and Apulia, regions of southern Italy where director Gabriele Salvatores spent his youth. The primary set was in the countryside near Melfi. Salvatores chose to challenge the kind of Italian film that typically becomes popular on the foreign market: \\"the beautiful ocean, the nostalgic past, mafia, pizza, and mandolins.\\" The story is loosely based on a true story of a kidnapped boy from Milan during the anni di piombo in the 1970s, a time of turmoil and terrorism in Italy. At the time, it was alarmingly common to kidnap people from the North and transport them to the South, where they would be hidden and sometimes killed unless the ransom was paid. 1978 was the year in which kidnappings in Italy reached an all-time peak of nearly 600. Although many kidnappings were politically motivated, children of wealthy northern families were targeted as well. It became such a problem that the Italian government decided to automatically freeze the assets of any families whose children had been kidnapped and contacted by people wanting a ransom to discourage this phenomenon. According to Salvatores, the film is not primarily about kidnapping of the time but the mystery revolving around a kidnapping. The story is also about the journey and loss of innocence of a young boy.Wendell Ricketts 12 December 2007 (screenshots of the movie available on this website) The majority of the actors in the film, especially the children, were local citizens with no filming or acting experience. Giuseppe Cristiano, who played the main character, had never appeared in a film before. The director spoke with psychologists about the impact of filming on the residents. Not to raise hopes, the filmmakers explained to the parents of the child actors that this was not a ticket to Hollywood. The veteran actors Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, Dino Abbrescia, and Giorgio Careccia were cast in the adult roles.Miriam Di Nunzio \\"'Scared' director takes risk with cast of unknowns\\" Chicago Sun-Times. April 18, 2004. Retrieved 12 December 2007. The vivid scenery in this film is one of its most recognized characteristics. There are many views of fields and hills of wheat, this endless land being the backyard for the children of Acqua Traverse and the setting to their childhood adventures. The film used a strong primary color scheme to portray the way children see the world, focusing on specific objects of interest with a close-up. The film score is primarily by a string quartet, that includes original music by Ezio Bosso, Quartetto d'Archi di Torino.

He used to wash cars to raise money for buying equipment. He spent three years there before being recruited by BBC Radio 1, the national pop network, where he worked as a stand-in presenter for Steve Wright before taking over the teatime show from Peter Powell in September 1984. Radio One In addition to this show, Brookes presented a rundown of the UK Top 40 singles chart on Sunday evenings between 1986 and 1990 and between 1992 and 1995. In April 1989, Brookes moved to the weekend breakfast show, co-hosting with Liz Kershaw, taking over from Mark Goodier. and also regularly deputised for Simon Mayo on the weekday breakfast show. Three years later he moved to the weekday early breakfast slot, where he remained until he was dismissed in 1995 by Trevor Dann, who said \\"...why is Bruno on? you know, he seems to have a charmed life, because if the view was 'we must get rid of the dinosaurs', you know we've got this behemoth striding the airwaves of dawn\\" in the BBC TV documentary Blood on the Carpet: Walking with Disc Jockeys in 2001. Brookes, along with another former chart show presenter Mark Goodier, returned to the station for a one-off Top 40 countdown show on Sunday 30 September 2007, providing new pre-recorded inserts into the show, which was hosted by the then-current (but outgoing) presenters JK and Joel. This special show formed part of the station's celebrations of the 40th birthday of BBC Radio 1. =Acid house= Brookes was also an early supporter of the fledgling acid house scene by championing Stakker Humanoid, a November 1988 hit for Humanoid (AKA Brian Dougans). In a 2013 interview with The Guardian, Brookes explained that he was given a white label of the record and immediately fell under its spell. \\"It just got to me. I remember listening to it and thinking it was one step ahead of everything techno that was coming out. It wasn't copying anything else; it was just fabulous.\\" As a result, he played the record twice in one show – a very unusual step for a prime-time radio DJ. =\\"Killing in the Name\\" controversy= While presenting the Top 40, Brookes accidentally played the full uncensored version of \\"Killing in the Name\\" by Rage Against the Machine on 21 February 1993. The song contains 17 instances of the word \\"Fuck\\". Brookes was not made aware of the language in the track and, as a new entry, included it in the broadcast. Brookes and his producer Simon Sadler were preparing a trail for the following week's show whilst the song played, so were unaware of what was going out on air. The station immediately received 138 phone calls of complaint. Television work During his period at Radio 1, Brookes was on the Top of the Pops host roster and also presented Beat the Teacher on BBC television, a children's quiz where pupils took on teachers in a general knowledge game based on noughts and crosses. He was the last of the show's three presenters, following Howard Stableford and ex-Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones. He also hosted the dating show Love at First Sight and the angling show Tight Lines on Sky. He also appeared in the Brass Eye series, in which he read an appeal against the fictitious drug cake. Personal life Brookes appeared on the quiz show Through the Keyhole in the late 1990s as one of the celebrities whose homes were visited by Loyd Grossman. Brookes is known as a supporter of the Conservative Party. In 2007 Brookes revealed in an interview with Nuts magazine that he had a tattoo of a pirate on his left thigh. He acquired it during the 1985 Radio 1 Roadshow tour as part of a bet with his producer, who in return drank a pint of vinegar. Brookes was in a relationship for many years with TV presenter Anthea Turner. He married model Debbie Brooker in 1994 but they divorced in 2000. In May 2006, Brookes suffered a heart attack and was treated at St Thomas' Hospital, London where he was interviewed by Nadia Sawalha as a patient on BBC One's City Hospital. In the interview he said he would try to give up smoking which he acknowledged as the main reason for his illness.\\"Ex-Radio 1 star has heart attack\\", BBC, 27 May 2006.

PC PowerPlay focuses on news and reviews for upcoming and newly released games on the Microsoft Windows platform. The magazine also reviews computer hardware for use on gaming computers. The magazine is published by Future Australia. In 2018, Future, owner and publisher of PC Gamer, purchased PC PowerPlay and related computing titles from nextmedia, incorporating PC PowerPlay articles into the online versions of PC Gamer. The magazine comes with a DVD which includes game demos, freeware games, anime shows, film/anime/game teaser trailers, game patches, game mods, game maps, PC utilities and Windows computer wallpapers. A CD version was also available until September 2005 where it was replaced by a DVD edition.(Although for a brief time, both editions existed while gamers made the transition from one technology to the next.) Main sections The main sections included in each month's magazine include: *Inbox: Letters to the editor and Snippets (A small section where a sentence of a writer's letter is used in a comical fashion. Currently snippets have been removed from the section.) *The Big Picture: A double-page screenshot of the game featured as the cover story. This is followed by the cover story itself (usually a preview of a major upcoming game). *Extended Memory: An opinion piece reflecting on the state of games today in relation to older, obsolete games and genres. *Jam:. James Cottee discusses issues of a general gaming nature. This section was previously titled \\"Out to Play\\". *Generation XX: Meghann O'Neill provided a look at gaming from a female perspective. *10 To Watch: Originally named \\"Incoming\\". A round-up of ten major soon to be released games. *PCPP Interview: An interview with a well known indie games developer. Topics include their inspirations and influences that shaped their developed games. *Reviews: A section where games are reviewed and given a rating out of 10, based on graphics, sound, gameplay, replayability, etc. *MyPC: A reader submits a picture of their computer, along with its specifications, recent upgrades, and other information. (The magazine points out 10 humorous points within the photo, and usually provides the reader with a prize.) *Hotware: Includes commercial products, some computer related, others not, which the reader may find interesting. (Usually, there is at least one product that costs a substantial amount of money.) *Tech: A selection of the latest technology is reviewed and discussed. This has expanded substantially after the removal of other tech columns like \\"ReShuffle\\". *The Beast: A list of components needed to build an incredibly powerful gaming PC costing extravagant amounts of money. (The descriptions of the components used has extended significantly after the removal of the \\"Beastie\\" column.) *The Menagerie: Consists of three computer builds with different budgets in mind. The hardware included in this section is usually low to mid range in ability, strictly following a \\"bang for buck\\" ideal. *State of Play: Includes four parts, discussing the characteristics and recent changes occurring in four different genres of gaming: MMOs, RPGs, RTS', and Indies. *Next Month: A whole page of games' artwork with the date of the next issue's publication date shown below. Deleted sections A number of notable sections that used to appear in the magazine included: *Number Crunching: A page of (often humorous) computer or game related statistics. *Tutorials: A lengthy article describing in relatively simple terms how something can be done. (Usually starts with a paragraph or two why the change is good.) *Briefing: An article which explains the history/use of a specific computer part. *On the Discs: Usually a two-page description of the software (demo or free) on the CDs/DVD. (A short summary is given for each demo included.) *Guerrilla Gamer: A fictional writer, \\"Guerrilla Gamer\\", using the image of Duke Nukem discusses a topic to which he usually has dislike towards. *Dr. Claw: A parody of the online gaming/IRC community written in Leet speak from the perspective of an early teen gamer. *Hack: A short lived comic about the antics of a PC games magazine writing team. *Flotsam and Jetsam: A roundup of the all latest budget game releases that often gave the reviewers a chance to showcase their writing skills by denigrating some of the worse titles on the market. *Reshuffle: A review of several Graphics Processing Units, where the frames per second and 3DMark points are stated along with a rating out of 10. *POWERTEST: Powertest was where several hardware items were reviewed for their pros and cons and given a rating out of 10. *The Beastie: The Beastie was a cheaper version of \\"The Beast\\" using mid-high range cost parts, which are chosen on a \\"bang for buck\\" basis. (It has been dropped in favour of an extended \\"Beast\\" system.) *Bargain Bin: A selection of old games which were considered good for their time, usually available for under $20. *The Vault/Flashback: This section of the magazine alternated between two types of retrospective examinations. \\"The Vault\\" looks at an older game (a decade old or more), where a key developer is interviewed and their thoughts are included on how the design process and the game's release went. (Examples include the original Doom, the original Ultima, and Commander Keen.) Meanwhile, \\"Flashback\\" is a more casual look at a similarly older game, usually approached in a style seen in the Playtest reviews. (Examples include The Last Express, Spycraft: The Great Game and Gabriel Knight.) *Yellow Boots: An amusing last page where a non-computer related topic is discussed, from the point of view of a man with a pair of apparently sentient yellow boots, with these tales often involving the author's \\"Crazy Ex-third flatmate\\" Victor Ninox. Scoring system Each review of a game or product is given a score out of ten. PC PowerPlay has given 10/10 scores to a number of games including: A 10/10 game is connoted not as a perfect game but as a \\"masterpiece with flaws\\". (The 10/10 score system replaced the old system of 0% to 100%.) PCPP once stated \\"What was the difference between a game which gets 95% and a game that gets 96%?\\". This was precisely what readers argued about. Under the previous percentage system, only Wolfenstein 3D ever received 100% (that 100% converted to 10/10 when printed in review score summaries in later issues), while the next closest score ever given, 98%, was given to: * Deus Ex * Falcon 4.0 * Half-Life * System Shock 2 * Total Annihilation *Unreal. Associated media In addition to the magazine itself there are several websites that are closely linked with it. The official PC PowerPlay website was launched in 2001, but was taken offline following the collapse of the online division of publishing company Next Media, then lay dormant until July 2006. The current website includes features and news, but most traffic on the site goes to the PC PowerPlay forums. The forum database has been largely preserved across a number of technology migrations. It first began on a ColdFusion powered site in 2001, then moved to phpBB and was converted to vBulletin in 2007. The forums provide an environment for the discussion of gaming and computer related software and technology. Within the forums there are also sections dedicated to general discussion and banter, serious discussions regarding Australian national, regional and international issues and a section for discussions of TV shows, films and music. This design also allows the organization of multiplayer games amongst the PCPP readers and other forum members. The general discussion section of the PCPP Forum is titled \\"Rhubarb\\", because of editor Anthony Fordham's love of the old British joke of having extras in movie crowd scenes say \\"rhubarbrhubarbrhubarb\\" to simulate incidental conversation. (Which may or may not originate from the British short film \\"Rhubarb\\", the remake in 1980, or The Goon Show.) A website re-launch occurred on 22 April 2009, consisting of a customized Joomla install and layout and featured regularly updated blogs, news and features. The site again entered a period of disuse shortly thereafter. On Wednesday, 12 March 2010, the PCPP website and forum software was replaced with a CMS provided by CyberGamer. This software also powers the cybergamer.com.au website. PCPP is now listed as a \\"Media Partner\\" of CyberGamer whilst CyberGamer now receives advertising space within PCPP and PCPP's sister magazine, Hyper. A press release was issued on 18 March, detailing the arrangement between both parties. As part of this online merger, PCPP's established community were incorporated within the CyberGamer Network. The CyberGamer Network acts as a single-sign on service for all CyberGamer- powered sites. Hyper Magazine was due to migrate their web presence to a CyberGamer network powered system on 8 April 2010. The transition to the CyberGamer forums have generally been considered to have been handled badly by many short and long term forum participants and it remains to be seen if the level of forum participation will return to its former heights. On 12 August 2010, PC Powerplay's then-editor, Anthony Fordham, announced that the PCPP Forums would revert to the old vBulletin software, stating that the PC Powerplay community were not happy with the current CyberGamer software. A potential merge with the Hyper game forum never occurred and the forum was eventually closed in December 2017. CD-ROM version, DVD-ROM version and Disc-less version Currently the magazine publishes two separate versions each issue. One is a plain magazine, while the other more expensive version includes a double-sided DVD-ROM disc, totalling up to a possible 9.4 gigabytes of demos, mods and/or other content. The magazine launched in 1996 with a 640 Megabyte CD-ROM cover disc, which was upgraded in 2000 to a double CD-ROM set. The DVD-ROM edition joined the lineup in 2002 alongside the CD-ROM version for three years, the CD-ROM version finally ceased production in 2005. The November 2005 edition included the first discless magazine at a little over half the price of the DVD-ROM version. While sales were not spectacular, dropping the CD-ROM did slow the rate of decline of the non-DVD-ROM version of the magazine. This saw subscriptions being offered for the disc-less version at half the sale price. The Bunker was a section of the DVD-ROM originally compiled each month by \\"ROM\\", a respected member of the PCPP online community. However, following his retirement from the position (announced in issue #143), The Bunker undertook a drastic transformation and became the PCPP Community Bunker. Readers and members of the online community produced and were actively encouraged to submit to the section. The Bunker was replaced in 2009 with a streamlined Applications and Utilities section.  Competition  PC PowerPlay has no direct competition in the Australian market (with no other dedicated Australian PC games magazines existing). However, there is indirect competition from technology enthusiast magazine Atomic. Various PC games magazines from the UK and US are sold in Australia (such as PC Gamer and PC Zone (now defunct)), but their circulations are minimal. An Australian version of PC Gamer launched shortly after PC PowerPlay but was shut down in 1999 following a dispute between the publisher and printer. Australian publishing company Derwent Howard launched a competitor called PC Games Addict in 2002, using some Australian content filled out by licensed content from PC Gamer in the UK and PC Format. The magazine ceased publication in 2005.  Target audiences and readership  PC Powerplay’s core target audience ranges from the ages of 14 to 34, with an approximate readership of 91,000. In terms of online audiences, PC Powerplay boasts over 43,200 unique online users – of these, 17,421 are email subscribers.

The title originates from a phrase in John Milton's Samson Agonistes: : ... Promise was that I : Should Israel from Philistian yoke deliver; :Ask for this great deliverer now, and find him :Eyeless in Gaza at the Mill with slaves ... The title of the book, like Milton's poem, recalls the biblical story of Samson, who was captured by the Philistines, his eyes burned out, and taken to Gaza, where he was forced to work grinding grain in a mill. The chapters of the book are not ordered chronologically. Huxley's biographer, Sybille Bedford, claims in her fictive memoir Jigsaw that the novel's characters Mary Amberley, a drug addict, and her daughter were partly inspired by her own experiences with her morphine-addicted mother and herself, known to Huxley because they were neighbours in the south of France. Plot The novel focuses on the life of socialite Anthony Beavis, but it does so by employing a non-chronological structure. It juxtaposes four periods of Beavis' life, from the time that he is a young boy in the 1890s up until 1936. The novel describes Beavis as he goes through school, college and various romantic affairs, while probing the meaningless lives of the upper-class during the same period. The novel depicts Beavis' own gradual disillusionment with high society, brought to a head by the suicide of his friend. At this point, he begins to search for some source of meaning in his life, which seems to be provided when he discovers pacifism and then mysticism. Critical reception The English journalist Simon Heffer has called the novel Huxley’s best book and single ‘great novel’. For Heffer, the book both harkens back to Huxley’s early satires and links to the more serious and philosophical concerns of his later novels. Formally, he says that the novel uses a modernist, stream of consciousness approach, but bases these in fact, unlike Woolf, Proust and Joyce who use unreliable memories. The tension between war and pacifism is explored in the novel in a particularly productive way. Heffer concludes by writing that Huxley is a “sophisticated, original English man of letters” who deserves a reevaluation and that this novel is a good place to start.Heffer, Simon, (20 October, 2018). Aldous Huxley did write a great novel - but it was not Brave New World. The Daily Telegraph. Heffer also includes Eyeless in Gaza in Strictly English, his guide to clear English, as containing examples of Huxley’s mastery of parentheses (both brackets and dashes) and the single dash.Heffer, Simon (2011). Strictly English: The Correct Way to Write... and Why It Matters. Random House. pp.33-34.

Gönül Dönmez-Colin Plot Giovanna (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) and her husband Filippo (Filippo Nigro) have settled into life. They both have jobs that make them unhappy. She works in an poultry factory. He works the graveyard shift because he lacks seniority. They argue about money, sex, time and work... There is a subtle sense that this is a marriage whose love is dwindling fast, and that perhaps they are only going through the motions for the sake of their children. One morning, the two of them are walking home and cross paths with an elderly man (Massimo Girotti). He is suffering from transient global amnesia, remembering nothing about himself and his current situation, although recalling random episodes from his remote past. And despite Giovanna's protests, Filippo brings him back to their home for the night so that he can take him to the police the next morning in the hopes of unraveling the mystery. As complications ensue, that one night stretches to a few days. The old man experiences strange episodes, flashbacks of sorts, that reveal clues to his mysterious past. His actions lead to a meeting between Giovanna and Lorenzo (Raoul Bova). Lorenzo lives across the street from Giovanna and their apartment windows face each other. The sexual tension between the two is quite palpable as they have both been secretly watching and lusting after each other from their dimly lit windows. Giovanna and Lorenzo's instant friendship swiftly moves to flirtation and then to a passionate kiss. However, Lorenzo's job is transferring him to another city very soon and Giovanna is put in an awkward spot having to make a very quick decision. Her heart tells her she should act on her feelings. Her mind tells her to be responsible. Nevertheless, the two of them puzzle over the mystery of the old man as they try to come to terms with their feelings for one another. The only thing the old man seems to remember is the name Simone, so Giovanna and her family take to calling him this. Giovanna takes Simone's suit to be cleaned and discovers a love letter in the jacket pocket addressed to him from a certain Davide Veroli. The next morning, Simone disappears, so Giovanna sets out to trace Davide Veroli as a means of identifying Simone and at this point also of tracing him. A meeting is arranged between them. When Giovanna comes face to face with the old Davide Veroli, it turns out he is the old man they called Simone. Simone, in fact, had been the man Davide had loved when he was young. Davide heard the Nazis were going to kill all Jews in Rome and killed his boss in order to escape and to alert as many people as possible. However, Davide was in a crossroad: he had to choose between telling the others – his neighbors, those who had laughed at him for being homosexual – or looking for Simone first instead. He chose to save the others in the first place to prove that he deserved their respect and saved many people and children. He was given many honors after this, but he lost his only love. After remembering who he was, he had gone back home, although without mentioning anything to the family that had given him a roof the previous days. Nonetheless, they became very good friends. Davide helped her make some big decisions in her life, like pursuing her dream to work in a bakery and having the strength to fight for her marriage and her children.

It is a part of the Alien and Predator crossover franchise, Alien vs. Predator. A sequel, Aliens versus Predator 2, was developed by Monolith Productions and released by Sierra in 2001.  Gameplay  Like the 1994 Alien vs Predator game for the Atari Jaguar, Aliens versus Predator offers three separate campaigns, each playable as a separate species: Alien, Predator, or human Colonial Marine. Each player character has different objectives, abilities, and weapons. The single-player campaign presents the player with a conventional series of levels to progress through that are designed around the abilities of each character. As the Colonial Marine the player uses a number of weapons to combat Aliens and Predators. The marine wears armor for protection and uses an image intensifier and flares to improve visibility in dark areas. When playing as the Predator the player uses a variety of weapons from the Predator films such as wrist blades, a throwing disc, and shoulder-mounted energy weapons. The Predator is the most durable of the three player characters and can survive falls from greater heights than the human. The player can use a cloaking device to become invisible and several different modes of vision to detect enemies, including an infrared vision mode and a mode sensitive to electrical systems. As an Alien the player can explore most of the game's environments freely, even climbing across walls and ceilings. The Alien has no weapons, however, using its claws, tail, and jaws to attack enemies. The screen is distorted into a fisheye lens effect to reflect the Alien's field of view. The player can also use a form of echolocation in dark areas and can detect pheromones to discern human or Predator enemies. The Alien can drop from any height without injury and is the fastest of the three player characters. Several bonus levels allow each player character access to portions of the missions of the other characters. To allow the marine and Predator characters to traverse through the areas of the Alien missions, the player is supplied with a jet pack for the marine and a grappling hook for the Predator.  Plot  The storylines of the three player characters are independent of one another. As an Alien the player must defend the Alien hive from human marines, then stow away on an evacuating spacecraft and reach the marines' ship, the Ferarco. When the Ferarco's self-destruct system is activated, the player must reach the escape shuttle, which takes them to Gateway Station. Here the player explores the station and battles more marines, reaching a ship departing for Earth. Before boarding the ship the player battles two Predators, after which the Alien enters the Earth-bound shuttle. When playing as the Colonial Marine, the player begins at a research station on LV-426 built to study the derelict spacecraft where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs in the film Alien (1979). Aliens attack and the player must fight their way through the research facility, the derelict ship, and an adjoining colony. Next the player explores the atmosphere processing station and shuts down its cooling valves in order to cause an explosion which will wipe out the Aliens. The player character escapes in a drop ship and travels to Odobenus Station in orbit above the planetoid, where they battle more Aliens, Predators, facehuggers, and cybernetically-enhanced Aliens until reaching the spaceship Tyrargo. Aboard the ship the player battles more enemies including an Alien/Predator hybrid and \\"praetorian\\" Aliens. The player then battles an Alien queen, defeating it by expelling it through the airlock. The Predator character's storyline visits three different planets, beginning with the player hunting marines in order to recover a captured Predator ship and its occupant from a human military base. Aliens are accidentally released in the base and the player discovers that the humans have created an Alien/Predator hybrid by implanting the captured Predator with an Alien embryo. The player defeats the hybrid, triggers the facility's self-destruct mechanism, and escapes in the Predator ship. The player next visits Fiorina \\"Fury\\" 161, the prison planet that is the setting of Alien 3 (1992), where more Aliens and marines are battled. Finally the player visits a marine-controlled Alien habitat, battling cybernetically- enhanced Aliens, \\"praetorian\\" Aliens, and finally the Alien Queen.  Development and release  Aliens versus Predator was developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Fox Interactive. It was announced in 1995 for release during the 1997 Christmas season on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC. However, the PC version was pushed back to 1999, while the Saturn and PlayStation versions were scrapped altogether, though the PlayStation was showcased in an early state during E3 1997. The Saturn version was not displayed at the show, though Rebellion was still planning a release for the system at the time. A version for the Dreamcast was also in development but never released. An expansion pack titled Millennium Expansion Pack was released in 2000. It adds nine levels for single- and multiplayer, the ability to save within levels and new weapons for the marine. A compilation package titled Aliens versus Predator: Gold Edition was also released in 2000. It contains the main game and the expansion. An Apple Macintosh version, for OS X and classical Mac OS, based on the Gold Edition was released by MacPlay in 2001. A version for Game Boy Advance was developed and published by Ubisoft, but eventually canceled. = Source code release = In 2001, on end-of- support and end-of-life of the game, Rebellion Developments released the game's source code and tools to public to allow the game community further support of the game. The source code to Aliens Vs Predator is copyright (c) 1999-2000 Rebellion and is provided as is with no warranty for its suitability for use. You may not use this source code in full or in part for commercial purposes. Any use must include a clearly visible credit to Rebellion as the creators and owners, and reiteration of this license. Following the source code release, the game was unofficially ported to Linux and hosted at icculus.org in 2001,http://icculus.org/avp/ Xbox in 2009 and for PlayStation Vita in 2020. Also an unofficial patch project for the PC version exists, based on the source code.Aliens Vs Predator - Source code update = Re- release = On 15 January 2010, after several years of unavailability, Aliens versus Predator was commercially re-released under the title Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000. This version of the game has been updated to work on modern computers, as well as support for the Xbox 360 controllers. Moreover, this release includes all the levels from the original AvP Gold Edition and the extra content of the Millennium Expansion Pack. Supporting only single player initially, multiplayer functionality has since been added. This release can be purchased either through Valve's Steam digital distribution service, through Green Man Gaming, or through GOG.com where it started as a free giveaway. A patch released on 19 January 2010 added proper widescreen support, optional unlimited saves, a locked frame rate, mouse improvements, and other updates to the game. At one point it was available through the now-defunct game streaming service OnLive.  Reception  Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Played as the Marine, late at night with the lights out and the movie-inspired music cranked up, AvP is a totally absorbing, even terrifying experience.\\" Aliens versus Predator received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. IGN praised the game for allowing the player to play three different characters, each with a unique game-play element, and for being \\"fun and terrifying at the same time\\". GamePro cited the lack of a save feature as a major flaw, but praised the \\"splendid graphics, perfect sound effects, multiple vision modes, and ambiance\\" and citing it as \\"the most frightening game since Half-Life\\". The Adrenaline Vault cited the lack of depth in the story as a major flaw but praised the immersive atmosphere describing a moment of being attacked by a facehugger in the game as being \\"in these moments...the greatest game I had ever played\\".  Sequel  A sequel called Aliens versus Predator 2 was developed by Monolith Productions and released by Sierra in 2001. It once again comprised three campaigns for each of the three playable species, but this time, the sequel had a much deeper plot and the campaigns intersected at numerous points.

He had two spells presenting the station's Top 40 singles chart, from 1990 to 1992 and from 1995 until 2002, and also temporarily presented The Radio 1 Breakfast Show during 1993. He has also presented shows on BBC Radio 2, Classic FM, 102.2 Smooth Radio and Real Radio, and appeared on BBC television as a recurring presenter of Top of the Pops between 1988 and 1996. He currently presents a morning show on Greatest Hits Radio England at 10am – 1pm (Mon - Fri) and specialist programmes Now! That's What I Call a Chart Show (Sundays 5pm - 7pm, repeated on Fridays from 7pm - 9pm) and Greatest Hits Superstars (Fridays 9pm - 10pm, repeated on Sundays from 4pm - 5pm) on Greatest Hits Radio England and Scotland. https://planetradio.co.uk/greatest-hits/presenters/mark-goodier/ From 30 March 2020, Mark's morning show is simulcasted across England and Scotland from 10am - 1pm.https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/01/bauer-networks-more-shows-across- scotland/ Early life and career Goodier was born in Harare, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His family moved to Llanfairfechan, Wales shortly after he was born, eventually settling in Edinburgh, Scotland when he was 8 years old. He was educated at George Heriot's School, in Edinburgh. He became a mobile DJ in Edinburgh and then joined a local Free Radio Station (Telstar) where his radio career began. Afterwards he went on to join the local stations Radio Forth and Radio Tay at the age of 19. After progressing through several jobs at stations in Scotland including Radio Clyde in Glasgow and at Metro Radio in the North East of England, he joined BBC Radio 1 in 1987, beginning a 15-year stint with the station, beginning with a two-hour Saturday night show. BBC Radio 1 Goodier co-presented the Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show (with Liz Kershaw and Sybil Ruscoe (Liz's stand-in), and he quickly progressed to a drivetime slot. He created The Evening Session and hosted between 1990 and 1993. During this period, he also presented the UK Top 40 chart countdown on Sunday evenings and was also an established host on Top of the Pops along with several of his BBC Radio 1 colleagues. Many acclaimed bands and artists recorded sessions for Goodier at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios, some of which were commercially released. In 1992, Nirvana's \\"odds-and-sods\\" release, Incesticide, featured several songs recorded for Goodier's BBC show. The album reached the top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic and achieved Platinum status in America. A further session recording was \\"Something in the Way\\", released on the 2011 edition of Nevermind. When Simon Mayo left Breakfast Show in 1993, former BBC Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister approached Steve Wright to take over the slot. Wright said that he would not do so immediately after Mayo, and Bannister asked Goodier to host for four months in late 1993. He then shifted to afternoons, then back to his old drivetime slot in 1995. In the same year, he returned to the chart show after Bruno Brookes left the station. In 1997, Goodier took on a Saturday and Sunday morning slot after quitting daily radio to establish his production company, WiseBuddah. He spent his final two years at Radio 1 only presenting the Top 40 show, before leaving the station entirely in 2002 owing to falling audiences and BBC bosses considering him \\"too old for the job.\\" Goodier's final show was broadcast on 17 November that year, which also marked the 50th anniversary of the UK Singles Chart. Career after BBC Radio One After permanently leaving BBC Radio 1, Goodier presented the EMAP-produced Smash Hits Chart, which competed with Radio 1's official chart and Hit40UK. The Smash Hits Chart finished in March 2006, when EMAP also began to broadcast the Hit40UK chart show across their Big City Network of stations. He also presented the Classical Chart for Classic FM. On 1 April 2006, his new Real Top 40 shows began on the Real Radio network in Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire. Every show reflected sales and airplay for that area. Goodier is featured in a podcast promoting the Top of the Pops boxset alongside Miles Leonard, Malcolm McLaren and David Hepworth. In March 2007, Goodier joined the newly relaunched Smooth Radio in London, as presenter of the weekday mid-morning show from 10 am to 1 pm, his first daily show in a decade, and subsequently this show was networked to other Smooth stations and then on the national Smooth service. He left the station in December 2012 to focus on running his Wisebuddah company. Goodier is a frequent stand-in on BBC Radio 2 when regular presenters are on leave. From 27 February to 2 July 2016 he presented Pick of the Pops on a temporary basis following the dismissal of Tony Blackburn, before Paul Gambaccini took over as the permanent presenter. In addition, he was (and still is) a voiceover artist for television adverts which promote new compact disc-formatted albums, in particular the Now That's What I Call Music! UK series, of which he has been \\"the voice\\" since Now 21 in early 1992, along with the exception of Now 95 in late 2016. Goodier has also hosted the annual Blackpool Illuminations Switch on Concert for two years on Real Radio and Smooth Radio. In June 2012, Goodier joined Spectrum FM, the English language music station in the Costa del Sol, Spain, to present a weekly Saturday morning show. He is a Fellow of The Radio Academy. On 17 November 2016, Goodier suffered a stroke aged 55, which prevented him from voicing the official television advert(s) for Now That's What I Call Music! 95 (UK). He was replaced by television presenter Matt Edmondson. As of July 2020, he has made \\"an incredible\\" recovery.

Dreys are usually built of twigs, dry leaves, and grass, and typically assembled in the forks of a tall tree.Lawniczak, M. (2002).\\"Sciurus carolinensis\\", Animal Diversity Web. They are sometimes referred to as \\"drey nests\\" to distinguish them from squirrel \\"cavity nests\\" (also termed \\"dens\\"). In temperate regions, dreys become much more visible in the autumn, when leaf-fall reveals new nests built the previous summer or in early fall. A favoured site for a drey is a tree crotch about above ground level. Squirrels may also nest in attics or exterior walls of buildings, where a drey may be regarded as a fire hazard, as some squirrels have a habit of gnawing on electrical cables. At other times, squirrels may inhabit a permanent tree den in the hollow of a trunk or large branch. Etymology Sign for the redundantly named \\"Squirrel's Drey\\" pub in Sporle, King's Lynn, Norfolk, UK The origin of the word \\"drey\\" is unknown, but has been traced in English to the early 17th century.meaning and origin of the word \\"drey\\" from Oxforddictionaries.com Accessed online September 29, 2015 Construction In North America, dreys begin as a collection of small, gnawed-off branches bearing green leaves. The habit of harvesting these branches well before autumn (when the leaves would naturally fall) allows the leaves – though they turn brown – to adhere tightly throughout the winter. A finished drey is a hollow sphere, about a foot or more in diameter, with branches and other rough-hewn materials loosely woven on the outside and an inner surface lined with a variety of finer materials, such as grass, moss, leaves, shredded bark or pine needles.Ray, C. Claiborne, 30 Jan. 2017, How Squirrels Build Their Nests: New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/science/squirrels- nests.html (last accessed 8 Mar. 2018). There may be one, or occasionally two, entrance/exit holes in a drey, usually close to the bottom and oriented toward the trunk, which keeps rain out. A second hole is used for an escape route. The incomplete or flat dreys sometimes seen may be hot-weather sleeping platforms, or abandoned efforts built by very young, inexperienced squirrels. Drey construction materials and sizes differ according to squirrel species and region. Eastern gray squirrels, for example, tend to use the leaves, bark and twigs of deciduous trees such as beech, elm, and oak. Southern flying squirrels will often employ fungal rhizomorphs, deciduous leaves, bark and twigs in their nests, while northern flying squirrels often use shredded cedar bark (among other types of bark), lichens, mosses, leaves and twigs in their dreys. In the Pacific Northwest, the northern flying squirrel employs the common Bryoria lichen as the primary material. A drey is almost always at least above the ground, and flying squirrels build much higher. Sometimes squirrels build their own dreys and sometimes they occupy a vacant drey that was previously constructed by another tree squirrel, often of a different species. Dreys must protect against the environment, and require constant upkeep to remain water and predator-resistant. Squirrels often build more than one in a season, as reserve nests, lest the primary drey be disturbed by predators or overrun by fleas or lice. Some dreys have been observed in use for more than a decade by multiple generations of squirrels, although the average drey may be used only a year or two before being abandoned. If used repeatedly, squirrels must constantly maintain their drey, replenishing twigs and leaves as necessary. Remnants of an abandoned nest may be visible for years. Occupation Male and female squirrels may share the same nest for short times during a breeding season, and during cold winter spells squirrels may share a drey to stay warm. However, females nest alone when pregnant. In North America, squirrels produce broods of about three \\"pups\\" twice a year. (After leaving the drey, a young squirrel is termed a \\"juvenile\\" for its first year of life.) The June broods are sometimes born in dreys, but January broods are usually born and raised in tree cavities, which are much safer. Drey broods are about 40% less likely to survive than tree cavity broods, so long as the cavity entrance hole is no wider than about four inches, which can keep out hungry raccoons.

History The standard was developed over a series of \\"DIS Workshops\\" at the Interactive Networked Simulation for Training symposium, held by the University of Central Florida's Institute for Simulation and Training (IST). The standard itself is very closely patterned after the original SIMNET distributed interactive simulation protocol, developed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) for Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) in the early through late 1980s. BBN introduced the concept of dead reckoning to efficiently transmit the state of battle field entities. In the early 1990s, IST was contracted by the United States Defense Advanced Research Project Agency to undertake research in support of the US Army Simulator Network (SimNet) program. Funding and research interest for DIS standards development decreased following the proposal and promulgation of its successor, the High Level Architecture (simulation) (HLA) in 1996. HLA was produced by the merger of the DIS protocol with the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP) designed by MITRE. There was a NATO standardisation agreement (STANAG 4482, Standardised Information Technology Protocols for Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), adopted in 1995) on DIS for modelling and simulation interoperability. This was retired in favour of HLA in 1998 and officially cancelled in 2010 by the NATO Standardization Agency (NSA). The DIS family of standards DIS is defined under IEEE Standard 1278: * IEEE 1278-1993 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application protocols * IEEE 1278.1-1995 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application protocols * IEEE 1278.1-1995 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application protocols (Corrections) * IEEE 1278.1A-1998 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application protocols Errata (May 1998) * IEEE 1278.1-2012 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application protocols * IEEE-1278.2-1995 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Communication Services and Profiles * IEEE 1278.3-1996 - Recommended Practice for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Exercise Management and Feedback * IEEE 1278.4-1997 - Recommended Practice for Distributed Interactive - Verification Validation & Accreditation * IEEE P1278.5-XXXX - Fidelity Description Requirements (never published) In addition to the IEEE standards, the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) maintains and publishes an \\"enumerations and bit encoded fields\\" document yearly. This document is referenced by the IEEE standards and used by DIS, TENA and HLA federations. Both PDF and XML versions are available. Current status SISO, a sponsor committee of the IEEE, promulgates improvements in DIS. Major changes occurred in the DIS 7 update to IEEE 1278.1 to make DIS more extensible, efficient and to support the simulation of more real world capabilities.DIS 7 Overview, SISO PSG File Library Application protocol Simulation state information is encoded in formatted messages, known as protocol data units (PDUs) and exchanged between hosts using existing transport layer protocols, including multicast, though broadcast User Datagram Protocol is also supported. There are several versions of the DIS application protocol, not only including the formal standards, but also drafts submitted during the standards balloting process. * Version 1 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols, Version 1.0 Draft (1992) * Version 2 - IEEE 1278-1993 * Version 3 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols, Version 2.0 Third Draft (May 1993) * Version 4 - Standard for Distributed Interactive Simulation - Application Protocols, Version 2.0 Fourth Draft (March 1994) * Version 5 - IEEE 1278.1-1995 * Version 6 - IEEE 1278.1a-1998 (amendment to IEEE 1278.1-1995) * Version 7 - IEEE 1278.1-2012 (See External Link - DIS Product Development Group.) Version 7 is also called DIS 7. This is a major upgrade to DIS to enhance extensibility and flexibility. It provides extensive clarification and more details of requirements, and adds some higher-fidelity mission capabilities. Protocol data units The current version (DIS 7) defines 72 different PDU types, arranged into 13 families. Frequently used PDU types are listed below for each family. PDU and family names shown in italics are found in DIS 7. * Entity information/interaction family - Entity State, Collision, Collision-Elastic, Entity State Update, Attribute * Warfare family - Fire, Detonation, Directed Energy Fire, Entity Damage Status * Logistics family - Service Request, Resupply Offer, Resupply Received, Resupply Cancel, Repair Complete, Repair Response * Simulation management family - Start/Resume, Stop/Freeze, Acknowledge * Distributed emission regeneration family - Designator, Electromagnetic Emission, IFF/ATC/NAVAIDS, Underwater Acoustic, Supplemental Emission/Entity State (SEES) * Radio communications family - Transmitter, Signal, Receiver, Intercom Signal, Intercom Control * Entity management family * Minefield family * Synthetic environment family * Simulation management with reliability family * Live entity family * Non-real time family * Information Operations family - Information Operations Action, Information Operations Report Realtime Platform Reference FOM (\\"RPR FOM\\") The RPR FOM is a Federation Object Model (FOM) for the High-Level Architecture designed to organize the PDUs of DIS into an HLA object class and interaction class hierarchy. It has been developed as the SISO standard SISO-STD-001. The purpose is to support transition of legacy DIS systems to the HLA, to enhance a priori interoperability among RPR FOM users and to support newly developed federates with similar requirements. The most recent version is RPR FOM version 2.0 that corresponds to DIS version 6.

LVS is a free and open-source project started by Wensong Zhang in May 1998, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. The mission of the project is to build a high- performance and highly available server for Linux using clustering technology, which provides good scalability, reliability and serviceability.  Overview  LVS as used by Wikimedia The major work of the LVS project is now to develop advanced IP load balancing software (IPVS), application-level load balancing software (KTCPVS), and cluster management components. * IPVS: an advanced IP load balancing software implemented inside the Linux kernel. The IP Virtual Server code is merged into versions 2.4.x and newer of the Linux kernel mainline. * KTCPVS: implements application-level load balancing inside the Linux kernel, still under development. LVS can be used for building highly scalable and highly available network services, such as web, email, media and VoIP services, and integrating scalable network services into large-scale reliable e-commerce or e-government applications. LVS-based solutions already have been deployed in many real applications throughout the world, including Wikipedia. The LVS components depend upon the Linux Netfilter framework, and its source code is available in the \`net/netfilter/ipvs\` subdirectory within the Linux kernel source. LVS is able to handle UDP, TCP layer-4 protocols as well as FTP passive connection by inspecting layer-7 packets. It provides a hierarchy of counters in the \`/proc\` directory. The userland utility program used to configure LVS is called ipvsadm, which requires superuser privileges to run. = Schedulers = LVS implements several balancing schedulers, listed below with the relevant source files: * Round-robin (\`ip_vs_rr.c\`) * Weighted round-robin (\`ip_vs_wrr.c\`) * Least-connection (\`ip_vs_lc.c\`) * Weighted least-connection (\`ip_vs_wlc.c\`) * Locality-based least-connection (\`ip_vs_lblc.c\`) * Locality-based least-connection with replication (\`ip_vs_lblcr.c\`) * Destination hashing (\`ip_vs_dh.c\`) * Source hashing (\`ip_vs_sh.c\`) * Shortest expected delay (\`ip_vs_sed.c\`) * Never queue (\`ip_vs_nq.c\`)  Glossary  Commonly used terms include the following: * LVS director: load balancer that receives all incoming client requests for services and directs them to a specific \\"real server\\" to handle the request * Real servers: nodes that make up an LVS cluster which are used to provide services on the behalf of the cluster * Client computers: computers requesting services from the virtual server * VIP (Virtual IP address): the IP address used by the director to provide services to client computers * RIP (Real IP address): the IP address used to connect to the cluster nodes * DIP (Directors IP address): the IP address used by the director to connect to network of real IP addresses * CIP (Client IP address): the IP address assigned to a client computer, that it uses as the source IP address for requests being sent to the cluster  Examples  Setting up a virtual HTTP server with two real servers: ipvsadm -A -t 192.168.0.1:80 -s rr ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.0.1:80 -r 172.16.0.1:80 -m ipvsadm -a -t 192.168.0.1:80 -r 172.16.0.2:80 -m The first command assigns TCP port 80 on IP address 192.168.0.1 to the virtual server. The chosen scheduling algorithm for load balancing is round-robin (\`-s rr\`). The second and third commands are adding IP addresses of real servers to the LVS setup.

She and her running-mate, Walt Brown, pulled in 10,837 votes, the highest total for the Socialist Party since 1952. She was married to her husband Fred Hebert until his death in October 2002. Political career Originally a Republican, she became a socialist by the 1960s. Herbert was a frequent candidate for state office in the 1980s and 1990s under the banner of the Liberty Union Party, a nonviolent socialist party active only in the state of Vermont. In 1996 she was the Liberty Union nominee for Governor of Vermont. She originally entered the 2004 race as the running mate of Eric Chester, one of Brown's leftist rivals for the presidential nomination. Chester lost the nomination to Brown, but Herbert won the VP nomination at the SP national convention. She ran on a platform on democratic socialism and socialist feminism. A recall effort within the party attempted to have Herbert become the SP's presidential candidate, after a major rift arose over Brown's position on abortion. Despite all of the challenges surrounding the campaign, the Brown-Herbert ticket went on to earn more votes than any Socialist Party presidential ticket since 1952. In 2006, Herbert was the Liberty Union Party nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. In 2007, she ran for the vice presidential nomination of the Socialist Party for the 2008 ticket. However, her candidacy was conditional upon Eric Chester winning the presidential nomination. Chester narrowly lost the presidential nomination to Brian P. Moore. In 2012, Herbert was the Liberty Union candidate in the election for Vermont Secretary of State against Democratic, Progressive, Working Families and Republican nominee Jim Condos, she garnered 13.1% of the vote, returning the LUP to major party status in Vermont once again.

The film consists of 11 short stories which share coffee and cigarettes as a common thread, and includes the earlier three short films.  Themes  The film is composed of a comic series of short vignettes shot in black and white built on one another to create a cumulative effect, as the characters discuss things such as caffeine popsicles, Paris in the 1920s, and the use of nicotine as an insecticide – all while sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The theme of the film is absorption in the obsessions, joys, and addictions of life, and there are many common threads between vignettes, such as the Tesla coil, medical knowledge, the suggestion that coffee and cigarettes don't make for a healthy meal (generally lunch), cousins, The Lees (Cinqué and Joie, and a mention of Spike Lee), delirium, miscommunication, musicians, the similarities between musicianship and medical skill, industrial music, acknowledged fame, and the idea of drinking coffee before sleeping in order to have fast dreams. In each of the segments of the film, the common motif of alternating black and white tiles can be seen in some fashion. The visual use of black and white relates to the theme of interpersonal contrasts, as each vignette features two people who disagree completely yet manage to sit amicably at the same table.  Plot segments  The eleven segments that make up the film are as follows: = Strange to Meet You = This is the original 1986 short Coffee and Cigarettes with Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright having a conversation about coffee and cigarettes. Steven tells Roberto about his coffee ideas, such as freezing it into \\"caffeine Popsicles\\" for kids, and how he likes to drink coffee right before he goes to sleep so he can dream faster \\"like a camera on those Indy 500 cars\\". Roberto does not understand anything he says but is entertained to listen. They experiment with switching chairs, but decide to switch back again. Steven suddenly remembers he has a dentist appointment that he is afraid to go to, but has to. Roberto happily volunteers and goes instead of him. = Twins = Originally the 1989 short Coffee and Cigarettes, Memphis Version – aka Coffee and Cigarettes II – this segment features Joie Lee and Cinqué Lee as the titular twins and Steve Buscemi as the waiter who expounds on his theory on Elvis Presley's evil twin. Cinqué Lee also appears in \\"Jack Shows Meg his Tesla Coil\\". The scene also features a recounting of the urban legend that Elvis Presley made racist comments about African Americans during a magazine interview. = Somewhere in California = Filmed in 1993 as the short Coffee and Cigarettes - Somewhere in California, and won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. In this segment musicians Iggy Pop and Tom Waits smoke cigarettes to celebrate that they quit smoking, drink some coffee and make awkward conversation. = Those Things'll Kill Ya = Joseph Rigano and Vinny Vella have a conversation over coffee about the dangers of smoking. The silent Vinny Vella Jr. also appears to beg his father for money, which is given in exchange for affection, which is not provided. = Renée = Renée French (played by herself) drinks coffee while looking through a gun magazine. E. J. Rodríguez plays the waiter, who is eager to be of service. He initially approaches her to serve more coffee, to which she reacts by saying \\"I had the right color, right temperature, it was just right\\". After that, he comes back several times, hesitates, and leaves. He seems intent on striking up a conversation with her. = No Problem = Alex Descas and Isaach De Bankolé are a couple of friends who meet and talk over some coffee and cigarettes. Alex has no problems, or so he answers to Isaach's repeated questioning. At the end of the scene, Alex takes out a pair of dice and rolls three sets of doubles. It could be assumed that he has a gambling problem but to him it appears to be a non-issue. Despite this, he doesn't roll the dice in front of his friend. = Cousins = Cate Blanchett plays herself and a fictional and non-famous cousin named Shelly, whom she meets over some coffee in the lounge of a hotel. There is no smoking in the lounge, as the waiter informs Shelly (but not until Cate is gone). Shelly tells Cate about her boyfriend, Lee, who is in a band. She describes the music style as hard industrial, similar to the band Iggy describes. Cate tells Shelly she looks forward to meeting \\"Lou\\" someday. Cate is made to feel awkward and uncomfortable by Shelly's constant envious remarks about how she perceives Cate's life and attitude. = Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil = Features Jack and Meg White of the band The White Stripes having some coffee and cigarettes. They play themselves, although the scene seems to perpetuate the band's former pretense that they are indeed siblings. Jack shows Meg his Tesla coil that he says he built himself and waxes intellectual on the achievements of Nikola Tesla. In the beginning, Jack seems upset that Meg doesn't share his excitement, and it takes Meg some coaxing to get Jack to agree to show Meg his Tesla coil. He introduces the line, \\"Nikola Tesla perceived the earth to be a conductor of acoustical resonance.\\" Cinqué Lee plays a waiter in this segment. In the end, the coil breaks, and Meg and the Waiter offer suggestions as to why it might be broken. Finally Meg says something that Jack seems to agree to, and he leaves to \\"go home and check it out\\". Meg clinks her coffee cup to produce a ringing noise, pauses, says \\"Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance\\" and clinks her coffee cup to produce the noise again; she looks pensively out into the distance before a cut to black. Early during the segment, \\"Down on the Street\\" by The Stooges is played in the background. = Cousins? = British actors Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan have a conversation over some tea. (Coogan offers Molina a French cigarette, but Molina saves his for later.) Molina is a very enthusiastic fan of Coogan's, who contrarily is very uninterested at their meeting and barely manages to hide this. Molina excitedly shares with him research he came across, learning that they are distant cousins, and proposes a friendship or show business project to capitalize on this. Steve Coogan still remains evasive, lightening up only when an attractive female fan recognizes him. He later tries to make up excuses to keep from ever having to hear from Alfred Molina again, and then clumsily tries to reverse this when he overhears Molina get a call from good friend Spike Jonze. But it is too late and Molina, disappointed, leaves Coogan with the bill. Although the scene is set in LA, the segment was actually shot in Brooklyn at Galapagos, Williamsburg. = Delirium = Hip-hop artists (and cousins) GZA and RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan drink naturally caffeine-free herbal tea and have a conversation with the waiter, Bill Murray, about the dangers of caffeine and nicotine. During this conversation GZA makes a reference to how he would drink much coffee before going to bed so his dreams would \\"whip by\\" similar to the camera-shots at the Indy 500, very similar to the same reference that Steven Wright did in the first segment. Murray requests that GZA and RZA keep his identity secret, while GZA and RZA inform Murray about nontraditional methods to relieve his smoker's hack. = Champagne = William \\"Bill\\" Rice and Taylor Mead spend their coffee break having a nostalgic conversation, whilst Janet Baker singing \\"Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen\\" from Mahler's Rückert-Lieder appears from nowhere. William Rice repeats Jack White's line, \\"Nikola Tesla perceived the earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance.\\" It is possible to interpret the relevance of this line to the constant recurrent themes throughout the seemingly unconnected segments. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 64% approval rating, based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.26/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Episodes vary in quality, but overall this talky film is quirkily engaging.\\" On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". William Thomas of Empire Magazine delighted in the \\"quirky conversations\\" and \\"almost nostalgic air\\" which was punctuated with \\"lovely high contrast black-and-white imagery and snatches of music from Mahler to doo-wop\\". On the other hand, he felt the film suffered from an occasional lack of focus and uneven structure. Roger Ebert commended the film's tempo; writing that \\"none of these 11 vignettes overstays its welcome, although a few seem to lose their way\\". Philip French of The Guardian provided a more critical review. He noted that \\"four or five are duds. Three, however, in which people appear as versions of themselves, are outstanding. Iggy Pop meeting Tom Waits; Cate Blanchett (in both roles) having a reunion with an envious cousin; Alfred Molina taking tea with Steve Coogan in Hollywood\\". Jamie Russell of the BBC labelled it \\"a mixed bag of entertaining genius and absolute rubbish\\". Several reviewers have praised the film's handling of the relationship between celebrities and fame.

Numerous members of the dynasty ruled the republic first as Capitano del popolo and later as Doge. Origins Battle of Meloria, 1284 a major victory of Oberto Doria followed by his brother, Lamba Doria's victory in 1298 at Curzola According to legend, a noble Genoese lady named Auria or Oria della Volta fell in love with a noble pilgrim who was going to Jerusalem for the First Crusade; his name was Arduino di Narbonne but their children were named after the mother—de Oria, the children of Oria. Arduino was a typical name of the Arduinici family of the Piemonte, some of whose members bore the title of Counts of Auriate; one might then speculate that one of the Arduinici of Auriate gave origin to this family, which suddenly appears in history as a local major power in Liguria in the late 11th century. Documentary evidence refers to two members of that family, Martino and Genuardo, in 1110; they are called filii Auriae (the sons or children of Oria). The Doria had fiefs in Sardinia from the 12th century to the 15th century, and also in Dolceacqua, Oneglia and Portofino, in the Riviera to the west of Genoa. Notable members The Doria Castle (up in the photo) in Portovenere Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria, 1606, age 22, as painted by Peter Paul Rubens, shortly after her wedding to Giacomo Massimiliano Doria Simon Doria lived in the late 12th century and was an admiral of the Genoese in the crusaders' assault against Saint Jean d'Acre. Percivalle Doria, who died in 1275, was an infamous warlord and a well-known Provençal poet, would be a member of the family. Also a poet, Simon Doria was podestà of Savona and Albenga. The brothers Oberto Doria and Lamba Doria were naval commanders and politicians: Oberto was Captain of the People in Genoa and led its naval forces in the victory of La Meloria against Pisa in 1284 while Lamba won a major battle against Venetian Andrea Dandolo at Curzola in 1298. Tedisio Doria (or Teodosio) financed the expedition of Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi in 1291. Branca Doria is mentioned by Dante in the Divine Comedy because of his treacherous murder of Michele Zanche, his father-in-law, in 1275. Brancaleone Doria ruled the Giudicato of Arborea and nearly conquered the whole of Sardinia in the late fourteenth century. Ottone Doria commanded the 5,000 or more Genoese crossbowmen hired by the French for the Battle of Crécy against the English, in August 1346. Like many of his troops, he was killed in the battle, where the Genoese ended by being attacked by both sides. Heavy rain had made their bowstrings wet and useless (unlike those of the English longbows, they could not easily be removed) so Ottone ordered a retreat. The French cavalry saw this as cowardice and attacked them, while others were slain by the English bowmen. A remarkable member of the family is Admiral Andrea Doria, Prince of Melfi (1466–1560), who re-established the Genoese Republic. He was perpetual censor of Genoa in 1528 and admiral to the emperor Charles V, who was created Prince of Melfi (1531) and marquis of Tursi (in the kingdom of Naples) in 1555. These titles were inherited by Giovanni Andrea Doria, son of Giannettino Doria who was a second cousin and adopted son of Andrea Doria. Giannettino Doria was killed in 1547 during the Fieschi conspiracy against the power of Andrea Doria over Genoa, and his descendants inherited the titles granted to the great admiral. Giovanni Andrea's son was Giovanni Doria, a cardinal of the Catholic Church. Other notable Dorias of the period include admiral Carlo Doria and art collector Giovanni Carlo Doria. The family had relationships with political entities both in and out of Europe. During the attempts by the Mongol ilkhanate ruler Abaqa to form a Franco- Mongol alliance, his strategy included a strengthening of ties with the Genoese. Many male children of the Doria family were named after foreign rulers, such as Abaga (Abaqa Khan), Casano (Ghazan Khan), and Aitone, named after Hayton, or Hethum I, king of Cilician Armenia.Phillips, p. 102 =Doges of Genoa= Some members of the family became doge of Genoa. *1537-1538: Giovanni Battista Doria *1579-1581: Nicolò Doria *1601-1603: Agostino Doria *1621: Ambrogio Doria *1633-1635: Giovanni Stefano Doria *1793-1795: Giuseppe Maria Doria Titled branches Members of the Doria family bore the titles of Prince of Melfi (Doria-Pamphili branch), of Princes of Centola (Doria d'Angri branch), of Counts of Montaldeo, Marquesses of Ciriè e del Maro, Marquesses of San Columbano, Lords of Oneglia, among many others. Agnatic members of the family are marchesi al cognome, that is, bear the title of marquess attached to the family name as a courtesy title. Non-agnatic princely branches like the Colonna-Doria are still flourishing. There are also titled branches outside Italy, such as the Porrata Doria family in Spain, which rank as marquesses. Role in the great explorations The Doria clan helped finance the Portuguese and Spanish navigations in the late 15th and 16th centuries. Francesco Doria, a banker at Seville, financed Christopher Columbus's expeditions, and his son Aleramo Doria was a banker to King John III of Portugal until 1556. Finally, Aleramo's daughter Clemenza Doria was one of the earliest settlers in the 16th-century Portuguese colonization of Brazil. Clemenza Doria married twice; her second husband was Fernão Vaz da Costa (c. 1520–1567), son of Portuguese Chief Justice Cristóvão da Costa and a great- grandson of the legendary navigator Soeiro da Costa; they originated the Costa Doria family which is still thriving today as one of their members, José Carlos Aleluia [da Costa Doria], is a representative in the Brazilian congress, and businessman João Doria Jr. or João Agripino da Costa Doria III held a cabinet-level position in the José Sarney administration in Brazil (1985–1989) and is currently the elected governor of São Paulo. The genoese Lodisio Doria, knight of Christ's Order, settled in the island of Madeira. Their descendants are the Teixeira Doria, lords of Pena d'Aguia, and França Doria families, which also have as direct ancestor the Portuguese navigator Tristão Vaz. The França Doria branch is headed by the Count of Calçada, with a younger branch headed by the Viscount of Torre Bela. In literature The name Doria was used in Cornelia Funke's \\"Inkheart\\" series (specifically, the book \\"Inkdeath\\") for a semi-main character who eventually fell in love with the teenage heroine.

The term is typically used derisively, often by local political activists frustrated with the lack of attention to local public issues and lack of understanding of local political and governmental nuances. The rise of cookie-cutter campaigns is due in large measure to the rise of political consulting. Where political consultants once were limited mostly to national and statewide elections, they are now employed down to the levels of city council and school board elections.

It is in the municipality of Lom, in the Jotunheimen mountain area. Glittertind had earlier been a challenger for the title as the highest mountain in Norway, as measurements showed Glittertind including the glacier was slightly higher than Galdhøpiggen (2,469 m above sea level with no glacier at the summit). In a 1917 official map, the mountain was indicated to be 2481 m.Kristians amt nr 36: Jotunheimen (Search via http://kartverket.no/Kart/Historiske-kart ) So it was a matter of defining a glacier as a part of a mountain or not. The glacier has, however, shrunk in recent years, and the dispute has been settled in Galdhøpiggen's favour. The summit of Glittertind was reached for the first time in 1841 by Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland and Hans Sletten. Glittertind is easily accessible from Spiterstulen lodge in the west, by a climb of 1300 m, and from Glitterheim lodge in the east, by a climb of 1000 m. The hike from Glitterheim is the easier, but Glitterheim is inside the National Park and can therefore only be reached by foot. The summit hike is a very popular one, only surpassed in seasonal numbers by Galdhøpiggen, its western neighbor. The route across the glacier that crowns the summit is completely without crevasses, but on a hot summer day it might be a wet hike across the melting snow which covers the ice. Visitors might even experience that the meltwater blows up across the summit, leaving hikers soaked. The view is magnificent. East and southeast of Glittertind there are hardly any high peaks, and hence most of the northern and eastern parts of the province of Oppland can be seen. All famous photos of Glittertind are taken on the eastern flank slightly below the top. There used to be a cabin at the summit, but because of the impossibility of mooring it sufficiently, it was taken by a storm and landed on the Grjotbreen glacier, under the steep north wall of the summit. The name The mountain is named after the river Glitra, the last element is the finite form of tind m 'mountain peak'. The name of the river is derived from the verb glitre 'glitter, sparkle'.

It was founded in 1966 and provides data, analysis and recommendations for armed conflict, military expenditure and arms trade as well as disarmament and arms control. The research is based on open sources and is directed to decision-makers, researchers, media and the interested public. SIPRI's organizational purpose is to conduct scientific research in issues on conflict and cooperation of importance for international peace and security, with the goal of contributing to an understanding for the conditions for a peaceful solution of international conflicts and sustainable peace. SIPRI was ranked among the top three non-US world-wide think tanks in 2014 by the University of Pennsylvania Lauder Institute's Global Go To Think Tanks Report.https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir;=1&article;=1008&context;=think_tanks In 2019, SIPRI ranked 31st amongst think tanks globally.James G. McGann, 2019 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report, 2019, University of Pennsylvania Lauder Institute, p. 69. History Ambassador Alva Myrdal In 1964, Prime Minister of Sweden Tage Erlander put forward the idea of establishing a peace research institute to commemorate Sweden's 150 years of unbroken peace. A Swedish Royal Commission chaired by Ambassador Alva Myrdal proposed in its 1966 report to establish an institute, later named the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI. The institute's research should seek to contribute to \\"the understanding of the preconditions for a stable peace and for peaceful solutions of international conflicts\\" and the Commission recommended that research be concentrated on armaments, their limitation and reduction, and arms control. The commission also recommended that SIPRI work is of \\"an applied research character directed towards practical-political questions [which] should be carried on in a constant interchange with research of a more theoretical kind\\". SIPRI has built its reputation and standing on competence, professional skills, and the collection of hard data and precise facts, rendering accessible impartial information on weapon developments, arms transfers and production, military expenditure, as well as on arms limitations, reductions and disarmament. The task of the institute is to conduct \\"scientific research on questions of conflict and cooperation of importance for international peace and security with the aim of contributing to an understanding of the conditions for peaceful solution of international conflicts and for a stable peace\\". The Swedish Riksdag decided that the Institute be established on 1 July 1966 with the legal status of an independent foundation. All SIPRI research is based exclusively on open sources. Organisation SIPRI's organisation consists of a Governing Board, Director, Deputy Director, Research Staff Collegium and support staff. An Advisory Committee serves as a consultative body to the institute. The Governing Board takes decisions on important matters concerning the research agenda, activities, organisation and financial administration of the institute. Other matters are decided by the Director. The Research Staff Collegium advises the Director on research matters. SIPRI headquarters in Solna, Stockholm The staff of about 70 employees is mainly international, with 25 different nationalities reported in 2019. The researchers are recruited for specific project periods and represent various academic disciplines. SIPRI also hosts guest researchers who work on issues related to research programmes as well as interns in relevant fields whose programmes of study can contribute to and benefit from SIPRI's research. The institute works in a global network, with partnerships and cooperation between other institutes and with individual scientists. SIPRI has close cooperation with many multilateral organisations, for example, the United Nations and the European Union. SIPRI is frequently visited by government delegations, parliamentarians as well as researchers from the academic sphere. The institute keeps close connections with the diplomatic body in Stockholm. =Governing board= Current members of the Governing Board: Jan Eliasson, Chair of SIPRI Governing Board * Ambassador Jan Eliasson (Sweden), retired Swedish diplomat and former Deputy Secretary- General of the United Nations, as of 1 June 2017, Chair of the SIPRI Governing Board * Vladimir Baranovsky (Russia), Director, Center for Situation Analysis (CSA) *Jean-Marie Guéhenno (France), Senior Advisor, Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue and a member of the UN Secretary General High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation * Dan Smith (United Kingdom), Director, SIPRI *Patricia Lewis (United Kingdom/Ireland), Research Director, International Security at Chatham House * Espen Barth Eide (Norway), Member of the Norwegian Parliament and former United Nations Special Adviser on Cyprus * Radha Kumar (India), Chair, United Nations University Council * Jessica Tuchman Mathews (United States), Former President of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and current Distinguished Fellow * Ambassador Ramtane Lamamra (Algeria), Member of the UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Board on Mediation and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria Former Governing Board Chairpersons: * Alva Myrdal (1966–67) * Gunnar Myrdal (1967–73) * Rolf Edberg (1974–78) * Hans Blix (1978) * Karin Söder (1978–79) * Rolf Björnerstedt (1979–85) * Ernst Michanek (1985–87) * Inga Thorsson (1987–91) * Daniel Tarschys (1992–2000) * Rolf Ekeus (2000–10) * Göran Lennmarker (2010–14) * Sven-Olof Petersson (2014–2017) =Director= The Director, who is appointed by the Swedish Government, has the main responsibility for SIPRI's work programme.

He is the author of the pseudonymous works attributed to Theron Q. Dumont and Yogi Ramacharaka.Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos, The Celestial Tradition, p. 66, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1992 He wrote an estimated 100 books, all in the last 30 years of his life. He was mentioned in past editions of Who's Who in America, in Religious Leaders of America, and in several similar publications. His works have remained in print more or less continuously since 1900. Works by Atkinson, William Walker 1862-1932 (WorldCat). Works by Ramacharaka Yogi 1862-1932 (WorldCat). Life and career William Walker Atkinson was born in Baltimore, Maryland on December 5, 1862,\\"William Walker Atkinson.\\" Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology, 5th ed. Gale Group, 2001. to Emma and William Atkinson. He began his working life as a grocer at 15 years old, probably helping his father. He married Margret Foster Black of Beverly, New Jersey, in October 1889, and they had two children. Their first child probably died young. The second later married and had two daughters. Atkinson pursued a business career from 1882 onwards and in 1894 he was admitted as an attorney to the Bar of Pennsylvania. While he gained much material success in his profession as a lawyer, the stress and over-strain eventually took its toll, and during this time he experienced a complete physical and mental breakdown, and financial disaster. He looked for healing and in the late 1880s he found it with New Thought, later attributing the restoration of his health, mental vigor and material prosperity to the application of the principles of New Thought. =Mental Science and New Thought= Some time after his healing, Atkinson began to write articles on the truths he felt he had discovered, which were then known as Mental Science. In 1889, an article by him entitled \\"A Mental Science Catechism,\\" appeared in Charles Fillmore's new periodical, Modern Thought. By the early 1890s Chicago had become a major centre for New Thought, mainly through the work of Emma Curtis Hopkins, and Atkinson decided to move there. Once in the city, he became an active promoter of the movement as an editor and author. He was responsible for publishing the magazines Suggestion (1900–1901), New Thought (1901–1905) and Advanced Thought (1906–1916). In 1900 Atkinson worked as an associate editor of Suggestion, a New Thought Journal, and wrote his probable first book, Thought-Force in Business and Everyday Life, being a series of lessons in personal magnetism, psychic influence, thought-force, concentration, will-power, and practical mental science. He then met Sydney Flower, a well-known New Thought publisher and businessman, and teamed up with him. In December, 1901 he assumed editorship of Flower's popular New Thought magazine, a post which he held until 1905. During these years he built for himself an enduring place in the hearts of its readers. Article after article flowed from his pen. Meanwhile, he also founded his own Psychic Club and the so-called \\"Atkinson School of Mental Science\\". Both were located in the same building as Flower's Psychic Research and New Thought Publishing Company. Atkinson was a past president of the International New Thought Alliance. =Publishing career and use of pseudonyms= Throughout his subsequent career, Atkinson was thought to have written under many pseudonyms. It is not known whether he ever confirmed or denied authorship of these pseudonymous works, but all of the supposedly independent authors whose writings are now credited to Atkinson were linked to one another by virtue of the fact that their works were released by a series of publishing houses with shared addresses and they also wrote for a series of magazines with a shared roster of authors. Atkinson was the editor of all of those magazines and his pseudonymous authors acted first as contributors to the periodicals, and were then spun off into their own book-writing careers—with most of their books being released by Atkinson's own publishing houses. One key to unravelling this tangled web of pseudonyms is found in \\"Advanced Thought\\" magazine, billed as \\"A Journal of The New Thought, Practical Psychology, Yogi Philosophy, Constructive Occultism, Metaphysical Healing, Etc.\\" This magazine, edited by Atkinson, advertised articles by Atkinson, Yogi Ramacharaka, and Theron Q. Dumont—the latter two were later credited to Atkinson—and it had the same address as The Yogi Publishing Society, which published the works attributed to Yogi Ramacharaka. Advanced Thought magazine also carried articles by Swami Bhakta Vishita, but when it came time for Vishita's writings to be collected in book form, they were not published by the Yogi Publishing Society. Instead they were published by The Advanced Thought Publishing Co., the same house that brought out the Theron Q. Dumont books—and published Advanced Thought. =Hinduism and yoga= In the 1890s, Atkinson had become interested in Hinduism and after 1900 he devoted a great deal of effort to the diffusion of yoga and Oriental occultism in the West. It is unclear at this late date whether he actually ever ascribed to any form of Hindu religion, or merely wished to write on the subject. According to unverifiable sources, while Atkinson was in Chicago at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, he met one Baba Bharata, a pupil of the late Indian mystic Yogi Ramacharaka (1799 - c.1893). As the story goes, Bharata had become acquainted with Atkinson's writings after arriving in America, the two men shared similar ideas, and so they decided to collaborate. While editing New Thought magazine, it is claimed, Atkinson co-wrote with Bharata a series of books which they attributed to Bharata's teacher, Yogi Ramacharaka. This story cannot be verified and—like the \\"official\\" biography that falsely claimed Atkinson was an \\"English author\\"—it may be a fabrication. No record exists in India of a Yogi Ramacharaka, nor is there evidence in America of the immigration of a Baba Bharata. Furthermore, although Atkinson may have travelled to Chicago to visit the 1892 - 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where the authentic Indian yogi Swami Vivekananda attracted enthusiastic audiences, he is only known to have taken up residence in Chicago around 1900 and to have passed the Illinois Bar Examination in 1903. Atkinson's claim to have an Indian co-author was actually not unusual among the New Thought and New Age writers of his era. As Carl T. Jackson made clear in his 1975 article The New Thought Movement and the Nineteenth Century Discovery of Oriental Philosophy, Atkinson was not alone in embracing a vaguely exotic \\"orientalism\\" as a running theme in his writing, nor in crediting Hindus, Buddhists, or Sikhs with the possession of special knowledge and secret techniques of clairvoyance, spiritual development, sexual energy, health, or longevity. The way had been paved in the mid to late 19th century by Paschal Beverly Randolph, who wrote in his books Eulis and Seership that he had been taught the mysteries of mirror scrying by the deposed Indian Maharajah Dalip Singh. Randolph was known for embroidering the truth when it came to his own autobiography (he claimed that his mother Flora Randolph, an African American woman from Virginia, who died when he was eleven years old, had been a foreign princess) but he was actually telling the truth—or something very close to it, according to his biographer John Patrick Deveney—when he said that he had met the Maharajah in Europe and had learned from him the proper way to use both polished gemstones and Indian \\"bhattah mirrors\\" in divination. In 1875, the year of Randolph's death, the Ukrainian-born Helena Petrovna Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society, by means of which she spread the teachings of mysterious Himalayan enlightened yogis, the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, and the doctrines of the Eastern philosophy in general. After this pioneer work, some representatives from known lineages of Indian and Asian spiritual and philosophical tradition like Vivekananda, Anagarika Dharmapala, Paramahansa Yogananda, and others, started coming to the West. In any case, with or without a co-author, Atkinson started writing a series of books under the name Yogi Ramacharaka in 1903, ultimately releasing more than a dozen titles under this pseudonym. The Ramacharaka books were published by the Yogi Publication Society in Chicago and reached more people than Atkinson's New Thought works did. In fact, all of his books on yoga are still in print today. Atkinson apparently enjoyed the idea of writing as a Hindu so much that he created two more Indian personas, Swami Bhakta Vishita and Swami Panchadasi. Strangely, neither of these identities wrote on Hinduism. Their material was for the most part concerned with the arts of divination and mediumship, including \\"oriental\\" forms of clairvoyance and seership. Of the two, Swami Bhakta Vishita was by far the more popular, and with more than 30 titles to his credit, he eventually outsold even Yogi Ramacharaka. =A French master of magnetism= During the 1910s, Atkinson put his attention into another pseudonym, that of Theron Q. Dumont. This entity was supposed to be French, and his works, written in English and published in Chicago, combined an interest in New Thought with ideas about the training of the will, memory enhancement, and personal magnetism. =Dual career and later years= Death Certificate for William Walker Atkinson In 1903, the same year that he began his writing career as Yogi Ramacharaka, Atkinson was admitted to the Bar of Illinois. Perhaps it was a desire to protect his ongoing career as a lawyer that led him to adopt so many pseudonyms—but if so, he left no written account documenting such a motivation. How much time Atkinson devoted to his law practice after moving to Chicago is unknown, but it is unlikely to have been a full-time career, given his amazing output during the next 15 years as a writer, editor, and publisher in the fields of New Thought, yoga, occultism, mediumship, divination, and personal success. The high point of his prodigious capacity for production was reached in the late 1910s. In addition to writing and publishing a steady stream of books and pamphlets, Atkinson started writing articles for Elizabeth Towne's New Thought magazine Nautilus, as early as November 1912, while from 1916 to 1919, he simultaneously edited his own journal Advanced Thought. During this same period he also found time to assume the role of the honorary president of the International New Thought Alliance. Among the last collaborators with whom Atkinson may have been associated was the mentalist C. Alexander, \\"The Crystal Seer,\\" whose New Thought booklet of affirmative prayer, \\"Personal Lessons, Codes, and Instructions for Members of the Crystal Silence League\\", published in Los Angeles during the 1920s, contained on its last page an advertisement for an extensive list of books by Atkinson, Dumont, Ramacharaka, Vishita, and Atkinson's collaborator, the occultist L. W. de Laurence. Atkinson died November 22, 1932 in Los Angeles, California at the age of 69. Writings Atkinson was a prolific writer, and his many books achieved wide circulation among New Thought devotees and occult practitioners. He published under several pen names, including Magus Incognito, Theodore Sheldon, Theron Q. Dumont, Swami Panchadasi, Yogi Ramacharaka, Swami Bhakta Vishita, and probably other names not identified at present. He is also popularly held to be one (if not all) of the Three Initiates who anonymously authored The Kybalion, which certainly resembles Atkinson's other writings in style and subject matter. Atkinson's two co-authors in the latter venture, if they even existed, are unknown, but speculation often includes names like Mabel Collins, Michael Whitty, Paul Foster Case, and Harriett Case. A major collection of Atkinson's works is among the holdings of a Brazilian organization called Circulo de Estudos Ramacháraca. According to this group, Atkinson has been identified as the author or co-author (with individuals such as Edward E. Beals and Lauron William de Laurence) of 105 separate titles. These can be broken down roughly into the following groups: =Titles written under the name William Walker Atkinson= These works treat themes related to the mental world, occultism, divination, psychic reality, and mankind's nature. They constitute a basis for what Atkinson called \\"New Psychology\\" or \\"New Thought\\". Titles include Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World, and Practical Psychomancy and Crystal Gazing: A Course of Lessons on the Psychic Phenomena of Distant Sensing, Clairvoyance, Psychometry, Crystal Gazing, etc. Although most of the Atkinson titles were published by Atkinson's own Advanced Thought Publishing Company in Chicago, with English distribution by L. N. Fowler of London, England, at least a few of his books in the \\"New Psychology\\" series were published by Elizabeth Towne in Mount Holyoke, Massachusetts, and offered for sale in her New Thought magazine The Nautilus. One such title, for which Atkinson is credited as the author, with the copyright internally assigned to Towne, is The Psychology of Salesmanship, published in 1912. The probable reason that Atkinson made an assignment of copyright to Towne is that his \\"New Psychology\\" books had initially been serialized in Towne's magazine, where he was a freelance writer from 1912 at least through 1914. =Titles written under pseudonyms= These include Atkinson's teachings on Yoga and Oriental philosophy, as well as New Thought and occult titles. They were written in such a way as to form a course of practical instruction. Yogi Ramacharaka titles When Atkinson wrote under the pseudonym Yogi Ramacharaka, he claimed to be a Hindu. As Ramacharaka, he helped to popularize Eastern concepts in America, with Yoga and a broadly-interpreted Hinduism being particular areas of focus. The works of Yogi Ramacharaka were published over the course of nearly ten years beginning in 1903. Some were originally issued as a series of lectures delivered at the frequency of one lesson per month. Additional material was issued at each interval in the form of supplementary text books. Ramacharaka's Advanced Course in Yoga Philosophy and Oriental Occultism remains popular in some circles. According to Atkinson's publisher, the Yogi Publication Society, some of these titles were inspired by a student of the \\"real\\" Yogi Ramacharaka, Baba Bharata, although there is no historical record that either of these individuals ever existed. In reply to inquiries about Yogi Ramacharaka, this official information was provided by the Yogi Publication Society: :\\"Ramacharaka was born in India in about the year 1799. He set forth at an early age to educate himself and to seek a better philosophy for living. :\\"Traveling throughout the East almost always on foot, he visited the depositories of books available. The primary places where libraries were open to him were lamaseries and monasteries, although with the passing of time some private libraries of royalty and of wealthy families were also thrown open to him. :\\"In about the year 1865, after many years of searching and many visits to the lonely high places where he could fast and meditate, Ramacharaka found a basis for his philosophy. At about this same time, he took as a pupil, Baba Bharata, who was the eight-year-old son of a Brahmin family. Together teacher and pupil retraced the steps of the teacher's earlier travels, while Ramacharaka indoctrinated the boy with his philosophy. :\\"In 1893, feeling that his life was drawing to a close, Ramacharaka sent his pupil forth to carry their beliefs to the new world. Arriving in Chicago where the World Columbian Exposition was in progress, Baba Bharata was an instant success. He lectured before enthusiastic audiences from all parts of the world who were visiting the Fair, attracting a considerable following in the process. Many wished him to start a new religion - but he felt only the drive to write on the subject which he lectured on so effectively. :\\"In the closing years of the 1800s, Baba Bharata became acquainted with William Walker Atkinson, an English author who had written along similar lines and whose books had been published by ourselves and by our London connection, L. N. Fowler & Company Ltd. :\\"The men collaborated and with Bharata providing the material and Atkinson the writing talent, they wrote the books which they attributed to Yogi Ramacharaka as a measure of their respect. The very fact that after all these years their books are well known around the world and sell better with every passing year is a credit, too, to the two men who wrote the books.\\" Note that in at least one point, this \\"official\\" account is false: William Walker Atkinson was an American, not \\"an English author\\" and L. N. Fowler, an occult publishing house, was the British publisher of books that Atkinson had published under various of his own imprints in Chicago. Swami Bhakta Vishita titles Atkinson's second Hindu-sounding pseudonym, Swami Bhakta Vishita, billed as \\"The Hindoo Master\\" was not authentically Hindu, nor did he write on the topic of Hinduism. His best-known titles, which have remained in print for many years after entering the public domain, were \\"The Development of Seership: The Science of Knowing the Future; Hindoo and Oriental Methods\\" (1915), \\"Genuine Mediumship, or Invisible Powers\\", and \\"Can We Talk to Spirit Friends?\\" Atkinson produced more than two dozen Swami Bhakta Vishita books, plus a half-dozen saddle-stitched paper pamphlets under the Vishita name. All of them dealt with clairvoyance, mediumship, and the afterlife. Like Ramacharaka, Vishita was listed as a regular contributor to Atkinson's Advanced Thought magazine, but his books were published by the Advanced Thought Publishing Company, not by the Yogi Publication Society, which handled the Ramacharaka titles. Swami Panchadasi titles Despite the popularity of his Yogi Ramacharaka and Swami Bhakta Vishita series, the work that Atkinson produced under his third Hindu-sounding pseudonym, Swami Panchadasi, failed to capture a wide general audience. The subject matter, Clairvoyance and Occult Powers, was not authentically Hindu, either. Theron Q. Dumont titles As Theron Q. Dumont, Atkinson stated on the title pages of his works that he was an \\"Instructor on the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism, Paris, France\\"—a claim manifestly untrue, as he was an American living in the United States. The Atkinson titles released under the Dumont name were primarily concerned with self-improvement and the development of mental will power and self- confidence. Among them were Practical Memory Training, The Art and Science of Personal Magnetism, The Power of Concentration, and The Advanced Course in Personal Magnetism: The Secrets of Mental Fascination, The Human Machine', Mastermind\\". Theodore Sheldon titles The health and healing book, Vim Culture has often been attributed to William Walker Atkinson. Theodore Sheldon does not appear to be the same person as T. J. Shelton, who (like Atkinson) wrote on subjects related to health and healing for The Nautilus magazine and was also one of several honorary presidents of the International New Thought Alliance. Discovery of a 1925 letter from Theodore Sheldon to Florence Sabin of Johns Hopkins University provides evidence of Theodore Sheldon's existence as an actual person, apart from William Walker Atkinson. The original copy of this letter was located in Florence Sabin's university archives and makes reference to Ms. Sabin as Theodore Sheldon's childhood teacher from \\"the banks of Lake Geneva,\\" which is important biographical data about an otherwise unknown writer. While it's possible that Atkinson could have been a ghost writer or contributor to Sheldon's work, the personal nature of Sheldon's correspondence with Florence Sabin would have been very difficult for Atkinson to fabricate, suggesting that Theodore Sheldon was more than an Atkinson pen name. Magus Incognito titles The Secret Doctrines of the Rosicrucians by Magus Incognito consisted of a nearly verbatim republication of portions of The Arcane Teachings, an anonymous work attributed to Atkinson (see below). Three Initiates Ostensibly written by \\"Three Initiates,\\" The Kybalion was published by the Yogi Publication Society. Whether any of the above has a basis in fact, The Kybalion bears notable structural resemblances to The Arcane Teachings, an anonymous set of six books attributed to Atkinson. A full description of the similarities between the two works can be found on the Kybalion page. =Titles Atkinson co-authored= With Edward Beals, which may have been another pseudonym, Atkinson wrote the so-called \\"Personal Power Books\\"—a group of 12 titles on humanity's internal powers and how to use them. Titles include Faith Power: Your Inspirational Forces and Regenerative Power or Vital Rejuvenation. Due to the lack of information on Edward Beals, many believe this is also a pseudonym. With his fellow Chicago resident L. W. de Laurence he wrote Psychomancy and Crystal Gazing. L.W. de Laurence was an incredible character himself, publisher and author of dozens of \\"occult\\" books that had a tremendous influence in many African and Caribbean countries, to the point that, to this day, they are banned in Jamaica. =The 'Arcane Teaching' Books= A series named The Arcane Teaching is also attributed to Atkinson. Perhaps significantly, the doctrine behind The Arcane Teaching is remarkably similar to the philosophy in The Kybalion (another title attributed to Atkinson), and significant portions of material from The Arcane Teaching were later re-worked, appearing nearly verbatim in The Secret Doctrines of the Rosicrucians by Magus Incognito (yet another Atkinson alias). Nothing is known of the first edition of The Arcane Teaching, which apparently consisted of a single volume of the same name. The second edition was expanded to include three 'supplementary teachings' in pamphlet form. The four titles in this edition were: The Arcane Teaching (hardback), The Arcane Formulas, or Mental Alchemy (pamphlet), The Mystery of Sex, or Sex Polarity (pamphlet), and Vril, or Vital Magnetism (pamphlet). This edition was published by A. C. McClurg—the same publisher who brought out the Tarzan the Ape-Man series by Edgar Rice Burroughs—under the \\"Arcane Book Concern\\" imprint, and the name of the publisher, A. C. McClurg, doesn't actually appear anywhere upon the books in this edition. The series bears a 1909 copyright mark, listing the copyright holder as \\"Arcane Book Concern\\". There also appears to have been a pamphlet entitled Free Sample Lesson which was published under the \\"Arcane Book Concern\\" imprint, indicating that it may have appeared concurrently with this edition. The third edition split the main title, The Arcane Teaching, into three smaller volumes, bringing the total number of books in the series to six. This edition consisted of the following titles (the three titles marked with an asterisk (*) are the volumes that had appeared together as The Arcane Teaching in the previous edition): The One and the Many* (hardback), Cosmic Law* (hardback), The Psychic Planes* (hardback), The Arcane Formulas, or Mental Alchemy (binding unknown), The Mystery of Sex, or Sex Polarity (binding unknown), and Vril, or Vital Magnetism (binding unknown). The third edition of The Arcane Teaching was published by A. C. McClurg under its own name in 1911. The books in this series bear the original 1909 copyright, plus a 1911 copyright listing \\"Library Shelf\\" as the new copyright holder. A search of the Library of Congress' web site has revealed that none of The Arcane Teaching series resides in its current collection. = Other likely pseudonyms = Because Atkinson ran his own publishing companies, Advanced Thought Publishing and the Yogi Publication Society, and is known to have used an unusually large number of pseudonyms, other authors published by those companies may also have been his pseudonyms; *A. Gould and Dr. Franklin L. Dubois (who co-wrote The Science of Sex Regeneration circa 1912), and *Frederick Vollrath (who contributed articles on the subject of \\"Mental Physical-Culture\\" to Atkinson's Advanced Thought magazine) *O. Hashnu Hara. Although is hard to find concrete evidence, the first clue is always the impossibility to find information about the writer, other than the fact that he wrote books published by Atkinson. Books under this name include: Practical Yoga; Concentration; and Mental Alchemy, all books with titles similar to other Atkinson's books.

His first published book was Collection of Indiana Lawmaker and Lobbyists (1903), followed by an annual series of Abe Martin-related books between 1906 and 1930, as well as other works such as Short Furrows (1912) and Book of Indiana (1929). Humorist Will Rogers once declared that Hubbard was \\"America's greatest humorist.\\" A few months after introducing his Abe Martin cartoon in 1904,Hubbard moved the setting of his most famous character to the fictional town of Bloom Center in rural Brown County, Indiana. He also added more characters to the cartoon series over the years, typically communicated his many quips and sharp-eyed observations of everyday life by pairing two sentences of humorous but unrelated observations in each cartoon. For years after Hubbard's death in 1930, the Indianapolis News and other newspapers continued to print his Abe Martin cartoon series. In 1932, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources dedicated Brown County State Park to Hubbard and named the park's guest accommodations the Abe Martin Lodge. Hubbard was inducted into the Ohio Journalism Hall of Fame in 1939 and the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 1967. His humor and quips remain in use and continue to entertain readers through the Abe Martin books, as well as Hubbard's longer essays, cartoons, and other published works. Early life and education Frank McKinney Hubbard was born in Bellefontaine, Ohio, on September 1, 1868, and was always called as \\"Kin.\\" His father, Thomas Hubbard, was the outspoken editor and publisher of the weekly Bellefontaine Examiner. After Grover Cleveland's election as U.S. president in 1884, Thomas Hubbard was appointed as the town's postmaster. Kin's mother, Sarah Jane (Miller) Hubbard, was a homemaker. Kin Hubbard was the youngest child in the family that included his five older siblings (three boys: Ed, Horace, and Tom; and 2 girls: Josephine and Ada). He was the only one of the children to marry. Kin was named after Frank McKinney, an Ohio politician who was one of his father's friends.Kelly, pp. 32–33 and 41. Hubbard's artistic ability showed at an early age, but he was disinterested in school. Hubbard began drawing around the age of ten or eleven and became a self-taught artist and writer. He had little formal education beyond elementary school and almost no art training. Hubbard left the Bellefontaine schools at the age of thirteen before finishing the seventh grade. Later, he enrolled at the Jefferson School of Art in Detroit, Michigan, but remained in the school for only a few days before he quit.Kelly, pp. 50 and 60. Marriage and family Hubbard married Josephine Jackson on October 12, 1905. Jackson was born in Greencastle, Indiana, and moved with her family to Indianapolis, Indiana, during her youth. She graduated from Indianapolis's Shortridge High School and met Hubbard a shortly time later, when he was thirty-four years old. Kin nicknamed his wife \\"Tiny\\" although she was not small in stature.Banta, p. 163.Kelly, pp. 7 and 9. Kin and Josephine Hubbard were the parents of two surviving children: a son named Thomas, born in 1907, and a daughter named Virginia, who was born in 1909. Kin Hubbard Jr. was killed in an automobile accident in 1919, when he was little more than a year old; another son died at birth in 1921.Kelly, pp. 98–99 and 139–40.Hawes, p. 18. In 1909, the Hubbard family moved into a newly built home in Irvington, a suburban neighborhood of Indianapolis, and remained there for twenty years. A larger home for the family on North Meridian Street was completed in the fall of 1929.Kelly, pp. 97–99, 140, and 149–51. Kin Hubbard loved the theater throughout his life and frequently attended theatrical performances and circus performances. In addition, he was an avid home gardener. Hubbard tended to avoid public appearances, preferring instead to live a quiet life, but enjoyed traveling, especially in his later years. Hubbard took a cruise to the Bahamas in 1923 and joined an around-the-world voyage aboard the Samaria in 1924. Kin and Josephine Hubbard also took trips to Miami, Florida, during the winter months.Kelly, pp. 140 and 143–44. Career =Early years= Early in his career, Hubbard held several short-term jobs that included work at a paint shop, as a postmaster's clerk for his father, and as an engraver and silhouette artist. In 1891 Hubbard began working as illustrator at The Indianapolis News but he left after three years to return home to Ohio.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 181–82.Hawes, p. 8. Before resuming his career as an artist in Indianapolis in 1891, Hubbard continued travels in the South; found work at Chattanooga, Tennessee, as a mule-team driver; and worked as an amusement park gatekeeper in Cincinnati, Ohio. Hubbard also wrote and performed for the Grand Bellefontaine Operatic Minstrels and Professor Tom Wright's Operatic Solo Orchestra.Boomhower, p. 41.Kelly, p. 60. In addition, he worked as an artist for the Cincinnati Tribune and the Mansfield, Ohio, News before the Indianapolis Sun hired him in 1899 as a sketch artist and caricaturist at a salary of $15 per week. Hubbard stayed at the Sun for two years, but rejoined the Indianapolis News staff in 1901.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 182.Hawes, pp. 11–12. =Indianapolis News humorist= Hubbard initially began work for the Indianapolis News in 1891, after a friend showed John H. Holliday, the newspaper's owner and editor, some of Hubbard's humorous writings and drawings. His initial pay was a meager $12 per week. After three years at the News, Hubbard became frustrated with his limited drawing skills and returned to Ohio.Kelly, pp. 65–69. Hubbard rejoined the staff of the Indianapolis News in the fall of 1901 and continued to work at the newspaper for the remainder of his career. Hubbard became well known for his political caricatures, especially those of Indiana legislators and lobbyists, signing his political drawings as \\"Hub.\\" Hubbard's first book, Collection of Indiana Lawmaker and Lobbyists, was published in 1903. Kelly, p. 81. Hubbard was known for his humor, as well as his practical jokes around the office. He initially worked in a News department that other newspaper workers dubbed the \\"Idle Ward\\" because they thought its workers had plenty of leisure time to talk. In addition to Hubbard, the department's staff included reporter William Herschell, best known for his poem, \\"Ain't God Good to Indiana?,\\" and fellow cartoonist Gaar Williams. After Hubbard gained notoriety for his Abe Martin cartoon, he was given a private office, where he continued to maintain a regular daily work schedule.Boomhower, p. 45.Kelly, pp. 92 and 110–11. In addition to his famous Abe Martin cartoons, which were a feature in the News and went into national syndication in 1910, Hubbard wrote and illustrated a once-a-week humor essay for the \\"Short Furrows\\" series in the Sunday edition of the newspaper. These essays had Abe Martin as the by-line and went into syndicated distribution to other newspapers in 1911. Hubbard also selected essays for his book of the same title, which was published in 1912.Hawes, pp. 19–20. =Creator of the Abe Martin cartoons= First Abe Martin cartoon, published December 17, 1904 Hubbard's most famous work was his creation of the cartoon character Abe Martin, \\"a rustic character that made a habit of commenting on legislators' foibles.\\" His first Abe Martin drawing appeared in the Indianapolis News on December 17, 1904.Kelly, p. 82. The popular cartoon series, which remained the main focus of the cartoonist's work for the remainder of his life, was featured six days a week on the back page of the News for twenty-six years. It also appeared in syndication beginning in 1910.Kelly, pp. xii, 83, and 86.Hawes, pp. 3 and 15. Hubbard moved his Abe Martin character to rural Brown County, Indiana, on February 3, 1905.In the fall of 1904, Hubbard visited Nashville, the seat of government for Brown County, while covering John W. Kern's campaign for governor of Indiana. On October 1, 1904, he sent an illustrated report of Kern's speech and included descriptions of locals in attendance. Hubbard's illustration of the \\"agriculturist\\" for his report from Nashville had a similar appearance and mannerisms to what became his Abe Martin character. See Hawes, p. 15.In 1914, Hubbard and his wife, Josephine, made an auto trip to rural Brown County for another visit. The reason that Hubbard gave for his delayed visit his fear that his characters offended the locals and they might not like him. See Kelly, pp. 82–83 and 131. The scenic locale among the hills of southern Indiana provided Hubbard with additional inspiration to exaggerate Abe Martin's humorous comments. Over the years, Hubbard slightly changed Abe Martin's appearance and added more fictional characters to the series. These characters include, among others, Uncle Niles Turner, Miss Fawn Lippincott, Professor Alexander Tansey, Tell Binkley, and Hon. Ex-Editor Cale Fluhart.Kelly, pp. 84–86.Hawes, pp. 23–24. Although Hubbard's characters were composites of various people, rather than a single individual, their characteristics represented stereotypes of local judges, teachers, businessowners and proprietors, as well as other inhabitants of the fictional town of Bloom Center, and were readily identifiable to his readers.Hawes, pp. 17–18. Portions of the names for the characters came from people that Hubbard knew in Ohio. He also found inspiration for names of his characters from Kentucky jury lists.Boomhower, p. 43. The growing popularity of the Abe Martin cartoon lead to annual publications of related books beginning in November 1906 with the initial publication of Abe Martin of Brown County, Indiana, a compilation of Hubbard's works from the Indianapolis News.Hawes, p. 30. The cartoons also began to reach a wider newspaper audience in 1910 after Hubbard signed with the George Matthey Adams Syndicate. The syndicated Abe Martin cartoon series eventually appeared in about 200 cities.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 180 and 182. The News also continued to publish Abe Martin's sayings even after Hubbard's death in 1930. Part of Martin's popularity was his rustic humor and sharp-eyed observations of everyday life. Hubbard communicated his humor using just a few words. His typical formula was pairing two sentences of humorous but unrelated observations in each of his daily cartoons.Kelly, pp. xii, 83, and 86. Hubbard's signature style of writing also included liberal use of colloquialisms and contractions.\\"Kin Hubbard, Hoosier, Humorist, Human Being,\\" in For example: \\"When a feller says, \\"It hain't th' money but th' principle o' th' thing,\\" it's the money.\\" Death and legacy Hubbard died from a sudden heart attack at his home on North Meridian Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, on December 26, 1930, at the age of sixty-two. He is best remembered as the humorist who created the Abe Martin cartoon and was described by a fellow News employee as \\"a genial Dapper Dan with the soul of an imp.\\"Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 180. During his career with the Indianapolis News, he made more than 8,000 drawings and wrote and illustrated about 1,000 essays for the \\"Short Furrows\\" column. Hubbard also published Abe Martin-related books on an annual basis. For years after Hubbard's death, the News and other newspapers continued to feature his Abe Martin cartoons.Kelly, pp. xv, xvi, 105 and 107. Hubbard's humor continues to entertain readers through his Abe Martin books, as well as Hubbard's longer essays and other works that were published between 1903 and 1930.Kelly, p. 111.Banta, pp. 163–64. Honors and tributes *Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, wrote, \\"Riley's Tribute,\\" a poem dedicated to Abe Martin's comical humor and the creator of the famous caricature. Hubbard included Riley's poem in his first Abe Martin book, Abe Martin of Brown County, Indiana, which was initially published in the fall of 1906. *George Ade, a noted Hoosier humorist, playwright, and author, wrote \\"Abe Martin of Brown County,\\" praising of Hubbard and his cartoon character. The article appeared in the May 1910 issue of American magazine and increased national awareness and the popularity of Hubbard's work, which went into national syndication later that year.Hawes, pp. 19–20. *Hubbard's friendImage from the Hubbard manuscript collection at the Lilly Library at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. See: and fellow American humorist Will Rogers declared Hubbard was \\"America's greatest humorist.\\" Rogers also commented: \\"Just think –– only two lines a day, yet he expressed more original philosophy in 'em than all the rest of the paper combined.\\" *In 1927, Hubbard and other American cartoonists that included Gaar Williams, John T. McCutcheon (creator of the 1931 Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoon, The Wise Economist Asks A Question), Harold Gray (famous for the Little Orphan Annie comic strip), and Fontaine Fox (creator of the Toonerville Folks comics) had their work featured in the annual Hoosier Salon art exhibition. *At the time of Hubbard's death in 1930, McCutcheon, a noted cartoonist for the Chicago Tribune, published a cartoon showing Hubbard's grief-stricken characters standing at their creator's door.Kelly, p. xiv. *In May 1932, two years after Hubbard's death, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources dedicated Brown County State Park to Hubbard.

Biography  Ivar Jacobson was born in Ystad, Sweden on September 2, 1939. He received his Master of Electrical Engineering degree at Chalmers Institute of Technology in Gothenburg in 1962. After his work at Ericsson, he formalized the language and method he had been working on in his Ph.D. at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 1985 on the thesis Language Constructs for Large Real Time Systems. After his master's degree, Jacobson joined Ericsson and worked in R&D; on computerized switching systems AKE http://www.ericssonhistory.com/products/the-switches/AKE---an-electronic-dead- end/ and AXE including PLEX. After his PhD thesis in April 1987, he started Objective Systems with Ericsson as a major customer. A majority stake of the company was acquired by Ericsson in 1991, and the company was renamed Objectory AB. Jacobson developed the software method Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) published 1992, which was a simplified version of the commercial software process Objectory (short for Object Factory). In October, 1995, Ericsson divested Objectory to Rational SoftwareDBMS Interview - October 1996 and Jacobson started working with Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh, known collectively as the Three Amigos. When IBM bought Rational in 2003, Jacobson decided to leave, after he stayed on until May 2004 as an executive technical consultant. In mid-2003 Jacobson formed Ivar Jacobson International (IJI) which operates across three continents with offices in the UK, the US, Sweden, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.  Work  = Ericsson = In 1967 at Ericsson, Jacobson proposed the use of software components in the new generation of software controlled telephone switches Ericsson was developing. In doing this he invented sequence diagrams, and developed collaboration diagrams. He also used state transition diagrams to describe the message flows between components. Jacobson saw a need for blueprints for software development. He was one of the original developers of the Specification and Design Language (SDL). In 1976, SDL became a standard in the telecoms industry. At Objectory he also invented use cases as a way to specify functional software requirements. = Rational Software = At Rational, Jacobson and his friends, Grady Booch and James Rumbaugh, designed the UML and his Objectory Process evolved to become the Rational Unified Process under the leadership of Philippe Kruchten. = Essential Unified Process = In November 2005, Jacobson announced the Essential Unified Process or “EssUP” for short. EssUP was a new “Practice”-centric software development process derived from established software development practices. It integrated practices sourced from three different process camps: the unified process camp, the agile software development camp and the process improvement camp. Each one of them contributed different capabilities: structure, agility and process improvement. Ivar has described EssUP as a \\"super light and agile\\" RUP. IJI have integrated EssUP into Microsoft Visual Studio Team System and Eclipse. = EssWork = Standing on the experience of EssUP Ivar and his team, in particular Ian Spence and Pan Wei Ng, developed EssWork starting in 2006. EssWork is a framework for working with methods. It is based on a kernel of universal elements always prevalent in software development endeavors. On top of the kernel some fifteen practices have been defined. A team can create their own method by composing practices. = SEMAT and Essence = In November 2009, Jacobson, Bertrand Meyer and Richard Soley (\\"the Troika\\") started an initiative called SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) to seek to develop a rigorous, theoretically basis for software engineering practice, and to promote its wide adoption by industry and academia. SEMAT has been inspired by the work at IJI, but with a fresh new start. It has resulted in Essence, which is an OMG standard since November 2014. Essence views methods as a combination of software engineering and development practices. It aims to enable the abstraction of practices from the methods, thus facilitating their reuse and combination for tailoring methods as best suits the needs.

In economics, this law pertains to the relationship between the growth of output and the growth of productivity. According to the law, faster growth in output increases productivity due to increasing returns. Verdoorn (1949, p. 59) argued that \\"in the long run a change in the volume of production, say about 10 per cent, tends to be associated with an average increase in labor productivity of 4.5 per cent.\\" The Verdoorn coefficient close to 0.5 (0.484) is also found in subsequent estimations of the law.  Description  Verdoorn's law describes a simple long-run relation between productivity and output growth, whose coefficients were empirically estimated in 1949 by the Dutch economist. The relation takes the following form: p=a+ bQ where p is the labor productivity growth, Q the output growth (value-added), b is the Verdoorn coefficient and a is the exogenous productivity growth rate. Verdoorn's law differs from \\"the usual hypothesis […] that the growth of productivity is mainly to be explained by the progress of knowledge in science and technology\\", as it typically is in neoclassical models of growth (notably the Solow model). Verdoorn's law is usually associated with cumulative causation models of growth, in which demand rather than supply determine the pace of accumulation. Nicholas Kaldor and Anthony Thirlwall developed models of export-led growth based on Verdoorn's law. For a given country an expansion of the export sector may cause specialisation in the production of export products, which increase the productivity level, and increase the level of skills in the export sector. This may then lead to a reallocation of resources from the less efficient non- trade sector to the more productive export sector, lower prices for traded goods and higher competitiveness. This productivity change may then lead expanded exports and to output growth. Thirlwall (1979) shows that for several countries the rate of growth never exceeds the ratio of the rate of growth of exports to income elasticity of demand for imports. This implies that growth is limited by the balance of payments equilibrium. This result is known as Thirlwall's Law. Sometimes Verdoorn's law is called Kaldor-Verdoorn's law or effect.

He was a member of the Continental Congress, and a signer of the Articles of Confederation. Early life Telfair was born in 1735 on his family's ancestral estate in western Scotland.Johnson, Charles J. \\"Edward Telfair (1735-1807).\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia. May 26, 2015. Web. August 30, 2015. He graduated from the Kirkcudbright Grammar School, before acquiring commercial training. He immigrated to America in 1758 as an agent of a commission house, settling in Virginia. Telfair subsequently moved to Halifax, North Carolina, and finally to Savannah, Georgia, where he established his own commission house. He arrived in Georgia in 1766, joining his brother, William, who had emigrated earlier. Together with Basil Cowper, Telfair built the commission house, and it was an overnight success. =Slave owner= Telfair was a slave owner and a consultant on slavery issues.Edward Telfair Papers, 1764–1831; 906 Items & 5 Volumes; Savannah, Georgia; \\"Papers of a merchant, governor of Georgia, and delegate to the Continental Congress\\". His mercantile firm dealt in slaves, among other things, and contemporary correspondence of his included discussions of such topics as: the management of slaves; the purchase and sale of slaves; runaway slaves; the mortality rate of slaves born on plantations; the difficulty of selling closely related slaves; and the relations between whites and freedmen. Revolutionary period Telfair was a member of a Committee of Safety (1775–1776), and was a delegate to the Georgia Provincial Congress meeting at Savannah in 1776. He was also a member of the Georgia Committee of Intelligence in 1776. Telfair was elected to the Continental Congress for 1778, 1780, 1781, and 1782. He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation. In 1783, during the Cherokee–American wars, Telfair was commissioned to treat with the Chickamauga Cherokee Indians. Telfair was the designated agent (on behalf of Georgia) in talks aimed at settling the northern boundary dispute with North Carolina in February 1783. The land in question was generally regarded as Creek land, so the Cherokees readily signed the treaty. The Creeks refused. Although the citizens of Franklin County begged him to retaliate, Secretary of War, Henry Knox, instructed Governor Telfair not to retaliate against the Creek Indians. He served three terms as Governor of the state of Georgia. During his second term as governor, he illegally granted thousands of acres of land to speculators as part of the Yazoo land fraud. Later life Telfair was one of only 12 men who received electoral votes during the first election for President and Vice President of the United States,Journal of the Senate; Vol. 1; 1789; p8. receiving the vote of one unrecorded elector from his home state of Georgia. Telfair died in Savannah in 1807, interred initially in the family vault at Sharon plantation.

Although candy apples and caramel apples may seem similar, they are made using distinctly different processes. History According to one source, American William W. Kolb invented the red candy apple. > Kolb, a veteran Newark candy-maker, produced his first batch of candied > apples in 1908. While experimenting in his candy shop with red cinnamon > candy for the Christmas trade, he dipped some apples into the mixture and > put them in the windows for display. He sold the whole first batch for 5 > cents each and later sold thousands yearly. Soon candied apples were being > sold along the Jersey Shore, at the circus and in candy shops across the > country, according to the Newark News in 1948.Newark Sunday News, November > 28, 1948, pg.16. Newark Evening News, June 8, 1964, pg. 32 Ingredients and method Candy apples are made by coating an apple with a layer of sugar that has been heated to hard crack stage. The most common sugar coating is made from sugar (white or brown), corn syrup, water, cinnamon and red food coloring. Humid weather can prevent the sugar from hardening. Regional traditions Pommes d'amour on display * Australia – the Granny Smith variety of apple is considered ideal for creating the children's treat. * Brazil – candy apples (named as in other Lusophone countries maçã-do-amor, as in the French pommes d'amour, meaning \\"apples of love\\") are common in the festivities in honor of John the Apostle. * China – a similar treat called Tanghulu is made by coating small fruits, traditionally hawthorns with hard sugar syrup. * Canada – very popular and usually eaten at fairs or carnivals. * France – candy apples are called pommes d'amour (apples of love). They are a common treat found at many festivals in France. * Germany – most often associated with the Christmas season. They are also sometimes sold at carnivals and fairs * Israel – almost solely sold in cities' squares on Yom Ha'atzmaut eve (Israel Independence Day) as part of the street celebrations. * Japan – candy apples, grapes, strawberries and tangerines are commonly available at Japanese festivals. * Republic of Ireland – eaten at Halloween. * United Kingdom – associated with and eaten at Halloween (Scotland and Northern Ireland), Bonfire Night (England and Wales). * United States – jelly apples, found in New York's Coney Island area, are related but have a soft candy (\\"jelly\\") coating and a cherry flavor, not cinnamon. Urban myth During the 1960s and 1970s, news reports about children supposedly receiving candy apples with pins and razor blades in them, created concern during Halloween in the United States. Hospitals offered free x-rays to detect foreign objects in the candy apples. To date, the stories have never been substantiated and fall into the category of urban legend.

In 1994 it was divided into three new federal states: North Kordofan, South Kordofan and West Kordofan. In August 2005, West Kordofan State was abolished and its territory divided between North and South Kordofan States, as part of the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. West Kordofan was reestablished in July 2013.Western Kordofan State Sudan shuffles governors of Kordofan states including ICC suspect Geography Kordofan covers an area of some 376,145 km² (146,932 miles²), with an estimated population in 2000 of 3.6 million (3 million in 1983). It is largely an undulating plain, with the Nuba Mountains in the southeast quarter. During the rainy season from June to September, the area is fertile, but in the dry season, it is virtually desert. The region’s chief town is El-Obeid. Economy and demography Traditionally the area is known for production of gum arabic. Other crops include groundnuts, cotton and millet. The main tribal groups are Arab tribes, such as Dar Hamid, Kawahla, Hamar, Bedairiah, Joamaah and Rekabeiah. In Northern Kordofan there are large grazing areas used and inhabited for hundreds of years by Arabic-speaking, semi-nomadic Baggara and camel-raising Kababish. Nilotic tribes, Nuba, Shilluk and Dinka, also inhabit parts of Kordofan. The Kordofanian languages are spoken by a small minority in southern Kordofan and are unique to the region, as are the Kadu languages, but Arabic is the main and most widely spoken language in the greater Kordofan region. History =Before 1840= About the beginning of the 16th century, Funj from Sennar settled in the country; toward the end of that century, Kordofan was conquered by Suleiman Solon, Sultan of Darfur. In 1779, the King of Sennar (see Kingdom of Sennar) sent Sheikh Nacib, with two thousand cavalry, to take possession of the country, which remained for about five years under the government of Sennar. There followed a considerable immigration of Arab tribes and native people from Sennar and Dongola (see old Dongola) into the country. The Sennari however suffered a decisive defeat in 1784 and thereafter under Darfur viceroys the country enjoyed prosperity. The inhabitants lived in peace and were not troubled with taxes; the merchants were exempt from duties, and the tribute paid was a voluntary present to the Sultan of Darfur. Bara, the second commercial town of importance in the country, was built by the Dongolavi. Commerce extended in all directions. Caravans brought products from Abyssinia and Egypt into Lobeid and Bara, from which the greater part was again transported on to other parts of Africa. This prosperity ended in 1821 when Mehemet Ali, Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt sent his son-in-law, Mahommed Bey the Defturdar, with about 4,500 soldiers and eight pieces of artillery, to subject Kordofan to his power. The monopoly enjoyed by the Egyptian governors in Kordofan impeded trade and stifled entrepreneurial activities. From 1837 to 1839, the country was explored by Ignaz Pallme. =After 1840= The Mahdi captured El-Obeid in 1883. The Egyptian government dispatched a force from Cairo under the British General William Hicks, which was ambushed and annihilated at Sheikan to the south of El Obeid. Following British reoccupation in 1898, Kordofan was added to the number of provinces of the Sudan. In 1973 it was split into the provinces (mudiriya) of North Kordofan and South Kordofan, which became states (wilayat) in 1994. In 2011, armed conflict in South Kordofan broke out in June 2011, ahead of independence for South Sudan. Fighting has since involved rebel groups in Darfur and has expanded into North Kordofan.

Biography He studied with Karol Woytyla in the Belgian Pontifical College before the latter's election to Pope John Paul II. Before his nomination as cardinal he was made a member of the St Bavo Chapter in 1961.http://www.odis.be/hercules/toonPers.php?taalcode=nl&id;=3641 Canon Joos was a judicial vicar in ecclesiastical tribunals of the diocese of Ghent, doctor in canon law. He was professor at CIBI and the seminary.http://www.kerknet.be/actua/nieuws_detail.php?nieuwsID=51745 In 2003 the Vatican published the wish of the pope to create Joos cardinal in the next Consistory. In Belgium everyone was surprised, in the Belgian media he was only known as a parish priest. Belgian media mistook him for another priest just after he was elevated to cardinal. It was the first time in the history of the diocese that a canon was elevated to cardinal. His elevation as cardinal was seen by many as gratitude from Pope John Paul II towards his long-time friend. After announcing his intention to elevate Canon Joos to the rank of cardinal, Pope John Paul also appointed him titular Bishop of Ypres, and Joos was consecrated on 7 October 2003, days before the consistory at which he became a member of the College of Cardinals. After his elevation, Cardinal Joos continued to live in the Diocese of Ghent, serving as a parish priest and as judicial vicar in ecclesiastical tribunals. The cardinal died in Landskouter, and received a pontifical funeral in Saint-Bavo cathedral. He was buried like requested in Landskouter, and not in the Cathedral of Ghent.http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/g0v9v8e9http://www.landskouter.be/tag/gustaaf- joos/ Interview of Gustaaf Joos with P-magazine Joos gained notoriety in January 2004, when in an interview to Belgian P-Magazine, he said, about homosexuals: :\\"I am prepared to sign here in my blood that of all those who say they are lesbian or gay, at most five to 10 per cent are effectively lesbian or gay. All the rest are sexual perverts. I demand you write this down. If they come to protest on my doorstep, I don't care. I'm just speaking out on what thousands of people are thinking but never get a chance to say. Real homosexuals don't wander in the streets in colourful suits. Those are people who have a serious problem and have to live with that. And if they err, they will be forgiven.\\" about politics and universal suffrage: :\\"Politics, democracy. Don't make me laugh. The right to vote, what is that all about? I find it strange that a snot-nosed 18-year-old has the same vote as a father of seven. One has no responsibilities whatsoever, the other provides tomorrow's citizens. \\" and about prostitution: :\\"If a man thinks he needs sex or is going to explode, it is better to find a prostitute than seduce or rape a girl. At least there are no innocent victims involved\\". Joos also expressed admiration for Cyriel Verschaeve, a Belgian priest and poet who was convicted as a Nazi collaborator for recruiting young men for the Eastern Front during the Second World War. This interview created a stir in some Belgian media. Upon the fierce reaction of those media, Joos always stood by his comments. Godfried Cardinal Danneels distanced himself from Joos through his spokesman Toon Osaer, while the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism threatened to sue him for violating an anti-discrimination law. As a consequence of this interview, Cardinal Joos received death threats.

It is the fifth main installment in the Puyo Puyo puzzle game series and the second Puyo Puyo game to be programmed by Sonic Team after Puyo Pop (which was released just after the series' original developer, Compile, went bankrupt). This was the start of the \\"reboot\\" series of the Puyo Pop franchise, with a new plot discussing how Accord lost the flying cane. Sega, which acquired the series' rights from Compile in 1998, published all the Japanese releases of the game. The game was scarcely released internationally, and certain versions were released by other publishers in those areas. Only the GameCube and Nintendo DS versions were released in North America. Europe received both versions plus the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable versions. The NAOMI port to Dreamcast, released exclusively for the Japanese arcade cabinets, was the last Dreamcast game developed by Sonic Team, as well as the last first-party title released on the platform. The Dreamcast version is the only console version to use sprites in place of 3D models. Gameplay The basic game mechanics are mainly similar to those of Puyo Puyo: the player has a 6x12 board, and must decide where to place incoming groups of variously-colored blobs, or puyo. After placing each set of puyo, any groups of four or more of the same colored adjacent puyo will pop. Any above will fall down and can form more groups for a chain reaction. Each time groups of puyo pop, the player will score points and send \\"trash\\" (aka \\"garbage\\" and \\"nuisance\\") to their opponent. Garbage temporarily gets stored in a bar above the playfield, represented by symbols and warning the player of an incoming amount of garbage. These trash puyo are colorless and will only pop when puyo next to them do so, rather than in groups as normal. These will only fall if the player fails to make a chain, and trash falls in groups of 30 (one rock) at a time. When a player's board fills up, either if they cannot make groups or if they are sent a large amount of trash (usually the latter), they lose and the other player will win. A new addition to the game mechanics is Fever mode. Fever mode occurs when a bar in the middle of the screen is filled up. To fill the bar, one must offset (or counterattack) the trash being sent to the field by the opponent. Every chain, which is a single popping of puyo, will fill one space in the fever meter until it is full, which is when fever activates. In fever mode, a pre-designed chain will fall onto an empty field. In a limited amount of time, one must find a trigger point in the puzzle, which will cause a large chain to go off and attack the opponent. Once a chain is made, another puzzle falls, bigger and more complicated than the previous one. This keeps occurring until time runs out, then it returns the player to their original field. The Nintendo DS version supports 2 to 8 players, as opposed to the others which only support 2 or 4. In this mode, one can play as any available character. There is also an endless mode, where one can practice fever mode, complete small tasks as they are given, or play the original game. However, the grid and all clear rules remain the same as they do in fever, so it's not exactly classic. Plot Ms. Accord, a teacher at the Primp Magic School, has lost her Flying Cane, the equivalent of a magic wand, and claims to have a reward for the student who can find it. The player plays the role of either Amitie or Raffine, students at the school, as they venture across the Puyo Pop Fever world to find the cane, while meeting many wacky characters along the way and battling them. Raffine's course contains more difficult gameplay and alters the characters the player meets, as well as which character actually finds the wand. When playing as Raffine near to the end of the game, it is revealed that Accord never actually lost her flying cane. Raffine then plans on revealing her and Popoi's secret, but fails in her ending, as she is knocked unconscious by Ms. Accord, losing all memories of the flying cane incident. She regains consciousness near her school where Amitie and her friends congratulate her. Release =Soundtrack= PuyoPuyo Fever 1&2 Sound Track for both games Puyo Pop Fever and Puyo Puyo Fever 2 was released on July 26, 2007. The track has a total of 45 tracks. =Mobile remake= On February 1, 2009, Sega released a remake of Puyo Puyo Fever in Japan for iOS and Android, titled . Reception Edge ranked the game #64 on its list of \\"The 100 Best Games To Play Today\\", stating that \\"Behind sugary visuals lies a game that revels in bringing about the ultimate chain reaction, the play area riddled with hidden score opportunities until the entire screen collapses into implosions of multipliers.\\" Legacy In Sega Superstars, there is a game based on Puyo Pop Fever, though the gameplay differs from the original game. The player must position his/her body in a certain position to get the Puyos into a pot of the same color. Bombs will also fall, and if they get into a pot, points are lost. In Sega Superstars Tennis, a minigame based on Puyo Pop Fever is featured. Players have to clear Puyos by hitting the ball at them. If the ball hits a Puyo touching another Puyo of the same color, all of them disappear and extra points are awarded. Occasionally, some Puyos become garbage Puyos that do not disappear when the ball hits them, but they can be cleared if one of the colored Puyos attached to them are hit. This minigame is played on the stage based on Nights.

Byglandsfjorden to the right Setesdal is north of Kristiansand Traditional Silver Jewelry used in addition to the Setesdalsbunad Setesdal (; older name: Sætersdal) is a valley and a traditional district in Agder County in southern Norway. It consists of the municipalities of Bykle, Valle, Bygland, Iveland, and Evje og Hornnes. The Otra river flows through the valley of Setesdal into the sea near Kristiansand. Otra flows from the Hardangervidda plateau in Telemark to the north. The historic Setesdal starts at Evje and extends as far as the farm Bjåen, at the edge of Telemark county. Øvre (Upper) Setesdal is in the municipality of Bykle. The municipalities of Iveland, Evje & Hornes and Bygland comprise the Nedre (Lower) Setesdal. Valle municipality is in the middle of the Setesdal valley. Norwegian National Road 9 runs through Setesdal.  Etymology  The oldest Norse form of the name was just Setr, and this was later replaced by Setrsdalr ('the dale/valley of Setr'). The common word setr has the meaning 'homestead, farm' – and Setr was probably originally the name of an old, large farm in the central part of Valle. The old farm was then later divided into a lot of smaller parts, but the name survived as the name of the district.  History  The Historia Norwegiæ, a short history of Norway written by a monk in the second half of the 12th century, reports that Setesdal was then part of the law district \\"Telemark with Råbyggelag\\". A Raabygger or Råbygger is one who lives in a corner; this is an apt description for the valley of Setesdal, which runs like a wedge into the heights of the mountain called Haukelifjell. Ascending the Otra valley from Evje, one reaches the lake Byglandsfjord. At this point one historically found one of the more pronounced cultural transitions in Norway; there was a radical change in racial characteristics, dress (folk costumes or Bunad), architecture, dialect, folk music, dance (e.g., the ganger, a form of Bygdedans), customs, and cuisine. Particularly obvious north of the mountain pass of Byklestigen, the people of upper Setesdal were observed to be more closely related in blood and speech to their eastern neighbours in Telemark, as well as their immediate neighbours in adjoining districts of Rogaland to the west than to those people down the valley. Sigurd Fåvnesbane featured on the portal plank from Hylestad Stave Church Between Valle in Setesdal on the western side of the mountains and Fyresdal on the eastern side, one finds a medieval trail that priests and bishops used to get between the counties of Agder and Telemark. This trail is named \\"The Bishop's Road\\"(Bispevegen) and every year a march called \\"The Bishop's Road March\\" (Bispevegmarsjen) starts at Kleivgrend in Fyresdal. The Hylestad stave church, constructed in the 13th century, in Setesdal was demolished in the 17th century. Its portal, with several carved scenes illustrating the legend of Sigurd Fåvnesbane (Sigurd the Dragon-slayer), is on display at University Museum of National Antiquities in Oslo (Universitetets Oldsaksamling, Historisk Museum, Oslo). Sigurd's slaying of Fafnir is described in the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson and the Völsungasaga as well as alluded to in Beowulf and Njáls saga. The Setesdal Line () is a railroad between Kristiansand and Byglandsfjord, Setesdal in southern Norway. It was opened to Hægeland in 1895, and to Byglandsfjord in 1896. This railroad was closed down in 1962 but parts of it exist today as a hobby railroad and it is in regular tourist use during the summer months. Bjoren is an old steamboat that is in regular tourist use on a part of the river Otra called Byglandsfjord.

Educated at St Albans School (where he was a classmate of Stephen Hawking) and at St John's College, Cambridge, he was a member of the Cambridge University Footlights revue in 1962, alongside John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. Hendra is probably best known for being the head writer and co-producer in 1984 of the first six shows of the long-running British satirical television series Spitting Image, and for starring in the film This Is Spinal Tap as the band's manager Ian Faith. Early life and career Hendra was born in Hertfordshire. His surname is Cornish, and he also has Irish ancestry.https://in- sightjournal.com/2016/12/01/an-interview-with-tony-hendra-part-one/ In 1964, Hendra moved to America, with actor and comedian Nick Ullett. For the next five years they worked successfully as a comedy team appearing at the Cafe Au Go Go in New York with Lenny Bruce, at the hungry i in San Francisco with Nina Simone and at the Shadows in Washington DC with various headliners including Woody Allen. They were regular guests on The Merv Griffin Show and appeared six times on The Ed Sullivan Show. in 1969 Hendra broke up the comedy team and in 1970 began writing for National Lampoon magazine from its inception. In 1971 he became the first editor hired by founders Doug Kenney and Henry Beard. In 1972, Hendra co-created National Lampoon's first album Radio Dinner, with Michael O'Donoghue, on which Hendra performed a parody of John Lennon titled Magical Misery Tour. In 1973, Hendra produced, directed and co-wrote (with Sean Kelly), the Lampoon's off-Broadway revue Lemmings in which Hendra cast John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Rhonda Coullet, Christopher Guest and Alice Playten in their first starring roles. Hendra continued as an editor of the Lampoon until 1975 when he became co-editor-in-chief with Kelly until 1978. Freelance editor After leaving the Lampoon in 1978, Hendra began working as a freelance editor, writer and actor. During the New York newspaper strike of 1978, he edited and co-created the parody Not the New York Times with Rusty Unger, Christopher Cerf, and George Plimpton, and published by Larry Durocher and Josh Feigenbaum. In 1979 he co-edited (with Cerf and actor Peter Elbling) \\"The 80s - A Look Back\\" In 1980 he packaged and edited The Sayings of Ayatollah Khomeini aka The Little Green Book of Ayatollah Khomeini, a collection of the Ayatollah's actual teachings with an introduction by Clive Irving which was regularly featured on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. In 1982 he was editor-in-chief of Off the Wall Street Journal and Off the Wall Street Journal II which between them sold almost a million copies and featured such contributors as Kurt Andersen. Other parodies Hendra created and edited included The Irrational Inquirer, Playboy: the Parody and Not the Bible (1983). He was featured on the cover of Newsweek (25 April 1983) with Sean Kelly and Alfred Gingold. Hendra was a writer for and became editor-in-chief of Spy Magazine from 1993–94. In the mid-1980s, he decided to devote himself exclusively to writing and in 1987 published \\"Going Too Far\\" a history of 'sick' 'black' 'anti-establishment' American satire (aka \\"Boomer Humor\\") from the 1950s to the 1980s, which featured interviews of Boomer Humor's chief practitioners. Television and films In 1984, Hendra co-created, co-wrote, and co-produced the British television satirical show Spitting Image for which he, Jon Blair, and John Lloyd were nominated for a British Academy Award in 1985. He was ousted from the production after the first six shows, being replaced by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. He played Ian Faith in This Is Spinal Tap. He appeared in several other films and television programs, including Miami Vice, The Cosby Mysteries, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. In 1997, Hendra and director Ron Shelton wrote The Great White Hype, a satire of racism in boxing, starring Samuel L. Jackson, Damon Wayans, Jamie Foxx, Jeff Goldblum, and Peter Berg. He co-conceived and wrote the English dubs of three of the films created by Belgian animator Picha, including The Missing Link (1980), The Big Bang (1987), and Snow White: The Sequel (2007). Family life and sexual abuse allegations Hendra has been married twice. His first marriage, to Judith Christmas in 1964, produced two daughters and ended in an acrimonious divorce in 1985. He and his second wife, Carla, live in New York City with their three children. In 2004, at the time that his memoir Father Joe was achieving best-seller status, Jessica Hendra, the younger of Hendra's two daughters from his first marriage, submitted an op-ed piece to The New York Times in which she asserted that her father failed to include in his narrative of \\"deliverance through faith and atonement for his failings\\" that he had sexually abused her as a young child. The newspaper declined to publish the piece, but did assign a reporter, N. R. Kleinfield, to investigate her charges. On 1 July 2004, The New York Times published Kleinfield's story, here, including details of the alleged acts of molestation and interviews with two of Jessica's therapists, three friends, her mother, and her husband. All said that Jessica told them at different junctures of being molested—in her mother's case, when she was 12. A former boyfriend told Kleinfield, however, that Jessica never spoke of it during their years together, and that she was \\"very unstable emotionally\\"—adding, \\"I can't believe it happened.\\" Hendra responded, \\"I can only just categorically deny this. It's not a new allegation. It's simply not true, I'm afraid.\\"\\"Daughter Says Father's Confessional Book Didn't Confess His Molestation of Her\\", nytimes.com, 1 July 2004. In the wake of criticism of the paper's decision to publish the story in the absence of tangible proof,Not Fit to Print, column in The Washington Post by Richard Cohen, 20 July 2004. New York Times ombudsman Daniel Okrent wrote a detailed examination of the procedures followed by the editorial staff prior to publication. While acknowledging that Kleinfield was convinced, based on information gathered during his reporting, that Jessica Hendra had indeed been molested, Okrent expressed concern over possible consequences should the charges prove to be false. Okrent posited: > \\"Even if the preponderant evidence indicates it's true ... doesn't the small > chance that it's false outweigh the value of giving readers access to the > private miseries of the Hendra family?

Biography Charles de Valois was the illegitimate son of Charles IX and Marie Touchet. He was born at the Château de Fayet in Dauphiné in 1573. His father, dying in the following year, commended him to the care and favour of his younger brother and successor, Henry III, who faithfully fulfilled the charge. His mother then married François de Balzac, marquis d'Entragues. One of their daughters (Charles's half-sister) named Catherine Henriette afterwards became the mistress of Henry IV. Charles de Valois was carefully educated and was destined for the Knights of Malta. At the early age of sixteen he attained one of the highest dignities of the order, being made Grand Prior of France. Shortly after he came into possession of large estates left by his paternal grandmother Catherine de' Medici, from one of which he took his title of count of Auvergne. In 1589 Henry III was assassinated, but on his deathbed he commended Charles to the good-will of his successor Henry IV. By that monarch he was made colonel of horse, and in that capacity served in the campaigns during the early part of the reign. But the connection between the king and Madame de Verneuil appears to have been very displeasing to Charles, and in 1601 he engaged in the conspiracy formed by the Dukes of Savoy, Biron and Monsieur de Turenne, one of the objects of which was to force Henry to repudiate his wife and marry the marchioness. The conspiracy was discovered; Biron and Bouillon were arrested and Biron was executed. Charles was released after a few months' imprisonment, chiefly through the influence of his half- sister, his aunt, the duchess of Angoulême and his father-in-law. He then entered into fresh intrigues with the court of Philip III of Spain, acting in concert with Madame de Verneuil and her father d'Entragues. In 1604 d'Entragues and he were arrested and condemned to death; at the same time the marchioness was condemned to perpetual imprisonment in a convent. She easily obtained pardon, and the sentence of death against the other two was commuted into perpetual imprisonment. Charles remained in the Bastille for eleven years, from 1605 to 1616. A decree of the parlement (1606), obtained by Marguerite de Valois, deprived him of nearly all his possessions, including Auvergne, though he still retained the title. In 1616 he was released, was restored to his rank of colonel-general of horse, and dispatched against one of the disaffected nobles, the duke of Longueville, who had taken Péronne. Next year he commanded the forces collected in the Île-de-France, and obtained some successes. In 1619 he received by bequest, ratified in 1620 by royal grant, the duchy of Angoulême. Soon after he was engaged on an important embassy to the Holy Roman Empire, the result of which was the treaty of Ulm, signed July 1620. In 1627 he commanded the large forces assembled at the siege of La Rochelle; and some years after in 1635, during the Thirty Years' War, he was general of the French army in Lorraine. In 1636 he was made lieutenant- general of the army. He appears to have retired from public life shortly after the death of Richelieu in 1643. The duke was the author of the following works: # ', from the assassination of Henri III. to the battle of Arques (1589–1593) published at Paris by Boneau, and reprinted by Buchon in his Choix de chroniques (1836) and by Petitot in his Mémoires (1st series, vol. xliv.) # ' (1620) # a translation of a Spanish work by Diego de Torres. To him has also been ascribed the work, La générale et fidèle Relation de tout ce qui s'est passé en l'Isle de Ré, envoyée par le Roy à la Royne sa mère (Paris, 1627). Angoulême died on 24 September 1650.  Personal life  In 1591 he obtained a dispensation from the vows of the Order of Malta, and married Charlotte, daughter of Henry, maréchal d'Amville, afterwards Duke of Montmorency and his first wife. They had had three children: * Henri * Louis-Emmanuel de Valois, Count d'Alais, who succeeded his father as duke of Angoulême and was colonel- general of light cavalry and governor of Provence; his daughter Marie Françoise de Valois married Louis, Duke of Joyeuse; * François, who died in 1622. His first wife died in 1636, and in 1644 he married Françoise de Narbonne, daughter of Charles, baron of Mareuil. She had no children and survived her husband until 1713.

It was first published in four volumes in 1570 in Venice, illustrated with woodcuts after the author's own drawings. It has been reprinted and translated many times, often in single-volume format. Book I was first published in English in 1663 in a London edition by Godfrey Richards. The first complete English language edition was published in London by the Italian-born architect Giacomo Leoni in 1715–1720.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., \\"Palladio and his Books.\\" http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html  Organization  The treatise is divided into four books: The first book discusses building materials and techniques. It documents five classical orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, Composite) in all their parts (bases, columns, architraves, arches, capitals, trabeations), as well as discussing other building elements (vaulted ceilings, floors, doors and windows, fireplaces, roofs and stairs). The second book covers the designs of private urban townhouses and country villas of the 1500s, in and around Venice, almost all designed by Palladio himself. This includes nine palazzi, 22 villas (13 of them completed, another five partly completed), and a series of unrealized projects. The plates of completed projects sometimes differ from the buildings as actually constructed. The third book addresses matters of city planning: streets, stone street paving, bridges of both stone and wood, and piazzas, with examples drawn from Roman origins alongside contemporary examples; also basilicas, including the basilica designed by Vitruvius in Fano and the important Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. The fourth book contains five chapters of general introduction, then 26 chapters, each of which describe the designs of specific Roman temples dating from antiquity, along with one contemporary church design. (The exception is the San Pietro in Montorio, designed by Donato Bramante, consecrated in the year 1500.) Palladio's selections range geographically from Rome, Naples, Spoleto, Assisi, Pola and Nîmes. Illustrations of the temples include careful measurements of existing building elements, together with Palladio's own conjectural interpretations of the temple's facades where only fragments remained, as at the Temple of Trajan. The 26 temples discussed in include: * Chap. VI. Of the Draughts of some ancient Temples that are in Rome, and first of the Temple of Peace (Temple of Peace, Rome) * Chap. VII. Of the Temple of Mars the Avenger (at the Forum of Augustus) * Chap. VIII. Of the Temple of Nerva Trajan (Temple of Trajan) * Chap. IX. Of the Temple of Antoninius and Faustina (Temple of Antoninus and Faustina) * Chap. X. Of the Temples of the Sun and Moon (Temple of Venus and Roma) * Chap. XI.

Of the Temple of Neptune (Temple of Neptune (Rome)) Author Palladio founded an architectural movement which takes its name from him, Palladian architecture. I quattro libri dell'architettura contains Palladio's own designs celebrating the purity and simplicity of classical architecture. Some of these ideas had got no further than the drawing board while others, for example villa plans, had been successfully built. The book's clarity inspired numerous patrons and other architects. Palladian architecture grew in popularity across Europe and, by the end of the 18th century, had extended as far as North America. Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, was a keen admirer of Palladio and once referred to the book as \\"the Bible\\". The Four Books was used to inform his own work as the architect of Monticello and the University of Virginia and also architect William Buckland's at the 1774 Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland. Palladio drew inspiration from surviving Roman buildings, Roman authors (especially the architect Vitruvius) and Italian Renaissance architects. However, The Four Books of Architecture provided systematic rules and plans for buildings which were creative and unique. Palladio's villa style is based on details applied to a structural system built of bricks. He offers two types of general rules in the corpus: design rules (those based on appearance) and construction rules (those based on the logic of villa construction). Here rules of the two types are identified in sets from which subsets of identifiers and rules can be written. Each of the nine rule-sets contains many sub-identities of components and procedures for physical construction. A rule-set such as “Walls”, that identifies five sub-rules based on wall thickness, only needs construction rules; there is no need for rules based on style. In contrast, rules for “Frames” are based on a geometric style of curves and shape proportions. The results will yield clear identities for a shape grammar composition that can be based on physical construction and visual style. Rule-sets These identities are taken from the first book of architecture and a survey of built villas. These are the nine rule-sets that define identity:Villa Pisani (Bagnolo) in I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura #Walls — parametric formula #Ceilings — parametric formula #Stairs — parametric formula #Columns — parametric object #Doors — parametric formula #Windows — parametric formula #Frames — parametric object #Roof — parametric formula #Details — parametric object and formula See also * Palladian villas of the Veneto * De architectura (10 books on architecture) References =Sources= * External links * I quattro libri dell'architettura, ne' quali, dopo un breue trattato de' cinque ordini, & di quelli auertimenti, che sono piu necessarii nel fabricare; si tratta delle case private, delle vie, de i ponti, delle piazze, de i xisti, et de' tempij. — downloadable pdf first edition from the Library of Congress * I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura — facsimile of the book at rarebookroom.org * \\"Complete bibliography for the 16th and 17th centuries Category:Architectural history Category:Andrea Palladio buildings Category:Architecture books ","title":"I quattro libri dell'architettura"},{"id":"1127199","text":"The National Academy of Design is an honorary association of American artists, founded in New York City in 1825 by Samuel Morse, Asher Durand, Thomas Cole, Martin E.

History National Academy of Design, one of many Gothic Revival buildings modeled on the Doge's Palace in Venice, seen . This building was demolished in 1901. The original founders of the National Academy of Design were students of the American Academy of the Fine Arts. However, by 1825 the students of the American Academy felt a lack of support for teaching from the academy, its board composed of merchants, lawyers, and physicians, and from its unsympathetic president, the painter John Trumbull. Samuel Morse and other students set about forming \\"the drawing association\\", to meet several times each week for the study of the art of design. Still, the association was viewed as a dependent organization of the American Academy, from which they felt neglected. An attempt was made to reconcile differences and maintain a single academy by appointing six of the artists from the association as directors of the American Academy. When four of the nominees were not elected, however, the frustrated artists resolved to form a new academy and the National Academy of Design was born. Morse had been a student at the Royal Academy in London and emulated its structure and goals for the National Academy of Design. The mission of the academy, from its foundation, was to \\"promote the fine arts in America through exhibition and education.\\"Historical Overview, National Academy of Design.

Together with Cayo Botella off the northwestern point, and Pelá and Pelaita to the west, it belongs to the barrio Fraile of Culebra. It is a nature reserve and is part of the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge. The island is home to Culebrita Lighthouse, one of the oldest lighthouses in the Caribbean. Culebrita is only accessible by private boat from the main island of Culebra. Geography Map of Culebra highlighting Fraile barrio which includes Culebrita Culebrita is a coral island approximately 1 mile in length and a tourist spot. It is roughly y-shaped with three branches extending from the island's center. There are six beaches on Culebrita, the chief one being Playa Tortuga (Turtle Beach) on the north side of the island. The beach is named for the many sea turtles that use the beach for breeding grounds and the surrounding waters for grazing. Sea turtles Tina and Ike call Playa Tortuga home. The other two large beaches are Trash Beach and West Beach. Because Trash Beach is located on the windward side of the island, debris is often blown onto this beach. This is how the beach gets its name. West Beach is where the water taxis from Culebra Island dock. Chart of Culebrita, with Cayo Botella to the northwest There are also large tidal pools on the east side of the island where people lounge as if they were large baths. The pools trap small sea life at low tide. The west side of the island contains two lagoons. The Culebrita Reef lays off the southern coast of the island. Wetlands Isla Culebrita has two shallow lagoons, the largest of which, Laguna de Molino (Mill Lagoon), is located in northwest branch of the island. It covers approximately and is about below sea level. The second lagoon, referred to as the eastern tidal flat, is located near the middle of the island's west coast and covers about . Both lagoons are bordered on the seaward-side by a small mangrove fringe. These wetlands are an important habitat for some of the local wildlife. Flora and fauna In 2006, an environmental and cultural resource survey of Culebrita was carried out by Southeastern Archaeological Research (SEARCH) of Jonesville, Florida and Ellis Environmental Group, LC, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Huntsville in order to identify “cultural resources, sensitive habitats, and endangered plants and animals that may exist” on Isla Culebrita. During the survey, a total of 97 plant species were recorded, none of which are state or federally threatened or endangered species. In addition, 32 birds, 4 reptiles, and 2 mammikhhjre recorded. Of these animals, one federally endangered species, the brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) and one threatened species, the white-cheeked pintail (Anas bahamensis) were observed. Endangered green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) were also observed on the island. The endangered Culebra skink makes its home in Culebrita.

The Intelligent Flight Control System (IFCS) is a next-generation flight control system designed to provide increased safety for the crew and passengers of aircraft as well as to optimize the aircraft performance under normal conditions. The main benefit of this system is that it will allow a pilot to control an aircraft even under failure conditions that would normally cause it to crash. The IFCS is being developed under the direction of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center with the collaboration of the NASA Ames Research Center, Boeing Phantom Works, the Institute for Scientific Research at West Virginia University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Objectives of IFCS  The main purpose of the IFCS project is to create a system for use in civilian and military aircraft that is both adaptive and fault tolerant. This is accomplished through the use of upgrades to the flight control software that incorporate self-learning neural network technology. The goals of the IFCS neural network project are. # To develop a flight control system that can identify aircraft characteristics through the use of neural network technology in order to optimize aircraft performance. # To develop a neural network that can train itself to analyze the flight properties of the aircraft. # To be able to demonstrate the aforementioned properties on a modified F-15 ACTIVE aircraft during flight, which is the testbed for the IFCS project.  Theory of operation  The neural network of the IFCS learns flight characteristics in real time through the aircraft’s sensors and from error corrections from the primary flight computer, and then uses this information to create different flight characteristic models for the aircraft. The neural network only learns when the aircraft is in a stable flight condition, and will discard any characteristics that would cause the aircraft to go into a failure condition. If the aircraft's condition changes from stable to failure, for example, if one of the control surfaces becomes damaged and unresponsive, the IFCS can detect this fault and switch the flight characteristic model for the aircraft. The neural network then works to drive the error between the reference model and the actual aircraft state to zero.  Project history  = Generation 1 = Generation 1 IFCS flight tests were conducted in 2003 to test the outputs of the neural network. In this phase, the neural network was pre-trained using flight characteristics obtained for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 STOL/MTD in a wind tunnel test and did not actually provide any control adjustments in flight. The outputs of the neural network were run directly to instrumentation for data collection purposes only. = Generation 2 = Generation 2 IFCS tests were conducted in 2005 and used a fully integrated neural network as described in the theory of operation. It is a direct adaptive system that continuously provides error corrections and then measures the effects of these corrections in order to learn new flight models or adjust existing ones. To measure the aircraft state, the neural network takes 31 inputs from the roll, pitch, and yaw axes and the control surfaces. If there is a difference between the aircraft state and model, the neural network adjusts the outputs of the primary flight computer through a dynamic inversion controller to bring the difference to zero before they are sent to the actuator control electronics which move the control surfaces.  See also  A different research and development project with the goal of designing an intelligent flight control system is being carried out at University College London. Their prototype is known as the Intelligent Autopilot System which has Artificial Neural Networks capable of learning from human teachers by imitation. The system is capable of handling severe weather conditions and flight emergencies such as engine failure or fire, emergency landing, and performing Rejected Take Off (RTO) in a flight simulator. * Aircraft flight control system * F-15 * McDonnell Douglas F-15 STOL/MTD  References  # # # # Category:Aircraft instruments Category:Applications of control engineering ","title":"Intelligent flight control system"},{"id":"1127222","text":"Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji in 1945 Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji (born Leon Dudley Sorabji; 14 August 1892 – 15 October 1988) was an English composer, music critic, pianist and writer. He is one of the most prolific 20th-century composers, and is best known for his nocturnes and large-scale piano compositions, which include seven symphonies for piano solo, four toccatas, Sequentia cyclica, 100 Transcendental Studies, Opus clavicembalisticum, his last two piano sonatas and Gulistān. Sorabji expressed a sense of otherness early in his life. As a homosexual of mixed ancestry and feeling alienated from English society, he was educated privately and had a lifelong tendency to seclusion. His mother was English and his father a Parsi businessman and industrialist from India, who set up a modest trust fund that freed him from the need to work. Although Sorabji was a reluctant performer and not a virtuoso, he played his works in public between 1920 and 1936. In the late 1930s, his attitude shifted and he imposed restrictions on performance of his music (also known as a \\"ban\\"), which he lifted in 1976. His compositions received little exposure in those years and he remained in public view mainly through his writings and music criticism, at the centre of which are his books Around Music and Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician. During this time, he also left London and eventually settled in the village of Corfe Castle, Dorset. Information on Sorabji's life, especially his later years, is scarce, with most of it coming from the letters he exchanged with his friends. Sorabji was a largely self-taught composer. Although he was attracted to modernist aesthetics at first, he later dismissed much of the established and contemporary repertoire. He drew on diverse influences like Ferruccio Busoni, Claude Debussy and Karol Szymanowski and developed a highly individual style characterised by frequent polyrhythms, interplay of tonal and atonal elements and lavish ornamentation. His larger works also tend to combine contrasting forms (primarily baroque and athematic). His output of over 100 compositions spanned eight decades and ranges from sets of miniatures to works lasting several hours. Although he primarily composed for the piano, he also wrote orchestral, chamber and organ pieces. Sorabji has been likened to many of the composer-pianists he admired, including Franz Liszt and Charles-Valentin Alkan. Features of his music, not least its harmonic language and complex rhythms, anticipated trends in compositions from the mid-20th century onwards.  Biography  = Early years = Shapurji Sorabji, the composer's father Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was born Leon Dudley Sorabji in Chingford, Essex (now Greater London), on 14 August 1892.Roberge, Marc-André (3 July 2020). \\"Biographical Notes\\".

Like many of his near ancestors, he was an industrialist and businessman.Owen, pp. 40–41 Sorabji's mother, Madeline Matilda Worthy (13 August 1866 – 5 May 1959), was English.Owen, pp. 33–34 She is said to have been a singer, pianist and organist, but little evidence has been found to support these claims.Hinton, Alistair (2005). \\"Sorabji's Songs (1/4)\\".

He reportedly started to learn the piano from his mother when he was eight,Rapoport, p. 18 and he later received help from Emily Edroff-Smith, an English musician and piano teacher who was a friend of his mother's.Rapoport, p. 33Roberge (2020), p. 205 Sorabji attended a school of about twenty boys where, in addition to general education, he took music lessons in piano, organ and harmony, as well as language classes for German and Italian.Roberge (2020), p. 49 From the early 1910s until 1916, he studied music with pianist and composer Charles A. Trew (1854–1929).Roberge (2020), p. 53 He was also educated by his mother, who took him to concerts.Roberge (2020), p. 308 The first significant insight into Sorabji's life came from his correspondence with composer and critic Peter Warlock (also known as Philip Heseltine), which began in 1913. Warlock inspired Sorabji to become a music critic and focus on composition, and his letters convinced him to avoid a university setting. Sorabji, who had obtained a matriculation and had contemplated going to the University of London, decided to study music privately.Owen, p. 21Roberge (2020), pp. 50–51 He was initially vocal and active in promoting his music, and showed great interest in interacting with musicians.Abrahams, pp. 144–145 In late 1919, Warlock sent music critic Ernest Newman several of Sorabji's scores, including his First Piano Sonata. Newman ignored them, and in November that year, Sorabji privately met composer Ferruccio Busoni and played the piece for him. Busoni expressed reservations about the work but gave him a letter of recommendation, which helped Sorabji get it published.Rapoport, pp. 252–254 Warlock wrote in his own journal, The Sackbut, and accused Newman of systematic avoidance and sabotage. Sorabji joined the controversy later and claimed Newman had refused to look at his works, to which the critic responded by describing the circumstances that prevented him from reviewing the scores and meeting Sorabji in person. Warlock went on to make public accusations of abuse and stubbornness on Newman's part, and the issue was settled after another journal, Musical Opinion, reproduced correspondence between Newman and Sorabji.Roberge (2020), pp. 86–87 Madeline Matilda Worthy, Sorabji's mother Sorabji has been called a late starter as he had not composed music before the age of 22. Already before picking up the craft of composition, he had been drawn to recent developments in art music—in the work of Arnold Schoenberg, Alexander Scriabin, Gustav Mahler and Claude Debussy, among others—at a time when they did not receive much attention in England. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider.Owen, pp. 279–280 Early editions of his compositions were published with his father's financial aid. Their modernist style, increasingly longer durations and technical complexity baffled critics and audiences.Roberge, Marc-André (29 June 2020). \\"Dimensions and Colours of the Published Editions\\". Sorabji Resource Site. Retrieved 14 July 2020.Owen, pp. 21–24 Although his music had its detractors, some musicians received it positively:Abrahams, p. 15 when Sorabji played his own piece Le jardin parfumé—Poem for Piano Solo over a 1930 radio broadcast, English composer Frederick Delius sent him a letter admiring the piece's \\"real sensuous beauty\\";Rapoport, pp. 280, 360 in the 1920s, French pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos;Grew, p. 85 and Austrian composer Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in his work.Rapoport, p. 240 Sorabji first played his music publicly in 1920 and he performed his works in Europe over the next decade.Roberge (2020), p. 60 In the mid-1920s, he befriended Scottish composer Erik Chisholm, which led to the most fruitful period of his pianistic career. They first met in April 1930 in Glasgow and Sorabji joined Chisholm's Active Society for the Propagation of Contemporary Music soon after its creation later that year.Roberge (2020), p. 168 The Society's concerts featured a number of distinguished composers and musicians, including Paul Hindemith, Nikolai Medtner, Alfredo Casella and Béla Bartók.

Retrieved 22 November 2012.Roberge (2020), pp. 205–206 = Ban and seclusion = On 10 March 1936 in London, pianist John Tobin played a portion of Opus clavicembalisticum. The performance lasted 90 minutes—twice as long as it should have. Sorabji left before it finished and denied having attended, paid for, or supported the performance.Roberge (2020), p. 229 A number of leading critics and composers attended the concert and wrote negative critiques in the press, which severely damaged Sorabji's reputation.Roberge (2020), pp. 229, 233 Sorabji said he was no longer interested in having his works performed before he made his last public appearance on 16 December 1936 in Glasgow to premier his Toccata seconda. He withdrew from the concert platform for the rest of his life, and over the next decade, made remarks expressing his opposition to the spread of his music.Roberge (2020), p. 232 A view of the village of Corfe Castle, Dorset, where Sorabji settled in the 1950s and led a largely secluded life Although the restrictions Sorabji placed on performances of his works were known as a \\"ban\\", there was no official or enforceable pronouncement to this effect; rather, he discouraged others from playing his music publicly. This was not without precedent and even his first printed scores bore a note reserving the right of performance.Roberge (2020), pp. 230–231 Few concerts with his music—most of them semi-private or given by his friends and with his approval—took place in those years, and he turned down offers to play his works in public.Roberge (2020), pp. 232–233, 378–379 His withdrawal from the world of music has usually been ascribed to Tobin's recital,Owen, p. 25 but other reasons have been put forward for his decision: the deaths of people he admired (such as Busoni and Bernard van Dieren), the silence of Jean Sibelius, the changes in Karol Szymanowski's style and the increasing prominence of Igor Stravinsky and twelve-tone music.Abrahams, pp. 147–156 Furthermore, the fall of the pound and rupee in 1931 affected Sorabji's father, who stopped supporting the publication of his scores that same year; plans to publish other pieces by Sorabji were cancelled.Roberge (2020), p. 111 In spite of all this, the 1930s marked an especially fertile period in Sorabji's career, one in which he created many of his largest works.Roberge (2020), pp. 2, 240 His activity as music critic also peaked, and in 1938, Oxford University Press became the agent for his published works until his death in 1988.Roberge (2020), pp. 5–6, 190 Sorabji was not drafted during either World War I or World War II and surviving documents do not explain why. After the First World War, he praised conscientious objectors for their courage, but there is no proof he tried to register as one. It remains unclear how he avoided military duties during World War II: his open letters and music criticism did not cease, and he never touched the topic of war in his writings.Roberge (2020), pp. 54–55 For much of the Second World War, Sorabji focused on his set of 100 Transcendental Studies (1940–44), many of which were written during German bombings. He remained writing during the night and early morning in his home at Clarence Gate Gardens even as most other blocks were abandoned. Wartime records show that a high explosive bomb hit Siddons Lane, where the back entrance to his former place of residence is located.Roberge (2020), pp. 280–281 Sorabji left London in 1950 and settled in The Eye (named after the Eye of Horus, which was engraved on a metal plate near the entrance),Roberge (2020), p. 294 a house that he had built for himself in the village of Corfe Castle, Dorset, in 1956.Rapoport, p. 223 It has been described as a parallel to his distancing from the world of music.Owen, p. 26 He had been on holidays in Corfe Castle since 1928 and the place had appealed to him for many years.Roberge (2020), p. 291 In 1946, he expressed the desire to be there permanently, and once settled in the village, he rarely ventured outside.Roberge (2020), pp. 273, 292 Living expenses were also a factor in his decision to leave London. = Admirers and inner withdrawal = Despite his isolation and his withdrawal from the concert platform and the world of music, Sorabji retained a circle of close admirers. Over the years, concerns over the fate of his legacy intensified as Sorabji did not record any of his works and none of them had been published since 1931. The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday (1912–1997), an English trainer and teacher who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades.Rapoport, pp. 317–318 From 1951 to 1953, Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music.Roberge (2020), p. 252 Sorabji received the letter, signed by 23 admirers, soon after, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas, equivalent to just over £127 at the time (and £ today).Roberge (2020), p. 253 Sorabji was concerned by the impact copyright laws would have on the spread of his music,Roberge (2020), p. 231 but Holliday eventually persuaded him after years of opposition, objections and stalling. Several recordings (amounting to a little over 11 hours of music) were made in Sorabji's home between 1962 and 1968.Roberge (2020), pp. 253–254 Although Sorabji made requests to limit circulation of the tapes and Holliday attempted to comply, leaks occurred and some of the recordings were included in a 55-minute WBAI programme broadcast in December 1969 and an expanded three-hour version produced by WNCN in 1970. The latter programme, which was rebroadcast several times in the 1970s, drew attention from the United States which helped in the dissemination and understanding of Sorabji's music.Roberge (2020), p. 255 Sorabji and Holliday's friendship ended in 1979 due to a perceived rift between them and disagreements over custodianship of Sorabji's legacy.Roberge (2020), pp. 256–257 However, Holliday preserved his collection of Sorabji's letters and other related items, which is one of the largest and most important sources of material on the composer. He took many notes during his visits to Sorabji and often accepted everything he told him at face value.Roberge (2020), pp. 47, 252 His collection of \\"Sorabjiana\\" was purchased by McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) in 1988.Roberge (2020), p. 258 Another devoted admirer was Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji after reading his book Around Music. Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions in response to post-war shortages in England, and he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s, Gentieu offered to pay for the expenses to microfilm Sorabji's major piano works and provide copies to selected libraries. Gentieu sent him a tape recorder, but issues with operating the machine and Sorabji's reluctance prevented recordings from being made.Roberge (2020), p. 304Rapoport, pp. 311–312 In 1952, Gentieu set up a mock society (the Society of Connoisseurs) to mask the financial investment on his part, but Sorabji suspected that it was a hoax. Microfilming (which encompassed all of Sorabji's unpublished musical manuscripts) began in January 1953 and continued until 1967 as new works were produced.Roberge (2020), p. 303 Copies of the microfilms became available in several libraries and universities in the United States and South Africa. Sorabji grew increasingly tired of composition over the years: health problems, stress and fatigue interfered and he began to loathe writing music. After the Messa grande sinfonica (1955–61)—which comprises 1,001 pages of orchestral score—was completed, Sorabji wrote he had no desire to continue composing, and in August 1962, he suggested he may abandon composition and destroy his extant manuscripts. Extreme anxiety and exhaustion due to personal, family and other issues, including the private recordings and preparing for them, had drained him and he took a break from composition. He eventually returned to it, but worked at a slower pace than before and produced mostly short works. He stopped composing in 1968 and mentioned in his letters that he would not write any more music. Documentation of how he spent the next few years is unavailable and his production of open letters declined.Roberge (2020), pp. 339–340 = Renewed visibility = In November 1969, Scottish composer Alistair Hinton (born 1950), then a student at the Royal College of Music in London, discovered Sorabji's music in the Westminster Music Library and wrote a letter to him in March 1972.Rapoport, pp. 19, 22–23 They met for the first time in Sorabji's home on 21 August 1972 and quickly became good friends;Rapoport, p. 30 Sorabji began to turn to Hinton for advice on legal and other matters.Roberge (2020), p. 256 In 1978, Hinton and musicologist Paul Rapoport microfilmed Sorabji's manuscripts that did not have copies made, and in 1979 Sorabji wrote a new will that bequeathed Hinton (now his literary and musical executor) all the manuscripts in his possession.Roberge (2020), pp. 257, 368 Sorabji, who had not written any music since 1968, returned to composition in 1973 due to Hinton's interest in his work.Rapoport, p. 37 Hinton also persuaded Sorabji to give Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public, which was granted on 24 March 1976 and marked the end of the \\"ban\\", although another pianist, Michael Habermann, may have received tentative approval at an earlier date.Roberge (2020), p. 369Rapoport, pp. 39, 41 Several recitals with Sorabji's music took place and a television documentary on him broadcast in 1977 was filmed. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; Sorabji did not wish to be seen and there was just one brief shot of him waving to the departing camera crew.Rapoport, p. 41Roberge (2020), p. 382 In 1979, Sorabji appeared in two broadcasts: one on BBC Scotland for the 100th birthday of composer Francis George Scott, and one on BBC Radio 3 to commemorate Medtner's centenary. Although the former lacked footage of Sorabji, it was where he first met Ronald Stevenson, whom he had known and admired for more than 20 years.Roberge (2020), p. 401 After they met, Sorabji wrote Villa Tasca (1979–80), a piano piece dedicated to Stevenson. As he worked on it, Sorabji received a commission from Gentieu, who acted on behalf of the Philadelphia branch of the Delius Society, and fulfilled it by writing Il tessuto d'arabeschi (1979) for flute and string quartet. He dedicated it \\"To the memory of Delius\\" and was paid £1,000 (equivalent to £ in present-day terms).Roberge (2020), p. 391 = Last years = Sorabji's tombstone in \\"God's Acre\\", the Corfe Castle cemetery Towards the end of his life, Sorabji stopped composing due to his failing eyesight and struggle to physically write.Owen, p. 295 His health deteriorated severely in 1986, which obliged him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital; in the October of that year he put Hinton in charge of his personal affairs. In March 1987, he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh (near Dorchester, Dorset), where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care.Roberge (2020), p. 72 In June 1988, he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure and arteriosclerotic heart disease on 15 October 1988 a little after 7 pm at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October, and the funeral service took place in Corfe Castle in the Church of St. Edward, King and Martyr, on the same day.Roberge (2020), p. 408 The Sorabji Archive (originally called The Sorabji Music Archive) was founded in 1988 by Hinton (the sole heir to Sorabji's oeuvre) to disseminate knowledge of Sorabji's legacy.Roberge, Marc-André (29 June 2020). \\"Milestones in the Discovery of Sorabji's Music\\".

Personal life  = Mystique and fabrications = During Sorabji's lifetime, and especially since his death, there have been many myths and legends around his life and works. Scholars have focused on various areas to dispel them:Roberge (2020), pp. xxv–xxvi his compositional method and the nature of his music,Roberge (2020), p. xxii his skills as a performer, the dimensions and purported unplayability of his pieces and the existence of a \\"ban\\" on performances of his work.Owen, p. 16Roberge (2020), p. 230 It has proven to be a challenging task: while nearly all of Sorabji's known works have been preserved and there are almost no lost manuscripts,Roberge, Marc-André (2 July 2020). \\"Manuscripts with Peculiarities\\". Sorabji Resource Site. Retrieved 13 July 2020. few documents and items relating to his life have survived. His correspondence with his friends is the main source of information on this area, though much of it is also missing. Sorabji often discarded large volumes of his letters and books without inspecting their content. Marc-André Roberge, the author of Sorabji's first biography, Opus sorabjianum, writes that \\"there are years for which hardly anything can be reported\\".Roberge (2020), p. xxv One debunked claim about Sorabji is that his mother was Spanish-Sicilian, and by extension, he himself was not English. Research carried out by Sean Vaughn Owen in the early 2000s revealed she had been born to English parents christened in an Anglican church, which refutes the claim that she had been adopted or had recent Spanish-Sicilian ancestry.Owen, pp. 34–35 He further established that his mother repeatedly used aliases and gave false birth dates (even on legal documents),Owen, pp. 311–312 and suggested she passed this habit onto Sorabji, who \\"developed throughout his life a complex sense of otherness\\" and \\"represented himself to others in a manner that was not in keeping with reality\\".Owen, p. 3 Sorabji did not deny his mother's Englishness in his youth, but later insisted she was of Spanish-Sicilian descent and he objected to being called English.Roberge (2020), p. 39 He also claimed his mother had been a singer, though there is little evidence she had a stage career.Roberge (2020), p. xxxiii There were other myths, some of which were peddled by Sorabji himself. He claimed to have had relatives in the upper echelons of the Catholic Church and wore a ring that he said had belonged to a Sicilian cardinal and was allegedly supposed to go to the Pope upon his death.Roberge (2020), p. 44Owen, p. 102 The villagers in Corfe Castle sometimes referred to him as \\"Sir Abji\\" and \\"Indian Prince\\".Owen, p. 315 Sorabji would often mislead others, especially lexicographers, by giving them incorrect biographical information on himself.Roberge (2020), pp. 70–72 One of them, Nicolas Slonimsky, who in 1978 erroneously wrote that Sorabji owned a castle,Roberge (2020), p. xxi once called him \\"the most enigmatic composer now living\\".Slonimsky, p. 152 Sorabji's deception regarding his age may be why he was not drafted during World War I, though his precarious health has also been suggested as an explanation. It remains unclear why Sorabji insisted on a Spanish-Sicilian ancestry and other fabrications. Owen says he may have shielded himself from being viewed as a mixed-race Englishman and chose to portray himself as a foreigner instead.Owen, p. 311 His interviews with people from Corfe Castle and neighbouring areas show that Sorabji's personality exhibits many contradictions, which he terms \\"posturing of otherness\\". Owen concludes that despite Sorabji's elitist and misanthropic image, his acquaintances found him serious and stern but generous, cordial and hospitable.Owen, pp. 314–317 He summarises the tensions displayed in Sorabji's reputation, writings, persona and behaviour thus: > The contradictions between his reputation and the actuality of his existence > were known to Sorabji and they appear to have given him much amusement. This > sense of humour was detected by many in the village, yet they too were prone > to believe his stories. The papal connection of course was a particular > favourite and as much as Sorabji detested being spotlighted in a large > group, he was perfectly content in more intimate situations bringing direct > attention to his ring or his thorny attitude regarding the ban on his > music.Owen, p. 317 = Sexuality and otherness = Sorabji as a young man Sorabji's otherness was two-fold: he was homosexual and of mixed race. In his youth, he was apparently mistreated by other boys in the school he attended and his tutor, who sought to make an English gentleman out of him, would make derogatory comments about India and hit him on the head with a large book, which gave him recurring headaches. These experiences have been identified as the root of Sorabji's dislike of England, which he expressed in his writings and elsewhere. He described English people as mean to foreigners, and he saw them as intentionally and systematically mistreating them.Roberge (2020), p. 277 He recalled how in 1914 a \\"howling mob\\" with brickbats and large stones pursued him and \\"half killed\\" him, and he may have been blackmailed over his homosexuality.Rapoport, p. 70 Sorabji felt despised and misunderstood by the English music establishment, and he made remarks opposing the dissemination of his works in England.Roberge (2020), pp. 69–70, 231–232 London in particular received his ire: he called it the \\"International Human Rubbish dump\\"Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji.

Letter to Frank Holliday, 1 December 1954, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 291 In the 1950s, he conceded he had been unduly harsh in his assessments of the English and acknowledged that many of his close friends were or had been Englishmen.Roberge (2020), p. 280 Sorabji detested being called English. He identified with his Parsi and alleged Spanish-Sicilian ancestry instead, attributing his explosive temperament to the latter.Roberge (2020), pp. 69–70, 232, 276 During the First World War, he and his mother planned to move to France or Italy, which never happened. With the exception of two trips to India, he never left Europe.Roberge (2020), pp. 82, 273 He visited Italy at least eight times, occasionally for extended periods.Roberge (2020), pp. 275–276 French culture and art also appealed to him, and he set French texts to music.Roberge (2020), p. 274 Around 60% of his known works have titles in Latin, Italian and other foreign languages.Roberge, Marc-André (2 July 2020). \\"Titles of Works Grouped by Language\\". Sorabji Resource Site. Retrieved 13 July 2020. In 1919, Sorabji experienced a \\"sexual awakening\\", which led him to join the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology and the English branch of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft.Roberge (2020), p. 149 In the early 1920s, at a time of considerable emotional distress, he consulted Havelock Ellis, a British psychologist and writer on sexual psychology, on the matter of his orientation. Ellis held progressive views on the subject and Sorabji regarded him highly; he inscribed a dedication \\"To Dr. Havelock Ellis.—in respectful admiration, homage and gratitude\\" in his Piano Concerto No. 7, Simorg-Anka (1924).Owen, pp. 46–48Roberge (2020), pp. 138–139 He went on to reference Ellis in many of his articles on the topic, often building on the concept of sexual inversion.Owen, pp. 47–48 Havelock Ellis, whose thoughts on homosexuality shaped Sorabji's own Although Sorabji's homosexual tendencies were first exhibited in his letters to Warlock in 1914,Roberge (2020), p. 59 they manifested most strongly in his correspondence with Chisholm. Sorabji sent him a number of exceptionally long letters that captured a desire for intimacy and to be with him alone, and have been interpreted as expressing Sorabji's love for him.Roberge (2020), pp. 170–171 Chisholm apparently rebuffed him, possibly sometime around his marriage in 1932; Sorabji's letters afterwards became less sentimental and more infrequent.Roberge (2020), pp. 152, 172 Sorabji spent approximately the last 35 years of his life with Reginald Norman Best (25 September 1909 – 29 February 1988), the son of his mother's friend. Best spent his life savings to help Sorabji buy The Eye and shared the costs of living with him.Roberge (2020), p. 295 He was homosexual, and although Sorabji often described him to the villagers as his godson, many suspected there was more to their relationship and those close to them believed they were partners.Owen, pp. 46–47 Sorabji once called him \\"one of the two people on earth most precious to me\\".Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji. Letter to Kenneth Derus, 30 December 1977, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 295 Best was reserved and considered a recluse even when compared to Sorabji;Owen, p. 49 he suffered from depression and multiple congenital deficiencies. Around 1970, he began taking electroconvulsive therapy; the treatment caused Best considerable anxiety and Sorabji was upset by the effect it had on him, and it has been suggested that this exacerbated their reclusiveness.Owen, p. 51 In March 1987, they moved into Marley House Nursing Home, where Sorabji called him \\"darling\\" and complimented him on his looks before Best died on 29 February 1988. Sorabji suffered a mild stroke in June and died later that year; their ashes are buried beside each other.Roberge (2020), pp. 298, 409 Sorabji's vocal music includes texts by homosexual artists such as Michelangelo and Paul Verlaine.Roberge (2020), p. 152 He also wrote Gianandrea and Stephen, a short homoerotic story set in Palermo. Roberge says that in this text, which purports to be biographical, Sorabji \\"let his imagination run at its wildest\\".Roberge (2020), p. 45 Sorabji probably had sexual encounters with men while he lived in London, and in 1977, he wrote, \\"deep affection and indeed love between men is the greatest thing in life, at any rate it is in my life\\".Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji. Letter to Kenneth Derus, 30 December 1977, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 152Roberge (2020), pp. 152–153 Roberge also writes, \\"the loneliness that he must have often felt surely accounts for his desire to create for himself an ideal world in which he could believe—and have his friends believe\\".Roberge (2020), p. 47 = Social life = Many of Sorabji's friends were not musicians and he said that their human qualities meant more to him than their musical erudition.Roberge (2020), pp. 251, 322, 368 He sought warmth in others and said he depended emotionally on his friends' affection. He could be extremely devoted to them, though he admitted to preferring solitude.Roberge (2020), p. 322 Some of his friendships, like those with Norman Peterkin or Hinton, lasted until the death of either party; others were broken, such as the one with Holliday.Roberge (2020), p. 251 Sorabji appears to have been more approachable when he moved to Corfe Castle and his reclusiveness strengthened with age.Owen, p. 103 He cherished his privacy (going as far as to describe himself as a \\"claustrophiliac\\"Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji. Letter to Robert (Wilfred Levick) Simpson, 29 June 1948, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 296) and has often been called a misanthrope. He planted more than 250 trees around his house, which had a number of notices to deter uninvited visitors. Sorabji did not like the company of two or more friends simultaneously and would accept only one at a time, each about once or twice per year.Roberge (2020), pp. 296, 323 In an unpublished text titled The Fruits of Misanthropy, he justified his reclusiveness by saying, \\"my own failings are so great that they are as much as I can put up with in comfort—those of other people superadded I find a burden quite intolerable\\".Sorabji (1930), pp. 42–43, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 270 = Family and finances = Kaikhosru Sorabji was always close to his mother, which may account for the fact that he was educated privately and did not go to university. She accompanied him on his travels and he spent nearly two-thirds of his life with her until he began living with Best in the 1950s.Roberge (2020), pp. 274, 308 Sorabji also looked after his mother in her last years when they were no longer together.Roberge (2020), pp. 294–295, 308–309 Despite the emotional attachment he had to her, their close bond has been partly attributed to being abandoned by his father and the impact this had on their financial security. There is little evidence that his father, Shapurji Sorabji, lived with his family.Roberge (2020), p. 37 Although he was musically cultured and financed the publication of several of Sorabji's compositions (enabling 14 of them to be published between 1921 and 1931), he did not want his son to become a musician. After the marriage, he returned to Bombay, where he played a significant role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries. In October 1914, he set up the Shapurji Sorabji Trust, a modest trust fund that would provide his family with a life income that would free them of the need to work.Roberge (2020), p. 203 Shapurji died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 7 July 1932. Kaikhosru left London soon after and travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate before returning on 9 February 1933. His mother accompanied him on the second trip to India, which occurred 29 May 1933 – 23 January 1934.Roberge (2020), p. 198 Roberge believes that the bond between Kaikhosru and his mother was strengthened after they learned that Shapurji had been living with another woman since around 1909 and had married her in 1929.Roberge (2020), pp. 201–202 Kaikhosru and his mother were excluded from his will and received a fraction of what his second wife and adopted son did.Roberge (2020), p. 201 After a long process that began in 1936, the bigamous marriage was declared null and void in 1949, but the financial assets could not be retrieved.Roberge (2020), p. 202Owen, p. 43 Sorabji earned no money as a critic, and at times had to sell his possessions to get out of financial difficulties.Roberge (2020), pp. 203–204 His lifestyle was modest, though he was fond of some alcoholic beverages, including sweet wines and chocolate liqueurs.Roberge (2020), pp. 204, 337 He sometimes helped his friends financially, and in his later years, when he was dependent on others to take care of him and help him with daily chores, he would thank them with gifts.Roberge (2020), pp. 203, 296 Near the end of his life, the Shapurji Sorabji Trust had been exhaustedOwen, p. 57 and his house, along with his belongings (including some 3,000 books), was put up for auction in November 1986 to pay for the nursing home he was to stay in.Roberge (2020), pp. 204, 246 As performances of his music became more common starting in the mid-1970s, Sorabji joined the Performing Right Society and received a small income from the royalties they generated. On 19 September 1988, less than a month before his death, he registered for the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society and became the oldest composer to have ever applied to the list.Roberge (2020), pp. 381–382 = Health and religious views = Sorabji suffered from frail health throughout his life: he broke his leg as a child; experienced recurring attacks of malaria, which is attributed to his two trips to India; was diagnosed with sciatica in 1976, which hampered his ability to walk and sometimes left him housebound. He was crippled with arthritis near the end of his life.Roberge (2020), pp. 297, 338 He preferred his physiotherapist over doctors and had an interest in alternative medicine and spiritual healing.Roberge (2020), pp. 338–339 He experimented with herbal remedies and over-the-counter products, and practised weekly one-day fasts and yearly one-week fasts for many years.Roberge (2020), pp. 337, 339 Sorabji's attraction to these things was linked to his interest in the occult, numerology and related topics; Rapoport suggested that Sorabji chose to hide his year of birth for fear that it could be used against him.Roberge (2020), pp. 70, 338 Early in his life, Sorabji published articles on the paranormal and he included occult inscriptions and references in his works.Roberge (2020), pp. 117–119 In 1922, Sorabji met occultist Aleister Crowley, whom he found disappointing; he dismissed Crowley as a \\"fraud\\" and \\"the dullest of dull dogs\\".Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji.

Letter to Peter Warlock, 19 June 1922, reproduced in Rapoport, p. 245Roberge (2020), p. 118 His interest in extra-sensory perception led him to join the Society for Psychical Research in the early 1930s.Roberge (2020), p. 119 His occult interests also led to a 20-year friendship with Bernard Bromage (1899–1957), an English writer on mysticism and a member of the secret order Fraternity of Inner Light.Roberge (2020), p. 221 He acted as joint trustee of the Shapurji Sorabji Trust between 1933 and 1941 and produced a highly defective index for Sorabji's book Around Music, which the composer was displeased with.Roberge (2020), p. 223 Bromage also apparently behaved incorrectly as trustee, causing Sorabji considerable monetary losses, which led to his removal from the Trust and the end of their friendship around 1942.Roberge (2020), p. 222 Occult themes rarely appeared in Sorabji's music and writings afterwards.Roberge (2020), pp. 118–119 Sometime in 1913 or 1914, Sorabji joined the Parsi community and changed his name.Roberge (2020), p. 67 He spoke favourably of the Parsis, though his experiences with them in India upset him. He embraced only a few aspects of Zoroastrianism before cutting his ties to various Parsi and Zoroastrian organisations over objections to their actions. However, he was still interested in his Persian heritage, and insisted that his body should be cremated after his death (which is an alternative to using the Tower of Silence).Roberge (2020), pp. 68–69, 408 Sorabji's attitude towards Christianity was mixed. In his early life, he denounced it for fueling war and deemed it a hypocritical religion,Roberge (2020), pp. 54, 330 though he later voiced his admiration for the Catholic Church and attributed the most valuable parts of European civilisation to it. His interest in the Catholic Mass inspired his largest score, the Messa grande sinfonica.Roberge (2020), p. 276 Although he professed that he was not Catholic, he may have embraced some of the faith in private.Roberge (2020), p. 331 In the 1930s, Sorabji began practising yoga—the only form of exercise he engaged in.Roberge (2020), p. 338 He credited it with infusing his life with greater order and balance, enabling him to command inspiration and helping him achieve focus and self-discipline. The practice inspired him to write an essay titled \\"Yoga and the Composer\\" and compose the Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone (1938–39), which has seven movements titled after bodily centres in tantric and shaktic yoga.Roberge (2020), p. 120  Music  = Early works = Although there has been speculation about earlier works, Sorabji's first known (albeit lost) composition is a 1914 transcription of Delius's orchestral piece In a Summer Garden.Abrahams, pp. 35–36Owen, p. 278Rapoport, pp. 109, 214 His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos.Abrahams, p. 160 Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant.Abrahams, p. 227 They are characterised mainly by their use of the single-movement format and by their athematism.Abrahams, pp. 162, 176 The main criticism against them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form.Abrahams, pp. 176, 207Rapoport, p. 355 Sorabji developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, described them as derivative and lacking in cohesion,Abrahams, pp. 227–228 and even considered destroying many of their manuscripts late in his life.Abrahams, p. 35 = Mature works and symphonic style = movement of Sorabji's Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone. The numbering of themes follows the manuscript. Various people have stated that Sorabji achieved compositional maturity with Three Pastiches for Piano (1922) and Le jardin parfumé (1923),Powell (2003a), p. [3] but he regarded Organ Symphony No. 1 (1924) as his first mature work. In contrast to his previous pieces, baroque organisational principles play an important role in it. Their union with his earlier compositional ideas led to the emergence of what has been described as his \\"symphonic style\\", which provided the basis for most of his seven piano and three organ symphonies.Abrahams, p. 163 The first piece to apply the architectural blueprint of this style is his Fourth Piano Sonata (1928–29), which consists of three sections: * A \\"tapestry of motives\\"; * An ornamental slow movement (labelled as a nocturne); * A closing compound movement, which includes a fugue.

It is followed by a stretto that leads to a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. If a fugue has multiple themes, this pattern is repeated for each subject and material from all expositions is combined near the end.Abrahams, pp. 185–186 Sorabji's fugal writing has at times been treated with suspicion or criticised. The subjects can lack the frequent changes of direction present in most melodic writing, and some of the fugues are among the longest ever penned—the largest being the two-hour \\"Fuga triplex\\" that closes the Second Symphony for Organ.Owen, p. 221Pemble, John (9 February 2017). \\"Eight-Hour Work Introduces A New Organ In Iowa City\\".

In some cases, a variation set takes the place of the slow movement. Starting with the Second Symphony for Piano (1954), fugues are positioned either midway through the work or right before a closing slow movement.Abrahams, p. 164 Interludes and moto perpetuo-type sections link larger movements together and make appearances in Sorabji's later fugues,Roberge (2020), p. 306Abrahams, pp. 165, 183, 186–187 like in the Sixth Symphony for Piano (1975–76), whose \\"Quasi fuga\\" alternates fugal and non-fugal sections.Rapoport, p. 170 Other important forms in Sorabji's mature work are the toccata and the autonomous variation set.Abrahams, pp. 168–169 The latter, along with his non-orchestral symphonies, are his most ambitious works and have been praised for the imagination exhibited in them.Abrahams, pp. 168, 227Rapoport, p. 350 Sequentia cyclica super \\"Dies irae\\" ex Missa pro defunctis (1948–49), a set of 27 variations on the original Dies irae plainchant, is considered by some to be his greatest work.Roberge (1996), p. 130 His four multi-movement toccatas are generally more modest in scope and take the structure of Busoni's work of the same name as their starting point.Abrahams, pp. 169–171 = Late works = A passage from the \\"Arabesque-Nocturne\\" from Sorabji's Piano Symphony No. 6, which reflects the textural thinning out of his late music In 1953, Sorabji expressed disinterest in continuing to compose when he described Sequentia cyclica (1948–49) as \\"the climax and crown of his work for the piano and, in all probability, the last he will write\\".Sorabji (1953), p. 9, reproduced in Abrahams, p. 154 His rate of composition slowed down in the early 1960s, and later that decade, Sorabji vowed to cease composing, which he eventually did after writing Concertino non grosso for String Sextet with Piano obbligato quasi continuo (1968). Hinton played a crucial role in Sorabji's resumption of compositional activities.Roberge (2020), pp. 340, 368 Sorabji's next two pieces, Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi and Symphonia brevis for Piano, were written in 1973, the year after the two first met, and marked the beginning of what has been identified as his \\"late style\\", one characterised by thinner, less polyphonic textures, and greater use of extended harmonies.Inglis, p. 49Abrahams, pp. 228–229Owen, p. 283 Roberge writes that Sorabji, upon completing the first movement of Symphonia brevis, \\"felt that it broke new ground for him and was his most mature work, one in which he was doing things he had never done before\\".Roberge (2020), p. 372 Sorabji described his late works as being designed \\"as a seamless coat ... from which the threads cannot be disassociated\\" without compromising the coherence of the music.Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji. Letter to Norman Gentieu, 28 November 1981, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 391 During his late period and several years before his creative hiatus, he also produced pieces composed of \\"aphoristic fragments\\", musical utterances that can last just a few seconds.Roberge (2020), pp. 238, 388 = Inspiration and influences = Ferruccio Busoni, who exerted a strong influence on Sorabji's music and writings Sorabji's early influences include Cyril Scott, Ravel, Leo Ornstein and particularly Scriabin.Rapoport, p. 199 He later became more critical of Scriabin and, after meeting Busoni in 1919, was influenced primarily by the latter in both his music and writings.Owen, p. 303Rapoport, pp. 199, 267Abrahams, p. 150 His mature work was also significantly influenced by Charles-Valentin Alkan, Debussy, Leopold Godowsky, Max Reger and Szymanowski.Roberge (1991), p. 79Rubin, Justin Henry (2003). \\"Thematic Metamorphosis and Perception in the Symphony [No. 1 for Organ of Kaikhosru Sorabji (2/7)\\"]. The Sorabji Archive. Retrieved 22 November 2012.Abrahams, pp. 176–177, 223 Eastern culture partially influenced Sorabji. According to Habermann, it manifests itself in the following ways: highly supple and irregular rhythmic patterns, abundant ornamentation, an improvisatory and timeless feel, frequent polyrhythmic writing and the vast dimensions of some of his compositions.Rapoport, pp. 340, 366 Sorabji wrote in 1960 that he almost never sought to blend Eastern and Western music, and although he had positive things to say about Indian music in the 1920s, he later criticised what he saw as limitations inherent in it and the raga, including a lack of thematic development, which was sidelined in favour of repetition.Roberge (2020), pp. 199–200 A major source of inspiration were his readings of Persian literature, especially for his nocturnes,Roberge (2020), p. 69 which have been described by Sorabji and others as evoking tropical heat, a hothouse or a rainforest.Roberge (2020), pp. 23, 90 Religious and occult references appear in Sorabji's music and come from various sources:Rapoport, pp. 62–65 his Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, the song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text of a Catholic benedictionRoberge, Marc-André (2 July 2020). \\"Musical and Literary Sources\\".

This type of alteration is also seen in Sorabji's numbering of variations.Roberge (2020), p. 121 Sorabji, who claimed to be of Spanish-Sicilian ancestry, composed pieces that reflect an enthusiasm for southern cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach. These are works of a Mediterranean character and are inspired by Busoni's Elegy No. 2, \\"All'Italia! in modo napolitano\\", and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Franz Liszt. They are considered to be among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.Abrahams, p. 171Rapoport, p. 358 = Harmony, counterpoint and form = Sorabji's counterpoint stems from Busoni's and Reger's.Rapoport, p. 346Abrahams, p. 205 The influence of these composers led Sorabji to employ baroque contrapuntal forms (chorale prelude, passacaglia, fugue and others), but he rejected the symmetry and architectural approaches used by composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johannes Brahms.Rapoport, pp. 266–267 Sorabji was dismissive of the Classical style, mainly because he believed it to restrict musical material by forcing it into a \\"ready-made mould\\",Sorabji (1947), pp. 49–52 and his musical thinking is closer to that of the Baroque era than to the Classical.Rapoport, pp. 344, 350 The use of baroque, theme- oriented forms often contrasts with the more rhapsodic, improvisatory writing of his fantasias and nocturnes,Abrahams, p. 173 which, due to their non- thematic nature, have been called \\"static\\". Abrahams describes Sorabji's approach as built on \\"self-organising\\" (baroque) and athematic forms whose ebb and flow is not dictated by themes, and can thus be expanded as needed. While Sorabji wrote pieces of standard or even minute dimensions,Roberge (2020), p. 238 his largest works call for stamina and skills beyond the reach of most performers;Owen, p. 294 examples include his Piano Sonata No. 5 (Opus archimagicum), Sequentia cyclica and the Symphonic Variations for Piano, which last about six, eight and nine hours respectively.Roberge, Marc-André (7 July 2020). \\"Performed Works and Durations\\".

Roberge estimates that Sorabji's extant musical output, which he describes as \\"[perhaps] the most extensive of any twentieth-century composer\\",Roberge (2020), p. 1 may occupy up to 160 hours in performance.Roberge (2020), p. 12 Sorabji's harmonic language often combines tonal and atonal elements, frequently uses triadic harmonies and bitonal combinations, and it does not avoid tonal references.Rapoport, pp. 335, 340, 388 It also reflects his fondness for tritone and semitone relationships;Abrahams, pp. 76, 212 for example, the opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart.Abrahams, p. 184 Despite the use of harmonies traditionally considered harsh, it has been remarked that his writing rarely contains the tension that is associated with very dissonant music.Rapoport, pp. 340, 424 Sorabji achieved this in part by using widely spaced chords rooted in triadic harmonies and pedal points in the low registers, which act as sound cushions and soften dissonances in the upper voices.Abrahams, pp. 194–195 In bitonal passages, melodies may be consonant within a harmonic area, but not with those from the other one.Abrahams, p. 206 Abrahams characterises Sorabji's writing as having a \\"disembodied quality\\" resulting from the use of non-functional harmony, in which no key or bitonal relationship is allowed to become established. This lends flexibility to his harmonic language and helps justify the superimposition of semitonally opposed harmonies.Abrahams, pp. 203–210 = Creative process and notation = Because of Sorabji's sense of privacy, little is known about his compositional process. Early accounts claim that he composed off the cuff and did not revise his work, and it has been said that he used yoga to gather \\"creative energies\\". These claims are generally regarded as dubious and contradict statements made by Sorabji himself (as well as some of his musical manuscripts). In the 1950s, Sorabji stated that he would conceive the general outline of a work in advance and long before the thematic material.Roberge (2020), p. 2 A few sketches survive; crossed-out passages are mostly found in his early works.Roberge (2020), pp. 2, 90 Yoga helped Sorabji regulate his thoughts and achieve self-discipline.Abrahams, pp. 64–66 He found composition highly enervating and often completed works with headaches and experiencing sleepless nights afterwards.Roberge (2020), p. 298 The unusual features of Sorabji's musical language and the \\"ban\\" resulted in idiosyncrasies and irregularities in his notation: a shortage of interpretative directions, the relative absence of time signatures (except in his chamber and orchestral works) and the non-systematic use of bar lines.Roberge (2020), p. 15 He wrote extremely quickly, and there are many ambiguities and inconsistencies in his musical autographs.Abrahams, pp. 53–67Owen, p. 306 They are among the most distinctive features of his scores that have prompted comparisons with his other characteristics.Abrahams, p. 241 Hinton suggested a link between them and Sorabji's speech,Stevenson, p. 35 and said that \\"[Sorabji] invariably spoke at a speed almost too great for intelligibility\\", while Stevenson remarked, \\"One sentence could embrace two or three languages.\\" Sorabji's handwriting, particularly after he began to suffer from rheumatism, can be difficult to decipher.Roberge (2020), p. 376 After complaining about misprints in an open letter he had submitted, the editor of the journal responded, \\"If Mr. Sorabji will in future send his letters in typescript instead of barely decipherable handwriting, we will promise a freedom from misprints\\".Anon. (1930), p. 739Roberge (2020), pp. 376–377 In later life, his typewriting also became problematic and error-ridden.Roberge (2020), p. 377 = Pianism and keyboard music =  As a performer  Sorabji's pianistic abilities have been the subject of much contention. After his early lessons, he appeared to have been self-taught.Owen, p. 280 In the 1920s and 1930s, when he was performing his works in public, their alleged unplayability and his piano technique generated considerable controversy. At the same time, his closest friends and a few other people hailed him as a first-class virtuoso. Most writers believe that he was neither sloppy nor a player of the highest calibre: Roberge, for instance, describes his performances as \\"very problematic\\". Sorabji was a reluctant performer and struggled with the pressure of playing in public.Rapoport, p. 83 On various occasions, he stated that he was not a pianist, and he always prioritised composition; from 1939, he no longer practised the piano often.Rapoport, p. 80 Contemporary reviews noted Sorabji's tendency to rush the music and his lack of patience with quiet passages,Roberge (2020), p. 206 and the private recordings that he made in the 1960s contain substantial deviations from his scores, partly due to his impatience and disinterest in playing clearly and accurately.Rapoport, pp. 81–82Abrahams, p. 51 Writers have thus argued that early reactions to his music were significantly coloured by flaws in his performances.Abrahams, pp. 37–53  As a composer  staves Many of Sorabji's works are written for the piano or have an important piano part.Roberge (1997), pp. 95–96 His writing for the instrument was influenced by composers such as Liszt and Busoni, and he has been called a composer- pianist in their tradition.Roberge (1983), p. 20Rapoport, pp. 340, 342 It particularly exhibits the influence of Godowsky, specifically in its polyphony, polyrhythms and polydynamics. This necessitated the regular use of the sostenuto pedal and systems of three or more staves in Sorabji's keyboard parts; his largest such system appears on page 124 of his Third Organ Symphony and consists of 11 staves.Roberge, Marc-André (3 July 2020). \\"Advanced Keyboard Writing\\". Sorabji Resource Site. Retrieved 14 July 2020.Abrahams, p. 80 In some works, Sorabji writes for the extra keys available on the Imperial Bösendorfer. While its extended keyboard includes only additional low notes, at times he called for extra notes at its upper end.Roberge (2020), pp. 16–17 Sorabji's piano writing has been praised by some for its variety and understanding of the piano's sonorities.Abrahams, p. 223Gray-Fisk, p. 232 His approach to the piano was non-percussive,Rapoport, p. 362 and he emphasised that his music is conceived vocally. He once described Opus clavicembalisticum as \\"a colossal song\\", and pianist Geoffrey Douglas Madge said that Sorabji's playing had much in common with bel canto singing.Rapoport, pp. 392–393 Sorabji once said, \\"If a composer can't sing, a composer can't compose.\\"Owen, p. 287 His piano music—including works he designated as symphonic—often strives to emulate the sounds of other instruments, as seen in score markings such as \\"quasi organo pieno\\" (like a full organ), \\"pizzicato\\" and \\"quasi tuba con sordino\\" (like a tuba with mute).Abrahams, pp. 234–236 In this respect, Alkan was a key source of inspiration: Sorabji was influenced by his Symphony for Solo Piano and the Concerto pour piano seul, and he admired Alkan's \\"orchestral\\" writing for the instrument.Powell (2006), pp. [5], [7]  Organ music  Besides the piano, the other keyboard instrument to occupy a prominent position in Sorabji's output is the organ, which he apparently studied in his youth.Roberge (2020), p. 211 Sorabji's largest orchestral works have organ parts, but his most significant contribution to the instrument's repertoire are his three organ symphonies (1924; 1929–32; 1949–53), all of which are large-scale tripartite works that consist of multiple subsections and last up to nine hours.Roberge (2020), pp. 12, 144, 213, 306 Organ Symphony No. 1 was regarded by Sorabji as his first mature work and he numbered the Third Organ Symphony among his finest achievements.Roberge (2020), pp. 30, 306–307 He considered even the best orchestras of the day to be inferior to the modern organ and praised the \\"tonal splendour, grandeur and magnificence\\" of the instruments in Liverpool Cathedral and the Royal Albert Hall.Roberge (2020), pp. 305–306 He praised organists and described them as being more cultured and possessing sounder musical judgement than most musicians.Roberge (2020), pp. 211–212  Creative transcription  Transcription was a creative endeavour for Sorabji, as it had been for many of the composer- pianists who inspired him: Sorabji echoed Busoni's view that composition is the transcription of an abstract idea, as is performance.Roberge (1991), p. 74Abrahams, p. 233 For Sorabji, transcription was a means for older material to undergo transformation to create an entirely new work (which he did in his pastiches, among them two reworkings of Frédéric Chopin's \\"Minute Waltz\\"), and he saw the practice as a way to enrich and uncover the ideas concealed in a piece.Roberge (1991), p. 82 Most of his transcriptions date from the 1940s and include an adaptation of Johann Sebastian Bach's Chromatic Fantasia, in the preface to which he denounced those who perform Bach on the piano without \\"any substitution in pianistic terms\\".Roberge (2020), pp. 258–259 Sorabji dismissed performers like Albert Schweitzer, whom he deemed rigid and inflexible, and praised others such as Egon Petri and Wanda Landowska for their ability to \\"re-create\\" music. He also encouraged a less-than-literal approach to his compositions.Abrahams, pp. 237–240  Writings  As a writer, Sorabji is best known for his music criticism. He contributed to publications that dealt with music in England, including The New Age, The New English Weekly, The Musical Times and Musical Opinion.Rapoport, p. 257 His writings also cover non-musical issues: he criticised British rule in India and supported birth control and legalised abortion.Rapoport, p. 260 As a homosexual in a time when sodomy was illegal in England (and remained so until 1967), he wrote about the biological and social realities that homosexuals faced for much of his lifetime.Owen, p. 46 He first published an article on the subject in 1921 as a response to a legislative change that would penalise \\"gross indecency\\" between women. The article referenced research by Ellis showing that homosexuality was inborn, rather than a perversion, and could not be cured by imprisonment. It further called for the law to catch up with the latest research and medical findings, and advocated for decriminalising homosexual behaviour. In 1954, Sorabji denounced English laws against same-sex acts and the futility of the punishments they reserved for homosexuals, and in 1958, he joined the Homosexual Law Reform Society.Roberge (2020), p. 150 = Books and music criticism = Charles-Valentin Alkan, whose music Sorabji championed throughout his life Sorabji first expressed interest in becoming a music critic in 1914, and he started contributing criticism to The New Age in 1924 after the magazine had published some of his letters to the editor. By 1930, Sorabji became disillusioned with concert life and developed a growing interest in gramophone recordings, believing that he would eventually lose all reason to attend concerts. In 1945 he stopped providing regular reviews and only occasionally submitted his writings to correspondence columns in journals.Rapoport, pp. 261–262 While his earlier writings reflect a contempt for the music world in general—from its businessmen to its performersRapoport, pp. 21, 260—his later reviews tend to be more detailed and less caustic.Rapoport, pp. 257, 266–267 Although in his youth Sorabji was attracted to the progressive currents of 1910s' European art music, his musical tastes were essentially conservative.Rapoport, p. 266 He had a particular affinity for late-Romantic and Impressionist composers, such as Debussy, Medtner and Szymanowski,Rapoport, pp. 263, 267 and he admired composers of large-scale, contrapuntally elaborate works, including Bach, Mahler, Anton Bruckner and Reger. He also had much respect for composer-pianists like Liszt, Alkan and Busoni.Roberge (2020), p. 361 Sorabji's main bêtes noires were Stravinsky, Schoenberg (from the late 1920s onwards), Hindemith and, in general, composers who emphasised percussive rhythm.Roberge (2020), pp. 57, 357, 362 He rejected serialism and twelve-tone composition as he considered both to be based on artificial precepts,Rapoport, p. 338 denounced Schoenberg's vocal writing and use of Sprechgesang,Roberge (2020), p. 357 and even criticised his later tonal works and transcriptions.Rapoport, p. 269 He loathed the rhythmic character of Stravinsky's music and what he perceived as its brutality and lack of melodic qualities.Rapoport, p. 263 He viewed Stravinsky's neoclassicism as a sign of a lack of imagination. Dmitri Shostakovich and Gabriel Fauré are among the composers whom Sorabji initially condemned but later admired.Rapoport, pp. 269–270 The front cover, back cover and spine of the 1947 publication of Sorabji's book Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician The bulk of Sorabji's music criticism is found in the books Around Music (1932; reissued 1979) and Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician (1947; reissued 1986); both include revised versions of some of his essays and received mostly positive reviews, though Sorabji considered the latter book much better.Roberge (2020), pp. 193, 273 Readers commended his courage, expertise and intellectual incisiveness, but some felt that his verbose style and use of invectives and vitriol detracted from the solid foundation underlying the writings.Roberge (2020), pp. 194–195, 272–273 These critiques echo general criticisms of his prose, which has been called turgid and in which intelligibility is compromised by very long sentences and missing commas.Roberge (2020), pp. 13, 374–375 Roberge writes that Sorabji \\"could sing the praises of some modern British personalities without end, especially when he knew them, or he could tear their music to pieces with very harsh and thoughtless comments that would nowadays lay him open to ridicule\\";Roberge (2020), p. 362 he adds that \\"his biting comments also often brought him to the edge of libel\\". Sorabji championed a number of composers and his advocacy helped many of them move closer to the mainstream at a time when they were largely unknown or misunderstood.Roberge (2020), pp. 352, 361–362 In some cases, he was recognised for promoting their music: he became one of the honorary vice-presidents of the Alkan Society in 1979, and in 1982, the Polish government awarded him a medal for championing Szymanowski's work.Roberge (2020), p. 397  Legacy  = Reception = Sorabji's music and personality have inspired both praise and condemnation, the latter of which has been often attributed to the length of some of his works.Abrahams, pp. 14–15Owen, pp. 15–16 During his life, various individuals, particularly his close friends, spoke favourably of him: Hugh MacDiarmid ranked Sorabji, Denis Saurat and Francis George Scott among the greatest minds Great Britain had produced in his lifetime, placing them only below T. S. Eliot,Roberge (2020), p. 325 and composer and conductor Mervyn Vicars put Sorabji next to Richard Wagner, who he believed \\"had one of the finest brains since Da Vinci\\".Mervyn Vicars. Letter to Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, 30 November 1976, reproduced in Roberge (2020), p. 301 A number of contemporary reviews of his music voiced concerns and scepticism regarding its intelligibility, the technical demands he was making of performers and undue length.Abrahams, pp. 9–15 Several major books on music history, including Richard Taruskin's Oxford History of Western Music and Nicholas Cook's Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Music, do not mention Sorabji, and he has never received official recognition from his country of birth.Roberge (2020), pp. xxi, xxiv A 1994 review of Le jardin parfumé (1923) suggested that \\"the unsympathetic might say that besides not belonging in our time it equally belongs in no other place\\",Harrison (1994b), p. 60 and in 1937, one critic wrote that \\"one could listen to many more performances without really understanding the unique complexity of Sorabji's mind and music\\".Anon. (1937), p. 427 In more recent times, this divided reception has persisted to an extent.

Musicologist and critic Max Harrison, in his review of Rapoport's book Sorabji: A Critical Celebration, wrote unfavourably about Sorabji's compositions, piano playing, writings and personal conduct and implied that \\"nobody cared except a few close friends\\".Harrison (1994a), pp. 61–62 Sorabji's isolation, and sometimes the resulting lack of interaction with the music world, have been criticised even by his admirers.Owen, pp. 27, 293–294Abrahams, pp. 247–249 His writings have also been highly divisive, being viewed by some as profoundly perceptive and enlightening, and by others as misguided.Rapoport, pp. 257–259 = Innovation = Sorabji has been described as a conservative composer who developed an idiosyncratic style fusing diverse influences.Ullén (2004), p. 9Roberge (1983), pp. 17, 20Rapoport, pp. 334–335, 388 However, the perception of and responses to his music have evolved over the years. His early, often modernist works were greeted largely with incomprehension:Abrahams, p. 30 a 1922 review stated, \\"compared to Mr. Sorabji, Arnold Schönberg must be a tame reactionary\\",Bechert, p. 7 and composer Louis Saguer, speaking at Darmstadt in 1949, mentioned Sorabji as a member of the musical avant-garde that few will have the means to understand.Roberge (2020), p. 94 Abrahams writes that Sorabji \\"had begun his compositional career at the forefront of compositional thought and ended it seeming decidedly old-fashioned\\", yet adds that \\"even now Sorabji's 'old-fashioned' outlook sometimes remains somewhat cryptic\\".Abrahams, p. 31 Various parallels have been identified between Sorabji and more progressive composers. Ullén suggests that Sorabji's 100 Transcendental Studies (1940–44) can be seen as \\"presages of the piano music of, say, Ligeti, Finnissy or Ferneyhough\\", although he cautions against overstating this. Roberge likens the opening of Sorabji's Chaleur—Poème (1916–17) to Ligeti's Atmosphères of 1961, writing that it bears resemblance to the latter composer's micropolyphony and Powell has noted the use of metric modulation in Sequentia cyclica (1948–49), which was composed around the same time as (and independently from) Elliott Carter's 1948 Cello Sonata, the first work in which Carter made use of this technique.Roberge (2020), p. 91Powell (2020), pp. 22–23, 39 The mixing of chords with different root notes and the use of nested tuplets, both present throughout Sorabji's works, have been described as anticipating Messiaen's music and Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstücke (1952–2004) respectively by several decades.Roberge (2020), pp. 27–28 Sorabji's fusion of tonality and atonality into a new approach to relationships between harmonies, too, has been called a significant innovation.Rapoport, pp. 388–389  Notes and references  = Notes = = References =  Sources  * Abrahams, Simon John (2002).

Founded in 1478, Angra was historically the most important city in the Azores, as seat of the Bishop of the Azores, government entities, and having previously served as the capital city of Portugal, during the Liberal Wars. The population in 2011 was 35,402,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 239.00 km².Eurostat It was classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1983. Name Angra is the Portuguese word for \\"inlet\\", \\"cove\\", or \\"bay\\". The epithet ' (\\"of Heroism\\", \\"the Heroic\\") was granted to the city by Maria II to commemorate its citizens' successful defense of the island against a Miguelist assault in 1829. History 1595 Engraving by Jan Huygen van Linschoten, showing the extensive cultivated lands of the Achada Plain and the nucleus of the village of Angra Angra do Heroísmo as seen in 1671 An engraving of Angra showing the Fort of São João Baptista Some claim that Angra was founded by Álvaro Martins, who sailed with Didrik Pining on his expedition to the New World, and with Bartolomeu Dias on his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. Others contend that Angra was founded in 1450 or 1451 by Jácome de Bruges, a Fleming in the service of Prince Henry the Navigator, who recruited farmers, fishermen, and merchants in the Low Countries to colonize the Azores. The first references to the settlement of the Azores date to between 1439 and 1449, through the donation of Henry the Navigator the colonization of seven islands in the central and eastern groups of the archipelago. Terceira, included in this group, would be administered by Jácome de Bruges as stipulated in the nomination process, dated March 1450, that included, not only the settlement of the lands, but also: the milling monopoly, ovens, salt concession, land rights in the name of the monarchy, tithes, administration of justice, and rights of succession that included the exceptional provision for materlineal succession. But, the great difficulty in attracting settlers meant that by 22 August 1460, the island was still unpopulated. The site chosen by the first settlers was a ridgeline, which opened, like an amphitheatre, onto two small bays, separated by a peninsula, at the head of which stood the extinct volcano of Monte Brasil. One of these coves was deep enough (around ) to provide an anchorage for large vessels, and it had the further advantage of being sheltered from most strong winds, except for those from the south and southeast. In 1474, Álvaro Martins Homem ordered that the river flowing into the cove be diverted into a manmade stone-lined channel, running downhill, so that its rushing waters could be harnessed to turn the waterwheel of a mill. This laid the foundation for the future economic development of the village of Angra. At the same time, this allowed the area on either side of the river's course to be rearranged according to a rectilinear street-plan and organized into neighborhoods by function (commercial, residential, etc.), to accommodate the needs of the fast-growing port. The first houses of Angra were built on the hillside above the cove, the steep streets winding down to the shore. On high ground, away from the sea, a castle/stronghold/fortress was begun; it would eventually be named Castelo dos Moinhos (). By 1534, Angra was the first town in the archipelago to be elevated to the status of city. In the same year, it was chosen by Pope Paul III to be the seat of the Diocese of Angra, with ecclesiastical authority over all of the islands of the Azores. The commercial port of early Angra played an important role in the Portuguese East Indies trade beginning in the 15th Century. The bay of Angra was often full of caravels and galleons, a circumstance that contributed to the progress of the city and its people. The construction of a number of manors, convents, churches, and military fortifications in Angra, infrastructures that were usually inappropriate for a small city (or small island) indicates the important role that Angra played in trans-Atlantic shipping for the Portuguese. The Portuguese nobleman Pero Anes do Canto (1480–1556), who was born at Guimarães, was the superintendent of fortifications on Terceira. For his competency in that role, and other services to the Portuguese Crown, he was rewarded with the title moço fidalgo (knight-gentleman), and the high office of \\"Purveyor to the Armada of the Islands and the merchant vessels of the East India trade in all of the islands of the Azores\\" (a hereditary title that followed successive members of the Canto family for three hundred years). The importance and power of the Cantos can hardly be overstated. During the period when Portugal was trading with its Asian, African, and South American colonies, they were responsible for the protection and welfare of the merchant fleet (and the staggering wealth represented by the cargoes in their holds) once the ships approached the last leg of their voyages in the North Atlantic. They were also responsible for acting as the chief customs official, the chief magistrate charged with resolving disputes, and the overseer of the naval defenses of the Azores. =Portuguese succession= King António, Prior of Crato, who ruled Portugal from Angra during the 16th-century succession crisis Before Philip II of Spain had a chance to enforce his claim to the crown of Portugal, in 1580, António, Prior of Crato, an illegitimate scion of the Beja line of the House of Braganza Portuguese Royal Family, proclaimed himself king on 24 July 1580. However, his rule in continental Portugal lasted only twenty days; on 25 August, he was defeated at the Battle of Alcântara by the Spanish Habsburg armies led by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. After Alcântara, he attempted to rule Portugal from the Azores, where he established an opposition government in Angra do Heroísmo that lasted until 1583. Although for a time he was the monarch (minting coin and conferring titles), his government on Terceira was only recognized in the Azores, and from that place of refuge, António conducted a popular resistance movement opposed to the recognition of a foreign king. He was supported by a number of French adventurers under Filippo di Piero Strozzi, a Florentine exile in the service of France, as well as Portuguese patriots, some of whom came to the Azores to assist him directly. ;Battle of Salga Bay The first military action in the Azores occurred about a year after António's crushing defeat at Alcântara. A Spanish fleet of ten warships, commanded by Pedro Valdez, bombarded Angra on 5 July 1581, then began investigating the coast of the island in search of the best landing places. At dawn on 25 July, the first ships loaded with Spanish troops anchored in Salga Bay, about twelve kilometres east of Angra's harbour in the village of Vila de São Sebastião. A coastwatcher, stationed at the cape called Ponta do Coelho, gave the alarm, but when the first Portuguese forces arrived about one thousand Castilians had already landed and had started to sack the surrounding villages. In this phase of the fighting, according to local accounts of the action, a leading role was played by young and pretty Brianda Pereira who, together with other women, attacked the enemy with farm implements when she saw her house destroyed. By midmorning, the Spaniards were sweeping the coast with their artillery, and the fighting was fierce. About midday, when the outcome of the battle was still unsettled, an Augustinian monk named Friar Pedro, who was taking an active part in the struggle, thought of the stratagem of driving cattle against the Spaniards so as to scatter them. Over a thousand head of cattle were quickly gathered and, by means of shouts and musket shots, driven against the enemy positions. The disconcerted Spaniards fell back and were pursued to the shore, where almost all of them lost their lives in the fighting or drowned while trying to reach their boats. This unconventional victory, the Battle of Salga Bay, proved that António could count on a good deal of local support. ;Battle of Ponta Delgada The next major military action did not take place until the following summer. Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz, was sent in 1582, as \\"Admiral of the Ocean\\", to drive the pretender and his supporters from Angra and the Azores. Badly outnumbered, he won the Battle of Ponta Delgada on 26 July 1582, off the coast of the island of São Miguel, against a loose confederation of Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch privateers. ;Battle of Terceira Although António's fleet was completely defeated at the Battle of Ponta Delgada, the pretender did flee into exile in France after the battle. His supporters were subsequently defeated the following year at the Battle of Terceira, near Angra, on 27 July 1583, which allowed Philip's forces to finally occupy the Azores and complete his unification of the Crowns of Spain and Portugal. Yet, Santa Cruz, the Spanish admiral, who was acclaimed for his victories against the House of Aviz and its partisans in the Azores, recognized that England presented a grave threat to Spain's empire, and he became a zealous advocate of war with the English. A letter he wrote to Philip II from Angra do Heroísmo, on 9 August 1583, two weeks after the Battle of Terceira, contains the first definite suggestion of the formation of the Spanish Armada. It was following the events of the battle of Terceira that the existing fortifications in Monte Brasil were rethought. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), the original Portuguese fortifications were redesigned by Italian military engineer Giovanni Vicenzo Casale and his assistants, since privateers, such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, had attacked Spanish ships and possessions. The first cornerstone was lanced in 1583, and progressively elaborated to include several bastions and cannon emplacements. By the Restoration, the Spanish commander, Álvaro de Viveiros, resisted for eleven months (from 27 March 1641 to 4 March 1642) behind the walls of the impregnable fortress, and only a concentrated task force commanded by Francisco Ornelas da Câmara and João de Bettencourt were able to defeat the commander. The fort was taken, and reclaimed for Portugal: a church was constructed within the fortress in honour of Saint John the Baptist () after 1642. =17th century= A young Almeida Garret, during the Napoleonic invasions escaped, along with his family to Angra, where they remained until English forces liberated the Iberian peninsula After a time in London, former Emperor Pedro I of Brazil joined liberal forces in Angra do Heroísmo, where he made a base for his eventual assault on the continent during the Liberal Wars Over the years, Terceira (and Angra in particular) has been a popular place for out-of-favor monarchs to cool their heels while events on the Portuguese mainland or elsewhere went on without them. In 1667, near the end of the Portuguese Restoration War, King Afonso VI, his chief advisor, Castelo Melhor, and Castelo Melhor's francophile party were overthrown by the king's younger brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, (who later ruled as Pedro II of Portugal.) Pedro first installed himself as his brother's regent; then, he arranged Afonso's exile to the island of Terceira in the Azores on the pretense that he was incapable of governing. Afonso's exile lasted seven years. João Baptista da Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett, better known as the author, Almeida Garrett, was born in 1799 in Porto, Portugal. In 1809, his family fled the second French invasion carried out by Soult's troops, seeking refuge in Angra do Heroísmo. While in the Azores, he was taught by his uncles, all prominent churchmen. (His uncle, Dom Frei Alexandre da Sagrada Família, was the twenty- fifth bishop of Angra.) In 1818, Almeida Garrett left the island and moved to Coimbra to study at the university's law school. =19th century= Ngungunhane, the Lion of Gaza, was captured by Portuguese forces after his rebellion in Portuguese West Africa and exiled to Angra do Heroísmo When King João VI died in 1826, the country was plunged into a succession crisis. The king had a rightful male heir, Emperor Pedro of Brazil, who had successfully rebelled against his father in the 1820s. Many prominent Portuguese, however, did not wish to be reunified with their former colony. The king's younger son Miguel was exiled in Austria, having led a number of failed revolutions of his own against his father's liberal regime. Pedro abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his 7-year-old daughter Maria da Glória, stipulating that she would marry her uncle Miguel when she came of age. In order to rule jointly with his niece, however, Miguel was obligated to swear an oath to uphold the existing liberal constitution. Miguel initially agreed but quickly reneged. He deposed his young niece and began establishing an absolutist monarchy. Pedro and his daughter then began a conflict known variously as the Liberal Wars, the Portuguese Civil War, the War of the Two Brothers, and the Miguelite War. On June 22, 1828, liberals deposed the Azores' captain-general Manuel Vieira de Albuquerque Touvar, deporting him to the mainland and establishing a headquarters on Terceira. The Battle of Praia da Vitória on August 11, 1829, saw the Terceirans repulse a Miguelist attack. This would lead to Angra being given the honorary title of ', \\"the Heroic\\". Maria da Glória resided on the island from 1830 to 1833; her forces were victorious the following year. On 20 September 1836, Charles Darwin, the eminent English naturalist, nearing the end of his second voyage aboard the research vessel, HMS Beagle, arrived at the Azores and anchored at Angra. The next day, Darwin hired a horse and some guides and rode to the center of the island where an active volcanic crater was supposed to exist. What he found there was not a \\"crater\\" at all; instead, what he found was a series of fissures in the rock with steam issuing from them. To a naturalist, his long day in the saddle was not very illuminating. Biologically speaking, Darwin wrote, he could \\"find nothing of interest\\". The next day, Darwin traveled along the coast road and visited the town of Praia da Vitória on the northeastern end of the island. He returned by way of the northern shore, and he crossed the central part of the island on his way back to the Beagle. He departed on 25 September for the island of São Miguel, to pick up any letters that may have been posted to him there. Angra and neighboring Praia da Vitória were the sites of an interesting episode of the American Civil War. Unable to break the blockade by US Navy ships of southern (Confederate) ports, and hoping to draw these blockading ships away to counter other perceived threats, the Confederate States of America had commerce raiders built in Britain and France. One of these left Liverpool in July 1862 in the guise of a \\"merchant ship\\" and rendezvoused with supporting ships in the harbor of Praia da Vitória. This meeting-place was chosen because Portugal was neutral and the Azores were far away from pursuing US Navy ships. In that port and, later at Angra, cannon and other supplies of war were transferred aboard the new ship. The CSS Alabama was commissioned on 24 August 1862 just outside the harbor of Angra, and it left Terceira to begin its career as the most effective commerce raider in naval history. Ngungunhane (also known as Mdungazwe Ngungunyane Nxumalo, N'gungunhana, or Gungunhana Reinaldo Frederico Gungunhana) was born in Gaza in southern Africa around 1850, and he died at Angra do Heroísmo on 23 December 1906. A vassal of the Portuguese king, he later rebelled, and he was defeated and imprisoned by the Portuguese Army, led by Joaquim Mouzinho de Albuquerque. He was exiled to Lisbon and then to the island of Terceira, where he converted to Catholicism; he lived there until his death. He was the last emperor of the Empire of Gaza, a territory that is now part of Mozambique, and he was the last monarch of his dynasty. Nicknamed the \\"Lion of Gaza\\", he reigned from 1884 to 28 December 1895, the day he was made prisoner by Joaquim Mouzinho de Albuquerque in the fortified village of Chaimite. Because he was already known to the European press, the Portuguese colonial administration decided to condemn him to exile rather than send him to face a firing squad, as would normally be the case. He was transported to Lisbon, accompanied by a son named Godide and other dignitaries. After a brief stay, he was transferred to Angra do Heroísmo, where he died eleven years later. =20th century= Angra was hit by a major earthquake on 1 January 1980 that did considerable damage to the city's historic center and to many other locations on the island of Terceira. The Azores have experienced many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions since prehistoric times, but the 1980 event was probably the most serious since the eighteenth century. The damage in the city was repaired and rebuilt within four years. In 1983, the historic center of Angra do Heroísmo was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Geography Angra do Heroísmo The city of Angra, surrounded by the green landscapes of Monte Brasil and Serra do Morião The massive shield volcano of Santa Bárbara, the highest peak on the island of Terceira Angra occupies the south coast of Terceira. It is the headquarters of a military command and the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric. Its principal buildings are the Sé Cathedral of Angra do Heroísmo, a military college, an arsenal, and an observatory. The harbor, now of little commercial or strategic importance (but formerly a major commercial and military port), is sheltered on the west and southwest by the promontory of Monte Brasil, but, today, it is less important than the neighboring ports of Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel and Horta on the island of Faial. * Jardim Duque da Terceira * Miradouro da Amoreira * Miradouro do Pico das Cruzinhas * Miradouro da Ponta do Queimado * Miradouro do Pico Matias Simão * Miradouro da Serreta * Miradouro das Veredas * Mata da Serreta * Parque Municipal do Relvão * Parque Arqueológico Subaquático da Baía de Angra do Heroísmo * Parque de Campismo das Cinco Ribeiras =Ecoregions/Protected areas= * Algar do Carvão * Baía de Angra do Heroísmo * Baía das Pontas * Baía da Salga * Baía do Refugo * Baía dos Salgueiros * Furna de Água * Galerias da Feteira * Gruta do Natal * Gruta Brisa Azul * Gruta das Mercês * Gruta do Zé Grande * Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras * Gruta das Agulhas * Gruta dos Ratões * Ilhéus das Cabras * Lagoa do Negro * Monte Brasil * Porto das Cinco Ribeiras * Ponta do Queimado * Prainha * Serra do Morião * Serra da Ribeirinha * Serra de Santa Bárbara * Zona Balnear do Negrito * Zona de Protecção Especial do Ilhéu das Cabras =Climate= The climate of Angra do Heroísmo is borderline Mediterranean (Csa) and humid subtropical (Cfa), with the August daily mean being just above the isotherm and the July rainfall just below the 30 mm isotherm for the oceanic climate (Cfb) regime. It is also significantly tempered by the Gulf Stream and the warm North Atlantic waters surrounding the Azores, with extremely mild winter temperatures for a place so far from the equator. It is one of the outermost locations from the equator never to have recorded air frost. By contrast, temperatures above have never been recorded, with summer days reliably staying around to . =Human geography= Administratively, the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo is made up of several civil parishes, that were historically parochial entities administered by the Catholic Church. After the expulsion of the religious orders from Portugal, the Portuguese administration adapted these territorial units, into secular institutions that became the foundation of local government. In a civil context, a parish (freguesia in Portuguese) is simply a subdivision of a municipality (concelho or município). The nineteen civil parishes of Angra do Heroísmo are: * Altares * Cinco Ribeiras * Doze Ribeiras * Feteira * Nossa Senhora da Conceição * Porto Judeu * Posto Santo * Raminho * Ribeirinha * Santa Bárbara * Santa Luzia * São Bartolomeu de Regatos * São Bento * São Mateus da Calheta * São Pedro * Sé * Serreta * Terra Chã * Vila de São Sebastião Thirteen of the parishes have a thousand people or more, and 88.71% of the population live in these larger parishes. About 11.3% of the population live in the remaining six small parishes. The most populated parish is Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Our Lady of Conception), and the least populated is Serreta. The largest parish geographically is Porto Judeu, and the smallest is Santa Luzia. Architecture Convent of São Francisco was founded in 1470. =Civic= Downtown Angra The historic centre of Angra, is located along the southern coast, encompassing the medieval city and fortified citadel that forms the volcanic cone of Monte Brasil. Angra is dominated by the Old Square (), also known as the Square of Saints Cosmo and Damian () or the Restoration Square (). It was one of the first Portuguese squares specifically designed as a broad open space, joining two of the old town's main arteries. Angra's square is a broad and orderly, paved with Portuguese pavement stone (of white limestone and black basalt). Throughout its history, this main square has had various functions: it was a chicken and livestock market on Sundays; during the struggles between the Liberals and the Absolutists (during the Liberal Wars) it was the site of public hangings; and the location where the local running of the bulls began. The well-planned and handsome square in Angra owes its character to the influence of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which resulted in the reconstruction program that influenced many of the towns and villages of Portugal. The old square (which reached its ultimate form during the late 18th century) reflects this new thinking and approach to urbanism and transport. After the 19th century (specifically 1879), it served as a central gathering place for concerts by the military band of the 10th Chasseur regiment, whose barracks were in the Fort of São João Baptista. * Building of the Angra do Heroísmo Savings (); * Cemetery of Anchors (); * Customshouse of Angra do Heroísmo (); constructed to support the influx of peoples and commercial resources into the 15th century colonies of the Azores, the long- house-like civil structure was constructed in the 16th century along the Patio da Alfândega alongside the primitive wharf and Church of the Misericórida; * Manor of D. Violante do Canto (); * Manor of Madre de Deus (), constructed by João de Bettencourt de Vasconcelos who (along with his brother-in-law, Captain-major Francisco Ornelas da Câmara) used this building in 1641 during their blockade of the fortress of São João Baptista, and carved-out trenches around the building in order to defend the site; * Manor of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios (), a former-residence of the Canto e Castro family, the 16th century manorhouse was constructed from the residential home of by Pero Anes do Canto, who was nominated as the first Provisionor-of-Arms (in 1527). Responsible for supporting the caravels and carracks that transited the Atlantic, the medieval post was centred in the manorhouse and his descendants expanded the group of buildings, including the large chapel, attributed to Pero's great-great- grandson; * Manor of the Count of Vila Flor (); * Palace of the Bettencourts (), a 17th-century building, originally a private home, that houses the public library and regional archives, that includes a repository of 400,000 books and two million documents; * Palace of the Captains-General (), located near the Largo Prior do Crato, the 16th century building, is intimately linked to the history : it was originally the Jesuit College of Saint Ignatius and later College of the Society of Jesus, before it was abandoned in 1759. When the office of Captain-General was created in 1766, the building was converted into the official residence of the Crowns representatives in the Azores, controlling the military, political, and administrative life of the archipelago; * Residence of Quinta de Nossa Senhora da Oliveira () * Cais da Alfândega * Cais da Silveira * Câmara Municipal de Angra do Heroísmo * Porto das Cinco Ribeiras =Military= The island of Terceira, dating from the 15th century had always been susceptible to attacks by pirates and privateers, first from Barbary coast pirates, but later by European powers who sought to capture spoils from the ships returning from the Far East. Following the personal union between Spain and Portugal, following the Dynastic Crisis, the need to protect the transit points of the Azores, resulted in the construction of several posts and redoubts along the coast of the island, among the most important were: * Castle of Moinhos (), known as the Castle of São Cristóvão, or Castle/Fort of São Luís, it is the ruins of 16th-century fortification overlooking the city of Angra, today surmounted by the Alto da Memória a 19th- century obelisk dedicated to former King Peter IV of Portugal, whose forces defeated the absolute monarchy of his brother Miguel during the Liberal Wars; * Fort of Cinco Ribeiras * Fort of Greta * Fort of Má Ferramenta (), used throughout the 16th to 20th century, the platform served for a time during the Second World War before being abandoned and left to ruin; * Fort of Negrito (), home to the Azorean Museum of Military History, Negrito was constructed in 1581 (simultaneously with the Fort of Salga) to provide protection from the then imminent Spanish attack caused by the Succession Crisis of 1580. * Fort of Salga * Fort of Santa Catarina das Mós * Fort of Santo António * Fort of Santo António do Monte Brasil (), the small fort, which was named after António of Portugal extended the defences of the Bay of Angra by crossing-fire with the Fort of São Sebastião, owing to the shorter range of the former; * Fort of São Benedito do Monte Brasil * Fort of São Fernando * Fort of São Francisco * Fort of São João (), also known as the Fort of Biscoitinhos, was included in the fortification plans of Tommaso Benedetto, but little was done to improve the large redoubt, which was mistakenly confused, at various times, with the Redoubt of Poço and/or Fort of Açougue; * Fort of São João Baptista (); Angra do Heroísmo is dominated by the cinder cone of Monte Brasil, on which is located the fortress of São João Baptista, originally completed as the Fort of São Filipe, during the Philippine Dynasty, under the reign of Philip II of Spain. The fortress, which includes a primary bulwark and encircled by line of walls with four hundred pieces of artillery, used to protected shipping that returned from the East Indies (laden with gold and silver). The fortess is dominated by the Church of São João Baptista () and parade grounds, completed at the end of the end of the Iberian union, following the restoration of Portuguese sovereignty in 1640. At that time, the fortress was renamed to correspond with the name of the church. * Fort of São Sebastião ()At the other end of the Bay of Angra, opposite the Porto de Pipas (Port of Barrels), is the Fort of São Sebastião, built in the 16th century on the order of King Sebastian. The scope of its cannons were interlocked with the ranges of the cannons on Monte Brasil and three other small forts along the coastline, creating an effective defensive system for the port, which had been a favourite target for pirates. The Castelo de São Sebastião has been transformed into a charming hotel, one of the forty-odd pousadas (inns in historic buildings) of Portugal; this transformation preserves its original historic character, but the plumbing has been modernized, and some non-visible structural elements have been strengthened. * Fort of the Zimbreiro * Fortress of São Mateus da Calheta (), part of a complex of six forts along the southern coast, the Great Fort was constructed after French pirates under Pierre Bertrand de Montluc attacked in 1567; * Fort of the Açougue * Fort of the Caninas * Fort of the Cavalas * Fort of the Church of São Mateus da Calheta * Fort of the Maré * Fort of the Terreiro * Redoubt of Dois Paus * Redoubt of Três Paus * Redoubt of Salga =Religious= At one stage, Angra had as many as nine convents, each with its own cloisters and churches. Most of these churches are from the Mannerist and Baroque periods, and they are remarkably grand if we bear in mind the poor quality of the stone to be found on the island. The interior decoration of these churches relied on the use of both traditional carved and gilded woodwork and the rich and exotic woods of Brazil. On the Ladeira de São Francisco in central Angra is the Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Guia (Church of Our Lady of Guia), where the seafarer Paulo da Gama is buried. He accompanied his brother Vasco da Gama on his first sea voyage to India in 1497. * Chapel/Hospital of Nossa Senhora da Boa Nova () * Chapel of the Misericórdia of São Sebastião () * Church of the Society of Jesus College () * Convent of the Conceptionists () * Convent of São Gonçalo (), established in 1542, through the initiative of nobleman Brás Pires do Canto, to shelter the Clarisse sisters, surviving to 1832 when it was the only surviving convent after the expulsion of the religious orders. It is considered one of the best surviving Baroque era religious institutions in the Azores. * Convent of Santo António dos Capuchos () * Hermitage of Santo Cristo do Cruzeiro () * (Old) Church of São Mateus da Calheta () Culture =Azorean bullfight= A scene from the traditional touradas à corda, where people and bulls play cat-and-mouse in the streets of parishes of the municipality The Portuguese version of bullfighting differs considerably from its Spanish counterpart, and the Azorean variety, which began on Terceira, differs from the mainland style in some important respects also. The Azorean bullfight ritual involves \\"audience participation\\" in a way that recalls the \\"running of the bulls\\" at Pamplona (Spain). On Terceira, 4 fighting bulls are enclosed in separate wooden crate for several hours and transported to the village where the bullfight will happen, then a long stout rope is secured around his neck. Fireworks are exploded to signal the citizens that a bull will soon be let loose in the public square. Once the bull is released, some young men take hold of the rope to try to control the bull's head, and others taunt the bull with everything from brightly colored fighting capes to parasols. A free-for-all ensues while the bull drags some men around by the rope and tries to punish his tormenters, by butting them to the ground and goring them (with blunted horns), or by trampling over them. This is a popular leisure activity and public entertainment; it is known as the tourada à corda (). Eventually, the bull is funneled through the city streets to the bullring, the Praça de Toiros da Ilha (Island Bullring), in the eastern part of Angra, where a traditional Portuguese-style bullfight is held. From May 1 to September 30, there are daily touradas; in fact, sometimes there are two or three in one day. Education The University of the Azores, which has its principal campus on the island of São Miguel, has a subsidiary campus in Angra do Heroísmo, where the Department of Agrarian Sciences (Departamento de Ciências Agrárias) is located. This institution is a center for advanced scientific and agricultural studies, and it attracts students from the entire archipelago, as well as foreign students from many countries. The Instituto Histórico da Ilha Terceira (IHIT), which means, in Portuguese, the \\"Terceira Island Historical Institute\\", is a private cultural association, dedicated to the investigation and study of the history of the Azores. It is organized as an academy, and it sponsors classes, lectures, and symposia on various topics. The institute was founded in 1942 by the city of Angra do Heroísmo. Sport Angra has a football team, named S.C. Angrense, that is part of the Associação de Futebol de Angra do Heroísmo. Sport Clube Lusitânia is the main football team on the island.

The university enrolls 4,041 students. History McMurran Hall Old college building and rear view of new building, 1918 Shepherd University began when the county seat of Jefferson County, West Virginia, was moved from Shepherdstown to Charles Town in July 1871. The people of Shepherdstown and vicinity decided to use the vacated courthouse for educational purposes. An article of incorporation for a school to be known as Shepherd College, designed to instruct students “in languages, arts and sciences,” was drawn up and signed by C. W. Andrews, Alexander R. Boteler, C. T. Butler, G. M. Beltzhoover, David Billmyer, Samuel Knott, and Henry Shepherd. This body of incorporators gave itself power to elect instructors, pay salaries, and prescribe courses of study. Professor Joseph McMurran was appointed first principal of the institution, which opened with 42 students in September 1871, under the authority of the Board of Trustees. On February 27, 1872, the Legislature of West Virginia passed the following act: “That a branch of the State Normal School be and the same is hereby established at the building known as Shepherd College, in Shepherdstown, in the county of Jefferson.” Shepherd became a four-year college for the training of teachers on July 1, 1930, at which time the institution began granting the bachelor of arts degree. Shepherd was authorized to implement liberal arts programs in 1943, and in 1950 the bachelor of science degree was added. Also in 1950 Shepherd was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1951 it became a member of the Association of American Colleges. On April 7, 2004, Governor Bob Wise signed legislation allowing Shepherd College to change its name to Shepherd University. In the past two decades, Shepherd has added 11 new buildings, including the $9 million Robert C. Byrd Science and Technology Center; the $18 million addition to the Scarborough Library, which also houses the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education; and the $10 million nursing classroom building. The $21.6 million Wellness Center opened on June 11, 2009 and includes a 25-yard, eight-lane pool; two basketball courts, and six basketball hoops; two racquetball courts, indoor elevated 1/10 mile jogging track; two multi-purpose rooms with mirrored wall for group exercise classes; 7,500+ square foot weight and fitness area as well as a dining venue operated by Shepherd's Dining Services. Potomac Place, a new 298 bed dormitory on the West Campus, opened in August 2017. Contemporary Arts Center entrance Phase I Frank Center Stage Dr. Mary J. C. Hendrix was inaugurated as the sixteenth president of Shepherd University on April 8, 2016. The Ruth Scarborough Library The Ruth Scarborough Library collection contains varied materials, numbering 511,518 items. Printed and microtext materials compose the majority of the collection, including 164,206 printed books and bound periodicals as well as 200,474 in microfiche and microfilm. Other items in the collection include phonograph records, cassette tapes, DVDs, CDs, and video cassettes. The library currently subscribes to 521 periodicals and newspapers in paper, and it provides access to more than 12,000 periodicals in full-text. In addition, the library provides access to electronic databases and online indexing and abstracting services. Since 1971, the library has been a selective repository for federal government publications and regularly receives West Virginia state government publications. The library houses a special collection of printed materials relating to state and regional history. The library's computerized catalog provides Web access to materials in the Scarborough collection, and the library maintains a Web site. The Scarborough Library, originally built in 1965, was renovated in 2002–03. The library is a place of study and research for individuals and groups. The expansion, dedicated in 2002, includes multimedia classrooms, additional reading areas and seating, and the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education whose purpose is to promote an understanding of the United States Congress and the Constitution through public programing, teacher training. The Byrd Center houses an archive containing the political papers of West Virginia's Senator Robert C. Byrd, Congressman Harley O. Staggers, Sr., and Congressman Harley O. Staggers, Jr., along with other related collections. Home of the Contemporary American Theater Festival The Contemporary American Theater Festival is an annual festival of new plays by American playwrights, most often premieres or second or third productions. CATF focuses on plays that deal with contemporary issues that boldly challenge and entertain audiences. Since 1991, CATF has produced 127 plays written by 90 playwrights, including 52 world premieres, 11 of which were commissioned. Adventurous audiences from 38 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, and Europe have attended the Theater Festival's productions. The plays are professionally produced using Actors' Equity Association's LORT D contract; CATF operates under agreements from AEA, United Scenic Artists, and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War is home to Shepherd University's Civil War & 19th Century America concentrated track of studies. Currently the program requires students to complete a program of specialized courses in addition to the courses already required of all history majors. Courses concentrate on various elements of 19th century history such as The American Civil War, 1850–1865; the Reconstruction Era; African American History; Soldiers and Society, 1861–65; and the Old South. Students also conduct primary research within the topic area and must intern at one of various historic sites in the region, such as Harpers Ferry National Historic Site.The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War . Shepherd.edu. Retrieved on 2011-07-02. The ongoing research mission at The George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War involves the compilation of figures from the soldiers' compiled military service records which will lead to a more definitive number of veterans from the battle born state of West Virginia. Within the next five years, data gleaned from the service records of soldiers serving in all of West Virginia's Union regiments and (Western) Virginia Confederate regiments will be compiled in the center's electronic database. Once completed a simple query will be able to provide a very accurate total for both sides including data heretofore unavailable to historians. Currently the center is headed by Civil War historian Dr. James J. Broomall.

Cufflinks are items of jewelry that are used to secure the cuffs of dress shirts. Cufflinks can be manufactured from a variety of different materials, such as glass, stone, leather, metal, precious metal or combinations of these. Securing of the cufflinks is usually achieved via toggles or reverses based on the design of the front section, which can be folded into position. There are also variants with chains or a rigid, bent rear section. The front sections of the cufflinks can be decorated with gemstones, inlays, inset material or enamel and designed in two or three-dimensional forms. Cufflinks are designed only for use with shirts that have cuffs with buttonholes on both sides but no buttons. These may be either single or double-length (\\"French\\") cuffs, and may be worn either \\"kissing\\", with both edges pointing outward, or \\"barrel-style\\", with one edge pointing outward and the other one inward so that its hem is overlapped. In the US, the \\"barrel-style\\" was popularized by a famous 19th-century entertainer and clown, Dan Rice; however, \\"kissing\\" cuffs are usually preferred. Design = Closing mechanism = Cufflink designs vary widely, with the most traditional the \\"double-panel\\", consisting of a short post or (more often) chain connecting two disc-shaped parts, both decorated. Whale- back and toggle-back cufflinks have a flat decorated face for one side, while the other side shows only the swivel-bar and its post. The swivel bar is placed vertically (aligned with the post) to put the links on and off, then horizontally to hold them in place when worn. The decorated face on the most visible side is usually larger; a variety of designs can connect the smaller piece: It may be small enough to fit through the buttonhole as a button would; it may be separated and attached from the other side; or it may have a portion that swivels on the central post, aligning with the post while the link is threaded through the button-hole and swiveling into a position at right angles to the post when worn. Links of knotted brightly colored silk enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1990s, joined by an elasticated section. = Motif = The visible part of a cufflink is often monogrammed or decorated in some way, such as with a birthstone or something which reflects a hobby or association. There are numerous styles including novelty, traditional, or contemporary. Cufflinks can and have been worn with casual wear, informal attire or business suits, all the way to very dressy styles such as semi-formal (black tie or Stroller), and formal wear (morning dress or white tie), where they become essentially required and are matched with shirt studs. Colorful and whimsical cufflink designs are usually only suitable for casual and relatively informal events and signals someone who is fun-loving, approachable, and friendly. However, formal wear has stricter expectations, with pearl cufflinks being preferred for white tie events Traditionally it was considered important to coordinate the metal of one's cufflinks with other jewelry such as watch case, belt buckle, tie bar or rings. Sartorial experts prescribe gold to be worn during the daytime and silver for evening wear, but neither expectation is considered as critical as it once was. = Fabric cufflinks = An alternative type of cufflink is the cheaper silk knot which is usually two conjoined monkey's fist or Turk's head knots. The Paris shirtmaker Charvet is credited with their introduction in 1904. They became quickly popular: \\"Charvet [link] buttons of twisted braid are quite the style\\" noted The New York Times in 1908. French cuff shirts are often accompanied with a set of colour-coordinated silk knots instead of double-button cufflinks. They are now often not from silk and consist of fabric over an elasticated core. Owing to the popularity of this fashion, metal cufflinks shaped to look like a silk knot are also worn. = Interchangeable cufflinks = Interchangeable cufflinks have started to come back into the marketplace in recent years. Cartier introduced their type in the 1960s consisting of a bar with a loop at either end that would allow a motif to be inserted at either end perpendicular to the bar. Cartier referred to the interchangeable motifs as batons. A set including the bars would come with batons made from coral, carnelian, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, onyx, tiger's eye and malachite. Bars would have been made from stainless steel, sterling silver or 18k gold. Cartier recently re-introduced these interchangeable cufflinks with batons made from striped chalcedony, silver obsidian, malachite, sodalite, and red tiger's eye. The accompanying bars are made from 18k gold or palladium plated sterling silver. The securing mechanism is the same for either series using a small screw inset into the looped end of the bar. The pressure exerted a by the screw on the baton holds them in place. Another type of interchangeable system was created by pranga & co. The patent- pending cufflink system comes apart allowing the motif, referred to as an Anker, to slide on. Putting the cufflink back together secures the anker into the cufflink allowing it to be worn. pranga & co's cufflink is simple and similar in concept to charm bracelet bead systems popularized by companies like Pandora Jewelry. The ankers used in the cufflinks are interchangeable with various charm bracelets systems and visa-versa. History Although the first cufflinks appeared in the 1600s, they did not become common until the end of the 18th century. Their development is closely related to that of the men's shirt. Men have been wearing shirt-like items of clothing since the invention of woven fabric 5,000 years BC. Although styles and methods of manufacturing changed, the underlying form remained the same: a tunic opened to the front with sleeves and collar. The shirt was worn directly next to the skin, it was washable and thereby protected the outer garments from contact with the body. Conversely, it also protected the skin against the rougher and heavier fabrics of jackets and coats by covering the neck and wrists. After the Middle Ages, the visible areas of the shirt (neck, chest, and wrists) became sites of decorative elements such as frills, ruffs, and embroidery. The cuffs were held together with ribbons, as collared, an early precursor of neckties. Frills that hung down over the wrist were worn at court and other formal settings until the end of the 18th century, whilst in the everyday shirts of the time, the sleeves ended with a simple ribbon or were secured with a button or a connected pair of buttons. In the 19th century, the former splendor of the aristocracy was superseded by the bourgeois efficiency of the newly employed classes. From then onward men wore a highly conventional wardrobe: a dark suit by day, a dinner jacket, or tailcoat in the evening. By the middle of the 19th century, modern cufflink became popular. The shirt front as well as collar and cuffs covering areas of the most wear were made sturdier. This was practical but when clean and starched, collars and cuffs underscored the formal character of the clothing. However, they could be too stiff to secure the cuffs with a simple button. As a consequence, from the mid 19th century onward men in the middle and upper classes wore cufflinks. The industrial revolution meant that these could be mass-produced, making them available in every price category. Colored cufflinks made from gemstones were initially only worn by men with a great deal of self-confidence, however. This situation changed when the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, popularised colorful Fabergé cufflinks in the 19th century. During this time cufflinks became fashion accessories and one of the few acceptable items of jewelry for men in Britain and the U.S. This development continued into the early 1900s, with more cufflinks worn than ever before. These were available in every type of form, color, and material, incorporating both gemstones and less precious stones and glass in cheaper copies. Intricate colored enameled cufflinks in every conceivable geometric pattern were especially popular. All of these were of equal value, as Coco Chanel had made fashion jewelry acceptable to wear. In a parallel development, however, a sportier style of shirt emerged with unstarched cuffs that could be secured with simple buttons. Cufflink made in Idar-Oberstein in the 1960s Cufflinks made by Victor Mayer, Pforzheim, in the 1930s This spread to Europe as well over the same period. In Germany, Idar- Oberstein and Pforzheim were key centers of cufflink production. Whilst in Idar-Oberstein cufflinks were produced using simple materials for the more modest budget, the Pforzheim jewelry manufacturers produced for the medium and upper segments using genuine gold and silver. In Pforzheim, premium cufflinks are still produced today, some of them to historic patterns, some modern, all of them using traditional craftsmanship. Following the end of shortages related to the Second World War, into the 1950s a gentleman liked to adorn himself with a whole range of accessories, comprising items such as cigarette case, lighter, tie pin or tie bar, watch (now worn mostly on the wrist instead of the pocket), ring, key chain, money clip, etc., an ensemble that also included a wide range of cufflinks. In the 1970s cufflinks were less emphasized in much of middle-class fashion. Fashion was dominated by the Woodstock generation, with shirts primarily manufactured complete with buttons and buttonholes. Many fine heirlooms were reworked into earrings. The 1980s saw a return to traditional cufflinks, as part of a general revival in traditional male dress. This trend has more or less continued to this day.

It is also located about west of the village of Bryggja. The village of Tennebø is located about southeast of Deknepollen, with the lake Degnepollvatnet located between the two villages. Before the Måløy Bridge was constructed, there was a ferry from Deknepollen to Måløy. The name Deknepollen could be roughly translated as a \\"small fjord arm by the deacon\\". Degnepoll is also a surname used by some families originating from the community or still living there. The estimated population (2001) of Deknepollen is 245. The main industry is fish processing and the main production facility produces fish oil and animal fodder. This factory was under construction during World War II and was totally destroyed during Operation Archery days before it could have been put into operation.

He shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alfred G. Gilman for \\"their discovery of G-proteins and the role of these proteins in signal transduction in cells.\\" Biography Rodbell was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Shirley (née Abrams) and Milton Rodbell, a grocer. His family was Jewish. After graduating from the Baltimore City College high school, he entered Johns Hopkins University in 1943, with interests in biology and French existential literature. In 1944, his studies were interrupted by his military service as a U.S. Navy radio operator during World War II. He returned to Hopkins in 1946 and received his B.S. in biology in 1949. In 1950, he married Barbara Charlotte Ledermann, a former friend of the legendary diarist Anne Frank, with whom he had four children. Rodbell received his Ph.D. in biochemistry at the University of Washington in 1954. He did post-doctoral work at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1954 to 1956. In 1956, Rodbell accepted a position as a research biochemist at the National Heart Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1985, Rodbell became Scientific Director of the NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina where he worked until his retirement in 1994. He was also Adjunct Professor of Cell Biology at Duke University (from 1991 to 1998)Bulletins of Duke University (from 1991 to 1998), published by Duke University and Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He died in Chapel Hill of multiple organ failure after an extended illness. =Research= Reflecting the increasingly common analogies between computer science and biology in the 1960s, Rodbell believed that the fundamental information processing systems of both computers and biological organisms were similar. He asserted that individual cells were analogous to cybernetic systems made up of three distinct molecular components: discriminators, transducers, and amplifiers (otherwise known as effectors). The discriminator, or cell receptor, receives information from outside the cell; a cell transducer processes this information across the cell membrane; and the amplifier intensifies these signals to initiate reactions within the cell or to transmit information to other cells. In December 1969 and early January 1970, Rodbell was working with a laboratory team that studied the effect of the hormone glucagon on a rat liver membrane receptor—the cellular discriminator that receives outside signals. Rodbell discovered that ATP (adenosine triphosphate) could reverse the binding action of glucagon to the cell receptor and thus dissociate the glucagon from the cell altogether. He then noted that traces of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) could reverse the binding process almost one thousand times faster than ATP. Rodbell deduced that GTP was probably the active biological factor in dissociating glucagon from the cell's receptor, and that GTP had been present as an impurity in his earlier experiments with ATP. This GTP, he found, stimulated the activity in the guanine nucleotide protein (later called the G-protein), which, in turn, produced profound metabolic effects in the cell. This activation of the G-protein, Rodbell postulated, was the \\"second messenger\\" process that Earl W. Sutherland had theorized. In the language of signal transduction, the G-protein, activated by GTP, was the principal component of the transducer, which was the crucial link between the discriminator and the amplifier. Later, Rodbell postulated, and then provided evidence for, additional G-proteins at the cell receptor that could inhibit and activate transduction, often at the same time. In other words, cellular receptors were sophisticated enough to have several different processes going on simultaneously. =Rodbell's personal philosophy of science= He concluded his formal written Nobel Lecture with this poem:Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1994, by Martin Rodbell > To my Friends:Thoughts from “On High” Life on a roller coaster, oscillating > from hither to yon, no respite for the iconoclast, wandering from dusk to > dawn. Conjuring strange thoughts foreign and twice forbidden, like > Prometheus unbound, this Nobelist climbs in vain to Andean peaks, seeking > what most would proclaim insane. Why, he ponders, are there no answers to > protean questions when others thinking cleanly and simply with Occam’s sharp > razor proclaim what seems obvious given the beam of their unerring laser. > Nature, happily unfettered with philosophy, or with cunning, or with intent > moves relentlessly onward or even backward with energy unspent while we > mortals test and probe with twinkling machines blinking precisely at each > movement, striving to unravel its irresolute randomness, its fathomless, > unlimited, meaningless rush into spiraling chaos, oblivious of its > multitudinous trials & errors which we pontifically believe must be unerring > truth & resolution. The laugh is on those who, burdened with pretensions of > truth, believe they can fathom within 15 minutes of human existence what has > transpired over eons of space and time in this Universe . So, I extol the > intuitions encapsulated in the folds of my mind from whence occasionally > they hurtle to the forebrain and in a twinkling of a proton’s discharge > bring to fruition a thought, an idea borne on the feathery appendages of > teeming neurons wedded in a seamless synergy. Those fleeting moments are > cherished as are those precious impulses imparted by the innumerable > individuals who nurtured and instilled unknowingly their encrypted thoughts > in mine. So, with these fanciful thoughts in mind I give praise to you - my > friends, my colleagues, my soul-mates, my loved ones - for letting my soul > and thoughts meander hither and yonder in this attempt at philosophy and > poetry. We now belong to the Gods on high who praise us for our frailties > and our achievements.

Biography Potts is originally from Perth, and from a hip hop background, prior to playing drums in 1988. He played in several bands in Perth, including Thou Gideon and Manic Pizza, before re-locating to Melbourne in 1992. In 1994 Potts joined with Gareth Edwards to form Sandro with Edwards on guitar and vocals and Nick Carroll on bass.Oz Music Project – Australian Music Resource and WebzineOz Music Project – Australian Music Resource and WebzineAustralian Music Online :: Artists :: Sandro Sandro released its first album, Live by Rivers in November 1996, which was followed by tours with Palace Brothers, Dirty Three and Smog later releasingHate Songs in 1997. The album attracted significant national airplay from Triple J, press in Rolling Stone and Juice and national airplay for the \\"Rainy Season\\" clip on Rage, Channel V and MTV. After a tour of the United States built around the completion of Sandro's third album, The Flux, Potts left the band playing his last show with them in New York. Returning home, He then went on to join Ninetynine, which was initially established as a solo side project by Sleater Kinney drummer Laura Macfarlane and Rhonda Simmonds. They recorded the band's second album, 767, with Simmonds on bass; Potts and Macfarlane sharing drums, vibraphone, and Casiotone keyboards; and Macfarlane on guitars, vocals, and xylophone. Simmonds left to join Origami and was replaced by Iain McIntyre and Michelle Mansford. A 75 date tour of the US, Canada and Europe followed, and with this lineup they recorded the album, 180°, in 2000. Mansford left after another long international tour in late 2001 and replaced by Amy Clarke (Formerly of Vivian Girls). The band recorded with Producer Lindsey Gravina (Magic Dirt) releasing The Process in 2002. They also that year released a compilation of rarities and odd 7\\" B-Sides, Anatomy of Distance.Oz Music Project – Australian Music Resource and Webzine Following this was another long tour of Europe and Japan. Clarke left Ninetynine in 2006 after the issue of 'Worlds of Space, Worlds of Population, Worlds of Robots' and was replaced by Meg Butler, with further touring to the US, Canada and Mexico, including a recording session at Motown in Detroit. On his third trip to Egypt in 2001, he acquired his first violin , an event that eventually led to the formation of Baseball, a Middle East influenced fusion band.Australian Music Online :: Artists :: BaseballCuba Is Japan During a stint in Scotland he met Monika Fikerle (Love of Diagrams)in November 2002 and with bassist, Steve Begovich, they toured Europe, Scandinavia and Japan. After returning from overseas, the group began recording their first album, Gods and Stars, Priests and Kings, with new bassist and keyboardist, Yoshi Araki in mid-2003. In November of that year, Baseball returned to Europe with Love of Diagrams, playing 28 shows across eleven countries, finishing in Osaka, Japan. Araki was not allowed re- entry into Australia and so Baseball underwent the line up change in early 2005 that would cement the foundings for the rest of their career. Ben Butcher joined to play guitar (ex Jihad Against America) and Evelyn Morris joined on drums (Pikelet/True Radical Miracle) Now a four piece with Monika switching from Piano Accordion to bass, and Potts solely on violin and vocals, they were invited to play at the Hohaiyan Rock Concert in Taiwan with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and released an EP, Taiwan/Japan Tour EP in 2005. In 2007, the group recorded \\"Animal Kingdom\\" at Head Gap in Melbourne and then undertook an extensive self-funded tour of Europe, taking in Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia, before heading into Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK. 2008 finally saw the release of the band's second album, Animal Kingdom, and three separate national tours followed. One with The Mountain Goats, another with Snowman and their own set of dates to launch the album. Original guitarist Steve Begovich died from MS complications in 2008 and by the start of 2009, the band Began to focus on other projects with Potts forming Cuba is Japan, Fikerle performing with Love of Diagrams and Morris with Pikelet. In 2011 Baseball played their first show in three years, a fundraiser for Japan earthquake victims in Melbourne.

Her murder case was named , due to her body being discovered in a concrete drum. The abuse was mainly perpetrated by four teenage boys, Hiroshi Miyano (宮野 裕史), Jō Ogura (小倉 譲), Shinji Minato (湊 伸治), and Yasushi Watanabe (渡邊 恭史). Approximately 100 people knew about Furuta's captivity, but either neglected to report it or themselves were involved in the torture and murder. Most of the perpetrators were friends of the teenage boys, who were low-ranking members of the yakuza.  Background  Furuta was born in Misato, Saitama Prefecture. As a teenager, she attended Yashio-Minami High School and worked part-time during after-school hours. She lived with her parents, her elder brother, and her younger brother. Prior to her abduction, she had accepted a job at an electronics retailer, where she planned on working after graduation. Furuta was a serious student in high school, with high grades and very infrequent absences. She had been working part-time at a plastic molding factory twice a week since October 1988 to save up money for a graduation trip she had planned. On the day of her abduction, she was said to have been looking forward to the final episode of a Japanese drama series, .  Crime  On 25 November 1988, Miyano and his friend Nobuharu Minato wandered around Misato with the intention of robbing and raping local women. At 8:30 pm, they spotted Furuta cycling home after she finished her part-time job. Under Miyano's orders, Minato kicked Furuta off her bicycle and immediately fled the scene. Miyano, under the pretense of it being a coincidence that he had witnessed this attack, approached Furuta and offered to walk her home safely. Furuta, accepting this offer, was unaware that Miyano was leading her to a nearby warehouse, where he revealed his yakuza connections. Miyano threatened to kill her as he raped her in the warehouse and once again in a nearby hotel. From the hotel, Miyano called Minato and his other friends, Jō Ogura and Yasushi Watanabe, and bragged to them about the rape. Ogura reportedly asked Miyano to keep her in captivity in order to allow numerous people to sexually assault her. The group had a history of gang rape and had recently kidnapped and raped another girl who was released afterward. Around 3:00 AM, Miyano took Furuta to a nearby park, where Minato, Ogura, and Watanabe were waiting. They had learned her home address from a notebook in her backpack and told her that they knew where she lived, and that yakuza members would kill her family if she attempted to escape. She was overpowered by the four boys, and taken to a house in the Ayase district of Adachi, where she was gang-raped. The house, which was owned by Minato's parents, soon became their regular gang hangout. On 27 November, Furuta's parents contacted the police about their daughter's disappearance. In order to discourage further investigation, the kidnappers coerced her into calling her mother. She was forced to say that she had run away, but was safe and staying with a friend. Furuta was also forced to ask her mother to stop the police investigation into her disappearance. When Minato's parents were present, Furuta was forced to pose as the girlfriend of one of the kidnappers. They later dropped this pretence when it became clear that Minato's parents would not report them to the police. The Minatos stated that they did not intervene because they were aware of Miyano's yakuza connections and feared retaliation, and because their own son was increasingly violent towards them. Minato's brother was also aware of the situation, but did nothing to prevent it. Furuta was held captive in the Minato residence for 40 days, during which time she was abused, raped and tortured.https://president.jp/articles/amp/29649?page=1https://www.news- postseven.com/archives/20180830_750592.html?DETAIL&_gl=1*1z0yzrp*_ga*ZWZOODFkdHBBR0Z1dVdxb3NFeDlRclFObWFwUkNnY1pVQ0NESUVEYllvTkI0YXlxcXJSZlZXRHlnanVDeVlIVQ.. https://matome.naver.jp/m/odai/2135216420298176301 「週刊アサヒ芸能」1989年4月20日号, page 174-175https://smart-flash.jp/sociopolitics/49075/amp https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2018/09110800/?amp=1「FLASH」1989年18日4月号, page 5「FRIDAY」1989年21日4月, page 68 The group responsible also invited and encouraged their other yakuza friends to torment Furuta. It was later said that over 100 men had committed the rape and torture. According to their trial statements, the four of them raped her over 400 times, beat her, starved her, hung her from the ceiling and used her as a \\"punching bag\\", dropped barbells onto her stomach, forced her to eat live cockroaches and drink her own urine, forced her to masturbate in front of them, and forced her to dance and sing to songs while being beaten. They inserted foreign objects into her vagina and anus, including a lit light bulb and fireworks. They burned her vagina and clitoris with cigarettes and lighters, and her eyelids with hot wax. They also tore off her left nipple with pliers and pierced her breasts with sewing needles. Furuta was said to slip into unconsciousness because of the repeated assaults, leading them to dunk her head into a bucket of water each time to continue the torture. When her body was found, Oronamin C bottles were stuck up her anus and her face was unrecognizable. She was also found to be pregnant, despite the severe damage to her uterus.https://leisurego.jp/archives/324636/10 Some of the accomplices have been officially identified, including Tetsuo Nakamura and Koichi Ihara, who were charged with rape after their DNA was found on and inside the victim's body. Ihara was allegedly bullied into raping Furuta. After he left the Minato household, he told his brother about the incident. His brother subsequently told their parents, who contacted police. Two police officers were dispatched to the Minato house; however, they were informed that there was no girl inside. The police officers declined an invitation to look around the house, believing the invitation alone was sufficient proof that there was nothing untoward to be found. Both officers faced considerable backlash from the community. Had they indeed searched the house and located Furuta, her ordeal would have only lasted sixteen days and she may well have recovered from her injuries. The two officers were fired for failing to follow procedure. At the beginning of December, Furuta attempted to call the police. However, she was discovered by Miyano before she could say anything. When the police phoned back, Miyano informed them that the original emergency call was a mistake. As punishment for contacting the authorities, Furuta's attackers doused her legs and feet in lighter fluid and set them on fire. They also pushed a large bottle into her anus, causing severe bleeding. She reportedly went into convulsions. During their trial, they stated that they thought she was faking a seizure, so they set her on fire again. She survived these injuries and continued to be raped and tortured. Furuta is reported to have asked her captors on multiple occasions to \\"kill her and get it over with\\", but they refused. Instead, they forced her to sleep outside on the balcony during winter time and locked her in a freezer. One of the kidnappers told the court that her hands and legs were so badly damaged that it took her over an hour to drag herself downstairs to the toilet. Due to the severity of the torture, she eventually lost bladder and bowel control and was subsequently beaten for soiling the carpets. She was also unable to drink water or consume food and would vomit after each attempt, for which she received further beatings. The brutality of the attacks drastically altered Furuta's appearance. Her face was so swollen that it was difficult to make out her features. Her body was also severely crippled, giving off a rotting smell that caused the four boys to lose sexual interest in her. As a result, the boys kidnapped and gang-raped a 19-year-old woman who, like Furuta, was on her way home from work. On 4 January 1989, after losing a game of Mahjong, Hiroshi Miyano decided to vent his anger on Furuta. At this point, Furuta was barely alive. Out of frustration, the boys beat her with an iron barbell, kicked and punched her, and placed two short candles on her eyelids, burning them with the hot wax. They made her stand, and struck her feet with a stick. At this point, she fell onto a stereo unit and collapsed into a fit of convulsions. Since she was bleeding profusely, and pus was emerging from her infected burns, the four boys covered their hands in plastic bags, which were taped at the wrists. They continued to beat her and dropped an iron exercise ball onto her stomach several times. They poured lighter fluid onto her thighs, arms, face, and stomach and once again set her on fire. Furuta allegedly made attempts to put out the fire, but gradually became unresponsive. The attack reportedly lasted two hours. Furuta eventually succumbed to her wounds and died that day. Less than twenty-four hours after her death, Nobuharu Minato's brother called to tell him that Furuta appeared to be dead. Afraid of being penalized for murder, the group wrapped her body in blankets and shoved it into a travel bag. They then put her body in a 55-gallon (208 liter) drum and filled it with wet concrete. Around 8:00 pm, they loaded and eventually disposed the drum into a cement truck in Kōtō, Tokyo.\\"Rapist, Murderer Given 20-Year Sentence\\". The Daily Yomiuri. Sunday 13 July 1991. Page 2. Retrieved from LexisNexis on 29 September 2009. On 23 January 1989, Hiroshi Miyano and Jō Ogura were arrested for the gang-rape of the 19-year-old woman who they had kidnapped in December. On 29 March, two police officers came to interrogate them, as women's underwear had been found at their addresses. During the interrogation, one of the officers led Miyano into believing that police were aware of a murder committed by Miyano. Thinking that Jō Ogura had confessed to the crimes against Furuta, Miyano told the police where to find Furuta's body. The police were initially puzzled by the confession, as they had been referring to the murder of a different woman and her seven-year-old son that had occurred nine days prior to Furuta's abduction. That case remains unsolved to this day. The police found the drum containing Furuta's body the following day. She was identified via fingerprints. On 1 April 1989, Jō Ogura was arrested for a separate sexual assault, and subsequently re-arrested for Furuta's murder. The arrest of Yasushi Watanabe, Nobuharu Minato, and Minato's brother followed. Prosecution Despite the shocking brutality of their crime, the identities of the boys were sealed by the court as they were all considered to be juveniles at the time of the crime. Journalists from the Shūkan Bunshun (週刊文春) magazine discovered their identities, however, and published them. They stated that, given the severity of the crime, the accused did not deserve to have their right to anonymity upheld. All four boys pled guilty to \\"committing bodily injury that resulted in death\\", rather than murder. In July 1990, a lower court sentenced Hiroshi Miyano, the alleged leader of the crime, to 17 years in prison. He appealed his sentence, but Tokyo High Court judge Ryūji Yanase sentenced him to an additional three years in prison. The 20-year sentence is the second-highest sentence given in Japan before life imprisonment. He was 18 at the time of the murder. Miyano's mother reportedly sent Furuta's parents 50 million yen (US$425,000), after selling their family home. Miyano was denied parole in 2004. In January 2013, Miyano was re- arrested for fraud. Due to insufficient evidence, he was released without charge later that month. Nobuharu Minato, who originally received a four-to- six-year sentence, was re-sentenced to five-to-nine years by Judge Ryūji Yanase upon appeal. He was 16 at the time of the murder. Minato's parents and brother were not charged. Furuta's parents were dismayed by the sentences received by their daughter's killers and won a civil suit against the parents of Nobuharu Minato, in whose home the crimes were committed. After his release, Minato moved in with his mother. He has not worked since. In 2018, Minato was arrested again for attempted murder after beating a 32-year old man with a metal rod and slashing his throat with a knife.https://www.tokyoreporter.com/crime/junko-furuta-killer-again-on-trial- chaos-in-the-courtroom/amp/https://www.tokyoreporter.com/crime/junko-furuta- killer-arrested-for-attempted-murder-3-decades-later/amp/ Yasushi Watanabe, who was originally sentenced to three-to-four years in prison, received an upgraded sentence of five-to-seven years. He was 17 at the time of the murder. For his role in the crime, Jō Ogura served eight years in a juvenile prison before he was released in August 1999. He was 17 at the time of the murder. After his release, he is said to have boasted about his role in the kidnapping, rape and torture of Furuta. In July 2004, he was arrested for assaulting Takatoshi Isono, an acquaintance he thought his girlfriend may have been involved with. Ogura tracked Isono down, beat him, and shoved him into his truck. He drove him from Adachi to his mother's bar in Misato, where he allegedly beat Isono for four hours. During that time, Ogura repeatedly threatened to kill the man, telling him that he'd killed before and knew how to get away with it. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for the assault on Isono and has since been released. Ogura's mother allegedly vandalised Furuta's grave, stating that she had ruined her son's life. It has also been reported that Ogura had depleted his father's savings, money which was intended to be provided as restitution to Furuta's family, buying and consuming a number of luxury goods. The sentences were largely regarded as being far too light for the crimes committed, and all four individuals were protected by special provisions applied to individuals 18 years old and younger. During sentencing, the judge commented that \\"exceptionally grave and atrocious violence\\" had been inflicted upon the victim, and that Junko Furuta had been \\"murdered so brutally at the young age of 17, [that her] soul must be wandering in torment\\". Upon hearing the details of the brutal rape and torture, a spectator in the gallery fainted. Furuta's mother also reportedly had a mental breakdown, which required psychiatric treatment. Aftermath Junko Furuta's funeral was held on 2 April 1989. One of her friends' memorial address stated: > Jun-chan, welcome back. I have never dreamed that we would see you again in > this way. You must have been in so much pain ... so much suffering ... The > happi we all made for the school festival looked really good on you. We will > never forget you. I have heard that the headmaster has presented you with a > graduation certificate. So we graduated together – all of us. Jun-chan, > there is no more pain, no more suffering. Please rest in peace ... Furuta's intended future employer presented her parents with the uniform she would have worn in the position she had accepted. The uniform was placed in her casket. At her graduation, Furuta’s school principal presented her a high school diploma, which was given to her parents. The location near where Furuta's body was discovered has been developed since and is now Wakasu park. People around Hiroshi Miyano remembered he never forbade others from asking him about Furuta's murder. While talking about it, he was always playful and exultant, and acted as if it was none of his business. Thus, Shūkan Bunshun criticized him for being completely unrepentant. In popular culture At least three books have been written about the crime.渥美饒兒『十七歳、悪の履歴書- 女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件』作品社、2003年。. 門野晴子『女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件―彼女のくやしさがわかりますか?』おんな通信社編、社会評論社、1990年。 佐瀬稔『うちの子が、なぜ!―女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件』草思社、1990年。 .

Detail of Kala's head on over the niche at Jabung, East Java Batara Kala is the god of the underworld in traditional Javanese and Balinese mythology, ruling over it in a cave along with Setesuyara. Batara Kala is also named the creator of light and the earth. He is also the god of time and destruction, who devours unlucky people. He is related to Hindu concept of Kala, or time. In mythology, he causes eclipses by trying to eat the Sun or the Moon.  Origin myth  According to legend, Batara Kala is the son of Batara Guru (the Javanese version of Shiva). Batara Guru has a very beautiful wife named Dewi Uma (Parvati). One day Batara Guru, in a fit of uncontrolled lust, forced himself on Dewi Uma. They had sexual intercourse on top of his vahana Nandi, a divine cow. This behavior ashamed Uma, who cursed both of them so they appeared as fearsome and ugly ogres. This fierce form of Dewi Uma is also known in Hinduism as Durga. From this relationship, Batara Kala was born with the appearance of an ogre. Another origin story is that he was conceived when a drop of Shiva's semen was swallowed by a fish. Batara Kala is described as having an insatiable appetite and being very rude. He was sent by the devas to Earth to punish humans for their evil habits. However, Batara Kala was interested only in devouring humans to satisfy his appetite. Alarmed, the devas then recalled Batara Kala from the Earth. He later became ruler of the underworld, together with the goddess Setesuyara. Traditionally, Javanese people try to obtain his favor, as the god of time and destruction, to prevent misfortune, especially to children. Exorcism ceremonies, called ruwatan, are held for children born under \\"unlucky\\" circumstances, such as being born feet-first. This is to prevent such children from being devoured by Batara Kala. This ceremony usually includes a wayang (Javanese shadow puppets) performance and a selamatan feast.  Eclipse myth  In Javanese mythology, Batara Kala is the cause of the solar and lunar eclipses. As the god of darkness and the underworld, Batara Kala is the sworn enemy of the god of the Moon, Batara Candra and god of the Sun, Batara Surya. Sometimes he will try to devour the Sun or Moon, causing an eclipse. When this eclipse happens, Javanese villagers will try to save the Sun or Moon by offering sacrifices and banging lesung (traditional rice hulling equipment) or slit drums, to cause noise and make Batara Kala vomit. This is thought to release the Sun or Moon and stop the eclipse. Symbolism Simon Monbaron notes that Batara Kala symbolizes the negative effects of having sexual relations in a fit of passion. Batara Kala's negative aspects are described as a warning against the fate of all children born out of wedlock. Batara Kala's function, especially as a Kirtimukha, has been considered similar to Bhoma in Indian and Balinese Hinduism.

It provides the user with bearing and distance (slant-range or hypotenuse) to a ground or ship-borne station. It is a more accurate version of the VOR/DME system that provides bearing and range information for civil aviation. The DME portion of the TACAN system is available for civil use; at VORTAC facilities where a VOR is combined with a TACAN, civil aircraft can receive VOR/DME readings. Aircraft equipped with TACAN avionics can use this system for en route navigation as well as non-precision approaches to landing fields. The space shuttle is one such vehicle that was designed to use TACAN navigation but later upgraded with GPS as a replacement. The typical TACAN onboard user panel has control switches for setting the channel (corresponding to the desired surface station's assigned frequency), the operation mode for either transmit/receive (T/R, to get both bearing and range) or receive only (REC, to get bearing but not range). Capability was later upgraded to include an air-to-air mode (A/A) where two airborne users can get relative slant-range information. Depending on the installation, Air-to-Air mode may provide range, closure (relative velocity of the other unit), and bearing, though an air-to-air bearing is noticeably less precise than a ground-to-air bearing. A TACAN only equipped aircraft cannot receive bearing information from a VOR only station. History TACAN symbol on aeronautical charts The TACAN navigation system is an evolution of radio transponder navigation systems that date back to the British Oboe system of World War II. In the United States, many companies were involved with the development of TACAN for military aircraft. Hoffman Laboratories Div. of the Hoffman Electronics Corp.–Military Products DivisionMissiles and Rockets, July 20, 1959, v. 5, no. 30, p. 127. (now NavCom Defense Electronics)http://www.navcom.com/ NavCom Defense Electronics was a leader in developing the present TACAN system in the US starting in the late 1950s. Operation TACAN in general can be described as the military version of the VOR/DME system. It operates in the frequency band 960-1215 MHz. The bearing unit of TACAN is more accurate than a standard VOR since it makes use of a two-frequency principle, with 15 Hz and 135 Hz components, and because UHF transmissions are less prone to signal bending than VHF. The distance measurement component of TACAN operates with the same specifications as civil DMEs. Therefore, to reduce the number of required stations, TACAN stations are frequently co-located with VOR facilities. These co-located stations are known as VORTACs. This is a station composed of a VOR for civil bearing information and a TACAN for military bearing information and military/civil distance measuring information. The TACAN transponder performs the function of a DME without the need for a separate co-located DME. Because the rotation of the antenna creates a large portion of the azimuth (bearing) signal, if the antenna fails, the azimuth component is no longer available and the TACAN downgrades to a DME only mode. Accuracy A VORTAC installation in Germany; the TACAN antenna is the highest antenna in the center. Theoretically a TACAN should provide a 9-fold increase in accuracy compared to a VOR, but operational use has shown only an approximate 3-fold increase. Accuracy of the 135 Hz azimuth component is ±1° or ±63 m at 3.47 km. Accuracy of the DME portion must be or 3 percent of slant range distance, whichever is greater, per FAA 9840.1 1982. and FAA N8200.121 TACAN stations can provide distance up to 390 nautical miles. Modern TACANs are much more accurate. The requirement now is to have portable TACAN that is IFR certifiable, both station and portable systems. The latest modern version of TACAN has been tested and could be a feasible back-up to future Air traffic control systems and may even be integrated into systems for a seamless back up. Past TACANs have relied on high output power (up to 10,000 watts) to ensure good signal in space to overcome nulls present in antenna design and to provide their required 200 mile range. With the advancement of technology, antenna design has improved with higher gain antennas, much shallower nulls, and lighter construction. Now it's feasible to have a 200 nmi range with a 400 watt TACAN DME transmitter, making the TACAN package much smaller, more portable and more reliable (a decrease in power also reduces heat, which lengthens the life of electronics). On the first Space Shuttle flight, Capcom Joseph P. Allen reported up to the crew that their TACANs had locked onto the Channel 111 signals at St. Petersburg, FL at a range of 250 miles. TACAN is getting smaller: full TACAN coverage can now be provided in a system that can be carried on a single trailer weighing less than 4000 lbs, and set up by two people in less than an hour. TACAN Transceivers can now be as small as lunch boxes (with full coverage and range) and the antennas can be reduced from 800 pounds to less than 100 pounds. Benefits USS Raleigh (LPD-1) with a lightning rod extending above it Because the azimuth and range units are combined in one system it provides for simpler installation. Less space is required than a VOR because a VOR requires a large counterpoise and a fairly complex phased antenna system. A TACAN system theoretically might be placed on a building, a large truck, an airplane, or a ship, and be operational in a short period of time. An airborne TACAN receiver can be used in air-to-air mode, which allows two cooperating aircraft to find their relative bearings and distance. Drawbacks For military usage a primary drawback is lack of the ability to control emissions (EMCON) and stealth. Naval TACAN operations are designed so an aircraft can find the ship and land. There is no encryption involved, an enemy can simply use the range and bearing provided to attack a ship equipped with a TACAN. Some TACANs have the ability to employ a \\"Demand Only\\" mode wherein they will only transmit when interrogated by an aircraft on-channel. It is likely that TACAN will be replaced with a differential GPS system similar to the Local Area Augmentation System called JPALS. The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System has a low probability of intercept to prevent enemy detection and an aircraft carrier version can be used for autoland operations. Some systems used in the United States modulate the transmitted signal by using a 900 RPM rotating antenna. Since this antenna is fairly large and must rotate 24 hours a day, it can cause reliability issues. Modern systems have antennas that use electronic rotation (instead of mechanical rotation) with no moving parts. Future Like all other forms of ground-based aircraft radio navigation currently used, it is likely that TACAN will eventually be replaced by some form of space-based navigational system such as GPS.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 3, 2004. In the episode, a Wall-Mart is built in South Park, and the people start to get addicted to shopping from it, due to its irresistibly attractive bargains, thus leading many businesses in South Park to close down. The four boys have to fight against Wall-Mart and to find a way to stop it from taking over the entire town. Its title and theme were inspired by the 1983 Disney movie Something Wicked This Way Comes based on the 1962 novel by Ray Bradbury. Plot The episode begins with Cartman betting Kyle five dollars that when people die they \\"crap their pants\\". Kyle says it is a stupid idea. In the meantime, a Wall-Mart opens in South Park (where Stark's Pond used to be) with much fanfare and everyone in town starts shopping there. Cartman is especially delighted that one can buy three copies of Timecop for $18 instead of just one for $9.98, though Kyle wonders why one would need three copies of the same movie. The popularity of Wall-Mart forces the local businesses to shut down, including Jim's Drugs, within minutes of Kyle's declaration that he will now take all his personal shopping there. Local residents, including Stan's father Randy, soon start to work at Wall-Mart for minimum wage and an extra 10% employee discount on store purchases which according to Randy, evens out the wage. South Park turns into a ghost town, and the townspeople decide they no longer want the Wall-Mart in South Park. They fail to resist, as they start to miss the bargains (Randy's frenzied case of impulse buying notably re-opens at dinner the first day after the self- imposed ban when Stan accidentally breaks his milk glass), so they (in the form of a vigilante mob) ask the Wall-Mart manager to have the location shut down. Terrified, he asks them to meet him outside in five minutes. As the people stop outside his office, the manager is thrown through the office window in an apparent suicide by hanging, and then voids his bowels (to the viewer, the force of defecation is so strong that his pants are blown off). Cartman gleefully tells Kyle he owes him $5. The townspeople burn the building down, only to see it rebuilt. A man rebuilding the Wall-Mart tells Kenny, Kyle and Stan that the rebuilding order came from Wall-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Stan and his friends arrange a bus trip to Bentonville, Arkansas to stop the Wall-Mart, but are joined by Cartman, whom the Wall-Mart subliminally told to stop them. Though none of the boys trust him (Kyle knows for a fact that Cartman is secretly against them), they are in a hurry to leave. They then reach Bentonville, despite Cartman's sabotage (slashing the tires of the bus they travel on), and talk to Harvey Brown, the current president of Wall-Mart, who is remorseful of all the damage it's done, since he is one of the founders. The boys ask him how they can stop it, and he tells them they need to find and destroy its \\"heart\\". As the boys leave, Brown tells them to tell the world \\"I'm sorry\\" and, despite Stan urging him not to, commits suicide by shooting himself in the head; he, like the manager, then voids his bowels with enough force that it blows a hole in his pants and tips over a nearby barstool. Cartman again laughs that Kyle now owes him $10. The boys return home to the still-dilapidated South Park. Dressed in camouflage, they try to re-enter South Park Wall-Mart but Cartman confronts them. He denies that they knew he was against them, but Kyle angrily begins yelling at him that he knew Cartman was against them all along, while Cartman continues to talk about why he was against them. Kenny is then assigned to hold Cartman off while Stan and Kyle enter the Wall-Mart. In the television department, the boys are confronted by a man who says he is Wall-Mart, a reference to the film The Matrix Reloaded. He says that he can take \\"many forms\\" although he only puts on different costumes. After confusing philosophical dialogue clichés, he finally tells the boys that the heart \\"lies beyond that plasma screen television\\". The boys walk over to find it is just a small rectangular mirror, but ignore the metaphor of the true heart of Wall-Mart being human desire and simply smash it to \\"destroy the heart\\", in which Kyle does with a black mallet. The building begins to shake, and the Wall-Mart then begins to fall apart, while the man says they will see him in his \\"true form\\". However, he does no more than rip off his mustache and jump around. The boys and everyone else inside the Wall-Mart evacuate and gather with other townsfolk in the parking lot, and see the Wall-Mart fold in on itself in a blinding flash of light (in the same way as the Freeling house in Poltergeist), then, inexplicably, crap its pants (shown as the imploding building suddenly releasing a large amount of fecal matter), upon which Cartman laughs loud and hard once again and leaves the scene. Everyone cheers because Kyle tells everyone that all of these places have a self-destruct sequence if they break a mirror in the back. Chef tells a soldier to spread the word to all the towns on how to destroy these places, in reference to a scene from the film Independence Day. Randy then announces that the Wall-Mart's \\"heart\\" was their desires the whole time. Oblivious to the fact that the boys consider this obvious, Randy explains pedantically how the residents of South Park had allowed their consumerism to work against them and nearly destroy their cherished small-town charm. Realizing their mistake -- albeit only on the surface -- the townspeople loyally return to shopping at Jim's Drugs, which is shown to gradually grow larger until it reaches a Wall-Mart wholesale fashion and is later being burned down itself. Watching it burn, the townspeople vow not to shop there again, and they immediately head to the local True Value (no doubt to repeat the same mistake). Home release \\"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

It is a derivative from Shiva-Hinduism Ananta Shesha combined with Javanese animism. After the fall of the kingdom of Majapahit and the ascent of Islam in Java, the centre for Hinduism shifted to Bali. These days many of the old myths and legends are celebrated in the wayang performance that became a vehicle to combine the syncretic philosophies from outside with those philosophies and ideas already rooted within the local cultures and traditions. At the beginning of time, only Antaboga existed. Antaboga meditated and created the world turtle Bedawang from which all other creations sprang.

December 9, 1508 - May 25, 1555) was a Dutch physician, mathematician, cartographer, philosopher, and instrument maker. He created important globes, improved the mathematical instruments of his day and applied mathematics in new ways to surveying and navigation. Gemma's rings are named after him. Along with Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, Frisius is often considered one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of cartography and significantly helped lay the foundations for the school's golden age (approximately 1570s–1670s). Biography Frisius was born in Dokkum, Friesland (present-day Netherlands), of poor parents who died when he was young. He moved to Groningen and later studied at the University of Leuven (Louvain), Belgium, beginning in 1525. He received the degree of MD in 1536 and remained on the faculty of medicine of Leuven for the rest of his life where, in addition to teaching medicine, he also taught mathematics, astronomy and geography. His oldest son, Cornelius Gemma, edited a posthumous volume of his work and continued to work with Ptolemaic astronomical models. Gemma Frisius's famous 1536 terrestrial globe. The green area is Madagascar. One of his most influential teachers at Leuven was Franciscus Monachus who, circa 1527, had constructed a famous globe in collaboration with the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der HeydenThere is no English biography of Van der Heyden (or Gaspar a Myrica c1496—c1549) but he has an entry in the Dutch Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek. Under the guidance of Monachus and the technical assistance of Van der Heyden, Frisius set up a workshop to produce globes and mathematical instruments which were praised for their quality and accuracy by contemporary astronomers such as Tycho Brahe. Of particular fame were the terrestrial globe of 1536 and the celestial globe of 1537. On the first of these Frisius is described as the author with technical assistance from Van der Heyden and engraving by Gerardus Mercator who was a pupil of Frisius at the time. On the second globe Mercator is promoted to co-author. Gemma Frisius's famous 1533 diagram introducing the idea of triangulation into the science of surveying. In 1533, he described for the first time the method of triangulation still used today in surveying (see diagram). Having established a baseline, e.g., in this case, the cities of Brussels and Antwerp, the location of other cities, e.g. Middelburg, Ghent etc., can be found by taking a compass direction from each end of the baseline, and plotting where the two directions cross. This was only a theoretical presentation of the concept -- due to topographical restrictions, it is impossible to see Middelburg from either Brussels or Antwerp. Nevertheless, the figure soon became well known all across Europe. Twenty years later, in ~1553, he was the first to describe how an accurate clock could be used to determine longitude. Jean-Baptiste Morin (1583-1656) did not believe that Frisius' method for calculating longitude would work, remarking, \\"I do not know if the Devil will succeed in making a longitude timekeeper but it is folly for man to try.\\" In the event it took two centuries before John Harrison produced a sufficiently accurate clock. Gemma's rings. See Commons annotations. Frisius created or improved many instruments, including the cross-staff, the astrolabe, and the astronomical rings (also known as \\"Gemma's rings\\").

Established in 1985 after a constitutional crisis in the National Union of Mineworkers, the UDM was given its certification on 6 December 1985, although it had effectively been in existence since the Nottinghamshire area of the NUM voted to secede from the federal union on 6 July 1985. After the events of the strike in 1984-5, the Nottinghamshire area of the NUM was involved in a number of disputes with the National Executive Committee that led to a ballot in May on empowering the Nottingham Area Committee to disassociate from the NUM. In ballots on 18 and 19 October on joining with Nottinghamshire in a new union, the South Derbyshire area of the NUM voted in favour by 51% and the Colliery Workers and Allied Trades Association (based mostly in Durham) voted in favour by almost 100%. The Nottinghamshire Miners' Association initially remained within the National Union of Mineworkers with elected officers including Roy Lynk and Neil Greatrex, later the General Secretary of the UDM. In 1992, The Independent newspaper reported that officials from the UDM had advised ministers on how to cut miners' power – including attempting to weaken the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS). The UDM was widely criticised in March 2004 after it was revealed that its top two officials received pay and benefits of over £150,000 each, despite membership having fallen to 1,431. On 3 April 2012, former president Neil Greatrex was found guilty of fraud from a miners' welfare fund. In 2013 the UDM announced plans to sell its headquarters; however, the union spokesman insisted there was no suggestion of winding the union up.

Fort McIntosh was established on 3 March 1849 by the 1st US Infantry, under the command of Lt. E.L. Viele,Texas Historical Marker # 5479001996 to guard the Texas frontier at the site of a strategic river crossing. Originally named Camp Crawford, the fort was renamed Fort McIntosh in 1850 in honor of Lieutenant Colonel James Simmons McIntosh, a hero in the Battle of Molino del Rey during the Mexican–American War. The fort was abandoned by Federal troops at the outbreak of the American Civil War. The Battle of Laredo took place near the fort on March 19, 1864, when seventy-two men repelled three attacks from a force of two hundred Federal soldiers sent from Brownsville, Texas. On October 23, 1865, the post was re-occupied by federal troops of the 2nd Texas Cavalry. In the late 19th century, Several African American units among them the Tenth Cavalry, the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\", were stationed at Fort McIntosh. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Fort Stockton, Fort Davis, Fort Bliss, McKavett, Clark, Richardson, Fort Inge and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 48 There were \\"sub posts or intermediate stations\\" including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.Carter, p. 49 During World War I, the fort was used as a training base and saw over 15,000 recruits pass through the gates. During World War II, the 8th Service Command, the 56th Cavalry Brigade, the Southern Land Frontier, the Civil Air Patrol, and battalion of military police all were stationed at the facility at one time or another.

Air density decreases with increasing temperature and altitude. The reduced density reduces the performance of the aircraft's engine and also provides less lift, requiring a higher speed to lift the plane off the ground. Aviators gauge air density by calculating the density altitude.https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/library/documents/2011/Aug/56396/FAA%20P-8740-02%20DensityAltitude[hi- res]%20branded.pdf An airport may be especially hot or high, without the other condition being present. Temperature and pressure altitude can change from one hour to the next. The fact that temperature decreases as altitude increases mitigates the \\"hot and high\\" effect to a small extent. Negative effects of reduced engine power due to hot and high conditions * Airplanes require a longer takeoff run, potentially exceeding the amount of available runway. * Reduced take-off power hampers an aircraft's ability to climb. In some cases, an aircraft may be unable to climb rapidly enough to clear terrain surrounding a mountain airport. * Helicopters may be forced to operate in the shaded portion of the height-velocity diagram in order to become airborne at all. This creates the potential for an uncontrollable descent in the event of an engine failure. * In some cases, aircraft have landed at high-altitude airports by taking advantage of cold temperatures only to become stranded as temperatures warmed and air density decreased. * While unsafe at any altitude, an overloaded aircraft is much more dangerous under hot and high conditions. Improving hot and high performance Some ways to increase aircraft performance in hot and high conditions include: * Reduce aircraft weight. Weight can be reduced by carrying only enough fuel to reach the (lower- altitude) destination rather than filling the tanks completely. In some cases, unnecessary equipment can be removed from the aircraft. In many cases, however, the only practical way to adequately reduce aircraft weight is to depart with a smaller passenger, cargo, or weapons load. Consequently, hot and high conditions at the originating airport may prevent a commercial aircraft from operating with a load large enough to be profitable, or may constrain the firepower that a combat aircraft can bring to bear when conducting a long- range airstrike. * Increase engine power. More powerful engines can improve an airplane's acceleration and reduce its takeoff run. More powerful engines are generally larger and heavier and use more fuel during cruise, however, increasing the fuel load needed to reach the same destination. The added weight of the fuel and engines may negate the potential performance gain, and the added cost of the extra fuel may constrain the profitability of a commercial aircraft. On the other hand, replacing an older, less efficient engine with a newer engine of more advanced design can increase both power output and efficiency while sometimes even decreasing weight. In this situation, the only real disadvantage is the cost of the upgrade. * Utilize assisted take off devices, such as rockets, to increase acceleration and rate of climb. * Inject distilled water into the engine compressor or combustor. The primary purpose of water injection into jet engines is to increase the mass being accelerated, thereby increasing the force created by the engine. A secondary purpose is to lower the combustion temperature so that higher power settings may be used without causing engine temperatures to exceed limits. Jet or rocket assisted take off Auxiliary rockets and/or jet engines can help a fully loaded aircraft to take off within the length of the runway. The rockets are usually one-time units that are jettisoned after takeoff. This practice was common in the 1950s and 60s, when the lower levels of thrust from military turbojets was inadequate for takeoff from shorter runways or with very heavy payloads. It is now seldom used. Auxiliary jets and rockets have rarely been used on civil aircraft due to the risk of aircraft damage and loss of control if something were to go wrong during their use. Boeing did, however, produce a version of its popular Boeing 727 with JATO primarily for \\"hot and high\\" operations out of Mexico City Airport (MMMX) and La Paz, Bolivia. The boosters were located adjacent to the main landing gear at the wing root on each side of the aircraft. Specialized aircraft Several manufacturers of early jet airliners offered variants optimized for hot and high operations. Such aircraft generally offered the largest wings and/or the most powerful engines in the model lineup coupled with a small fuselage to reduce weight. Some such aircraft include: * The BAC One-Eleven 475 combined the short body of the series 400 with the more powerful engines and improved wings of the series 500. This aircraft also featured stronger landing gear for rough field operations. * The Boeing 707–220, which was a 707–120 airframe fitted with more powerful Pratt & Whitney JT4A engines, civilian versions of the military J75. The 707-220 had extremely high fuel consumption, and only 5 were built, all for Braniff International Airways. The 707-220 was rendered redundant by the release of the turbofan-powered 707-120B, which had even greater power along with much lower fuel consumption. *The Convair 880. Although Convair only offered one configuration of this aircraft, it had more power and a smaller fuselage than its competitors from Boeing and Douglas. Convair essentially wagered the success of the entire 880 model line on the appeal of an aircraft optimized for hot and high operations. The wager failed; only sixty-five 880s were sold and Convair's nascent airliner business soon collapsed. *The De Havilland Canada Dash 8-200, which is a -100 airframe fitted with larger engines of the -300 for hot and high operations. They proved successful and eventually replaced the -100 production line. * The Lockheed L-1011-200, which was otherwise an L-1011-100 with more powerful RB.211-524B engines. * The McDonnell Douglas DC-9-20, which combined the smaller fuselage of the DC-9-10 with the larger wings and more powerful engines of the DC-9-30, and was significantly outsold by both. * The McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15, which combined the fuselage of the DC-10-10 with the larger engines of the DC-10-30. These were specifically designed for and sold to Aeromexico and Mexicana. Only seven were built. * The Vickers VC10, which was designed to meet BOAC requirements for a large airliner that could operate medium range flights from short runways in southern Asia and Africa. The rear- mounted engines gave a more efficient wing and made them less vulnerable to runway debris. The resulting high fuel consumption compared to the contemporary Boeing 707 prompted all other major airlines to dismiss the VC10. * The McDonnell Douglas MD-82 was a hot and high version of the MD-80, and sold well, which generally is extremely rare for a type of performance- specialised aircraft The marketing failure of these airplanes demonstrated that airlines were generally unwilling to accept reduced efficiency at cruise and smaller ultimate load-carrying capacity in return for a slight performance gain at particular airports. Rather than accepting these drawbacks, it was easier for airlines to demand the construction of longer runways, operate with smaller loads as conditions dictated, or simply drop the unprofitable destinations. Furthermore, as the second generation of jet airliners began to appear in the 1970s, some aircraft were designed to eliminate the need for a special \\"hot and high\\" variant – for instance, the Airbus A300 can perform a 15/0 takeoff, where the leading edge slats are adjusted to 15 degrees and the flaps kept retracted. This takeoff technique is only used at hot and high airports, for it enables a higher climb limit weight and improves second segment climb performance. Most jetliner manufacturers have dropped the \\"hot and high\\" variants from their model lineups.

He was the younger brother of Vincent van Gogh, and Theo's unfailing financial and emotional support allowed his brother to devote himself entirely to painting. Theo died at the age of 33, six months after his brother died at the age of 37. Theo is widely known for his influence on his brother; however, this often overshadows the significant impact that Theo made on the art world as a renowned art dealer: Theo played a crucial role in the introduction of contemporary Dutch and French art to the public.

He was the son of Theodorus van Gogh and Anna Cornelia Carbentus. His elder brother was artist Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890). =Business= Theo worked for some years at the Dutch office of the Parisian art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. Theo joined the Brussels office on 1 January 1873 as their youngest employee. After Theo was transferred to the London office, he moved to the office in The Hague, where he developed into a successful art dealer. By 1884, he was transferred to the Paris main office. Beginning in the winter of 1880–1881, he sent painting materials as well as monthly financial support \\"The Letters of Vincent\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, November 1, 1998 to his brother and painter Vincent van Gogh, who was then living in the Netherlands. =Private life= In Paris, Theo met Andries Bonger and his sister Johanna. He married Johanna in Amsterdam on 17 April 1889 and they moved to Paris. Their son Vincent Willem was born in Paris on 31 January 1890. On 8 June, the family visited Vincent, who was living near Paris in Auvers-sur-Oise. Vincent died in July 1890 at age 37. Theo suffered from dementia paralytica, an infection of the brain, and his health declined rapidly after Vincent's death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died six months later (25 January 1891) at age 33 in Den Dolder. Theo's great-grandson, also named Theo van Gogh, was a controversial film director, who was murdered on the streets of Amsterdam in 2004 by an Islamic extremist after making a short film critical of Islam.\\"Gunman kills Dutch film director\\". BBC (2 November 2004). retrieved 21 July 2009 Relationship with Vincent This 1887 portrait, by Vincent van Gogh, was long thought to be a self-portrait, but was reassessed in 2011 to be one of his brother Theo van Gogh. Theo admired his elder brother Vincent for his whole life, but communicating with him proved to be difficult, even before Vincent opted to follow his artistic vocation. The communication between both brothers suffered from diverging definitions of standards, and it was evidently Theo who kept on writing letters. Vincent is known to have not kept the letters Theo sent; on the other hand, Theo kept every scrap of correspondence from his brother (651 letters addressed to Theo in total). Therefore, mostly Vincent's answers survived and few of Theo's. (32 letters from Theo to Vincent remain) Theo was often concerned about Vincent's mental condition and he was amongst the few who understood his brother. It is known that Theo helped Vincent maintain his artist lifestyle by giving him money. He also helped Vincent pursue his life as an artist through his unwavering emotional support and love. The majority of Theo's letters and communications with Vincent are filled with praise and encouragement. Vincent would send Theo sketches and ideas for paintings, along with accounts of his day to day experiences, to the delight and eager attention of Theo.\\"Vincent van Gogh(Dutch Painter)\\" . Britannica. Retrieved 25 September 2011. =Dealer and artist= While Theo is best known for being the brother of Vincent van Gogh and one of his major roles in art was his influence on Vincent's career, Theo himself made many important contributions. Theo played a vital role in the introduction of contemporary Dutch and French art to the public: Theo was instrumental in the popularity of Impressionist artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degas by persuading his employers, Goupil & Cie, to exhibit and buy their works.Rewald, Gazette des Beaux-Arts 1973 In 1886, Theo invited Vincent to live with him in Paris, and from March they shared an apartment in Montmartre. Theo introduced Vincent to Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri Rousseau, Camille Pissarro and Georges Seurat, and in 1888 he persuaded Gauguin to join Vincent, who had moved to Arles. Theo not only conspired with Vincent as the liaison between Vincent and Gauguin, but was the deciding factor in his move to Arles seeing as it was Theo Van Gogh who planned and eventually committed to supporting them both financially. (Letter 616, Monday 28 or Tuesday 29 May 1888). He paid for living and professional expenses as well as for the travel expenses Gauguin accumulated to get from Pont Aven, Brittany, to Arles. Theo was equally the one with whom Gauguin communicated when his relationship with Vincent turned volatile and unmanageable, notably the severing of the ear fiasco. Theo was the source of stability and the intermediate between the two artists and allowed them to create prolifically for a couple of months (63 days) ; paintings we would otherwise have been deprived of. (Letter 852). =Correspondence= The two brothers maintained an intensive correspondence, with Theo often encouraging his depressed brother. Theo was one of the few people who Vincent could talk to and confide in. These letters are one of the few sources of information about Vincent's life, providing detailed accounts of not only the occurrences but also the thoughts and feelings in Vincent's life. Over three-quarters of the more than 800 letters Vincent wrote during his life were to Theo, including his first and his last letters. It is largely thanks to Theo and his wife, Johanna, who, in 1914, decided to publish the letters between Theo and Vincent, that these letters are available to us today. Hardly any of Theo's letters remain because Vincent failed to keep them. It can also be noted that the two-year period where Vincent and Theo lived together in the neighborhood of Montmartre in Paris, is also the least documented period of Vincent's artistic career, because of the lack of letters exchanged between the two brothers. These letters witness both the emotional and professional state of Vincent throughout his life as early as 1874 and serve as a diary for his everyday encounters. The letters have been collected and published in book form as The Letters of Vincent van Gogh. The relationship between the two brothers was the subject of the movie Vincent & Theo (1990), directed by Robert Altman. It also formed an important part of the film Lust for Life (1956), which was directed by Vincente Minnelli. Theo was played by the British actor James Donald and Vincent by the Hollywood star Kirk Douglas. The delivery of Vincent's final letter to Theo after Vincent's death and the circumstances surrounding his death was the subject of the 2017 film Loving Vincent, which was animated by oil paintings made with Van Gogh's techniques. Death alt=Two graves and two gravestones side by side; heading behind a bed of green leaves, bearing the remains of Vincent and Theo van Gogh, where they lie in the cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The stone to the left bears the inscription: Ici Repose Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) and the stone to the right reads: Ici Repose Theodore van Gogh (1857–1891) Theo's health deteriorated in the months after the death of his brother. He was admitted to the Willem Arntz Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, in Den Dolder on 18 November 1890. He had been diagnosed in Paris as suffering from a progressive and general paralysis. Initial examination confirmed this diagnosis. By 1 December his medical notes confirmed he presented all the symptoms of dementia paralytica, a disease of the brain. He died on 25 January 1891. The cause of death was listed as dementia paralytica caused by \\"heredity, chronic disease, overwork, sadness\\". In 1914, Theo's body was exhumed from his resting place in Utrecht, Netherlands, and reburied with his brother at Auvers-sur-Oise at the wish of his widow, Johanna, so the brothers could lie together eternally.

El frío de una vida, Espasa-Calpe, 2004, p.69. . – 28 August 2007), better known as Francisco Umbral, was a Spanish journalist, novelist, biographer and essayist. Style Although he was born in Madrid, a city that has inspired most of his work, his early years were spent in Valladolid. His mother travelled to Madrid for his birth, because he was an illegitimate child. His mother's indifference and distance from him marked him with an enduring sadness, as did the infant death of his only son, from which event was born his saddest and most personal book, Mortal y rosa, (A Mortal Spring). This created in the author a characteristic haughty manner, devoid of hopefulness, absolutely submerged in literature, which has provoked many polemics and enmities. In Valladolid he began his journalistic career at El Norte de Castilla, under the tutorship of Miguel Delibes. In 1961 he went to Madrid as a correspondent and quickly became a prestigious reporter and columnist in magazines such as La Estafeta Literaria, Mundo Hispánico and Interviú, and in influential newspapers such as Ya and ABC, although he is best known for his writings for the daily newspapers El País (founded in 1976 just after the death of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and the restoration of constitutionalism and democracy) and El Mundo (founded 1990). At El País he was one of the reporters who best was able to describe the countercultural movement known as La Movida, but his literary quality undoubtedly came from his creative fecundity, his linguistic sensibility and the extreme originality of his style, very careful and complex, creative in its syntax, very metaphorically developed and flexible, abundant in neologisms and intertextual allusions; in sum, of a demanding lyric and aesthetic quality. He practices a species of anti-bourgeois criticism of customs and manners, without renouncing a romantic ego, and, in the words of Novalis, has the intent of giving the dignity of the unknown to the everyday, impregnating it with a desolate tenderness. As a political reporter, Umbral is a highly trenchant writer. Having become a successful journalist and writer, he worked with Spain's most varied and influential magazines and newspapers. Among the many published volumes of his articles, the following stand out: *Diario de un snob (\\"Diary of a snob\\", 1973) *Spleen de Madrid (\\"Madrid Spleen\\", 1973, the title being a reference to Charles Baudelaire's Paris Spleen) *España cañí (1975) *Iba yo a comprar el pan (\\"I went out to buy bread\\", 1976) *Los políticos (\\"Politicians\\", 1976) *Crónicas postfranquistas (\\"Post-Francoist Chronicles\\", 1976) *Las Jais (\\"Birds\\", \\"Chicks\\" [slang, i.e. \\"Girls\\"] 1977) *Spleen de Madrid-2 (\\"Madrid Spleen-2\\", 1982) *España como invento (\\"Spain as an invention\\", 1984) *La belleza convulsa (\\"Convulsive Beauty\\", 1985) *Memorias de un hijo del siglo (\\"Memories of a child of the century\\", 1986) *Mis placeres y mis días (\\"My pleasures and my days\\", 1994). Among non- readers, he is remembered by an appearance in Mercedes Milá's TV program Queremos saber in Antena 3 TV (1993). After some chatter, Umbral breaks conversation claiming that he has come to talk about his latest book, La década roja, not to entertain her«¡Yo he venido aquí a hablar de mi libro!», Darío Prieto, El Mundo, 29 August 2007.

Flowing from Northwest Russia and into the Arctic Ocean, it lies mostly in the Komi Republic but the northernmost part crosses the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. Geography Pechora River, light-colored Ural Mountains and part of the Ob River It is long (a little shorter than the Columbia River) and its basin is , or about the same size as Finland. By mean annual discharge it ranks third in Europe, after the Volga and Danube. Its discharge is about half that of the Danube and a little more than its sister, the Northern Dvina, and is the largest of any river with no dams in its basin outside of New Guinea. West of its lower course is the Timan Ridge. East of the basin along the west flank of the Urals is the Yugyd Va National Park. Also in the basin is the Virgin Komi Forests, the largest virgin forest in Europe. In the far northeast of the basin on the Usa River is the large coal center of Vorkuta. The river was once an important transportation route, especially for those travelling to northwest Siberia. Today a railroad runs southwest from Vorkuta to Moscow. =Along the Pechora= The river rises in the Ural Mountains in the south-eastern corner of the Komi Republic. This area is part of the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve. On the other side of the Urals are the headwaters of the Northern Sosva. The river flows south, then west and turns north near Yaksha which is the head of navigation for small boats. A portage led south to the Kama basin. To the east is the upper Vychegda, a tributary of the Northern Dvina. The river flows past Komsomolsk-na-Pechore to Ust-Ilych where the Ilych joins from the east, then Northwest to Troitsko-Pechorsk ( from the mouth), north to Vuktyl and Ust-Shchuger where the Shchugor joins from the east. The river then flows north to Pechora town, where the railway from Vorkuta crosses, then north to Ust-Usa where the Usa joins from the east (the Usa was once an important river route into Siberia). The Pechora then curves northwest, west, and west southwest. The Izhma joins from the south. It then flows further west to Ust-Tsilma ( from the mouth) where the Pizhma joins from the southwest and the Tsilma joins from the west. Before modern times people traveled up the Tsilma and portaged to the Pyoza to reach the White Sea. Then the Pechora turns north and crosses the arctic Arctic Circle and the border of the Nenets Okrug; Pustozyorsk; Naryan-Mar, the Nenets capital and a port at the head of the Pechora delta; Pechora Bay; Pechora Sea; and finally the Barents Sea. Hydrology The monthly average discharge of the river was recorded between 1981 and 1993 in the village of Oksino, located upstream from the mouth.

A project for a Pechora–Kama Canal along the same general route was widely discussed in the 1960s through 1980s, this time not as much for transportation, but for the diversion of some of the water of the Pechora to the Kama, as part of a grand Northern river reversal scheme. However, no construction work was carried out on the route of the proposed canal, other than a triple nuclear explosion in 1971, which excavated a crater over long. Literary reference The Pechora was the source of the name of Pechorin – protagonist of the 1839 novel A Hero of Our Time by Mikhail Lermontov, a well- known work of Russian literature.

It is called the Sandford Principle after Lord Sandford who chaired the National Parks Policy Review Committee which reviewed national parks of England and Wales in between 1971 and 1974. :\\"National Park Authorities can do much to reconcile public enjoyment with the preservation of natural beauty by good planning and management and the main emphasis must continue to be on this approach wherever possible. But even so, there will be situations where the two purposes are irreconcilable... Where this happens, priority must be given to the conservation of natural beauty.\\" (Lord Sandford, 1974) The two purposes of National Parks are, in short, #conservation of the natural environment and #access for the public. (Considering the economic and social well-being of the community is also a duty which was subsequently introduced and applies to more recently created parks). The purposes were amended by the Environment Act 1995. They are now, firstly, to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area and, secondly, to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the area by the public.Countryside recreation journal, 2002 Most of the time it is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by good management. Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the Sandford principle, the Environment Act 1995 sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks. The Sandford Principle is often misquoted as \\"conservation has priority over recreation\\"; however, importantly, it is better summarised as, \\"where those two purposes cannot be reconciled by skilful management, conservation should come first\\". The Sandford Principle was first used in UK National Park management, and is still most commonly encountered in that context. However, where this dilemma has occurred in the management of other sites where public pressure and wildlife conservation might be in conflict, the principle is sometimes cited. The impact of the Environment Act 1995 Key words in the 1974 National Parks Policy Review Committee report are “priority must be given to the conservation of natural beauty”. Although these words have been used in policy-making and decisions for many years, they were not a legal statement. When the principle was eventually translated into law in 1995, its interpretation and impact were subtly changed. The Environment Act 1995 s62 (1) (2) states: \\"In exercising or performing any functions in relation to, or so as to affect, land in a National Park, any relevant authority shall have regard to the purposes specified in subsection (1) of section five of this Act and, if it appears that there is a conflict between those purposes, shall attach greater weight to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area comprised in the National Park.\\" This wording enshrines in law the issue at the heart of the Sandford Principle, and hence, since 1995, consideration of the Sandford Principle has only been possible through the Environment Act. This is an important distinction because the Environment Act expresses the issue in more equitable terms by saying that the Authority shall attach ‘greater weight to the purpose of conserving....’ rather than the phrase ‘priority must be given’ as used by Sandford and which was more absolute and directly in favour of conservation. Use of the term ‘greater weight’ indicates clearly that evidence must be collected and weighed when deciding where public enjoyment might be considered a less desirable purpose than conservation. The word ‘purpose’ is significant in that it places a legal requirement on the Authority to consider and demonstrate why it is conserving and enhancing the natural beauty, rather than doing so for no particular reason or simply suggesting an arbitrary priority.

Tancred came from the house of Hauteville and had a great-grandfather with the same name. Biography =Early life= Tancred was a son of Emma of Hauteville and Odo the Good Marquis. His maternal grandparents were Robert Guiscard and Guiscard's first wife Alberada of Buonalbergo. Emma was also a sister of Bohemond I of Antioch. =First Crusade= In 1096, Tancred joined his maternal uncle Bohemond on the First Crusade, and the two made their way to Constantinople. There, he was pressured to swear an oath to Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, promising to give back any conquered land to the Byzantine Empire. Although the other leaders did not intend to keep their oaths, Tancred refused to swear the oath altogether. He participated in the siege of Nicaea in 1097, but the city was taken by Alexius' army after secret negotiations with the Seljuk Turks. Because of this, Tancred was very distrustful of the Byzantines. In 1097 the Crusaders divided their forces at Heraclea Cybistra and Tancred entered the Levant by passing south through the Cilician Gates. He displayed the skills of a brilliant tactician by seizing five of the most important sites in Cilicia Pedias, which included the ancient cities of Tarsus and Adana, the great emporium at Mopsuestia, and the strategic castles at Sarvandikar and Anazarbus. The last three settlements were annexed to the Principality of Antioch. During their fourteen-year occupation of Anazarbus the Crusaders built the magnificent donjon atop the center of the fortified outcrop. At Sarvandikar, which controlled the strategic Amanus Pass, Tancred imprisoned Raymond of Saint-Gilles in 1101/02.Matthew of Edessa, Recueil des historiens des croisades, Documents arméniens, vol. 1, reprint: Farnborough, 1967, p. 57. He assisted in the siege of Antioch in 1098. One year later, during the assault on Jerusalem, Tancred, along with Gaston IV of Béarn, claimed to have been the first Crusader to enter the city on July 15. However, the first crusader to enter Jerusalem was Ludolf of Tournai, and he was followed by his brother Englebert. When the city fell, Tancred gave his banner to a group of the citizens who had fled to the roof of the Temple of Solomon. This should have assured their safety, but they were massacred, along with many others, during the sack of the city. The author of the Gesta Francorum (Deeds of the Franks) records that, when Tancred realised this, he was \\"greatly angered\\". When the Kingdom of Jerusalem was established, Tancred became Prince of Galilee. =Regent of Antioch= In 1100, Tancred became regent of Antioch when Bohemond was taken prisoner by the Danishmends at the Battle of Melitene. He expanded the territory of the Latin principality by capturing land from the Byzantines, although, over the next decade, Alexius attempted, unsuccessfully, to bring him under Byzantine control. In 1104, he also took control of the County of Edessa when Baldwin II was taken captive after the Battle of Harran. After Baldwin's release in late 1108, he had to fight Tancred (probably early 1109) to regain control of the county; Tancred was eventually defeated and returned to Antioch. After Harran, Bohemond returned to Europe to recruit more Crusaders, again leaving his nephew as regent in Antioch. Tancred's victory over Radwan of Aleppo at the Battle of Artah in 1105 allowed the Latin principality to recover some its territories east of the Orontes River.Smail, p. 28 In 1108, Tancred refused to honour the Treaty of Devol, in which Bohemond swore an oath of fealty to Alexius, and for decades afterwards Antioch remained independent of the Byzantine Empire. In 1110, he brought Krak des Chevaliers under his control, which would later become an important castle in the County of Tripoli. Tancred remained regent in Antioch in the name of Bohemond II until his death in 1112 during a typhoid epidemic. He had married Cecile of France, but died childless. The Gesta Tancredi is a biography of Tancred written in Latin by Ralph of Caen, a Norman who joined the First Crusade and served under Tancred and Bohemond. An English translation was co- published in 2005 by Bernard S. Bachrach and David S. Bachrach. In fiction Nicolas Poussin's Tancred and Erminia (Hermitage Museum) Tancred appears as a character in Torquato Tasso's 16th-century poem Jerusalem Delivered, in which he is portrayed as an epic hero and given a fictional love interest, the pagan warrior-maiden Clorinda. He is also loved by the Princess Erminia of Antioch. Portions of Tasso's verses were set by Claudio Monteverdi in his 1624 dramatic work Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda. He also appears in one of the scenes in Imre Madách's The Tragedy of Man. In Tom Harper's Siege of Heaven he is depicted as a violent psychopath. His portrayal is similar although slightly more humorous in Alfred Duggan's novel Count Bohemond. Tancred also appears as one of the Crusade leaders in Sir Walter Scott's novel Count Robert of Paris who returned to Constantinople from Scutari to ensure a fair contest between Count Robert and his challenger. The novel Tancred, or the New Crusade by Benjamin Disraeli centres around the adventures of an imagined modern descendant and namesake of the Prince of Galilee. Rossini's opera Tancredi is based on Tasso, via Voltaire's play Tancrède of 1759.

Although credited by fellow legislators for showing brains and hard work in his first term in office, Ambler exhibited an independent streak that rubbed some conservatives the wrong way. One of them was House Speaker Johnnie Byrd (R-Plant City), whom Ambler challenged on medical malpractice reform. Ambler enjoyed a better with incoming House Speaker Allan Bense (R-Panama City), who raised funds for Ambler's re-election. \\"He's a very good lawyer, he's a very articulate speaker,\\" Bense said. \\"I think he has done a good job representing his constituents in Tampa.\\" =Legislative accomplishments= State Rep Kevin Ambler and Legislative Aide Mike Norris, with Maj. Gen. Emmett Titshaw On April 29, 2003, Kevin Ambler passed House Bill 1475, The Florida Uniformed Servicemembers Act (FUSPA). The FUSPA provides protections to members of the military who are deployed in the defense of the United States. The FUSPA addressed several areas of concern that the Legislature felt were necessary to protect Florida's military personnel. The FUSPA also amplified and provided additional protections to those provided by Federal law and expanded protections to include several areas not covered by Federal law. In 2004, Ambler created the \\"Ought to be a Law\\" (OTBAL) Student Legislation Program. The program was the first of its kind in the United States, offering high school students the opportunity to write, research, and present a real bill before the state legislature. Ambler created the program to give high school students real-life civics experience and allow those students to see how ideas are made into state law. Every year, students from around the Tampa Bay area present a legislative proposal addressing a specific need or problem to a panel of Hillsborough County legislators. Each bill presentation included information about funding, possible opposition and support, mandates and timelines. If an element was missing or an idea seemed unfeasible, the panel let students know. After the initial round of proposals, the panelists selected six of the student-drafted bills as finalists in the competition. Students vote for their favorite bill out of the finalists, after which Ambler and State Senator Victor Crist would file the legislation in their respective chambers. Selected students from the OTBAL program's Student Legislation Delegation presented the winning bill at each Committee stop in the Florida House and Florida Senate. On May 6, 2005, Ambler passed House Bill 1659, which prohibited the performing or inducement of a termination of pregnancy upon a minor without specified parental notice. In 2006, Ambler received the Outstanding Representative Award from the Florida Academy of Trial Lawyers. During the 2007 Legislative Session, the \\"Ought to be a Law\\" program made history when House Bill 1161 titled, The High School to Business Career Enhancement Act, passed the Legislature unanimously and was signed into law by Governor Charlie Crist. On March 31, 2008, Ambler and Hillsborough County Public Schools Board Members were honored with a first place award in the American School Board Journal's 14th annual Magna Awards program, held at the Peabody Hotel in Orlando. The Association recognized the program as one of the top new education initiatives in the United States. Hillsborough County Public Schools also received a $2 million PROJECT Elect grant for advancing civics education based on the program. In 2008, The Florida Bar named Ambler Legislator of the Year. In 2009, the Florida Justice Association awarded Ambler the Outstanding Representative Award. On April 28, 2010, Ambler passed House Bill 7181, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's (DJJ) Juvenile Justice Reform Bill. This legislation reformed Florida's juvenile justice system by providing greater access to rehabilitative options for troubled children, and addressed the over-representation of minority youth in the juvenile justice system, compared to the general population. On April 29, 2010, Ambler passed House Bill 1003. The bill removed the 10 percent disability threshold for Service Connected Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses to become state certified, bringing it more in line with federal certification requirements. The bill also clarified the existing Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs policy of admitting eligible peacetime veterans as well as eligible wartime veterans into Florida's State Veterans' Nursing Homes and Domiciliary Home. On April 30, 2010, the House and Senate unanimously passed Ambler's House Bill 697, the Entertainment Industry Incentive Bill into legislation. =2010 Florida Senate Primary Election= In 2010, Hillsborough County Commissioner Jim Norman filed to run against Ambler in the Florida Senate District 12 Primary Election. Norman had volunteered on Ambler's previous campaigns for the House District 47 seat and had expressed his intentions to run for the seat when Ambler reached term-limits. Instead, Norman filed to run against Ambler for the Senate seat at the last second. During the campaign, news broke that Norman had failed to disclose a $435,000 Arkansas vacation home \\"given\\" to his wife, Mearline, by Ralph Hughes. Hughes was the millionaire founder of Cast-Crete, pre-cast concrete products used in construction jobs around the county. The east Hillsborough County power broker benefitted over the years from the county's pro-development decisions and was a longtime friend of Norman. Mearline Norman used the \\"gift\\" to buy and renovate a lakefront house and two boats in Arkansas, which Norman failed to disclose on his financial disclosure forms. Norman claims he had nothing to do with the loan or the purchase of the home. Norman and his attorney failed to explain how Mearline, who is not employed, could buy a home. On July 28, 2010, Ambler received the endorsement of the Tampa Tribune \\"...ultimately, Ambler conveys a firmer grasp on the need to deal creatively with Florida's fiscal crisis. And Norman's failure to deal more openly with the Arkansas matter gives us pause. For the Florida Senate, District 12, the Tribune endorses Kevin Ambler.\\" On August 6, 2010, Ambler received the endorsement of the Saint Petersburg Times: \\"Ambler, was a solidly conservative voice in his eight years representing the greater Carrollwood area in the Florida House. The former federal prosecutor and judge advocate for the Air Force has a good grasp of statewide policy. He has sensible proposals for cutting the size of government, targeting tax incentives to attract high-paying jobs and improving the quality of teachers. Ambler would subject property insurers to much more rigorous review before they could raise rates, a key concern for a district that is highly vulnerable to hurricane and sinkhole damage. Salvation Army scandal Questions about Jim Norman's employment at the Salvation Army arose during the heated primary election campaign. The charity paid him $95,000 a year for work that Norman said is done largely on weekends and provided him with a car. During the 2010 Primary Election, Norman was photographed using the vehicle for political activity, jeopardizing the Salvation Army's tax exempt status. Salvation Army officials stated that donors are complained about Norman being on the charity's payroll. At least a dozen readers sent letters or e-mails to the Saint Petersburg Times expressing their disappointment in the charity's handling of the Norman issue. On August 24, 2010, Ambler lost to Norman by just under four thousand votes. Norman v. Ambler Kevin Ambler first disclosed Hughes' gift to Mearline Norman in a lawsuit seeking to overturn his August 2010 Republican Primary loss to Jim Norman. In the lawsuit, Ambler argued that Norman was not qualified to run, because he failed to disclose the \\"gift\\" for the Arkansas home on his state ethics forms. During the proceedings, the Normans testified that Mearline partnered with Hughes, who gave her money to buy and furnish a home. Norman insisted he didn't disclose the house because he doesn't own it and had no knowledge of his wife's partnership with Hughes. Jim Norman kicked off ballot During the October trial, Second Circuit Judge Jackie Fulford stated that she found Norman's explanation that he knew nothing about the house, \\"patently absurd,\\" and ordered him off the ballot. Former State Rep. Rob Wallace named to replace Norman on ballot As provided under state law, six Republican representatives from Hillsborough and Pasco counties selected the candidate to replace Norman on the 2010 General Election ballot, choosing former State Rep. Rob Wallace. Wallace served eight years in the Florida House from 1994-2002 and was succeeded by Ambler. 1st District Court of Appeal restores Norman to ballot Norman appealed Fulford's decision and a three-judge panel of the First District Court of Appeal reversed the lower court, placing Norman back on the ballot. During the appeal, the judge noted that Norman could still face perjury charges, but it is up to the Legislature to remove a candidate from the ballot based on a recommendation of the Commission of Ethics. After being reinstated, Norman won the general election against two write-in candidates. Despite the token opposition, however, 45,573 voters cast ballots for someone other than Norman. FBI and Grand Jury investigation After the story aired, the FBI and a Grand Jury began investigation of Norman. State Commission on Ethics investigation In response to the media coverage, ethics complaints were filed against Norman by Tampa attorney Paul Phillips and by Dover activist George Niemann. According to Phillips' complaint, Mrs. Norman had no obvious known source of income which would allow for the purchase of a $435,000 lake front home. Phillips' complaint claimed Ralph Hughes fronted the money and that it constituted either an unreported loan or unreported income. The Normans refused to release their income tax returns to clear the answer to that question. Phillips' complaint noted that the home was sold to the Normans by Ed Roleson, Jr. a now deceased former Miller Beer Co. distributor. The real estate transaction was conducted around the same time the Tampa Sports Authority (which Norman served on) approved a patio deck in the south end-zone of Raymond James Stadium for Miller Beer. Phillips alleged Norman's solely listing his wife on the title to the house was \\"done deliberately to conceal an obvious conflict of interest for Mr. Norman and illegal gift to him and/or his spouse.\\" =Electoral history= See also *Government of Florida *Florida State Capitol *Florida House of Representatives *Republican Party of Florida External links *Florida Legislature *https://www.followthemoney.org/  References  Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:People from California Category:Businesspeople from Tampa, Florida Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Florida Republicans Category:Florida lawyers Category:20th-century American politicians Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Stetson University faculty Category:American people of Scotch-Irish descent Category:American politicians with physical disabilities Category:Contestants on American game shows Category:United States Air Force officers Category:Cornell University alumni ","title":"Kevin Ambler"},{"id":"1127442","title":"Mohammed Burhanuddin"},{"id":"1127447","text":"A strategic group is a concept used in strategic management that groups companies within an industry that have similar business models or similar combinations of strategies. For example, the restaurant industry can be divided into several strategic groups including fast-food and fine-dining based on variables such as preparation time, pricing, and presentation. The number of groups within an industry and their composition depends on the dimensions used to define the groups. Strategic management professors and consultants often make use of a two dimensional grid to position firms along an industry's two most important dimensions in order to distinguish direct rivals (those with similar strategies or business models) from indirect rivals. Strategy is the direction and scope of an organization over the long term which achieves advantages for the organization while business model refers to how the firm will generate revenues or make money. Hunt (1972) coined the term strategic group while conducting an analysis of the appliance industry after he discovered a higher degree of competitive rivalry than suggested by industry concentration ratios. He attributed this to the existence of subgroups within the industry that competed along different dimensions making tacit collusion more difficult. These asymmetrical strategic groups caused the industry to have more rapid innovation, lower prices, higher quality and lower profitability than traditional economic models would predict. Michael Porter (1980) developed the concept and applied it within his overall system of strategic analysis. He explained strategic groups in terms of what he called \\"mobility barriers\\". These are similar to the entry barriers that exist in industries, except they apply to groups within an industry. Because of these mobility barriers a company can get drawn into one strategic group or another. Strategic groups are not to be confused with Porter's generic strategies which are internal strategies and do not reflect the diversity of strategic styles within an industry. Originally, the analysis of intra-industry variations in the competitive behaviour and performance of firms was based primarily on the use of secondary financial and accounting data. The study of strategic groups from a cognitive perspective, however, has gained prominence during the past years (Hodgkinson 1997).  Strategic Group Analysis  Strategic Group Analysis (SGA) aims to identify organizations with similar strategic characteristics, following similar strategies or competing on similar bases. Such groups can usually be identified using two or perhaps three sets of characteristics as the bases of competition. Examples of the SGA: * Extent of product (or service) diversity. * Extent of geographic coverage. * Number of market segments served. * Distribution channels used. * Extent of branding. * Marketing effort. * Degree of vertical integration. * Product (or service) quality. * Pricing policy. Use of Strategic Group Analysis This analysis is useful in several ways: * Helps identify who the most direct competitors are and on what basis they compete. * Raises the question of how likely or possible it is for another organization to move from one strategic group to another. * Strategic Group mapping might also be used to identify opportunities. * Can also help identify strategic problems.

She was the wife of Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski and a member of the influential Familia political party. She founded Poland's first museum, the Czartoryski Museum, now located in Kraków. Life Czartoryski Palace at Puławy She was the daughter of Count Georg Detlev von Flemming () and Princess Antonina Czartoryska. On 18 November 1761, in Wołczyn, she married Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, thus becoming a princess. She was rumored to have had an affair with the Russian ambassador to Poland, Nikolai Vasilyevich Repnin, who was alleged to have fathered her son Adam George Czartoryski. She had also an affair with the Duke de Lauzun, who says himself in his \\"Mémoires\\" he fathered her second son Konstanty Adam. In Paris in 1772 she met Benjamin Franklin, subsequently a leader of the American Revolution, and the French philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire, who were bringing new ideas to the old order. In 1775, together with her husband, Czartoryska completely transformed the Czartoryski Palace at Puławy into an intellectual and political meeting place. Her court was one of the most liberal and progressive in the Commonwealth, although some aspects of her behavior also caused scandals. Izabela discovered the talent of the young painter Aleksander Orłowski and financed him. While in Prussia with her daughter Maria Wirtemberska for the latter's marriage, she told Frederick II of her fears that her husband would be poisoned, which was what had caused a split between him and Stanisław August Poniatowski politically. Frederick laughed and told her that only monarchs were poisoned, and spread the conversation around his court to Izabela's detriment, according to Wirydianna Fiszerowa. Temple of the Sibyl, Izabela Czartoryska's museum at Puławy In 1784 she joined the Patriotic Party. After the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising, her sons Adam George and Konstanty Adam were taken as political hostages by Russia's Empress Catherine II. In 1796 Izabela ordered the rebuilding of the ruined palace at Puławy and began a museum. Among the first objects to be included were Turkish trophies that had been seized by Polish King Jan III Sobieski's forces at the 1683 Battle of Vienna. Also included were Polish royal treasures and historic Polish family heirlooms. In 1801 Izabela opened the Temple of the Sibyl, also called \\"The Temple of Memory\\". It contained objects of sentimental importance pertaining to the glories and miseries of human life. During the November Uprising in 1830, the museum was closed. Izabela's son Adam George Czartoryski, going into exile in Paris, evacuated the museum's surviving objects to the Hôtel Lambert. His son Władysław Czartoryski would reopen the museum in 1878 in Kraków, where it exists today.

From the head of the Churchill Lake it is long. It was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and governor of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1685 to 1691. The Cree name for the river is Missinipi, meaning \\"big waters\\".\\"Churchill River (Manitoba)\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia The river is located entirely within the Canadian Shield. The drainage basin includes a number of lakes in Central-East Alberta which flow into a series of lakes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The main tributary, the Beaver River, joins at Lac Île-à-la-Crosse. Nistowiak Falls—the tallest falls in Saskatchewan—are on the Rapid River, which flows north, out of Lac la Ronge into Nistowiak Lake on the Churchill just north of La Ronge. A large amount of flow of the Churchill River after Manitoba–Saskatchewan border comes from the Reindeer River, which flows from Wollaston and Reindeer lakes. Flow from Reindeer Lake is regulated by the Whitesand Dam. From there, the Churchill River flows east through a series of lakes (Highrock, Granville, Southern Indian and Gauer), then flows via a diversion for hydro-electric generation into the Nelson River (60% of flow), and the rest flows as the Churchill River into Hudson Bay at Churchill, Manitoba (see also Nelson River Hydroelectric Project).  History  The Churchill formed a major part of the \\"voyageur highway\\" in the 18th to 20th centuries after Dene people showed Peter Pond the Methye Portage which connects the Hudson Bay watershed with the Clearwater – Athabasca – MacKenzie rivers which flow to the Arctic Ocean. See Canadian Canoe Routes (early). Fish species The Churchill is also home of several fish species including: walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, lake trout, lake whitefish, cisco, white sucker, shorthead redhorse, longnose sucker, lake sturgeon and burbot.  Hydroelectric developments  = Island Falls = The only operating hydroelectric generating station on the Churchill River is Island Falls, with a capacity of 111 megawatts (MW). The purpose of the Whitesand Dam mentioned above is to control the amount of water flowing through Island Falls, since the generating station is downstream of the Reindeer River fork. = Wintego Hydroelectric Project = In the 1970s, SaskPower was considering building another hydroelectric station on the Churchill River called Wintego. This station would've been located downstream of the Reindeer River forks, and upstream of Island Falls. The project was expected to cost $338 million (equivalent to $1.3 billion in 2020), including transmission and roads, and the capacity of the station would have been 300 MW. The cost estimate assumes a 50-year lifespan, but the lifespans of SaskPower's other hydroelectric stations have been proven to be much longer (such as 90 years for Island Falls). Construction of Wintego would also enable the output of Island Falls to increase by 70 MW, and this benefit is not included in the cost estimate above. = Other Saskatchewan = Two other potential hydroelectric developments between the Reindeer River Fork and Island Falls are the Iskwatam Generating Station and the Pita Generating Station, with unknown MW capacities. = Manitoba = In Manitoba, the Bonald and Granville Falls generating stations could produce 110 MW and 120 MW, respectively.

Namely, if A is the symmetric matrix that defines the quadratic form, and S is any invertible matrix such that D = SAST is diagonal, then the number of negative elements in the diagonal of D is always the same, for all such S; and the same goes for the number of positive elements. This property is named after James Joseph Sylvester who published its proof in 1852.  Statement  Let A be a symmetric square matrix of order n with real entries. Any non-singular matrix S of the same size is said to transform A into another symmetric matrix , also of order n, where ST is the transpose of S. It is also said that matrices A and B are congruent. If A is the coefficient matrix of some quadratic form of Rn, then B is the matrix for the same form after the change of basis defined by S. A symmetric matrix A can always be transformed in this way into a diagonal matrix D which has only entries 0, +1 and −1 along the diagonal. Sylvester's law of inertia states that the number of diagonal entries of each kind is an invariant of A, i.e. it does not depend on the matrix S used. The number of +1s, denoted n+, is called the positive index of inertia of A, and the number of −1s, denoted n−, is called the negative index of inertia. The number of 0s, denoted n0, is the dimension of the null space of A, known as the nullity of A. These numbers satisfy an obvious relation : n_0+n_{+}+n_{-}=n. The difference, , is usually called the signature of A. (However, some authors use that term for the triple consisting of the nullity and the positive and negative indices of inertia of A; for a non-degenerate form of a given dimension these are equivalent data, but in general the triple yields more data.) If the matrix A has the property that every principal upper left minor Δk is non-zero then the negative index of inertia is equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence : \\\\Delta_0=1, \\\\Delta_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\Delta_n=\\\\det A. Statement in terms of eigenvalues The law can also be stated as follows: two symmetric square matrices of the same size have the same number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues if and only if they are congruent (B=SAS^{T}, for some non- singular S). The positive and negative indices of a symmetric matrix A are also the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of A. Any symmetric real matrix A has an eigendecomposition of the form QEQT where E is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A, and Q is an orthonormal square matrix containing the eigenvectors. The matrix E can be written E = WDWT where D is diagonal with entries 0, +1, or −1, and W is diagonal with Wii = √Eii. The matrix S = QW transforms D to A.  Law of inertia for quadratic forms  In the context of quadratic forms, a real quadratic form Q in n variables (or on an n-dimensional real vector space) can by a suitable change of basis (by non- singular linear transformation from x to y) be brought to the diagonal form : Q(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i^2 with each ai ∈ {0, 1, −1}. Sylvester's law of inertia states that the number of coefficients of a given sign is an invariant of Q, i.e., does not depend on a particular choice of diagonalizing basis. Expressed geometrically, the law of inertia says that all maximal subspaces on which the restriction of the quadratic form is positive definite (respectively, negative definite) have the same dimension. These dimensions are the positive and negative indices of inertia. Generalizations Sylvester's law of inertia is also valid if A and B have complex entries. In this case, it is said that A and B are *-congruent if and only if there exists a non-singular complex matrix S such that . In the complex scenario, a way to state Sylvester's law of inertia is that if A and B are Hermitian matrices, then A and B are *-congruent if and only if they have the same inertia. A theorem due to Ikramov generalizes the law of inertia to any normal matrices A and B: If A and B are normal matrices, then A and B are congruent if and only if they have the same number of eigenvalues on each open ray from the origin in the complex plane.

Before he joined Jabloteh, he had been playing with Joe Public of Trinidad, on loan from Chester City of England. Eve is Chester's most capped player, although many of his caps were won while out on loan and he only made 14 Football League appearances for Chester in 1999-2000. They were relegated at the end of the season, with Eve missing several games because of international duty. After making his debut for the Trinidad and Tobago national football team in a 4 April 1994 Copa Caribe game against Barbados, Eve became a monumental figure for the national team. He earned 117 caps in those years, scoring 34 goals, and helped lead the team in three different rounds of World Cup qualifiers. He retired from international football after not being considered for the Trinidad and Tobago squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and has since wound down his playing career while preparing for a full-time career as a coach. He was an assistant coach at Jabloteh, working with former England international Terry Fenwick. In April 2009 he joined Ma Pau as the assistant coach.

It is a major component of the tough outer (exine) walls of plant spores and pollen grains. It is chemically very stable and is usually well preserved in soils and sediments. The exine layer is often intricately sculptured in species-specific patterns, allowing material recovered from (for example) lake sediments to provide useful information to palynologists about plant and fungal populations in the past. Sporopollenin has found uses in the field of paleoclimatology as well. Sporopollenin is also found in the cell walls of several taxa of green alga, including Phycopeltis (an ulvophycean) and Chlorella. Spores are dispersed by many different environmental factors, such as wind, water or animals. If the conditions are suitable the sporopollenin-impregnated walls of pollen grains and spores can persist in the fossil record for hundreds of millions of years, since sporopollenin is resistant to chemical degradation by organic and inorganic chemicals.  Chemical composition  The chemical composition of sporopollenin has long been elusive due to its unusual chemical stability and resistance to degradation by enzymes and strong chemical reagents. Analyses have revealed a mixture of biopolymers, containing mainly long-chain fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics and traces of carotenoids. Tracer experiments have shown that phenylalanine is a major precursor, but other carbon sources also contribute. It is likely that sporopollenin derives from several precursors that are chemically cross-linked to form a rigid structure. In 2019, researchers at MIT determined via thioacidolysis degradation and solid-state NMR the molecular structure of pine sporopollenin, finding it primarily composed of polyvinyl alcohol units alongside other aliphatic monomers, all crosslinked through a series of acetal linkages. Electron microscopy shows that the tapetal cells that surround the developing pollen grain in the anther have a highly active secretory system containing lipophilic globules. These globules are believed to contain sporopollenin precursors. Chemical inhibitors of pollen development and many male sterile mutants have effects on the secretion of these globules by the tapetal cells.

Normally, only the current state is captured. Using tuple-versioning techniques, typically two values for time are stored along with each tuple: a start time and an end time. These two values indicate the validity of the rest of the values in the tuple. Typically when tuple-versioning techniques are used, the current tuple has a valid start time, but a null value for end time. Therefore, it is easy and efficient to obtain the current values for all tuples by querying for the null end time. A single query that searches for tuples with start time less than, and end time greater than, a given time (where null end time is treated as a value greater than the given time) will give as a result the valid tuples at the given time. For example, if a person's job changes from Engineer to Manager, there would be two tuples in an Employee table, one with the value Engineer for job and the other with the value Manager for job. The end time for the Engineer tuple would be equal to the start time for the Manager tuple. The pattern known as log trigger uses this technique to automatically store historical information of a table in a database.

He wore the Yellow Jersey early in each Tour de France for four consecutive years between 1977 and 1980. A four-time winner of the Ronde van Nederland, he also rode the Tour de France 11 times between 1974 and 1987, winning 10 stages, a Dutch record equalled only by Jan Raas and Joop Zoetemelk. Knetemann won 127 races as a professional. Knetemann maintained an Amsterdam accent and a sharp sense of humour that made him a favourite with reporters and earned him television and radio appearances. His best year in the Tour de France was 1978, when he led from the sixth stage. Although he lost the leader's yellow jersey two days later, he won the stage into Lausanne and then the final stage on the Champs Elysées in Paris. Together with Raas and his TI-Raleigh teammates Knetemann played a pivotal role in the victory of Zoetemelk in the 1980 Tour de France, one of the most dominating team performances in Tour de France history in which the team won twelve stages. His career dwindled after a crash in Dwars door België in Belgium in March 1983. Recovery took months and, although he did again ride the Tour de France, there was not much left of the once sparkling star. Knetemann did however win the Amstel Gold Race in 1985. He retired from racing in 1991 and became Dutch team selector. Knetemann died while riding his bike. He collapsed from a heart attack with friends in Bergen. His wife, Gre Donker, was also a racing cyclist. They had a son and two daughters. Their daughter Roxane, born in 1987, was a professional cyclist as well.  Teams  Knetemann raced for several different sponsored teams in his career, one of the most famous was the team, managed by Peter Post, with which he won the 1978 UCI Road World Championships.

Details are uncertain, but the incident may have been the deadliest known road accident, and one of the deadliest fires of modern times, with the death toll estimated at 2,700 to 3,000 people.  Background  The Salang Tunnel, which opened the famous Salang Pass (or Kotal-e Salang) to motor traffic, was built by Soviet engineers in 1964 and eased traffic across the Hindu Kush mountain range that separates northern and southern Afghanistan. Prior to this, on 23 February 1980, a similar incident killed 16 Soviet soldiers in the Salang Tunnel.In Russian  Fire  Very few facts are known about the fire. All information available constitutes little more than hearsay, in part because the Soviet Army was not inclined to reveal massive losses during wartime. Neither the Soviet nor Afghan governments confirmed any incident occurred. Most sources agree that it involved a Soviet Army convoy traveling southward through the tunnel. According to Soviet Army records, on 3 November 1982, two military convoys (2211 and 2212) collided in the Salang tunnel causing a traffic jam. There were no fires or explosions. Another report from a traveler, who has been to the region, sounds very different from this official version: A fuel tanker in a military convoy exploded inside (the cause of the explosion remains somewhat in doubt with the Soviet Union still claiming it was an accident and the Mujahideen still claiming it was a successful terrorist attack) the Salang Tunnel, unleashing an explosive chain reaction. Drivers of cars, trucks, and buses evidently continued to enter the tunnel after the explosion. Soviet troops, fearing that the explosion might have been a rebel attack, closed off both ends with tanks, trapping many inside.  Victims  Initial reports described fuel and ordnance explosions, and estimates of the death toll were as high as 2,700.AFGHANISTAN: Tunnel Tragedy - TIME Shortly after the event, Western diplomats indicated that a collision with a fuel truck initiated the fire in the tunnel that led to the catastrophe resulting in the death of as many as 700 Soviet soldiers and 400 to 2,000 Afghan civilians. People died either from fire or of asphyxiation. The death toll was subsequently revised downwards many times. A 2010 NPR article listed the death toll as at least 150. 56 to 64 Soviet soldiers and 112 Afghan people were killed by carbon monoxide emitted by idling engines. The names of soldiers who died in the incident can be found in «The Book of remembrance of soviet soldiers fallen in Afghanistan» () which can be found here. US military analysts placed the casualty figure at 100 to 200 Soviet and Afghan soldiers. Some burned to death; others were killed by smoke and by carbon monoxide escaping from vehicles whose drivers kept their engines idling to stay warm in the freezing cold. As many as 700 Soviet troops and 2,000 Afghan soldiers and civilians may have died. Salang Pass, Salang Tunnel and The Last Battle  The Velvet Rocket  Aftermath  Afghan insurgents said they did not have any role in the explosion in the tunnel.

In 1822, Horatio Foster and his wife were the first to settle in what would become Drayton Plains, although just temporarily as they moved northward a few years later where they permanently settled. In 1823, the first to establish permanent homes in Drayton Plains were Jonathan Perry, Harvey Durfee and Austin Durfee. In 1825, the Erie Canal opened, linking the waters of Lake Erie in the west to the Hudson River in the east. The canal made travelling from the east easier, which resulted in an influx of settlers moving into the Michigan Territory.http://www.eriecanal.org/ In 1829, construction began on a road north from Detroit along the Saginaw Trail, allowing for easier passage into the wilderness north of the city. In 1835, Daniel Windiate emigrated from Berkshire, England to what soon would be called Drayton Plains. There, he built a dam and mill and named the mill Drayton after his England home, Drayton.Drayton, Vale of White Horse He died in Drayton Plains in 1843.

The Drayton Plains depot was built by the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway. The railroad was responsible for the population of Waterford Township reaching 1,085 the year it opened. Drayton Plains was platted in 1860. In that year the town was laid out by Lewis L. Dunlap.https://archive.org/stream/historyofoakland01seel#page/486/mode/2up By 1860, the population of Waterford Township had climbed to 1,289.https://waterfordmi.gov/824/Waterford-Township-Historical-Timeline As Drayton Plains continued to grow, more retail establishments began to open. In 1865, John Linabury built the first stable in Drayton Plains and the first cider mill was built in the 1860s by John Kirodot. Other business owners in Drayton Plains in 1872 included: *C.B. Albertson, the first railroad station agent *John Ebner, farmer and stock raiser *H.D. Judd, grist mill proprietor *A.A. Southard, general farmer *Paul Shwesinger, merchant & manufacturer of boots and shoes and dealer in general merchandise. *Moses Southard, blacksmith *James Swartz, manufacturer of boots and shoes and sold general merchandise in his store. William Besley (or Beasley), son-in-law of Daniel Windiate, owned a general store, which also later served as a post office, election hall, Sunday school and Saturday night dance hall. It even housed Meinrad Hangee's tin shop.,https://www.wordnik.com/words/tin- shophttp://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/pdf/newsletter/WHS%20NewlsetterDecJan09.pdf and block ice was cut from Loon Lake by Pittman and Dean Ice House and sold throughout the area. Early pioneers owning land tracts in Drayton Plains in 1872 include:http://www.memoriallibrary.com/MI/Oakland/PLATS/1872waterford.htm *C. B. Albertson *Henry L. Birge (b.1816-d.1912) *Andrew Cutchler (b.1803-d.1879) *G. Deming *Solomon G. Eagle (b.1817-d.1890) *John M. Fair (b.1803-d.1884) *Daniel M. Judd (b.1818-d.1877) *John Linabury *Oliver H.P. Osmun (b.1826-d.1907) *Moses Southard *H. E. Stowell *Matilda Van Campen (b.1817-d.1879) *William Van Ostrand *William K. Van Sykle (b.1818-d.1880?) *Beeckman Van Zandt (b.1808-d.1881) *Peter Wager (b.1810-d.1876) Many of Drayton Plains' streets were named after local pioneers such as Denby, Covert, Frembes, Linabury, Meinrad, Van Syckle and Van Zandt.http://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/pdf/newsletter/WHS%20NewlsetterOctNov09.pdf Schools The first school in Drayton Plains was built around 1865. The one- room wooden school was located at Monroe Street and Sashabaw Road in Drayton Plains, and was in use until 1920, when a new Drayton Plains School was built at the same Monroe Street and Sashabaw Road site. The first teacher at the school was Lewis M. Covert.http://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/pdf/newsletter/WHS%20NewlsetterDecJan09.pdf The school was moved to The Pine Grove Historical Museum in Pontiac, Michigan and is open for tours. High school students in Drayton Plains would ride the train from the depot to Pontiac High School, as Drayton Plains students were assigned to Pontiac High School in the early years. In 1961, Kettering High School was opened on Bender Street in Drayton Plains (now Waterford Township). In 1957, John D. Pierce Junior High School opened on Hatchery Road in Drayton Plains,http://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/pdf/newsletter/WHS%20Newlsetter%20june%20july%20august%20%202012.pdf and Stevens T. Mason Junior High School was opened in 1965 on Walton Blvd. in Drayton Plains. Drayton Plains feeder elementary schools for the junior high schools included Drayton Plains Elementary School, George C. McVittie Elementary School on Midland Avenue, David Grayson Elementary School on Walton Blvd., Thomas M. Cooley Elementary School on Highfield Road, John Monteith Elementary School on Crescent Lake Road and Frank Manley Elementary School on Van Zandt Roadhttp://www.waterford.k12.mi.us/https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylc=X3oDMTFiaHBhMnJmBF9TAzIwMjM1MzgwNzUEaXRjAzEEc2VjA3NyY2hfcWEEc2xrA3NyY2hhc3Q-?p=monteith+elementary+school+waterford&fr;=yfp-t-573-s&fp;=1&toggle;=1&cop;=mss&ei;=UTF-8 Fish Hatchery and Nature Center A fish hatchery was opened by the state in Drayton Plains in 1903 along the Clinton River on Mill Street (later Hatchery Road).http://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/museums/index.html#Hatchery The hatchery was originally known as the Drayton Plains Station. Its purpose was to raise bass fingerlings. Starting around 1913, the Drayton Plains Station began to be informally called the Drayton Plains Hatchery. By 1934, the name was officially changed to Drayton Plains State Fish Hatchery and remained thus until its closing in 1962. The Drayton Plains State Fish Hatchery was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on August 24, 1984.http://www.michmarkers.com/ Today, the former fish hatchery is the site of the Drayton Plains Nature Center, located at 2125 Denby. Situated on 138 acres, with an expanse of nearly one mile in length, it exhibits nature in various forms. The grounds include woods, ponds, streams and a prairie. Along with expansive trails, it offers an interpretive center that houses displays of specimens in their natural habitat.http://www.michigan.org/property/drayton-plains-nature-center/ 20th- century development As the 20th century began, the Drayton Plains train depot was opened. Built in 1908 by the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, a subsidiary of the Grand Trunk Railroad, the depot stood on the northeast corner of Mill Street and Saginaw Trail (situated on the south side of the tracks). The depot was closed in 1957 and was demolished in 1965. A replica of the depot was built in 1995 and it stands at the Waterford Historical Society.http://www.waterfordhistoricalsociety.org/museums/index.html#Hatchery In 1929, the Community Presbyterian church was opened at 4301 Monroe Avenue near Sashabaw Road.http://cpcwaterford.org/documents/our_history.html The Drayton Theater, built in the 1940s, was the only movie theater in Drayton Plains. It was located on Dixie Highway between Sashabaw Road and Monroe Street.http://www.waterwinterwonderland.com/movietheaters.aspx?id=812&LocTypeID;=5 In 1942, the Drayton Men's Club developed Drayton Ball Park at Dixie Highway and Sashabaw Road. The ballpark is still in operation today as Shell Park.https://waterfordmi.gov/824/Waterford-Township-Historical-Timeline A lumber yard, Burke Lumber, was built on the corner of Dixie Highway and Frembes Road around the mid-1940s. It was destroyed by fire in the 1960s. Today, the lot remains vacant. In 1950, a portrait studio, Sayles Studio, opened at 4431 Dixie Highway near Monroe Street. Eventually the youngest of the Sayles children took over the family business, which is now located at 1150 Scott Lake Road in Waterford, Michigan. In 1950, Tenuta's Super Market opened at 3515 Sashabaw Road and Walton Blvd. in Drayton Plains.http://www.tenutasfoodlane.com/ The first bowling alley in Drayton Plains was Dixie Lanes, located at 4443 Dixie Highway near Monroe Street. Opened in the 1950s, it later became Primrose Lanes, then Lighthouse Lanes and then Billy G's Lanes. In the early 1970s, the bowling alley was turned into a night club called \\"Heaven\\", which featured local bands. Today, the building is a bingo room. When zip codes were introduced in 1963, Drayton Plains' zip code became 48020. By the end of the 20th Century, the population of Waterford Township, Michigan was 73,150.http://censusviewer.com/city/MI/Waterford Dissolution The Drayton Plains post office was permanently closed on January 31, 2004. At the same time, all of its functions were transferred to the Waterford Post Office. The zip code for the community became 48329http://www.zipmap.net/Michigan/Oakland_County/Waterford.htm and its identity has been largely subsumed within that of Waterford Charter Township.http://webpmt.usps.gov/pmt007.cfm?PostOfficeCounty=Oakland&stat;_state_name=MICHIGAN References External links *An Account of Oakland County edited by Lillian Drake Avery.

He was described by Rik Van Looy as \\"The most talented and the only real classics rider of his generation\\". Nicknamed “The Gypsy” because he was born into a family of traveling clothiers, he is known for exploits in the cobbled classic Paris–Roubaix race, but his performances in other “Monument” races gave him a record that few can match. His record in Paris–Roubaix earned him another nickname, “Monsieur Paris–Roubaix” (English: “Mr. Paris–Roubaix“). Early life and amateur career De Vlaeminck was born on 24 August 1947 in the East Flanders town of Eeklo, His first love was football. At the age of 16 he debuted for F.C. Eeklo. He could have made a career in the sport, however his elder brother Erik was having success as a pro cyclist and this persuaded Roger to try cycling. He raced as a junior in 1965, gaining one win, but 1966 saw 25 victories. Roger and Erik spent their winters riding cyclo-cross and in 1968 in Luxembourg Erik became world professional champion and Roger the amateur champion on the same day. Roger eventually took the professional title in 1975. In 1968 De Vlaeminck rode the road race at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico and finished 18th. Professional career De Vlaeminck attempting to defend his alt=A cyclist riding on a cobbled road De Vlaeminck turned professional at the start of the 1969 season with Flandria-Declerck and won the Omloop \\"Het Volk\\" in his first race. De Vlaeminck's career ran parallel with Eddy Merckx and he battled for ascendancy with Merckx throughout his career. De Vlaeminck rode Paris–Roubaix on 14 occasions, winning four times (1972, 1974, 1975, 1977), finished second four times, third once, fifth once, sixth once, seventh twice and abandoned only in 1980. His skill as a cyclo- cross rider made him an expert on the cobbles of northern France which the race crosses. De Vlaeminck used the early season Italian stage race Tirreno–Adriatico as training for the spring classics. He dominated the race between 1972 and 1977, winning on six occasions and taking 15 stages. De Vlaeminck is one of only three riders to have won all five 'Monuments of Cycling' (i.e., Milan–San Remo, Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and the Giro di Lombardia). The other two are fellow Belgians Rik van Looy and Eddy Merckx. The only major one-day race he did not win was the world road race championship, his best performance was second to Dutchman Hennie Kuiper in 1975. He rode three Tours de France, winning stage 6 in 1970 between Amiens and Valenciennes. He took the points jersey in the Giro d'Italia on three occasions as well as 22 stages overall including seven stages in 1975. He took a stage win in the Vuelta a España in his final season in 1984. His career lasted 15 years (he retired in 1984) and he had 257 victories. Post-career De Vlaeminck (left) with former professional cyclists alt=Three men riding bicycles De Vlaeminck, who lives on a farm in Kaprijke, is still in cycling. He has been coaching cyclo-cross riders. In April 2004 he quit his job as coach to the John Saey-Deschacht team in Belgium to spend more time with his family, However he was tempted back to the sport in November 2004 as advisor to the Zimbabwe team as it prepared for the world championship in St. Wendel, Germany, at the end of January 2005. De Vlaeminck is known for firm opinions about cycling and is often consulted by journalists. In particular, he criticizes the trend to have multiple leaders in a team. That, he says, means the best racers share important races between them. De Vlaeminck is also known for his harsh opinion of Tom Boonen, calling him unworthy of equaling his Paris-Roubaix record of 4 wins, claiming cycling isn't as hard as it used to be. This led to the meme \\"In den tijd van Roger De Vlaeminck ...\\" (\\"in the days of Roger De Vlaeminck\\") where De Vlaeminck was attributed to doing all kinds of unrealistic stuff.

","title":"Roger De Vlaeminck"},{"id":"1127534","text":"An absentee ballot is a vote cast by someone who is unable or unwilling to attend the official polling station to which the voter is normally allocated. Methods include voting at a different location, postal voting, proxy voting and online voting. Increasing the ease of access to absentee ballots is seen by many as one way to improve voter turnout through convenience voting, though some countries require that a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel, be given before a voter can participate in an absentee ballot. Early voting overlaps with absentee voting. Early voting includes votes cast before the official election day(s), by mail, online or in-person at voting centers which are open for the purpose. Some places call early in-person voting a form of \\"absentee\\" voting, since voters are absent from the polling place on election day. In the electoral terminology of some countries, such as Australia, \\"absentee voting\\" means specifically a vote cast at a different polling station to one to which the voter has been allocated. \\"Early voting\\", \\"proxy voting\\" or \\"postal voting\\" are separate concepts in these countries. The history of absentee voting dates back to the 19th century, and modern-day procedures and availability vary by jurisdiction. Absentee voting may be available on demand, or limited to individuals meeting certain criteria, such as a proven inability to travel to a designated polling place. Many electors are required to apply for absentee voting, although some may receive a postal ballot by default. In some elections postal voting is the only voting method allowed and is referred to as all-postal voting. Typically, postal votes must be mailed back on or before the scheduled election day. However, in some jurisdictions return methods may allow for dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes or at voting centers. Electoral laws typically allow for the integrity and secrecy of the submitted ballot to be maintained, and stipulate a series of checks to protect against voter fraud. Voting at a distant polling place is subject to the same controls as voting locally, though distant staff are less likely to recognize an impersonator than local staff. Voting by mail is sometimes controlled by using security printing, such as special paper, or by requiring signatures of voters and sometimes witnesses, though signature comparisons have 10-14% error rates. Thousands of ballots fail these checks and are rejected. Evidence of fraud is uncommon. While postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting, on an absolute level cases of known fraud are extremely rare. Methods =Voting at a different polling station= Among countries where voters are allocated to one or several specific polling station(s) (such as the polling station closest to the voter's residential address, or polling stations within a particular district, province or state), some countries provide a mechanism by which voters can nevertheless cast their ballots on election day at a different polling station. The reasons for allocating voters to specific polling stations are generally logistical. Absentee voting at a different polling station might be catered for by, for example, designating some larger polling stations as available for absentee voting, and equipping such polling stations with the ballot papers (or the means to produce ballot papers) applicable to an absentee voter. =Postal voting= In a postal vote, the ballot papers are posted out to the voter – usually only on request – who must then fill them out and return them, often with the voter's signature and sometimes a witness signature to prove the voter's identity. Signature verification is an imperfect endeavor; the best academic researchers have 10-14% error rates.These systems handle scanned (\\"offline\\") signatures from multiple people (\\"WI, writer-independent\\"). Some jurisdictions use special paper or printing to minimize forged ballots. =All-postal voting= All- postal voting is the form of postal voting where all electors receive their ballot papers through the post, not just those who requested an absentee ballot. Depending on the system applied, electors may have to return their ballot papers by post, or there may be an opportunity to deliver them by hand to a specified location. There is some evidence that this method of voting leads to higher turnout than one where people vote in person or have to apply for a postal vote. Critics suggest that this is only a temporary impact, and that there are dangers in people using ballot papers intended for other electors. It has been tested by a large number of local authorities in the United Kingdom for their elections, and in 2004 it was used for elections to the European Parliament and local authorities in four of the English regions (see below for more details). In 2016, the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey was conducted via all-postal voting with a turnout of 79.5 percent. =Proxy voting= To cast a proxy vote, the user appoints someone as their proxy, by authorizing them to cast or secure their vote in their stead. The proxy must be trusted by the voter, as in a secret ballot there is no way of verifying that they voted for the correct candidate. In an attempt to solve this, it is not uncommon for people to nominate an official of their chosen party as their proxy. =Internet voting= Security experts have found security problems in every attempt at online voting, \\"Secure Internet voting will likely not be feasible in the near future... At the present time, the Internet (or any network connected to the Internet) should not be used for the return of marked ballots\\" \\"Electronic ballot return faces significant security risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of voted ballots. These risks can ultimately affect the tabulation and results and, can occur at scale... Even with ... technical security considerations, electronic ballot return remains a high-risk activity.\\" including systems in Australia, Estonia\\"The OSCE/ODIHR EAM was made aware of a program that could, if it was running on a voter’s computer, change the vote without the possibility for the voter to detect it. The case was brought to the attention of the project manager who assessed this threat to be theoretically plausible but nearly impossible to implement in reality.\\" Switzerland, Russia, and the United States.

By country =Australia= In Australia the term \\"absentee ballot\\" refers specifically to the procedure used when a voter attends a voting place which is not in the electoral district in which they are registered to vote. Instead of marking the ballot paper and putting it in the ballot box, the voter's ballot paper is placed in an envelope and then it is sent by the voting official to the voter's home district to be counted there. Postal voting and early voting are separate procedures also available to voters who would not be in their registered electoral districts on a voting day. At the 2016 Australian federal election, there were 1.2 million postal votes cast, amounting to 8.5 percent of total votes. Postal voting in Australia was introduced for federal elections in 1902, and first used at the 1903 election. It was abolished by the Fisher Government in 1910, following claims that it was open to abuse and biased towards rural voters. The Cook Government's bill to restore postal voting was one of the \\"triggers\\" for the double dissolution prior to the 1914 election. Postal voting was eventually restored by the Hughes Government in 1918 and has not been challenged since, although the provisions and requirements have been amended on a number of occasions. Prior to Federation in 1901, Western Australia introduced a form of postal voting in 1877 with strict eligibility criteria. South Australia introduced postal voting for seamen in 1890, and a further act in 1896 gave postal votes to any elector who would be more than from home on election day, as well as for any woman unable to travel \\"by reason of her health\\". Victoria passed a similar law in 1899, and the first federal postal voting legislation was also modelled on the 1896 South Australian act. Procedure in Australia Postal voting at a federal level is governed by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and administered by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Postal votes are available to those who will be absent from their electoral division through travel, or who those are unable to attend a polling booth due to illness, infirmity, \\"approaching childbirth\\", caring responsibilities, reasonable fears for their safety, religious beliefs, imprisonment, status as a silent elector, or employment reasons.Schedule 2—Grounds of application for postal or pre‑poll vote: Eligible voters may make a postal vote application (PVA) prior to each election, or apply for status as a \\"general postal voter\\" and receive a postal ballot automatically. Postal voters receive their ballot(s) and a prepaid envelope containing their name and address, as well as a predetermined security question from the PVA. Voters are required to sign the envelope and provide the correct answer to the security question. They are also required to have a witness sign and date the envelope. As of 2016, postal votes were able to be received and entered into the count up to 13 days after election day. Following the 2016 election, it was observed that the strict scrutiny process afforded to postal votes was a \\"significant contributor\\" to delays in declaring the results of close elections. =Austria= Austria enabled postal voting in 2007 by amending Article 26 of the Constitution of Austria. Electors request an electoral card that can be completed in person or in private and sent via post. In the 2017 election, roughly 780,000 postal ballots were cast representing 15% of all ballots. =Canada= The ability to vote when in-person voting is not possible was first introduced with the Military Voters Act in 1917, giving the right to vote to all Canadian soldiers. Public servants became eligible in 1970. The right was further extended to civilian support personnel on Canadian Forces bases in the 1977. In 1993, Bill C-114 extended the special ballot vote (Special Voting Rules) by mail to all Canadian citizens. Use of special voting rules including vote by mail has grown with each election. In the 42nd general election (2015), the number of voters increased by 117 percent over the previous election to roughly 619,000. This number grew to roughly 660,000 in the 43rd election (2019) representing 3.6 percent of electors. =Estonia= Since 2005, Estonia has allowed voters to cast votes via the Internet (encrypted to protect voter anonymity); 2% of Estonians cast ballots via the Internet initially, and 25% did so in 2011.Brad Plumer, Estonia gets to vote online. Why can’t America?, Washington Post (November 6, 2012). The Estonian Internet-voting system uses the Estonian national identity card, which is associated with a PINs unique to each voter: \\"all Estonians are issued a government ID with a scannable chip and a PIN number that gives them a unique online identity — they can use this identity to file their taxes or pay library fines or buy bus passes.\\" Security experts have found the Estonian voting system to be insecure in multiple ways. =Finland= Finland introduced vote by post in 2019. =France= France allows voting by \\"procuration\\", which is literally proxy voting. It has been said access to it has been eased in regard to the coronavirus pandemic. In the 2012 French legislative election, French citizens living abroad were permitted to cast votes electronically in the parliamentary elections (but not in the presidential election). In 2017, however, the system was dropped after the French National Cybersecurity Agency assessed an \\"extremely high risk\\" of cyberattacks in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.France drops electronic voting for citizens abroad over cybersecurity fears, Reuters (March 6, 2017). =Germany= Absentee voting has existed in Germany since 1957, originally in order to ensure that all German citizens, especially the old, sick, and disabled, and citizens living abroad, have the opportunity to participate in elections. At first, postal voters had to state why they could not cast their vote in person on Election Day; but this requirement has been dropped in 2008, allowing everyone to use postal voting. Like in many other countries, in more recent years, voting by mail has become increasingly popular among younger and non-disabled citizens residing within the country; as such, various tools are being developed to help citizens, both domestic and abroad, more easily apply for postal voting.wahlrecht.de: Briefwahl nun ohne Hinderungsgrund möglich =Hungary= Hungarian citizens living abroad who do not have an official address in Hungary are allowed to vote by mail. They are only allowed to vote for party lists, but not for local representatives. In the last parliamentary election in 2018, 267,233 votes (4.6% of all votes) were submitted via mail. 48% of all valid postal votes were submitted from Romania. =India= Only certain categories of people are eligible to register as postal voters. The Representation of the People Act-1950Representation of the People Act-1950 (RPA) section 20(8) allows postal ballots for people on polling duty; members of the armed forces and state police as well as their wives; employees of the Government of India who are officially posted abroad; and the President;, these are also called service voters. Additionally, people in preventive detention, disabled and those above the age of 65 years old can use postal vote. Prisoners can not vote at all.Maharashtra, Haryana Elections 2019: Can You Vote By Postal Ballot If You Aren't Living At Home?, Huffington Post, 26 September 2019. Postal voting in India is done only through the Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot Papers (ETPB) system of the Election Commission of India, where ballot papers are distributed to the registered eligible voters and they return the votes by post. When the counting of votes commences, these postal votes are counted first before the counting of votes from the electronic voting machines of all other voters. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has alleged that postal ballots \\"will adversely effect the verifiability of a large number of voters, thus, transparency and integrity of the process\\", and expressed concerns with \\"instances of manipulation and malpractice\\" with postal ballots. Section 20 of the RPA-1950 disqualified non- resident Indians (NRI) from getting their names registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevented non-residents from voting. In August 2010, Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill-2010 which allows voting rights to NRI's was passed in both Lok Sabha with subsequent gazette notifications on Nov 24, 2010. With this NRI's could vote in Indian elections if physically present at the time of voting. Civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.Petition for Absentee Voting in Indian Elections =Indonesia= Postal voting documents sent to an Indonesian voter in the United Kingdom during the 2019 Indonesian general election. Eligible Indonesians living abroad are able to vote by mail in national elections by registering at the Indonesian overseas election commission in their country of residence. Besides presidential elections, they are also able to vote in DPR elections. All overseas Indonesian voters are included in the Jakarta 2nd constituency, which also contains Central and South Jakarta. =Republic of Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland, postal votes are used in Seanad Éireann elections for the university constituencies and the vocational panels, both of which have restricted franchises. Otherwise, postal voting is only available in a restricted set of circumstances. The Irish constitution requires a secret ballot and the courts have interpreted this quite narrowly. Postal votes are available to people who by reason of their occupation cannot vote normally. They are also available to students living away from home, to people with disabilities, to prisoners (since January 2007), and to long term residents of hospitals, nursing homes and other similar institutions. =Israel= Israel does not have an absentee ballot system for all citizens. Absentee ballots are restricted to soldiers, prisoners, sailors, overseas diplomats, disabled persons and hospitalized people. The votes are not cast directly but placed in a double envelope with identifying information and counted directly by the elections committee only after verifying that the voter has not voted at his or her official polling station. Most absentee ballots are cast the day of the elections in alternate polling stations. Early voting is limited to civil servants overseas. There is no postal voting. =Italy= Electoral package sent to an Italian voter in South America during the 2013 Italian general election. Since 2001 Italian citizens living abroad have the right to vote by mail in all referendums and national elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate). =Malaysia= In Malaysia, opposition leader and former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim alleged that postal votes have been used by the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition in securing seats in certain constituencies. He also said that in one particular constituency (Setiawangsa), he claimed that his Parti Keadilan Rakyat had actually won during the 2008 elections, before 14,000 postal votes came in awarding the incumbent BN parliamentarian the seat with a majority of 8,000 votes. In Malaysia, only teachers, military personnel, and policemen based away from their constituencies are eligible to submit postal votes. =Mexico= Postal ballot paper for Mexico federal election 2012 In Mexico, since the 2006 federal elections, postal voting for people living abroad has been permitted. A request can be made to the National Electoral Institute which then sends the ballots outside the country. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, liberalised proxy voting is available. Voters can authorise someone else to cast their ballot without having to go through a registration procedure. Voters can cast a maximum of 2 proxy votes along with their own ballot. Postal ballots and Internet voting are only available to Dutch citizens living abroad, or having occupational duties abroad on election day. Electronic voting was banned in the Netherlands in 2007, and in 2017 Dutch authorities also abandoned electronic vote counting, conducting an all-paper, all-manual vote count in an effort to block foreign interference in its elections.Josh Lowe, Netherlands Abandons Electronic Vote Counting Amid Hacking Fears, Newsweek (March 6, 2017). =Philippines= As provided by the Overseas Absentee Voting Act, absentee voting in Philippine elections is only available in certain circumstances, such as for Overseas Filipino Workers or other migrants. Votes must be cast in person at select polling places, such as a consulate office; mail-in ballots are an option for Filipinos in select countries. Local absentee voting as pursuant to Republic Act No. 7166 and Executive Order No. 157 is only available for members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Philippine National Police, and government personnel on duty on election day. The absentee voting in both overseas and local is still manual vote counting system. Recently, absentee voting in Hong Kong and Singapore was done through the optical scan voting due to COMELEC Resolution No. 8806 in the 2010 general elections. Absentee voters can only vote for candidates elected by the entire electorate: the President, Vice President, senators, and party-list representatives. =Poland= In Poland, each citizen registered in the local voters' register, can get an absentee voter's certificate (AVC), which is a piece of paper with the person's details and the local government's stamp. The person can vote with AVC at every polling station countrywide and worldwide (in Polish embassies and consulates; the polling stations abroad are created by the Minister of Foreign Affairs before every elections). An AVC is issued only for President of Poland elections, parliamentary elections and elections to the European Parliament (in that case, the AVC can be got by Polish or EU citizen, so the EU citizen can vote for Polish deputies at polling station in Poland and Polish embassies or consulates, or for deputies from the country of origin. Although, if the EU citizen registers himself in the Polish voters' register, the local officials informs appropriate office in the country of origin). In case of Senate by- elections, AVC may be issued only for voters living and registered in given single-member constituency. Postal voting and proxy voting are also possible. Postal voting is possible both in country and abroad, but proxy voting is possible only in Poland. The proxy must be registered at the same local voters' register as a voter. The mail with the voter's ballot in postal voting is free of charge in Poland, but voter resides abroad must pay to send his ballot to the appropriate consulate. =Spain= In Spain, for European, regional and municipal elections, voters who will be absent from their town on election day or are ill or disabled, may request a postal vote at a post office. The application must be submitted personally or through a representative in case of illness or disability certified by a medical certificate. =Switzerland= Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referenda, and all cantons also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back. As of 2019, approximately 90% of Swiss voters cast ballots using Remote Postal Voting. In Switzerland, starting in 2004, 15 cantons conducted electronic voting pilot programs. In three cantons, Swiss voters resident abroad voted electronically; Geneva Canton, Canton of Neuchâtel, and Basel Stadt. The programs were closed in June and July 2019, and the plan is for new designs to be available by 2023.Electronic voting, Swiss Confederation. In 2019 the Swiss government invited researchers to test the security of online voting, and in early March 2019 researchers found back doors which let insiders, and hackers who accessed management systems, change results without detection. =Thailand= Absentee balloting started in Thailand first time in the 2000 general election. It is promulgated according to a provision in the 1997 constitution. The absentee ballot can be cast within Thailand and in foreign countries, where Thailand has diplomatic missions. Voters can cast the absentee ballot in 2 cases: (1) those who have their household registration in their constituency but will not be at their constituency on the election day, and wish to cast their vote in advance; and (2) those who physically reside in other locations out of their constituency at least 90 days prior to the election day, and will not be able to travel back to their constituency on the election day. In both cases, voters wishing to cast their absentee ballot must register with the election committee 30 days in advance prior to the general election date. Voters within Thailand can cast their vote either at the designated district offices for absentee voting in their provinces or through mail. Likewise, voters overseas can register to vote with the Thai missions in their country of residence or send the ballot to them by mail. The absentee voting date is normally designated a week ahead of the general election date. =United Kingdom= Absentee voting in the United Kingdom is allowed by proxy or post (known as postal voting on demand) for any elector. Postal voting does not require a reason, apart from in Northern Ireland, where postal voting is available only if it would be unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions. Proxy voting is allowed for people who will be away, working, or medically disabled. Anyone eligible to vote in the election may be a proxy for close relatives and two unrelated people. In May 2003, 35 local authorities trialled all-postal voting. The outcome of those pilots was a recommendation from the UK Electoral Commission that all-postal voting should be adopted as the normal method of voting at local elections in the UK. This reflected the positive impact on voter turnout at these elections (in some places, turnout doubled) and the fact that there was no evidence of an increase in electoral fraud. A 2016 government review said about postal voting, that \\"Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders... the possibilities of undue influence, theft of postal votes and tampering with them after completion were all still risks.\\" =United States= :Main article: Postal voting in the United States Voters may vote early or get a mailed ballot to mail back or take to a secure box or office. Most areas do not require a reason. Five states and some counties have all- postal elections. Vote-by-mail has been implemented in both Republican and Democratic states, but it became a political controversy in 2020. Availability of postal voting increases turnout. Americans living outside the United States and members of the military and merchant marine even inside the country, and their families, may register and vote under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Almost half the states require these ballots to be returned by mail. Other states allow mail along with some combination of fax, or email; four states allow a web portal. Security of mailed ballots is controlled by using special paper in some areas, and, more often, by requiring signatures of voters and sometimes witnesses. Signature comparisons are imperfect; the best academic researchers have 10-14% error rates. Thousands of ballots fail the signature checks and are rejected. Evidence of fraud is uncommon, though postal voting has a greater risk of fraud than in-person voting. Not all states have standards for signature review. There have been concerns that signatures are improperly rejected from young and minority voters at higher rates than others, with no or limited ability of voters to appeal the rejection. Processing large numbers of ballots and signature verifications accurately has numerous challenges other than fraud. In the 2016 US Presidential election, approximately 33 million ballots were cast via mailed out ballots (about a quarter of all ballots cast). The number of people expected to vote early or with mail-in ballot is expected to set records in this 2020 election. This is because of the coronavirus pandemic and people are choosing the option of absentee ballots.

The term was coined by the American motion picture trade magazine Variety following the explosion of films in the genre released in 1973 in the U.S. after the success of Five Fingers of Death.YourDictionary.com: \\"Chopsocky\\" The word is a play on chop suey, combining \\"chop\\" (as in karate chop referring to a strike with the edge of the hand) and \\"sock\\" (as in a punch). Chopsocky movies are usually characterized by overblown storylines, cheesy special effects (particularly exaggerated and sometimes bizarre sound effects during the actual fight scenes), and excessive violence. The genre also is known for its clumsy dubbing. Although the term \\"chopsocky\\" is commonly used as a name of martial arts cinema by the general media, the word can be disparaging as well. Another common meaning is a generalization for martial arts movies from Asia or Hong Kong in particular, without necessarily having the negative connotation. Variety magazine, the originator of the term, defined \\"chopsocky\\" simply as a martial arts film with no negative connotations. Kung fu craze (1970s–1980s) Hong Kong action cinema's international impact initially came in the form of martial arts films, especially 1970s kung fu films and most notably those of Bruce Lee. His earliest attempts at introducing his brand of Hong Kong martial arts cinema to the West came in the form of American television shows, such as The Green Hornet (1966 debut) and Kung Fu (1972 debut). The \\"kung fu craze\\" began in 1973, with the unprecedented success of Hong Kong martial arts films at the North American box office. King Boxer (Five Fingers of Death) starring Indonesian-born actor Lo Lieh was the first Hong Kong film to top the US box office, paving the way for Bruce Lee's breakthrough with The Big Boss (Fists of Fury) topping the US box office. In May 1973, Hong Kong action cinema made US box office history, with three foreign films holding the top three spots for the first time: Fists of Fury, Lady Whirlwind (Deep Thrust), and Five Fingers of Death. Lee continued his success with Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection), which also topped the US box office the following month. Kung fu film releases in the United States initially targeted Asian American audiences, before becoming a breakout success among larger African-American and Hispanic audiences, and then among white working-class Americans. Kung fu films also became a global success, across Asia, Europe and the third world. This eventually paved the way for Lee's posthumous Hollywood film breakthrough with the Hong Kong and US co-production Enter the Dragon (1973). Hong Kong martial arts cinema subsequently inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s–1990s (launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris), as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows by the 1990s. Sascha Matuszak of Vice said Enter the Dragon \\"is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today, and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African- Americans, Asians and traditional martial arts.\\" Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited fight scenes in Hong Kong films such as Enter the Dragon as being influential for the way they pitched \\"an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way\\". In Japan, the manga and anime franchises Fist of the North Star (1983–1988) and Dragon Ball (1984–1995) were influenced by Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly 1970s kung fu films such as Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon and Jackie Chan's Drunken Master (1978). In turn, Fist of the North Star and especially Dragon Ball are credited with setting the trends for popular shōnen manga and anime from the 1980s onwards. Similarly in India, Hong Kong martial arts films had an influence on Bollywood masala films. After the success of Bruce Lee films (such as Enter the Dragon) in India, Deewaar (1975) and later Bollywood films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films up until the 1990s. Bollywood action scenes emulated Hong Kong rather than Hollywood, emphasising acrobatics and stunts and combining kung fu (as perceived by Indians) with Indian martial arts such as pehlwani. Hong Kong martial arts films such as Enter the Dragon were the foundation for fighting games. The Street Fighter video game franchise (1987 debut) was inspired by Enter the Dragon, with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style. Street Fighter went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed. The early beat 'em up game Kung-Fu Master (1984) was also based on Bruce Lee's Game of Death (1972) and Jackie Chan's Wheels on Meals (1984). The success of Bruce Lee's films helped popularize the concept of mixed martial arts (MMA) in the West via his Jeet Kune Do system. In 2004, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) founder Dana White called Lee the \\"father of mixed martial arts\\".Wickert, Marc. 2004. Dana White and the future of UFC. kucklepit.com. See Wikiquotes for the text. Parkour was also influenced by the acrobatic antics of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong action films, as well as the philosophy of Bruce Lee.

An original work is one not received from others nor one copied from or based upon the work of others.. It is a work created with a unique style and substance. The term \\"originality\\" is often applied as a compliment to the creativity of artists, writers, and thinkers. The modern idea of originality is tied to Romanticism,Gregory (1997) pp. 12-13 quote: by a notion that is often called romantic originality.Smith (1924)Waterhouse (1926)Macfarlane (2007) The concept of originality is culturally contingent.

Also available online since 2006 at Writing World.Edward Young (1759) Conjectures on Original Composition Originality in law In law, originality has become an important legal concept with respect to intellectual property, where creativity and invention have manifest as copyrightable works. In the patent law of the United States and most other countries, only original inventions are subject to protection. In addition to being original, inventions submitted for a patent must also be useful and nonobvious. In United States copyright law and the law of many other states, copyrights protect only original works of authorship, a property which has been historically and legally linked to a concept of \\"creativity\\". A work must pass a threshold of originality in order to be copyrightable.Feist v. Rural In United Kingdom intellectual property law, a derived work can demonstrate originality, and must do so if it is to respect copyright.  Originality under United States copyright law  In the copyright law of the United States, more specifically under 17 U.S.C 102, the work that is sought to be protected must satisfy the threshold for originality. Though most of the countries require certain degree of originality in the work sought to be protected, such requirement does not stem from either the Berne Convention or the TRIPS Agreement. Therefore, there is no uniformity in the standard for originality. In the United States, originality necessitates bare minimum degree of creativity and independent creation. The Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co. held that the work must be independently created and must possess minimum degree of creativity. This interpretation requires an extremely low level of creativity and in the words of the court, “must possess some creative spark no matter how crude, humble or obvious it might be.” The court also took the opportunity to reject the previously judicially-established and followed the sweat of the brow doctrine. According to the said doctrine, labour and hard-work alone could suffice to establish originality. After the doctrine was rejected by the Supreme Court in 1991, in the Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp36 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) case, the court held that the copies of public domain photographs could not be copyrighted since they lacked originality and while such reproductions may have involved skill and labour, no protection could be granted to them, on account of lack of originality. While the current legal requirements of originality viz. minimum level of creativity and independent labour can be easily assessed and applied in case of literary works, the courts are required to undertake a deeper legal and factual inquiry in photographic works. The United States District Court for Southern District of New York in Mannion v. Coors Brewing Company377 F.Supp.2d 444 considered originality in terms of timing, subject and rendition, and held that the nature and extent of the copyright would be independent in the three aspects. The requirement for originality was incorporated in the statute only in the Copyright Act, 1976 and over the course of time, the courts have evolved various metrics to apply the test. Unlike, Patents, novelty is not required for a work to be considered as original. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Sheldon (1936)81 F.2d 49 (2d Cir. 1936) had clarified that sometimes it is relevant for other purposes. Therefore, if the work created by you is identical to a pre-existing work but you are unaware of the latter's existence, you may still enjoy copyright protection for your work. Apart from novelty, the work is not required to be made with an intent to be original. What is considered is only that it is actually an independent creation in effect. In 1951, the court in Alfred Bell Co. v. Catalda Arts held that the question as to whether there was intent to be original was not to be considered. The Supreme Court of the United States has also clarified that it is not necessary for the work to be artistic to qualify as original. Furthermore, in the landmark ruling, the court observed that it would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Monet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. This observation was an embodiment of the principle of artistic or aesthetic neutrality which seeks to eliminate the inherent subjectivity involved in the judges deciding whether the work is artistic, and hence, the question as to whether it warrants protection. The principle finds four broad justifications- (i) lack of expertise in the judges (ii) fear of elitism (iii) fear of paternalism (also called parentalism) (iv) lack of consensus on what constitutes art. However, scholars note that the principle of aesthetic neutrality is often violated as the adjudicators end up favouring creators of what they believe is deserving of copyright grant. In the United States, the work is not required to be non- commercial in nature for copyright protection and unlike the US trademark law, the work need to be necessarily lawful. Therefore, works created for commercial purposes, such as advertisements can also be granted a copyright.  Originality under Indian copyright law  Section 13(1)(a) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 mentions 'originality' as a requirement for copyright protection to literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Courts have interpreted this requirement of 'originality' in different ways. This has given rise to various doctrines/tests that can be helpful in determining whether a work meets the threshold of originality. The most prominent case with respect to 'originality' under the Indian Copyright Law is the Eastern Book Company v DCB Modak.Appeal (civil) 6472 of 2004 This judgment gave rise to two doctrines i.e. modicum of creativity and the skill and judgment test. This remains the accepted and current position of law in India as of now. However, prior to this, the Indian Courts used to follow the Sweat of the Brow approach. = \\"Sweat of the brow\\" doctrine = This theory bases the grant of copyright protection on the effort and labour that an author puts into their work as opposed to the creativity involved. Locke's theory of labour as property has often been extended to give jurisprudential basis to this theory of copyright law. In the case of V. Govindan v E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone,AIR 1955 Mad 391 it was held that compilations of information would meet the threshold of 'originality' under the Indian Copyright Act since it involves some level of 'skill, labour and brain'.¶8, V. Govindan vs E.M. Gopalakrishna Kone And Anr. (AIR 1955 Mad 391) A similar line of reasoning was adopted in the case of Burlington Home Shipping Pvt Ltd v Rajnish Chibber1995 IVAD Delhi 732 where a database was held to be original enough to be protected by copyright under Indian law. However, like in other jurisdictions, this theory was discarded by the Indian Courts also and the focus was shifted to the creativity involved in any work. = EBC Modak case (modicum of creativity and skill and judgment test) = The EBC Modak case is the Indian counterpart of the Feist Publications case in terms of the test it laid down. It concerned the copyrightability of Supreme Court judgments that were copy-edited and published by Eastern Book Company. These judgments were published along with 'headnotes' that were written by the Company itself. While explicitly discarding the Sweat of the Brow theory, the Court held that simply copy editing would not meet the threshold of originality under copyright law since it would only demonstrate an \\"amount of skill, labour and capital put in the inputs of the copy-edited judgments and the original or innovative thoughts for the creativity would be completely excluded.\\".¶37, Eastern Book Company v DB Modak Thus, it introduced the requirement of 'creativity' under originality. With respect to the level of creativity involved, the court adopted the 'minimal degree of creativity' approach. Following this standard, the headnotes that did not copy from the judgment verbatim were held to be copyrightable. Finally, the Court also gave way to the 'Skill and Judgment Test' which is more or less a compromise between the sweat of the brow theory and the modicum of creativity test. While relying on the CCH Canadian Case,[2004] 1 SCR 339 the Court essentially held that a work would meet the originality standard as long as there is labour or effort involved but not only labour. It must involve some level of skill and judgment as well. However, this approach mirrors the Sweat of the Brow theory more closely and is therefore a difficult theory to defend. Further, the Court held the division of a judgment into paragraphs and numbering them was enough to meet this standard of 'Skill and Judgment'. Whether this is the correct interpretation of the test as given in the CCH Canadian Case¶16, CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada, [2004] 1 SCR 339 remains debatable.  Originality in science  Scientific literature considered as primary must contain original research, and even review articles contain original analysis or interpretation. Originality of ideas and creative works An original idea is one not thought up by another person beforehand. Sometimes, two or more people can come up with the same idea independently. Originality is usually associated with characteristics such as being imaginative and creative. The evaluation of originality depends not only on the creative work itself, but also on the temporal context, the zeitgeist. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical music themes, the importance of objective characteristics and the zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), as well as its \\"absolute\\" originality influenced in similar magnitude the popularity of a theme. Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality. Original recording An original painting, photographic negative, analog audio, or video recording, will contain qualities that can be difficult, or under current technology may be impossible to copy in its full integrity. That can also apply for any other artifact. That is why it is often necessary to preserve the original, in order to preserve its original integrity. The copy is made to preserve the original recording by saving the original from degenerating as it is being played, rather than to replace the original.

( Nissan VQ engine ) In automotive engineering a multi-valve or multivalve engine is one where each cylinder has more than two valves. A multi-valve engine has better breathing and may be able to operate at higher revolutions per minute (RPM) than a two-valve engine, delivering more power.  Multi- valve rationale  = Multi-valve engine design = A multi-valve engine design typically has three, four, or five valves per cylinder to achieve improved performance. Any four-stroke internal combustion engine needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air (and often fuel), and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve bounce. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of multi-valve engines are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some SOHC multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be needed in order to reduce manufacturing costs. * Three-valve cylinder head This has a single large exhaust valve and two smaller intake valves. A three-valve layout allows better breathing than a two-valve head, but the large exhaust valve results in an RPM limit no higher than a two-valve head. The manufacturing cost for this design can be lower than for a four-valve design. The three-valve design was common in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and from 2004 the main valve arrangement used in Ford F-Series trucks, and Ford SUVs. The Ducati ST3 V-twin had 3-valve heads. * Four-valve cylinder head This is the most common type of multi-valve head, with two exhaust valves and two similar (or slightly larger) inlet valves. This design allows similar breathing as compared to a three- valve head, and as the small exhaust valves allow high RPM, this design is very suitable for high power outputs. * Five-valve cylinder head Less common is the five-valve head, with two exhaust valves and three inlet valves. All five valves are similar in size. This design allows excellent breathing, and, as every valve is small, high RPM and very high power outputs are theoretically available. Although, compared to a four-valve engine, a five- valve design should have a higher maximum RPM, and the three inlet ports should give efficient cylinder-filling and high gas turbulence (both desirable traits), it has been questioned whether a five-valve configuration gives a cost-effective benefit over four-valve designs. The rise of direct injection may also make five-valve heads more difficult to engineer, as the injector must take up some space on the head. After making five-valve Genesis engines for several years, Yamaha has reverted to the cheaper four-valve design, examples of the five-valve engines are the various 1.8l 20vT engines manufactured by AUDI AG, later versions of the Ferrari Dino V8 and the very rare 1.6l 4A-GE engine of Toyota. * Beyond five valves For a cylindrical bore and equal-area sized valves, increasing the number of valves beyond five decreases the total valve area. The following table shows the effective areas of differing valve quantities as proportion of cylinder bore. These percentages are based on simple geometry and do not take into account orifices for spark plugs or injectors, but these voids will usually be sited in the \\"dead space\\" unavailable for valves. Also, in practice, intake valves are often larger than exhaust valves in heads with an even number of valves-per- cylinder: * 2 = 50% * 3 = 64% * 4 = 68% * 5 = 68% * 6 = 66% * 7 = 64% * 8 = 61% = Alternative technologies = i-AVLS variable valve timing system on SOHC 4-valve-per-cylinder EJ25 boxer engine at Tokyo Motor Show 2007. Turbocharging and supercharging are technologies that also improve engine breathing, and can be used instead of, or in conjunction with, multi-valve engines. The same applies to variable valve timing and variable intake manifolds. Rotary valves also offer improved engine breathing and high rev performance but these were never very successful. Cylinder head porting, as part of engine tuning, is also used to improve engine performance.  Cars and trucks  = Before 1914 = The first motorcar in the world to have an engine with two overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder was the 1912 Peugeot L76 Grand Prix race car designed by Ernest Henry. Its 7.6-litre monobloc straight-4 with modern hemispherical combustion chambers produced 148 bhp (19.5 HP/Liter(0.32 bhp per cubic inch)). In April 1913, on the Brooklands racetrack in England, a specially built L76 called \\"la Torpille\\" (torpedo) beat the world speed record of 170 km/h. Robert Peugeot also commissioned the young Ettore Bugatti to develop a GP racing car for the 1912 Grand Prix. This chain-driven Bugatti Type 18 had a 5-litre straight-4 with SOHC and three valves per cylinder (two inlet, one exhaust). It produced appr. at 2800 rpm (0.30 bhp per cubic inch) and could reach . The three-valve head would later be used for some of Bugatti's most famous cars, including the 1922 Type 29 Grand Prix racer and the legendary Type 35 of 1924. Both Type 29 and Type 35 had a 100 bhp 2-liter SOHC 24-valve NA straight-8 that produced per cubic inch. = Between 1914 and 1945 = A.L.F.A. 40/60 GP was a fully working early racing car prototype made by the company now called Alfa Romeo. Only one example was built in 1914, which was later modified in 1921. This design of Giuseppe Merosi was the first Alfa Romeo DOHC engine. It had four valves per cylinder, 90-degree valve angle and twin-spark ignition. The GP engine had a displacement of 4.5-liter (4490 cc) and produced at 2950 rpm (14.7 kW/liter), and after modifications in 1921 at 3000 rpm. The top speed of this car was 88-93 mph (140–149 km/h). It wasn't until the 1920s when these DOHC engines came to Alfa road cars like the Alfa Romeo 6C. In 1916 US automotive magazine Automobile Topics described a four-cylinder, four-valve-per-cylinder car engine made by Linthwaite-Hussey Motor Co. of Los Angeles, CA, USA: \\"Firm offers two models of high-speed motor with twin intakes and exhausts.\\". Early multi-valve engines in T-head configuration were the 1917 Stutz straight-4, White Motor Car Model GL 309 CID Dual Valve Mononblock four, and 1919 Pierce- Arrow straight-6 engines. The standard flathead engines of that day were not very efficient and designers tried to improve engine performance by using multiple valves. The Stutz Motor Company used a modified T-head with 16 valves, twin-spark ignition and aluminium pistons to produce 80 bhp (59 kW) at 2400 rpm from a 360.8 cid (5.8-liter) straight-4 (0.22 bhp per cubic inch). Over 2300 of these powerful early multi-valve engines were built. Stutz not only used them in their famous Bearcat sportscar but in their standard touring cars as well. The mono block White Motor Car engine developed 72 horsepower and less than 150 were built, only three are known to exist today. In 1919 Pierce-Arrow introduced its 524.8 cid (8.6-liter) straight-6 with 24 valves. The engine produced 48.6 bhp (0.09 bhp per cubic inch) and ran very quietly, which was an asset to the bootleggers of that era. Multi-valve engines continued to be popular in racing and sports engines. Robert M. Roof, the chief engineer for Laurel Motors, designed his multi-valve Roof Racing Overheads early in the 20th century. Type A 16-valve heads were successful in the teens, Type B was offered in 1918 and Type C 16-valve in 1923. Frank Lockhart drove a Type C overhead cam car to victory in Indiana in 1926. Bugatti also had developed a 1.5-liter OHV straight-4 with four valves per cylinder as far back as 1914 but did not use this engine until after World War I. It produced appr. 30 bhp (22.4 kW) at 2700 rpm (15.4 kW/liter or 0.34 bhp/cid). In the 1920 Voiturettes Grand Prix at Le Mans driver Ernest Friderich finished first in a Bugatti Type 13 with the 16-valve engine, averaging 91.96 km/h. Even more successful was Bugattis clean sweep of the first four places at Brescia in 1921. In honour of this memorable victory all 16-valve-engined Bugattis were dubbed Brescia. From 1920 through 1926 about 2000 were built. Peugeot had a triple overhead cam 5-valve Grand Prix car in 1921. Bentley used multi-valve engines from the beginning. The Bentley 3 Litre, introduced in 1921, used a monobloc straight-4 with aluminium pistons, pent-roof combustion chambers, twin spark ignition, SOHC, and four valves per cylinder. It produced appr. 70 bhp (0.38 bhp per cubic inch). The 1927 Bentley 4½ Litre was of similar engine design. The NA racing model offered 130 bhp (0.48 bhp per cubic inch) and the 1929 supercharged 4½ Litre (Blower Bentley) reached 240 bhp (0.89 bhp per cubic inch). The 1926 Bentley 6½ Litre added two cylinders to the monobloc straight-4. This multi-valve straight-6 offered 180-200 bhp (0.45-0.50 bhp per cubic inch). The 1930 Bentley 8 Litre multi- valve straight-6 produced appr. 220 bhp (0.45 bhp per cubic inch). In 1931 the Stutz Motor Company introduced a 322 cid (5.3-liter) dual camshaft 32-valve straight-8 with 156 bhp (116 kW) at 3900 rpm, called DV-32. The engine offered 0.48 bhp per cubic inch. About 100 of these multi-valve engines were built. Stutz also used them in their top-of-the-line sportscar, the DV-32 Super Bearcat that could reach 100 mph (160 km/h). The 1935 Duesenberg SJ Mormon Meteor's engine was a 419.6 cid (6.9-liter) straight-8 with DOHC, 4 valves per cylinder and a supercharger. It achieved 400 bhp (298.3 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 0.95 bhp per cubic inch. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz W125 racing car used a supercharged 5.7-liter straight-8 with DOHC and four valves per cylinder. The engine produced 592-646 bhp (441.5-475 kW) at 5800 rpm and achieved 1.71-1.87 bhp per cubic inch (77.8-85.1 kW/liter). The W125 top speed was appr. 200 mph (322 km/h). = After 1945 = Ford Ecoboost 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 petrol engine (77.8 kW/liter) showing two intake valves (right), two exhaust valves (left), centrally placed spark plug, and direct fuel injector (right). The 1967 Cosworth DFV F1 engine, a NA 3.0-liter V8 producing appr. at 9,000 rpm (101.9 kW/liter), featured four valves per cylinder. For many years it was the dominant engine in Formula One, and it was also used in other categories, including CART, Formula 3000 and Sportscar racing. Debuting at the 1968 Japanese Grand Prix in the original 3.0-liter version the Toyota 7 engine participated in endurance races as a 5.0-liter (4,968 cc) non-turbo V8 with DOHC and 32-valves. It produced at 8,000 rpm (88.8 kW/liter) and at 6,400 rpm. The first mass-produced car using four valves per cylinder was the British Jensen Healey in 1972 which used a Lotus 907 belt-driven DOHC 16-valve 2-liter straight-4 producing 140 bhp (54.6 kW/liter, 1.20 bhp/cid). What about the Nissan S20 from 1969 used in the Nissan Skyline and Nissan Fairlady Z432? The 1973 Triumph Dolomite Sprint used an in-house developed SOHC 16-valve 1,998 cc (122 ci) straight-4 that produced appr. 127 bhp (47.6 kW/liter, 1.10 bhp/cid). The 1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega featured a DOHC multi-valve head designed by Cosworth Engineering in the UK. This 122-cubic-inch straight-4 produced at 5600 rpm (0.90 bhp/cid; 41.0 kW/liter) and at 4800 rpm. The 1976 Fiat 131 Abarth (51.6 kW/liter), 1976 Lotus Esprit with Lotus 907 engine (54.6 kW/liter, 1.20 bhp/cid), and 1978 BMW M1 with BMW M88 engine (58.7 kW/liter, 1.29 bhp/cid) all used four valves per cylinder. The BMW M88/3 engine was used in the 1983 BMW M635CSi and in the 1985 BMW M5. The 1978 Porsche 935/78 racer used a twin turbo 3.2-liter flat-6 (845 bhp/630 kW@8,200 rpm; 784 Nm/578 ft.lbs@6,600 rpm). The water-cooled engine featured four valves per cylinder and output a massive 196.2 kW/liter. Porsche had to abandon its traditional aircooling because the multi-valve DOHC hampered aircooling of the spark plugs. Only two cars were built. Ferrari developed their Quattrovalvole (or QV) engines in the 80s. Four valves per cylinder were added for the 1982 308 and Mondial Quattrovalvole, bringing power back up to the pre-FI high of . A very unusual Dino Quattrovalvole was used in the 1986 Lancia Thema 8.32. It was based on the 308 QV's engine, but used a split-plane crankshaft rather than the Ferrari-type flat-plane. The engine was constructed by Ducati rather than Ferrari, and was produced from 1986 through 1991. The Quattrovalvole was also used by Lancia for their attempt at the World Sportscar Championship with the LC2. The engine was twin-turbocharged and destroked to 2.65 litres, but produced in qualifying trim. The engine was later increased to 3.0 litres and increased power output to . The 1984 Ferrari Testarossa had a 4.9-liter flat-12 with four valves per cylinder. Almost 7,200 Testarossa were produced between 1984 and 1991. In 1985 Lamborghini released a Countach Quattrovalvole, producing from a 5.2-liter (5167 cc) Lamborghini V12 engine (64.8 kW/liter). The Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16 with 16-valve engine debuted at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 1983 after it set a world record at Nardo, Italy, recording a combined average speed of over the endurance test. The engine was based on the 2.3-liter 8-valve 136 hp (101 kW) unit already fitted to the 190- and E-Class series. Cosworth developed the DOHC light alloy cast cylinder head with four large valves per cylinder. In roadgoing trim, the 190 E 2.3-16 produced 49 hp (36 kW) and 41 ft•lbf (55 N•m) of torque more than the basic single overhead cam 2.3 straight-4 engine on which it was based offering at 6,200 rpm (59.2 kW/liter) and at 4,500 rpm. In 1988 an enlarged 2.5-liter engine replaced the 2.3-liter. It offered double valve timing chains to fix the easily snapping single chains on early 2.3 engines, and increased peak output by 17 bhp (12.5 kW) with a slight increase in torque. For homologation Evolution I (1989) and Evolution II (1990) models were produced that had a redesigned engine to allow for a higher rev limit and improved top-end power capabilities. The Evo II engine offered from 2463 cc (70.2 kW/liter). Saab introduced a 16-valve head to their 2.0-liter (1985 cc) straight-4 in 1984 and offered the engine with and without turbocharger (65.5 kW/liter and 47.9 kW/liter respectively) in the Saab 900 and Saab 9000. The 2.0-liter Nissan FJ20 was one of the earliest straight-4 mass-produced Japanese engines to have both a DOHC 16-valve configuration (four valves per cylinder, two intake, two exhaust) and electronic fuel injection (EFI) when released in October 1981 in the sixth generation Nissan Skyline. Peak output was at 6,000 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. The FJ20 was also offered with a turbocharger, producing at 6,400 rpm and at 4,800 rpm. Following Nissan's lead, the 1.6-liter (1,587 cc) Toyota 4A-GE Toyota engine was released in 1983. The cylinder head was developed by Yamaha Motor Corporation and was built at Toyota's Shimayama plant. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation. It produced 115-140 bhp/86-104 kW@6,600 rpm (54.2-65.5 kW/liter) and 148 Nm/109 lbft@5,800 rpm. To compensate for the reduced air speed of a multi-valve engine at low rpm, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature. In 1986 Volkswagen introduced a multi- valved Golf GTI 16V. The 16-valve 1.8-liter straight-4 produced 139 PS (102 kW; 137 bhp) or 56.7 kW/liter, almost 25% up from the 45.6 kW/liter for the previous 8-valve Golf GTI engine. The GM Quad 4 multi-valve engine family debuted early 1987. The Quad 4 was the first mainstream multi-valve engine to be produced by GM after the Chevrolet Cosworth Vega. The NA Quad 4 achieved per cubic inch (49.1 kW/liter). Such engines soon became common as Japanese manufacturers adopted the multi-valve concept.  Three valves  A cylinder head from a 1987 Honda CRX Si showing SOHC, rocker arms, valve springs, and other components. This is a multi-valve configuration with two intake valves and one exhaust valve for each cylinder. The 1975 Honda Civic introduced Honda's 1.5-liter SOHC 12-valve straight-4 engines. Nissan's 1988–1992 SOHC KA24E engine had three valves per cylinder (two intakes, one exhaust) as well. Nissan upgraded to the DOHC after 1992 for some of the sports cars, including the 240SX. In 1988, Renault released a 12 valve version of its Douvrin 4 cylinder 2.0l SOHC. Mercedes and Ford produce three-valve V6 and V8 engines, Ford claiming an 80% improvement in high RPM breathing without the added cost of a DOHC valve train. The Ford design uses one spark plug per cylinder located in the centre, but the Mercedes design uses two spark plugs per cylinder located on opposite sides, leaving the centre free to add a direct-to-cylinder fuel injector at a later date. The 1989 Citroën XM was the first 3-valve diesel-engined car.  Four valves  Nissan SR20VE 2.0-liter straight-4-cylinder head with DOHC, Nissan's Neo VVL variable valve timing with lift control and four valves per cylinder. Multi-valve train of Volvo's 2005 truck diesel engine D13A, a 12.8-liter turbocharged straight-6 (21.1-28.1 kW/liter) with SOHC and four valves per cylinder located around a central injector, and VEB engine brake that operates both exhaust valves. Examples of SOHC four-valve engines include: the Honda F-series engines, D-series engines, all J-series engines, the R-series engines, the Mazda B8-ME, the Chrysler 3.5 L V6 engine. The V12 engines of many World War II fighter aircraft also used a SOHC configuration with four valves for each cylinder. The 1993 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (OM604 engine) was the first 4-valve diesel- engined car.  Five valves  Peugeot had a triple overhead cam five- valve Grand Prix car in 1921. In April 1988 an Audi 200 Turbo Quattro powered by an experimental 2.2-liter turbocharged 25-valve straight-5 rated at 478 kW/650 PS@6,200 rpm (217.3 kW/liter) set two world speed records at Nardo, Italy: 326.403 km/h (202.8 mph) for 1,000 km (625 miles) and 324.509 km/h (201.6 mph) for 500 miles. Mitsubishi were the first to market a car engine with five valves per cylinder, with the 548 cc 3G81 engine in their Minica Dangan ZZ kei car in 1989. Yamaha designed the five-valve cylinder head for the Toyota 4A-GE 20V 1991 Silvertop and 1995 Blacktop engine used in some Toyota Corolla. Yamaha also developed five-valve Formula One engines, the 1989 OX88 V8, 1991 OX99 V12, 1993 OX10 V10 and 1996 OX11 V10, but none of these were very successful. For their YZ250F and YZ450F motocross bikes, Yamaha developed five-valve engines. Bugatti (EB 110), Ferrari (F355, 360 and F50), Volkswagen - Audi (Audi Quattro) - Skoda (Octavia vRS) and Toyota (4A-GE 20V) have all produced five-valve-engined vehicles.  Six valves  In 1985, Maserati made an experimental 2.0-liter turbo V6 engine with six valves per cylinder (three intakes, three exhaust). It achieved at 7,200 rpm (97.5 kW/liter).  Pushrod  Although most multi-valve engines have overhead camshafts, either SOHC or DOHC, a multivalve engine may be a pushrod overhead valve engine (OHV) design. Chevrolet has revealed a three-valve version of its Generation IV V8 which uses pushrods to actuate forked rockers, and Cummins makes a four-valve OHV straight six diesel, the Cummins B Series (now known as ISB). Ford also uses pushrods in its 6.7L Power Stroke engine using four pushrods, four rockers and four valves per cylinder. The Harley-Davidson Milwaukee Eight engine, introduced in 2016, uses four-valves per cylinder driven by pushrods and a single in-block camshaft.  Turbocharged  The 1980 Lotus Essex Turbo Esprit (with type 910 2.2-liter inline four engine) was the first production car to use a multi-valve turbocharged engine.

The Yamaha XT660 single once had five valves per cylinder, but a subsequent redesign reduced the valve-count to four. The Aprilia Pegaso 650 single also started out with five valves, but current models only have four. The jointly developed BMW F650 single always had four valves.

Appr. 6,400 engines were produced. Packard Merlin 28 V12 aircraft engine showing SOHC and four valves per cylinder. This widely used supercharged WWII engine produced from 1,649 cid (38.5 kW/liter). Ettore Bugatti designed several multi-valve aircraft engines. The 1916 Bugatti U-16 1484.3 cid (24.32 L) SOHC 16-cylinder, consisting of two parallel 8-cylinder banks, offered 410 bhp (305 kW) at 2,000 rpm (12.5 kW/liter or 0.28 bhp/cid). Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. Other advanced World War I aircraft engines, such as the 1916 Maybach Mb.IVa that produced at altitude and the 1916 Benz Bz.IV with aluminium pistons and the 1918 Napier Lion (a 450 bhp 24-liter DOHC 12-cylinder), used two intake valves and two exhaust valves. Long after the King-Bugatti \\"U-16\\" aviation engine used them, shortly before World War II, the Junkers aviation firm began production of the Third Reich's most-produced military aviation engine (68,000+ produced), the 1936-designed, 35-litre displacement, inverted-V12, liquid-cooled Junkers Jumo 211, which used a three-valve cylinder head designGerman language illistration of Jumo 211 three-valve design inherited from Junkers' first inverted V12 design, the 1932-origin Junkers Jumo 210 — this was carried through into the later, more powerful 1940-origin Junkers Jumo 213, produced through 1945, the production versions of which (the Jumo 213A and -E subtypes) retained the Jumo 211's three-valve cylinder head design. The V12 engines of many World War II fighter aircraft used a SOHC configuration with four valves for each cylinder. An example of a modern multi-valve piston-engine for small aircraft is the Austro Engine AE300. This liquid-cooled turbocharged 2.0-liter (1,991 cc) DOHC 16-valve straight-4 diesel engine uses common rail direct fuel injection and delivers at 3,880 rpm (62.0 kW/liter). The propeller is driven by an integrated gearbox (ratio 1.69:1) with torsional vibration damper. Total power unit weight is .  Boats  In 1905 car builder Delahaye had experimented with a DOHC marine racing engine with six valves per cylinder. This Delahaye Titan engine was a massive 5190 cid (85.0-liter) four-cylinder that produced 350 bhp (0.07 bhp/cid). It allowed the motor boat Le Dubonnet piloted by Emile Dubonnet to set a new world's speed record on water, reaching on the lake at Juvisy, near Paris, France. An example of modern multi-valve engines for small boats is the Volvo Penta IPS Series. These joystick-operated seawater-cooled inboard diesel engines use combined charging (turbo and supercharger, except IPS450) with aftercooler, common rail fuel injection and DOHCs with hydraulic 4-valve technology. Propshaft power ranges from (highest efficiency 59.7 kW/liter for IPS400 3.7-liter straight-4 diesel). Multiple units can be combined.  References  In direct injection engines - such as diesels and later petrol engines - fuel is delivered to the chamber directly via the injector rather than through a valve. In carburetted engines and indirect- injection engines the fuel is mixed with the air outside of the cylinder and both enter together via the intake valve.

Inaction where some action is socially customary is a typical passive-aggressive strategy (showing up late for functions, staying silent when a response is expected). Such behavior is sometimes protested by associates, evoking exasperation or confusion. It may be an expression of difficulty in dealing with one's negative emotions. It is an act if it is occasional and does not substantially interfere with social or occupational function, or relationships; it is a behavior if it is used persistently. Application =Psychology= In psychology, \\"passive- aggression\\" is one of the most misused of psychological terms. After some debate, the American Psychiatric Association dropped the behavior pattern from the list of personality disorders in the DSM IV as too narrow to be a full- blown diagnosis and not well enough supported by scientific evidence to meet increasingly rigorous standards of definition. Culturally, the ambiguous \\"passive-aggressive\\" label is misused by lay persons and professionals alike. The removal of the passive-aggressive personality definition from the official diagnostic manual was in large measure because of the frequent misapplication and because of the often contradictory and unclear descriptions clinicians in the field provided. Most of the definitions which follow (which had previously been classified as passive-aggressive) are often more correctly described as overt aggression, or covert aggression (which is the correct definition to describe subtle, deliberate, calculating and underhanded tactics that manipulators and other disturbed characters use to intimidate, control, deceive and abuse others). Outdated definition rejected by the American Psychiatric Association follows: \\"Passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non-active resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, sullenness, stubbornness, and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace, where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors as procrastination, forgetfulness, and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by authority figures, but it can also occur in interpersonal contexts. Another source characterizes passive-aggressive behavior as: \\"a personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations. Behaviors: learned helplessness, procrastination, stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is (often explicitly) responsible\\". Other examples of passive- aggressive behavior might include avoiding direct or clear communication, evading problems, fear of intimacy or competition, making excuses, blaming others, obstructionism, playing the victim, feigning compliance with requests, sarcasm, backhanded compliments, and hiding anger. =Conflict theory= In conflict theory, passive-aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as catty, as it consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non- assertive style of passive resistance. = Work = Passive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. In the ad for Warner's online ebook, it says: \\"The worst case of passive- aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity, sullenness, resentment, procrastination, 'forgetting' to do something, chronic lateness, and intentional inefficiency.\\" If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers.. If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. De Angelis says, \\"It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes.\\".  History  Passive- aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel William Menninger during World War II in the context of men's reaction to military compliance. Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their civil disobedience (what he called \\"aggressiveness\\") \\"by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism\\" due to what Menninger saw as an \\"immaturity\\" and a reaction to \\"routine military stress\\". According to some psychoanalytic views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.

Early life and early career Brambles was born in Harlow,Radio Rewind - BBC Radio 1 People - Jakki Brambles Retrieved 2016-10-19. Essex, England and grew up in Ayrshire, Scotland, where she went to secondary school at Ayr Academy in Fort Street, Ayr. She also began her radio career on local radio station West Sound in Ayr when she was 19. Career She then joined Capital London in 1987 as its youngest DJ, and after a year on the evening show joined the BBC in 1988 as the first female presenter (same as Annie Nightingale) to get her own prime time show on the national pop network BBC Radio 1. She took on the Radio 1's early morning show, initially at weekends, before graduating to the weekday equivalent. She also joined her colleagues on the Top of the Pops presentation roster. When Sybil Ruscoe left her role as Simon Mayo's weather and travel reporter on the breakfast show, Brambles took over that slot, thereby keeping her on air every day over two separate programmes. On her own shows she sometimes worked standing up to maintain a more \\"live\\" feel, claiming she found it difficult to keep her demeanour lively enough if she was seated. The combination with Mayo worked quite well until a minor revamp in 1990 saw Brambles progress to a 90-minute drivetime show and then, to the important lunchtime slot when Gary Davies went to weekends. In 1993 she married a Scotsman named Jim Sherry and left BBC Radio 1 in 1994 to move to the United States, where she lived for 11 years. The marriage ended in 1998. There was a plan to make her an American showbiz reporter for the BBC but this never transpired. Instead, she re- branded herself as the more maturely-spelt Jackie Brambles, and entered American broadcasting in San Francisco as a news radio morning anchor and occasional television news anchor for the CBS network. She also worked as a media consultant to several high-profile companies in Silicon Valley, including Intel, Oracle and Sony. Following a move to Los Angeles in 1999, she took on the role of foreign correspondent for GMTV, interviewing almost every major star in Hollywood as well as covering major news events including two presidential elections and the events of 9/11. Six months after returning to the UK in 2005, Brambles married David Todd, who works in financial services and had her first child. After leaving GMTV, she made several guest appearances on Loose Women in 2005. During Kaye Adams's maternity leave in 2006, Brambles hosted the show in Adams' place, which led to her becoming the new leading host of the show. On 7 August 2009, she closed her final show, after presenting 316 episodes between 2005 and 2009.

AOR evolved from hard rock and progressive rock radio in the mid-1970s, using research and formal programming to create an album rock format with greater commercial appeal. History =Freeform and progressive= The roots of the album-oriented rock radio format began with programming concepts rooted in 1960s idealism. The freeform and progressive formats developed the repertoire and set the tone that would dominate AOR playlists for much of its heyday. In July 1964, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a non-duplication rule prohibiting FM radio stations from merely running a simulcast of the programming from their AM counterparts. Owners of AM/FM affiliate stations fought these new regulations vigorously, delaying enactment of the new rules until January 1, 1967.Gent, George. \\"AM-FM Radio Stations Ready For the Great Divide Tomorrow\\" New York Times December 31, 1966: 39 When finally enacted, station owners were pressed to come up with alternative programming options. The freeform format in commercial radio was born out of the desire to program the FM airwaves inexpensively. Programmers like Tom Donahue at KMPX in San Francisco developed stations where DJs had freedom to play long sets of music, often covering a variety of genres. Songs were not limited to hits or singles; indeed the DJs often played obscure or longer tracks by newer or more adventurous artists than heard on Top 40 stations of the day. This reflected the growth of albums as opposed to singles as rock's main artistic vehicle for expression in the 1960s and 1970s. With a few exceptions, commercial freeform had a relatively brief life. With more and more listeners acquiring FM radios, the stakes became higher for stations to attract market share so that they could sell more advertising at a higher rate. By 1970 many of the stations were moving to institute programming rules with a \\"clock\\" and system of \\"rotation\\". With this shift, stations' formats in the early 1970s were now billed as progressive. DJs still had much input over the music they played, and the selection was deep and eclectic, ranging from folk to hard rock with other styles such as jazz fusion occasionally thrown in. =1970s= In October 1971, WPLJ in New York began to shift its free-form progressive rock format into a more tightly formatted hit oriented rock format, similar to what would later become known as album-oriented rock. WPLJ's parent company ABC installed similar formats on all of its FM stations including KLOS in Los Angeles and WRIF in Detroit. In 1973 Lee Abrams, formerly at WRIF, successfully installed a similar format, later known as SuperStars, at WQDR in Raleigh, North Carolina. In 1972, Ron Jacobs, program director at KGB-FM in San Diego, began using detailed listener research and expanded playlists in shifting the top 40 station towards a progressive rock format. Meanwhile, at competing station KPRI, program director Mike Harrison was similarly applying top 40 concepts to the progressive format which he dubbed \\"album-oriented rock.\\"Peeples, Stephen. Rock Around the World March 1977: 21 In the mid-1970s, as program directors began to put more controls over what songs were played on air, progressive stations evolved into the album-oriented rock format. Stations still played longer songs and deep album tracks (rather than just singles), but program directors and consultants took on a greater role in song selection, generally limiting airplay to just a few \\"focus tracks\\" from a particular album and concentrating on artists with a more slickly produced \\"commercial\\" sound than what had been featured a few years earlier. Noted DJ \\"Kid Leo\\" Travagliante of influential station WMMS in Cleveland observed the changes in a 1975 interview: \\"I think the '60s are ending about now. Now we are really starting the '70s. The emphasis is shifting back to entertainment instead of being 'relevant'...In fact, I wouldn't call our station progressive radio. That's outdated. I call it radio. But I heard a good word in the trades, AOR. That's Album-Oriented Rock. That's a name for the '70s.\\"Scott, Jane. \\"Rock reverberations\\" The Plain Dealer November 28, 1975: Action Tab p. 26 Radio consultants Kent Burkhart and Lee Abrams had a significant impact on AOR programming. Beginning in the mid-1970s they began contracting with what would become over 100 stations by the 1980s. Abrams had developed a format called SuperStars, pioneering it at WQDR, and had been very successful in delivering high ratings. The SuperStars format was based on extensive research and focused on the most popular artists such as Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles and also included older material by those artists.King, Bill. \\"Burkhart Opens Doors To Suite and Format Secrets\\" Billboard September 23, 1978: 22 While his SuperStars format was not quite as tight as Top 40 radio, it was considerably more restricted than freeform or progressive radio. Their firm advised program directors for a substantial segment of AOR stations all over the US. By the late 1970s, AOR radio discarded the wide range of genres embraced earlier on to focus on a more narrowly defined rock sound. The occasional folk, jazz, and blues selections became rarer and most black artists were effectively eliminated from airplay. Whereas earlier soul, funk, and R&B; artists like Stevie Wonder, War, Sly Stone and others had been championed by the format, AOR was no longer representing these styles,Goldstein, Patrick. \\"FM Radio: Redneck Rock?\\" Los Angeles Times September 21, 1980: T80 and took a stance against disco. In 1979, Steve Dahl of WLUP in Chicago destroyed disco records on his radio show, culminating in the notorious Disco Demolition Night at Comiskey Park. What links the freeform, progressive, and AOR formats are the continuity of rock artists and songs carried through each phase. Programmers and DJs of the freeform and progressive phases continued to cultivate a repertoire of rock music and style of delivery that were foundations of AOR and classic rock radio. Those AOR stations, which decided to stay \\"demographically-rooted\\", became classic rock stations by eschewing newer bands and styles which their older listeners might tune out. Those that did not fully evolve into classic rock generally attempted to hold on to their older listeners through careful dayparting, playing large amounts of classic rock during the 9–5 workday shift while newer material was played at night when the listener base skewed younger. Programming Most radio formats are based on a select, tight rotation of hit singles. The best example is Top 40, though other formats, like country, smooth jazz, and urban all utilize the same basic principles, with the most popular songs repeating every two to six hours, depending on their rank in the rotation. Generally there is a strict order or list to be followed and the DJ does not make decisions about what selections are played. AOR, while still based on the rotation concept, focused on the album as a whole (rather than singles). In the early 1970s, many DJs had the freedom to choose which track(s) to play off a given album—as well as latitude to decide in what order to play the records. Consequently, AOR radio gave mainstream exposure to album tracks that never became hits on the record charts that were limited to singles; Billboard, for instance, did not establish an airplay chart for album tracks until 1981. Later in the 1970s AOR formats became tighter and song selection shifted to the program director or music director, rather than the DJ. Still, when an AOR station added an album to rotation they would often focus on numerous tracks at once, rather than playing the singles as they were individually released. Criticism In the early 1980s, AOR radio was criticized by the Black Music Association, a trade association, and other industry observers for the lack of black artists included in their programming. AOR programmers responded that the lack of diversity was the result of increased specialization of radio formats driven by ratings and audience demographics.Thompson, Bill. \\"As Formats Change, Cries of Bias Arise\\" Philadelphia Inquirer February 15, 1982: D1Heron, Kim and Graff, Gary. \\"Racism in the World of Rock/On Some Stations, Blacks Hardly Ever Make the Airwaves\\" Detroit Free Press January 9, 1983: 1C In 1983, the undeniable success of Michael Jackson's album Thriller led some AOR stations to soften their stance by adding Jackson's \\"Beat It\\", which featured Eddie Van Halen, to their playlists. At the same time, other black artists also made inroads into AOR radio—Prince's \\"Little Red Corvette\\", Eddy Grant's \\"Electric Avenue\\" and \\"Beat It\\" all debuted on Billboard's Top Tracks chart the same week in April 1983, and through the remainder of the 1980s Jon Butcher, Tracy Chapman, Living Colour, Prince and Lenny Kravitz did manage to receive AOR airplay of varying magnitude. Spin-off formats In the 1980s some AOR radio stations added glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Bon Jovi, while others embraced modern rock acts such as the Fixx, INXS and U2. But by the end of the decade, AOR stations were playing fewer and fewer new artists and the rise of grunge, alternative and hip-hop accelerated the fade-out of the album-oriented rock format. By the early 1990s many AOR stations switched exclusively to the classic rock format or segued to other current formats with somewhat of an AOR approach: * Rock 40 – A service marked format developed by Joint Communications in 1987, and referred to as \\"Male CHR\\" by Burkhart, Douglas & Associates, which had difficulty because it was too close to other AOR formats and did not appeal to CHR fans because of the lack of music other than rock. Lee Abrams said the format was \\"too wimpy for the real rockers and too hard for the mainstream people.\\" Most of these stations were considered in the radio trade publications to be Top 40/CHR stations rather than AOR. For a time in the mid to late 1980s, Cleveland's WMMS considered themselves to be a Rock 40 station.Kojan, Harvey (November 17, 1989). \\"Rock 40 Vs. AOR: The Story So Far\\". (PDF). Radio & Records p. 52. \\"WMMS the nation's heritage Rock 40...\\" https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR- IDX/IDX/80s/89/RR-1989-11-17-OCR- Page-0052.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwj9l764n8PnAhXStp4KHUw2D84QFjADegQIBBAB&usg;=AOvVaw2ooD0FEaIe1bFek2T9Xs8A From 1989 until 1991, WAAF in Worcester–Boston, Massachusetts considered themselves to be a Rock 40 station. The most successful Rock 40 station however when it came to duration with the format was KEGL The Eagle in Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas which was mostly a rock leaning top 40 station from 1981 until 1992. * Active rock – The modern-day mainstream AOR, playing artists such as Stone Temple Pilots, Nickelback, Creed, Foo Fighters, Linkin Park, and Korn. The active rock format was pioneered by the now-defunct KNAC- FM of Long Beach/Los Angeles, California in 1986. KNAC program director/DJ Tom Marshall and music director/DJ Michael Davis had previously worked at rock station KFMG in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Active rock was also pioneered by the nationally syndicated Z Rock network, which lasted from 1986 to 1996, and expanded upon by WXTB out of Clearwater, Florida starting in 1990. * Adult album alternative (known as Triple A or AAA) – Echoed a softer AOR without hard rock or heavy metal. For a time Seattle's KMTT even promoted \\"Freeform Fridays\\", and the Grey Pony Tail Special to highlight the halcyon days of FM radio. WXRT in Chicago is a long-running AAA station. Other Triple A stations with strong heritage are KINK in Portland, Oregon and KBCO in Denver-Boulder, Colorado. * Modern rock or alternative rock – Pioneers in this format were KROQ-FM in L.A. and XETRA-FM (91X) in San Diego, taking the AOR programming approach to music with new wave, punk, college rock, and grunge/alternative leanings, mostly in the 1980s. * Classic rock – Developed from the album- oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s. The classic rock format features music ranging generally from the late 1960s to the mid 1990s, primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s.

It was an Assembly Sponsored Public Body. It began its life under John Walter Jones OBE, and its last chief executive was Meirion Prys Jones, with Meri Huws acting as chair. It received an annual government grant of £13m which was used to \\"promote and facilitate\\" the use of the Welsh language. The board was responsible for administering the Welsh Language Act and for seeing that public bodies in Wales kept to its terms. Over 500 Welsh language schemes were agreed with a range of bodies named under the provisions of the act. In cases where there were concerns that public bodies were not complying with their Welsh language schemes, the board could hold a statutory investigation. If the board's investigations indicated that an organisation has broken its own Welsh language scheme, it could produce recommendations to the organisation and, ultimately, refer the matter to the minister for heritage at the Welsh Assembly Government. The board's private sector and business team worked with a wide variety of large and small companies. Since launching the private sector Welsh language policy in November 2008, over 100 businesses produced a policy, and 150 companies signed up to the Board's \\"Investing in Welsh scheme\\", indicating support for the language. The Welsh Language Board was at the forefront of promoting bilingual design, in part by making annual bilingual awards. In 2006, winners included FBA, Glass Hammer, Synergy Creative Design & Marketing, Hoffi, 6721, Elfen, Zodshop and Departures. In winter 2004 Rhodri Morgan, previous First Minister of Wales, announced his decision to abolish the Welsh Language Board. This decision evoked a mixed reaction throughout Wales: welcomed by Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg but met with scepticism by others.

Initially his death was recorded with an open verdict, before being ruled as unlawful killing by a jury on appeal and finally returned to an open verdict by the High Court. Background Stanley was born in Bellshill, near Glasgow, Scotland, where he lived for the first 19 years of his life. He moved to London in the early 1970s in search of work, and married his childhood sweetheart, Irene. They had three children, and grandchildren, and lived in Hackney, east London. He had a previous criminal record, being convicted of armed robbery in 1974, and had served 4 years in prison for grievous bodily harm. This was unknown to the police officers who responded to the call about \\"an Irishman with a gun wrapped in a bag\\". The 46-year-old painter and decorator had recently been released from hospital after an operation for colon cancer at the time of his death. Shooting On 22 September 1999, Stanley was returning home from the Alexandra Pub in South Hackney carrying, in a plastic bag, a table leg that had been repaired by his brother earlier that day. Someone had phoned the police to report \\"an Irishman with a gun wrapped in a bag\\". At the junction of Fremont Street and Victoria Park Road in South Hackney, close to his home, Inspector Neil Sharman and PC Kevin Fagan, the crew of a Metropolitan Police Armed Response Vehicle challenged Stanley from behind. As he turned to face them, they shot him dead at a distance of 15 feet (5 m). Hearings =First inquest= The first inquest jury in 2002 returned an open verdict. Stanley's family were unhappy with this outcome, particularly as the coroner, Dr. Stephen Chan, had only allowed the jury to return either a verdict of lawful killing or an open verdict. =Judicial review= Stanley's widow, Irene, petitioned the High Court and succeeded in obtaining a judicial review of the first inquest. On 7 April 2003 Mr. Justice Sieber ordered a fresh inquest after ruling that there had been an \\"insufficient inquiry\\". During the new hearing, coroner Dr. Andrew Reid heard that the two officers fired the shots after being given wrong information in a tipoff; they had been told that Stanley was carrying a weapon and had an Irish accent. The new jury returned a verdict, in November 2004, of unlawful killing, which resulted in the suspension of the officers involved. In protest at the suspensions, over 120 out of the 400 Metropolitan Police officers authorised to use firearms handed in their firearms authorisation cards, with Glen Smyth, a Police Federation spokesman saying, \\"The officers are very concerned that the tactics they are trained in, as a consequence of the verdict, are now in doubt.\\" The officers' suspensions were lifted shortly afterwards. =High Court= In May 2005 the High Court decided that there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" for the verdict of unlawful killing, overturning it and reinstating the open verdict of the first inquest. Mr. Justice Leveson also decided a third inquest should not be held, but added his weight to calls for reform of the inquest system. Glen Smyth described the ruling as \\"common sense\\", but the campaign group Inquest was disappointed, saying the verdict sent \\"a message that families cannot have any confidence in the system. They feel they cannot get justice when a death in custody occurs.\\" Police action On 2 June 2005 the two officers involved in the shooting were arrested and interviewed, following an investigation by Surrey Police involving new forensic evidence. The Crown Prosecution Service decided in October 2005 not to press charges, saying that they \\"concluded that the prosecution evidence is insufficient to rebut the officers' assertion that they were acting in self defence\\". On 9 February 2006 the Independent Police Complaints Commission published their report into the incident, recommending that no further disciplinary action be taken against the officers. Representatives of the Stanley family expressed their \\"bitter disappointment\\" and stated the case was a failure of the criminal justice system. The Metropolitan Police Federation stated, \\"We are, of course, delighted by the vindication of the officers. But we remain deeply disturbed at the way the whole matter has been handled.\\" The report did make notable recommendations to the police in the post-incident procedure to be followed after a shooting.

They are better known as O. P. Van Sweringen and M. J. Van Sweringen, or by their collective nickname, the Vans. The brothers came from a farming area near Wooster, Ohio. Their father was for a time an engineer in the oil fields of Pennsylvania, fought in the Civil War and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. The family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in about 1890. Neither brother married; the two shared a common bedroom in their 54-room mansion, Roundwood Manor, on the grounds of their estate, Daisy Hill, in Hunting Valley, Ohio. During their lifetimes, they seldom gave interviews or made appearances in public; however, when they did, it was always together. Career =Real estate and Shaker Heights= Before the establishment of Shaker Heights, Ohio, the brothers were land and building speculators in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1909, the Van Sweringen brothers began exercising options on 1,399 acres (5.7 km²) of land formerly owned by the North Union Community of the Society of Believers, better known as the Shakers. Conceived and planned as a garden community similar to Baltimore's Roland Park, Shaker Village soon became Cleveland's most sought-after address. This was achieved through a combination of planning, design review, and convenience - all of which fell under the strict supervision of the Van Sweringens. Street planning for the new community used curved roads instead of the more usual grid pattern of streets found in many American communities. Three tree-lined boulevards extended eastward into the country. Moreland and Shaker boulevards' center isles would be used for trackbed for a planned interurban streetcar line. Both lines would share a common route from Cleveland through Shaker Square (recognized as the second modern planned shopping center in the United States) where they would divide onto their own routes. The Van Sweringens designated Shaker Boulevard as a grand boulevard of mansions, fronted by generous setbacks from the interurban tracks. Higher- density luxury apartments were planned for Moreland Boulevard, which was renamed Van Aken Boulevard in honor of the city's first mayor. Building in Shaker was controlled by a set of restrictive covenants and building guidelines established by the Van Sweringens and known as Shaker Standards. Shaker Standards prevented the community from being developed in any way contrary to how the Van Sweringens intended, including barring African Americans. Standards limited commercial development, rental property development, and residence style and size. Standards set roof slope angles, materials, finishes, and garage placement. All residences were required to be unique and designed by an architect. Duplex residences in the community were restricted to designated areas and were required to follow guidelines designed to give the impression that a structure was a single-family home. By 1920, the Van Sweringens controlled more than 4,000 acres (16 km²) in the community, which reached city status in 1931. Since lots sold slowly, the brothers concluded that Shaker Heights needed a transportation system between the suburb and downtown. =Railroad projects= In 1913, the Van Sweringens established the Cleveland Interurban Railroad, which managed the operation of their streetcar lines in what is now Cleveland Heights, Ohio. In order to provide convenience to residents of Shaker Heights, the Van Sweringens planned a high-speed interurban styled electric rail line, which was christened Shaker Heights Rapid Transit and commonly known as the Rapid. This prompted the Van Sweringens to purchase land in the vicinity of Public Square in downtown Cleveland as early as 1909 to provide a terminus for their rapid transit line. Their Rapids could travel at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h), but the line could not be moved farther west than 34th Street. In order to meet the Van Sweringens' guidelines that the Rapid would not travel in street traffic, the brothers bought a 51% interest in the 523-mile (842-km) New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road) in 1915 from the New York Central Railroad. The route gave the Van Sweringens an unobstructed path to downtown Cleveland. From this acquisition, the Van Sweringens formed the Nickel Plate Securities Corporation, from which they would use investor money to buy a controlling interest in other major United States rail companies. At their zenith in 1928, the Van Sweringens controlled 30,000 miles (50,000 km) of rail worth $3 billion, nearly all of it purchased through credit. Lines under their control included the Erie Railroad, Pere Marquette Railway, Hocking Valley Railway, and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. They managed to control this huge (for the time) system by a maze of holding companies (including the Alleghany Corporation) and interlocking directorships. To solve the problem of the passenger station, the Van Sweringens purchased more rights-of-way that gave them access to the area below the southwest corner of Cleveland's Public Square. Again, the Van Sweringens planned another city within a city to solve their rail dilemma; the result was the Union Terminal Complex, a mix of high-rise offices, shopping, and hotel aboveground, with a train depot and rapid station below grade. The centerpiece of this massive complex was named Terminal Tower, which was the second tallest skyscraper in the United States at the time of its completion. =The Terminal Tower= The Van Sweringens realized that if their plans for a Public Square station were to succeed, they would have to include all the electric railways — streetcars, rapid transit, and interurban lines — as well as local freight and warehousing facilities. Following the suggestion of an official of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, they added plans to include steam railways. On March 1, 1917, the engineers of the Erie Railroad, the Nickel Plate, and the Cleveland Terminal Company reported that a new freight-and-passenger terminal located on Public Square in downtown Cleveland would be economical. The plan provided twelve stub-end tracks for the steam passenger trains, with loops for local and interurban cars above. The space above the tracks was to be developed for stores and office buildings. In 1918, A.H. Smith, the Eastern Director of the United States Railroad Administration and the president of the New York Central Railroad, asked whether or not the proposed facility could be sufficiently enlarged to include the railroads using the lakefront station. Thus, it was Smith who initiated the idea for a \\"Union Station\\" on Public Square. In 1919, the Pennsylvania Railroad withdrew from the project. Smith, in his capacity as the president of the NYCRR, allied with the Van Sweringens, and fiercely opposed Pennsylvania Railroad.Rose, Mark H. et al. (2006). The best transportation system in the world: railroads, trucks, airlines, and American public policy in the twentieth century. Ohio State University Press. . p. 252. In 1923, the Van Sweringens announced their plans to build The Terminal Tower (a tall building to increase office space) over the Union Station to compare to the Woolworth Building in New York City. It was necessary to design the buildings to avoid vibrations from the trains below. Construction began in 1926 as 16 caissons each went down 200 to 250 feet (60 to 75 m) to support the weight of the building. Construction was completed in 1930. In 1973, Amtrak chose to move out of the station, instead serving a small station along the lake route, ending intercity service to the station, though Cleveland Rapid Transit continued its local services. In 1975, the Rapid and other municipal rail and bus routes were combined under the auspices of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. The station area was converted into a shopping mall known as Tower City Center, which opened in 1990. Decline and death The fortunes of the Van Sweringens rose in the 1920s. By 1929, their holdings were valued at $3 billion, mostly as a result of the high valuation of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the Great Depression, the brothers' rail empire suffered financial difficulties. Loans were foreclosed upon and assets were sold to meet interest payments for their debts. In 1933, O.P. Van Sweringen testified before the United States Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, in Washington, D.C., and during testimony, described their complex business dealings as it related to railroads. M.J. Van Sweringen's health began to decline in 1934, and he died on December 12, 1934. O.P. died on board a train near Hoboken of coronary thrombosis on November 22, 1936. At the time of his death, O.P.'s net worth was less than $3,000.

History  Main Campus Main Gate The gate of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in winter = Founding (1952–1954) = In 1952, the Central Government of China sought to construct a new higher education system for the rapid development of economy, science and technology after Chinese Civil War. Three technical institutes were planned to be established in Wuhan, including Huazhong Institute of Technology (HIT, 华中工学院), South-Central China Institute of Power Engineering () and South-Central China Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power () . In March 1953, the institute's charter was signed by the South-Central China Government under the approval of the Central Government of China. In the original planning, the land south of the Yujia Hill was chosen for the three campuses. Physicist was appointed as chair of the three-institute initiative. Economist Zhang Peigang was appointed as chief in planning to lead the HIT initiative. In June 1953, the land south of the East Lake was chosen as the campus of South-Central China Institute of Water Conservancy and Electric Power. The same year, the South-Central China government decided not to establish an independent South-Central China Institute of Power Engineering. All the programs related to power engineering were administered by Huazhong Institute of Technology. The institute formally opened on October 15, 1953. = Early development (1954–1966) = All the programs and departments at HIT were organized and formed from the programs related to electrical engineering, power engineering, electricity and mechanical engineering in Wuhan University, Hunan University, Guangxi University and South China Institute of Technology. HIT's first classes were held in spaces at those institutions. There were eight undergraduate programs, 314 full-time faculty members and 2,639 undergraduate students at that time. The first president is physicist Qian Zha, Dean of School of Engineering of Wuhan University. The first provost is Gancai Liu. In 1960, HIT was evaluated to be a national key university under the direct administration of the Ministry of Education of China. = Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) = In 1971, most of the Wuhan Mechanical Institute () was merged into the institute. Six departments were established. There were 20 undergraduate programs, 1,097 faculty members. The number of undergraduate students reached to 6,087. = New mission, global view (1976–1988) = Graduate students began to be enrolled in 1978, and in 1984, the institute became one of 22 universities to be approved by the State Council to establish a graduate school. By approval of the State Education Committee, the institute was renamed Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST, 华中理工大学) in 1988. = Leading the Reform in Tech-Schools (1988–2000) = With China's global strategy and the reform of the economy, HUST led a series of pivotal reforms among technical institutions in China. HUST is the first technical school to establish the Department of Journalism and Communication, the Department of Economics, and Department of Literature, and to host nationwide lectures in humanities. = Merger = On May 26, 2000, the former Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical University, Wuhan Urban Construction Institute (), and Wuhan Science and Technology Vocational College () combined to form the new Huazhong University of Science and Technology (); the Chinese name was changed, but the English name remained the same. = Tongji Medical College = The history of Tongji Medical College can be traced back to 1907 when Tongji German Medical School was founded by Erich Paulun in Shanghai.

After the establishment of National Tongji University in 1927, the Tongji Medical College was affiliated to the university as one of the schools. In 1950, the medical school was moved to Wuhan from Shanghai and merged with Wuhan University School of Medicine to become South-Central China Tongji Medical College. The college was later renamed as Wuhan College of Medicine in 1955, as Tongji Medical University in 1985, and as Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2000. = Presidents = * Zha Qian: (1953–1979) * Zhu Jiusi: (1979–1984) * Huang Shuhuai (1984–1993) * Yang Shuzi (1993–1997) Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences * Zhou Ji (1997–2001) Member and former President of the Chinese Academy of Engineering * Fan Mingwu (2001–2005) Member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, former President of China Institute of Atomic Energy * Li Peigen (2005–2014) Member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering * Ding Lieyun (2014–2018) Member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering * Li Yuanyuan (2018–present) Member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering  Campus  Road and Youth Lake in main campus HUST.

It is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE) and is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Pennsylvania Department of Education First established in 1866, Kutztown University began as the Keystone Normal School based out of the presently-named Old Main Building and specializing in teacher education; in 1928 its name was changed to Kutztown State Teachers College. Eventually, the school expanded its programs outside education to be christened Kutztown State College in 1960 and finally Kutztown University of Pennsylvania roughly twenty years later in 1983. Between four undergraduate colleges and graduate studies, Kutztown University now offers programs in the liberal arts and sciences, the visual and performing arts, business, education, and certain graduate studies. Eight intercollegiate men's sports and thirteen women's sports compete within the NCAA Division II and the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC). Kutztown University is a census-designated place in Maxatawny Township just outside the borough of Kutztown and makes up the main population of the university. As of the 2010 census, the population was 2,918 residents. History Old Main On September 15, 1866, the Keystone State Normal School was established on what is now the site of Old Main. The needs of a burgeoning industrialization in the region placed more and more demands on teacher preparation, and in 1928, the institution was designated Kutztown State Teacher's College and authorized to confer the bachelor's degree. Eventually, the area's need for liberally educated personnel to staff its industries outstripped the need for teachers. In 1960, the Department of Education changed the institution's name to Kutztown State College and diversified its goals toward \\"A center for learning for the best possible education of the youth of Pennsylvania in the arts and sciences and preparation of able and dedicated teachers.\\" On July 1, 1983, the institution became Kutztown University of Pennsylvania of the State System of Higher Education. As of Fall 2018, the university enrollment was approximately 8,300 full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students. Academics Degrees offered included Bachelor of Arts in 24 subjects, Bachelor of Science in 30, Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in five, Bachelor of Science in Education in five, Bachelor of Social Work, Bachelor of Science in Leisure & Sport Studies, Bachelor of Science in Library Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts in three subjects.

In 1961, Kutztown replaced the Golden Avalanche nickname with the Golden Bears as the University's nickname. In later years, Golden Bear mascots came into play. Before 2005, Goldie and Griz served as the KU Golden Bear mascots. However, they were both \\"graduated\\" to make way for a new mascot. The Raymond Entertainment Group of Newark, Delaware, helped KU create the new mascot. On October 1, 2005, at Kutztown's football game versus West Chester University, Kutztown University unveiled Avalanche as the school's new mascot. Avalanche is so named to honor Kutztown State College during the time of the Golden Avalanche sports teams. The Golden Bears can be seen in more places than the sports fields. Golden Bear statues are located near the basketball courts on South Campus and on North Campus near the Boehm Science Building. Along with the statues, several residential areas are named after the Golden Bear. Golden Bear Village South behind University Place and Golden Bear Village West next to Rothermel Hall are student apartments which hold the Golden Bear moniker. Notable alumni * A.J.

He played college football at Northwestern Louisiana State College, now Northwestern State University. Early years Smith attended Kentwood High School, where he started out playing the clarinet for the school's band. He decided to try out for the football team as a sophomore, but suffered a torn Achilles tendon that forced him to sit out the season. As a junior, he had osteomyelitis in his ankle, so he could only play in the second half of the last game of the season. In his last year, he was named the starting tailback in the team's single-wing formation, but suffered a serious hip injury in the fourth game and could not play the rest of the way, finishing his high school career after appearing in only 5 games. He also lettered in track and field, competing in the mile relay, the quarter-mile, the low and high hurdles. He won a state championship in the hurdles. College career Northwestern Louisiana State College could only offer him half a scholarship for track, unless he would also agree to play football, so he could qualify for a full scholarship. “They told me, ‘If you go out for the football team and don’t quit, we can give you a full scholarship,’” Smith said. “I didn’t even have to play—just don’t quit.”https://www.si.com/nfl/2016/01/19/jackie-smith-super-bowl-drop Smith initially joined the football team to fulfill this provision, but he was good enough to become a starter. During his college career, he had few opportunities to prove his true worth in the Demon's run-oriented offense, leading the team in receiving in his last two years, but recording modest stats. In track, he competed in the hurdles. In 1980, he was inducted into the Northwestern State Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1983, he was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career =St. Louis Cardinals= Smith was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the tenth round (129th overall) of the 1963 NFL Draft, based on the recommendation of Jack Rockwell, then a Cardinals trainer and a part-time scout, who saw him in a spring game during his senior season, where he showed enough speed to stand out. He was a part of a group of 10 rookies that made the team that year. He was originally projected to play flanker, but was named the starter at tight end after Taz Anderson was injured. In the fifth game of the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he posted 212 yards and 2 touchdowns on 9 receptions, while playing a key role in a 24-23 win. He would not relinquish his starter position back and would become a team co-captain. Besides being a talented receiver, Smith displayed elite conditioning and ran with great determination, not only avoiding tacklers but also running through them. He was an excellent blocker, in an era where the tight ends were expected to block more than feature their receiving skills. He was the team starting punter from 1964 to 1966, until Chuck Latourette took over the role. His best season came in 1967, when in 14 games he registered 56 receptions for 1,295 (third on the league), 21.5 yard-average per reception and 9 touchdowns. Smith proved his durability by playing in 121 straight games, until suffering torn ligaments in the ninth game of the 1971 season. In 1974 and 1975, he was a part of the NFC East divisional champions. In 1975, although he played in only 9 games, he contributed to the Cardinals setting an NFL record by allowing only 8 sacks in 14 games. Injuries that included a problem with the arch in one foot and a spinal condition (his arms would go numb after being tackled), affected him in his last two years. In 1976, he was passed on the depth chart by J. V. Cain and was relegated to a backup role. On December 4, 1977, he announced his retirement after playing 15 seasons and 198 games. In August 1978, it was reported in the media that the Cardinals contacted Smith to return, but no contract was offered. Smith played in five straight Pro Bowls and posted more than 40 receptions in seven seasons. He is tied for the most seasons played in a Cardinals uniform with 15 and had a string of 45 straight games with at least one reception. Despite his individual success, team success for the Cardinals proved fleeting. The Cardinals only made the playoffs twice in Smith's 15 seasons, and were eliminated both times in their first round, with Smith catching only one pass in each game. On January 29, 1994, Smith was officially voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, as the third tight end to ever receive this honor and recognized as one of the key players that helped revolutionize the position. In 1994, he was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. In 2001, he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 2009, he was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame. =Dallas Cowboys= In late September 1978, the Cowboys needed to add depth at tight end after Jay Saldi fractured his arm in the fourth game of the season against the St. Louis Cardinals. Head coach Tom Landry called Smith on Monday September 25, looking to convince him to come back from retirement and sign with the defending Super Bowl champions on September 28. He reported to the team on Thursday September 28 and provided depth against the Washington Redskins on Sunday October 2. Although he was the oldest player (38 years old) in the Dallas Cowboys roster, not many could keep up with his running ability. During the regular season, he was used as a blocking tight end in goal line formations and did not record a start or a reception. He received a game ball for his blocking after a win against the Philadelphia Eagles. In the NFC Divisional playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons, the Cowboys were behind 20-13 in the third quarter and Roger Staubach was out of the game with a concussion. Backup quarterback Danny White found Smith in the end zone (one of his 3 receptions) to tie the game and contribute to a 27-20 comeback win. Smith eventually made his only trip to the Super Bowl, which would end up leaving a mark on his career. With the Cowboys trailing the Pittsburgh Steelers 21-14 in the third quarter of Super Bowl XIII, Smith dropped a third down pass in the end zone from Staubach, so instead of tying the score, the team had to settle for a field goal. Although this wasn't the only critical play or turning point of the game and Staubach has also mentioned at different times that it was a poorly thrown pass, because it was such an iconic play, Smith was singled out in the media for the 35-31 loss. ESPN ranked Smith's dropped pass in the end zone #24 on their list of \\"100 Greatest Super Bowl Moments\\". He retired again, even though the Cowboys still wanted him back for the 1979 season. At the time, Smith's 7,918 career receiving yards were the most ever by an NFL tight end, until he was surpassed by Ozzie Newsome's 7,980 yards in 1990. His 16.5 yards per catch average is currently the highest among all tight ends in the Hall of Fame.

They are often confused with the similarly named current League of Ireland team Shelbourne. Both teams had their origins in the same Ringsend suburb and both teams played in the Leinster Senior League and the League of Ireland during the 1920s. However they were completely different teams. History =Leinster Senior League= In 1920–21 Shelbourne United won the Leinster Senior League Senior Division title. After Bohemians, Shelbourne and St James's Gate, they became the fourth civilian team to win the league. Shelbourne United spent the 1921–22 season in the same league. Other teams in the Leinster Senior League Senior Division this season included Shamrock Rovers, Bohemians B, St James's Gate B, Bray Unknowns, Midland Athletic, Pioneers, Brooklyn, Merrion, Glasnevin, CYMS and Richmond. During this season Shelbourne United played some home games at Beech Hill, Donnybrook. =League of Ireland= The 1922–23 season saw the League of Ireland expand from eight to twelve teams. After Frankfort and YMCA dropped out, Shelbourne United became one of six new teams to join the league. The others were Shamrock Rovers, Midland Athletic, Pioneers, Athlone Town and Rathmines Athletic. Shelbourne United and Rathmines Athletic originally had their applications to join the league rejected at a meeting on 17 August 1922. They were only reconsidered after one of the original proposed expansion teams, University College Dublin, dropped out after concerns about their ability to field a team throughout the season. The League was also concerned about Shelbourne United's plans to play their home games at Anglesea Road, on a pitch already used by Dublin United. However, after observing a friendly between the two teams, the league finally accepted Shelbourne United following another meeting on Monday, 4 September 1922. Less than two weeks later, they made their League of Ireland debut on Saturday, 16 September 1922, in a 1–0 away win against Shamrock Rovers. The 1922–23 season eventually saw Shelbourne United finish fourth behind Rovers, Shelbourne and Bohemians. In the 1922–23 FAI Cup they defeated Bohemians 2–1 in the round of sixteen and in the quarter-finals they lost over two games to the eventual winners Alton United. In their second and final season, 1923–24, they played their home games at Milltown Ground and finished sixth. They were quarter-finalists again in the 1923–24 FAI Cup, this time losing 2–1 to St James's Gate. Shelbourne United withdrew from the League of Ireland on 7 September 1924, the day after the 1924–25 season had started. Their place in the league was awarded to Fordsons.

She briefly produced Saturday Night Live, between November 1980 and March 1981. Early life Doumanian was born Jeannine Karabas to Greek immigrant parents, who raised her in Chicago. Her father was a restaurateur. She attended the University of Illinois but dropped out as a junior to marry John Doumanian, a promoter for Capitol Records.\\"Music as Written\\", The Billboard, June 1, 1959, pg. 21; archived at Google Books; retrieved November 30, 2012. While out with her husband who was scouting new talent in the clubs of Chicago, she met stand-up comedian Woody Allen who was sharing a billing with Capitol singer Nancy Wilson. A friendship developed after Allen's manager, Jack Rollins, asked the couple to show Allen around Chicago; and her husband became Allen's road manager. Career The Doumanians divorced and her husband moved to California and she moved to New York at the request of up-and-coming comedian Dick Cavett as a pre-interviewer and writer for ABC's The Dick Cavett Show; and then as an associate producer for Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell. In 1975, she took a position with NBC as a talent booker for Saturday Night Live. =Saturday Night Live= Show creator Lorne Michaels resigned as producer of Saturday Night Live at the end of its fifth season and the entire cast and writing staff followed, with the exception of writer Brian Doyle-Murray. Doumanian, who had been an associate producer during the first five seasons of the show and produced a special for Michaels in 1978, was one of the few who remained. She was offered Michaels' job running SNL, much to Michaels' surprise, and took over the show for the 1980 season, hiring a completely new cast and new writers. Doumanian's tenure as SNL executive producer was tumultuous. She hired Denny Dillon, Gilbert Gottfried, Gail Matthius, Joe Piscopo, Ann Risley and Charles Rocket as repertory players, and Yvonne Hudson, Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers as featured players. Then-unknown Eddie Murphy would join the show as a featured player on the fourth episode and was upgraded to repertory status on January 24, 1981. With its team of all-new writers and cast members, the show was plagued with problems from the start of the season and deemed a commercial disappointment, and suffered from competition with ABC's new weekend show, Fridays, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation import SCTV, which NBC aired following the Tonight Show on Fridays, as well as budget cuts. In a cliffhanger titled \\"Who Shot C.R.\\" from the episode on February 21, 1981, cast member Charles Rocket was \\"shot\\" after cast members shared their grievances with Rocket and with one another. When that episode's host, Charlene Tilton, asked Rocket what it felt like to be shot, he replied \\"Oh man, it's the first time I've been shot in my life. I'd like to know who the fuck did it.\\" The uncensored expletive, seemingly planned, landed the show, its producer and the network in trouble. After one further episode on March 7, 1981, the show was put on a month-long hiatus after NBC executives decided the show needed an immediate overhaul, and Doumanian was dismissed from her position at SNL and replaced by Dick Ebersol, who fired Gottfried, Risley and Rocket before the end of the hiatus. After one episode on April 11, the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike began, causing the season to end early. After the season ended, Ebersol fired Matthius and Dillon. Only Piscopo, Murphy, and writers Pam Norris, Barry Blaustein and David Sheffield remained from Doumanian's tenure when the next season started. One of Doumanian's writers, Terry Sweeney, would become a cast member on the show in 1985 after Lorne Michaels returned to replace Ebersol. In 2010, former cast writer Harry Shearer disclosed to Howard Stern that Doumanian rejected his proposal to bring in highly experienced talent and instead told him that she did not think she \\"want[ed] people who know what they're doing.\\" On February 15, 2015, Doumanian attended the SNL 40th anniversary special, although she apparently had not been officially invited, and it was said that SNL executives were not happy about her presence. Ebersol was not present. =Film= After leaving SNL, Doumanian was a producer for several of Woody Allen's films: *Bullets over Broadway (1994) *Mighty Aphrodite (1995) *Everyone Says I Love You (1996) *Deconstructing Harry (1997) *Celebrity (1998) *Sweet and Lowdown (1999) *Small Time Crooks (2000) She was a producer for the 1994 made-for-television film Don't Drink the Water and the 1997 documentary, Wild Man Blues, a film about a tour by Allen's jazz band. During production of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion in 2000, however, she reportedly shocked Allen with the abrupt announcement that he had 48 hours to find alternative funding for the film. In May 2001, on the advice of his financiers, Allen filed a lawsuit against Doumanian and her business partner and long-time boyfriend Jacqui Safra, claiming their production company had skimmed profits off of the movies. The lawsuit was settled in 2002 for an undisclosed amount.Saulny, Susan (June 12, 2002). \\"Woody Allen Settles Suit Against Longtime Producer\\", The New York Times; accessed May 13, 2014.Wadler, Joyce (September 20, 2002). \\"PUBLIC LIVES; Woody Allen's Ex-Best Friend on the Record, Sort Of\\".

She produced the 2013 film August: Osage County, which garnered Academy Award nominations for its stars, Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. =Theater= Doumanian has been producer on many Broadway productions, including Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, Amour, Jumpers, Democracy, the Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize-winning August: Osage County, Mary Stuart, Superior Donuts, the Tony Award-winning Book of Mormon, The Motherfucker with the Hat, The House of Blue Leaves, The Mountaintop, the Tony Award-winning 2012 revival of Death of a Salesman, Nice Work If You Can Get It, and The Testament of Mary. Off Broadway, Doumanian produced David Cromer's acclaimed production of Our Town, which garnered Lucille Lortel Awards for Outstanding Production and Outstanding Direction and an Obie Award for Outstanding Director. She also produced David Cromer's production of Tribes, which won the 2011-2012 New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Play as well as the 2012 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play.

The plateau is part of the English Chalk Formation and is adjacent to Salisbury Plain and the West Wiltshire Downs in the north, and the Dorset Downs to the south west. The scarp slope of the hills faces the Blackmore Vale to the west, and to some extent the Vale of Wardour to the north. The chalk gently slopes south and dips under clays and gravels. The highest point is Win Green Down, in Wiltshire, at . Cranborne Chase and the West Wiltshire Downs has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), at the sixth largest AONB in the country. History and archaeology Badbury Rings hill fort The downland has a long history with many earthworks and archaeology from the Neolithic age onwards. The dense woodland originally covering the downs would have gradually been cleared by the first farmers, but would have grown back repeatedly over the centuries as soils became exhausted and the agricultural carrying capacity of the land was exceeded several times over the course of six millennia. Much of the area therefore remained wooded from the Middle Ages until World War II. Analysis of remains found in some of the Bronze Age burial mounds, by experts at Bournemouth University, has revealed that many of the bones had small holes drilled in then, enabling them, it is hypothesised, to have been articulated by means of wooden pegs, i.e. the skeletons were prevented from falling apart during repeated removal and re-burial. There are many Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, including the henge monuments at Knowlton and the remains of a number of Iron Age settlements on the downs, most notably the hill fort at Badbury Rings (Vindocladia). There is a Roman villa which has been dug by archaeological television programme Time Team. During the Saxon invasion of England the Romano-British kept the invaders out of Dorset by building Bokerley Dyke, a defensive ditch, across the Roman Road that runs across the downs from Dorchester to Old Sarum. The downs have been sparsely populated since Saxon times, largely preserving archaeology until World War II when the need for agricultural land outweighed the archaeological importance. It was here that Augustus Pitt Rivers developed modern archaeological field work in the 19th century. The downs are named after the village Cranborne, founded by the Saxons, which had a manor house and a small monastery. The word \\"chase\\" comes from the hunts, frequented by royalty (including Kings John, Henry VIII and James I), which took place on the downs. The first known owner of the chase is thought to have been Brictric. His possessions were confiscated by Queen Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror; on her death, it passed to the Crown, and was granted, with other lands forming the feudal barony of Gloucester, to Robert Fitzhamon in 1083. This passed to his son-in-law Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. Ownership of the chase passed through successive Earls of Gloucester until the death of Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester in 1314. The chase passed to his sister Elizabeth de Clare (d. 1360), and thence to her granddaughter Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster (d. 1363). The Countess was succeeded by her daughter Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster (d. 1382), wife of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March. The chase was owned by successive Earls of March until 1461, when the last Earl was crowned as Edward IV of England. Cranborne Chase remained crown property until 1616, when it was granted to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. His great-grandson, the 3rd Earl, sold it to Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury in 1671. His son, the 2nd Earl, sold it in 1692 to Thomas Freke (d. 1701), who bequeathed it to Elizabeth Freke (the wife of his kinsman, also Thomas Freke) and her father Thomas Pile, with reversion to George Pitt should she die without children. Pitt inherited Cranborne Chase from her in 1714, and it passed from father to son in the Pitt family to his great-grandson George Pitt, 2nd Baron Rivers, after whose death it was disfranchised. Much of the Chase is still owned by large estates such as Kingston Lacy. Cranborne Chase School, a former boarding school for girls, was based at two locations in Cranborne Chase: at Crichel House near the village of Moor Crichel in Dorset from 1946 to 1961, and then at New Wardour Castle in the settlement of Wardour (near the village of Tisbury) in Wiltshire, until the School's closure in 1990.

In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from heraldry and literally means \\"placed into abyss\\". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author André Gide. A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two mirrors, seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image. Another is the Droste effect, in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature p. 37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) That is named after the 1904 Droste cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.Törnqvist, Egil. Ibsen: A Doll's House, p. 105, Cambridge University Press (1995) Heraldry Coat of arms of the United Kingdom, 1816–37 In the terminology of heraldry, the abyme is the center of a coat of arms. The term mise en abyme (also called inescutcheon) then meant “put/placed in the center”. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see Droste effect). A complex example of mise en abyme is seen in the coat of arms of the United Kingdom for the period 1816–1837, as used by King George III. The crown of Charlemagne is placed en abyme within the escutcheon of Hanover, which in turn is en abyme within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Another example is the two-headed eagle in the modern coat of arms of Russia, which holds a sceptre topped by a similar eagle holding a similar sceptre. Medieval examples Southwestern entrance mosaic of Hagia Sophia, Constantinople, depicting both Hagia Sophia itself and Constantinople, both offered to Jesus and the Virgin Mary While art historians working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic \\"self awareness\\", medievalists tended not to use it. Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a mosaic from the Hagia Sophia dated to the year 944. To the left, Justinian I offers the Virgin Mary the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, Constantine I offers the city of Constantinople (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia. More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself, in which Stuart Whatling conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the Stefaneschi Triptych in the Vatican Museum, which features Cardinal Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi as the giver of the altarpiece.Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych Critical theory and art history In Western art history, mise en abyme is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; \\"recursive\\" is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author André Gide who used it to describe self- reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his own work.Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself (collection of papers) As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez and literary forms such as William Shakespeare's use of the \\"play within a play\\" device in Hamlet, where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminates a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase mise en abyme was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme by Lucien Dällenbach.Lucien Dällenbach, Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme, Paris, Seuil, 1977 Literature and film Mise en abyme occurs in a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. Mise en abyme is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. Hayward, Susan. \\"Mise-en-abime\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 252-253 This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of deconstruction. The film- within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a movie, is an example of mise en abyme. The film being made within the film refers, through its mise en scène, to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film.Susan. Cinema Studies Key Concepts. New York: Routledge, 2006. Accessed 2009-05-27 An example is La Nuit américaine (1973) by François Truffaut. In film, the meaning of mise en abyme is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a \\"dream within a dream\\". For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that s/he is still dreaming. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as mise en abyme. This is seen in the film eXistenZ where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York (2008). A more recent instance can be found in the film Inception (2010). Classic filmic examples include the snow globe in Citizen Kane (1941) which provides a clue to the film's core mystery, and the discussion of Edgar Allan Poe's written works (particularly \\"The Purloined Letter\\") in the Jean-Luc Godard film Band of Outsiders (1964). In literary criticism, mise en abyme is a type of frame story, in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the intertextual nature of language, that is, of the way language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to other language, which refers to other language, and so forth. In comedy, Mise en abyme can be seen with The Harold, an improvisation cycle with reoccurring themes, popularized by Del Close in his book \\"Truth in Comedy.\\" See also     References Category:Artistic techniques Category:Metafictional techniques Category:Heraldry Category:Art history Category:Composition in visual art ","title":"Mise en abyme"},{"id":"1127656","text":"UHI may refer to: * Universal Handy Interface from Motorola * U-Haul U-Haul International * University of the Highlands and Islands, formerly known as UHI Millennium Institute * Urban heat island * An is also the name for a tool used in , traditional Māori tattoo-like skin marking ","title":"UHI"},{"id":"1127661","text":"Mauricio Rodrigo Solís Mora (born 13 December 1972 in Heredia) is a retired Costa Rican professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder, sweeper or central defender.

Career  Ryan joined her parents' vaudeville act, \\"The Merry Dancing Ryans\\", before she was 3 years old, and appeared in her first film, Wedding of Jack and Jill (1929) when she was 4. She attended Hollywood Professional School. Her singing, acting, and dancing skills were noticed by song-and-dance actor George Murphy, who helped her get a role in 1937's Top of the Town. However, her entry in the book Vaudeville old & new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America, Volume 1 notes, \\"[B]y then she was outgrowing the kiddie parts, yet not old enough for the teenage roles.\\" She continued working in small roles until 1942, when she had a solo number in the feature film What's Cookin'?. The Gloria Jean-Donald O'Connor-Peggy Ryan team were a great hit with audiences and exhibitors,Scott MacGillivray and Jan MacGillivray, Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven, iUniverse, Bloomington, Indiana, 2005 and the three teens made five features together. Her screen character in these films was usually brash, wisecracking, and boy-crazy. In 1944, Ryan advanced to more elaborate productions, in support of Jack Oakie and Abbott and Costello. She left Universal in 1945 and married James Cross that same year; they were divorced in 1952. She returned to the screen with dancer Ray McDonald for 1949's There's a Girl in My Heart and Shamrock Hill, and 1953's All Ashore. They wed in 1953 and toured together in a nightclub act before being divorced in 1957. Her third marriage, in 1958, was to Hawaii columnist Eddie Sherman, following which she left movies for choreography and semiretirement. Sherman adopted her two children from her previous marriages. On television, Ryan played a recurring role as secretary Jenny Sherman in Hawaii Five-O from 1969–76. In later years, she trained Las Vegas showgirls in tap dancing. Her last public performance, at her 80th birthday party, was a hilarious song-and-dance routine for her former Universal studio colleagues. She continued to teach tap until two days before her death. Death Ryan died at the age of 80 after two strokes. Her ashes were scattered under the Hollywood sign in Hollywood, California. She was survived by two children and five grandchildren. One of her children is retired actress Kerry Sherman.

From 1972 onwards, he assembled much of his artwork in close collaboration with his artistic partner and fifth wife, Nancy Reddin Kienholz. Throughout much of their career, the work of the Kienholzes was more appreciated in Europe than in their native United States, though American museums have featured their art more prominently since the 1990s. Art critic Brian Sewell called Edward Kienholz \\"the least known, most neglected and forgotten American artist of Jack Kerouac's Beat Generation of the 1950s, a contemporary of the writers Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Norman Mailer, his visual imagery at least as grim, gritty, sordid and depressing as their literary vocabulary\\". Early life Sollie 17, mixed media construction by Edward Kienholz and Nancy Reddin Kienholz (1979-80, Smithsonian American Art Museum) Interior view of The Beanery (1965, restored 2012; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 2013 photo) Edward Ralph Kienholz was born in Fairfield, Washington, in the dry eastern part of the state. He grew up on a wheat farm, learning carpentry, drafting and mechanical skills. His father was strict, and his mother was a religious fundamentalist; the rebellious son longed to escape this constricted environment. He studied art at Eastern Washington College of Education and, briefly, at Whitworth College in Spokane, but did not receive any formal degree. After a series of odd jobs, working as an orderly in a psychiatric hospital, manager of a dance band, used car salesman, caterer, decorator and vacuum cleaner salesman, Kienholz settled in Los Angeles, where he became involved with the avant-garde art scene of the day. Artistic development In 1956, Kienholz opened the NOW Gallery, for which Michael Bowen designed the sign;Comments by Michael Bowen on a photograph of the NOW Gallery's entrance. Beat Super Nova that year he met grad student Walter Hopps, who owned the Syndell Gallery. They co-organized the All-City Art Festival, then in 1957, with poet Bob Alexander, they opened the Ferus Gallery on North La Cienega Boulevard.Late Fifties at the Ferus. The Ferus Gallery soon became a focus of avant garde art and culture in the Los Angeles area. Despite his lack of formal artistic training, Kienholz began to employ his mechanical and carpentry skills in making collage paintings and reliefs assembled from materials salvaged from the alleys and sidewalks of the city.\\"His truck used to have ED KIENHOLZ--EXPERT painted on the door. You might not trust Roy Lichtenstein to frame a shed or Jasper Johns to re-weld a railing, but Kienholz was doing that stuff since childhood.\\" Hughes, Robert. \\"All-American Barbaric Yawp.\\" May 6, 1996. TIME In 1958 he sold his share of the Ferus Gallery to buy a Los Angeles house and studio and to concentrate on his art, creating free-standing, large-scale environmental tableaux. He continued to participate in activities at the Ferus Gallery, mounting a show of his first assemblage works in 1959. In 1961, Kienholz completed his first large-scale installation, Roxy's, a room-sized environment which he showed at the Ferus Gallery in 1962. Set in the year 1943, Roxy's depicts Kienholz's memories of his youthful encounters in a Nevada brothel complete with antique furniture, a 30s era jukebox, vintage sundries, and satirical characters assembled from castoff pieces of junk. This artwork later caused a stir at the documenta 4 exhibition in 1968. A 1966 show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) drew considerable controversy over his assemblage, Back Seat Dodge ‘38 (1964). The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors called it \\"revolting, pornographic and blasphemous\\" and threatened to withhold financing for the museum unless the tableau was removed from view. A compromise was reached under which the sculpture's car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children were present in the gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people lining up to see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, Back Seat Dodge ’38 has drawn crowds. LACMA did not formally acquire the work until 1986. In 1966, Kienholz began to spend summers in Hope, Idaho, while still maintaining studio space in Los Angeles. Also around that time, he produced a series of Concept Tableaux, which consisted of framed text descriptions of artwork that did not yet exist. He would sell these works of early Conceptual Art (though the term was not in widespread use at the time) for a modest sum, giving the buyer the right (upon payment of a larger fee) to have Kienholz actually construct the artwork. He sold a number of Concept Tableaux, but only The State Hospital progressed to a completed artwork. Kienholz's assemblages of found objects—the detritus of modern existence, often including figures cast from life—are at times vulgar, brutal, and gruesome, confronting the viewer with questions about human existence and the inhumanity of twentieth- century society. Regarding found materials he said, in 1977, \\"I really begin to understand any society by going through its junk stores and flea markets. It is a form of education and historical orientation for me. I can see the results of ideas in what is thrown away by a culture.\\"Edward Kienholz / MATRIX 21 Kienholz occasionally incorporated defunct or operating radios or televisions into their works, sometimes adding sound and moving images to the overall effect. Live animals were selectively included as crucial elements in some installations, providing motion and sound that contrasted starkly with frozen tableaus of decay and degradation. For example, The Wait, a dismal scene of a lonely skeletal woman surrounded by memories and waiting for death, incorporates a cage with a live parakeet cheerfully chirping and hopping about. The bird is considered an integral part of the installation, but requires special attention to ensure that it remains healthy and active, as described in the Whitney Museum's online catalog and video. Another well-known work, The State Hospital, incorporates a pair of black goldfish swimming in each of two glass goldfish bowls representing the head of an inmate suffering with mental illness. Kienholz's work commented savagely on racism, aging, mental illness, sexual stereotypes, poverty, greed, corruption, imperialism, patriotism, religion, alienation, and most of all, moral hypocrisy. Because of their satirical and antiestablishment tones, their works have often been linked to the funk art movement based in San Francisco in the 1960s.\\"Minimal Art,\\" The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century Art, ed. Harold Osborne (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1981) 376. Although he was an atheist and despised feigned religiosity, Keinholz carefully preserved an anonymous store window shrine discovered in Spokane, Washington. Calling this found outsider artwork The Jesus Corner, Keinholz exhibited it in a Spokane museum in 1984, and then showed it at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Ten years later, Keinholz insisted on selling it at a reduced price to the Missoula Art Museum in Missoula, Montana, to ensure that it would be on view in an environment he felt comfortable with. Collaboration with Nancy Reddin (1972–1994) In The Infield Was Patty Peccavi by Edward and Nancy Kienholz; metal, resin, cloth, wood, glass, paper, photomechanical reproduction, electric lights, stuffed bird and paint (1981, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden) In 1981, Ed Kienholz officially declared that all his work from 1972 on should be retrospectively understood to be co-authored by, and co-signed by, his fifth wife and collaborator, former photojournalist Nancy Reddin Kienholz.Peltakian, Danielle. Chronology, Edward Kienholz (1927-1994) Sullivan Goss Gallery Collectively, they are referred to as \\"Kienholz\\". Their work has been widely acclaimed, particularly in Europe. In the early 1970s, Kienholz received a grant that permitted him to work in Berlin. His most important works during this period were based on the Volksempfängers (radio receiving apparatus from the National Socialist period in Germany). In 1973 he was guest artist of the German Academic Exchange Service in Berlin. In 1974 Edward Kienholz performed with Jannis Kounellis, Wolf Vostell and other artists in Berlin at the ADA - Aktionen der Avantgarde.ADA 1 y 2 In 1973, Kienholz and Reddin moved from Los Angeles to Hope, Idaho and for the next twenty years they divided their time between Berlin and Idaho. In 1976 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1977 he opened \\"The Faith and Charity in Hope Gallery\\" at their Idaho studio, and showed both established and emerging artists, including Francis Bacon, Jasper Johns, Peter Shelton, and Robert Helm. The Keinholzs continued to produce their own new installations and sculptures for exhibition. Death Edward Kienholz died suddenly in Idaho on June 10, 1994, from a heart attack after hiking in the mountains near their home. He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, \\"[H]is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged into the front seat of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti beside him and the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife. To the whine of bagpipes, the Packard, steered by his widow Nancy Reddin Kienholz, rolled like a funeral barge into the big hole.\\"Hughes, Robert. \\"All-American Barbaric Yawp.\\" May 6, 1996. TIME Exhibitions A small Kienholz installation at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, Spain (1973) Since Edward's death, Nancy Reddin Kienholz has continued to administer the joint artistic estate, organizing shows and exhibitions. Retrospectives of Kienholz's work have been infrequent, due to the difficulty and expense of assembling fragile, literally room-sized sculptures and installations from widely dispersed collections around the world. Kienholz work has often been difficult to view, both because of its subject matter, and the logistics of displaying it. Relatively few of the major works had been on display in the US, the Kienholzes' native land, though American museums have now started to feature their work more prominently, especially after a major retrospective (posthumous) exhibition in 1996 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Bowers Museum (Santa Ana, California), the Dayton Art Institute, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art (Washington, DC), the Oakland Museum of California, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the University of Arizona Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York) are among the public collections holding work by Kienholz. The diverse and freely improvised materials and methods used in Kienholz works pose an unusual challenge to art conservators who try to preserve the artist's original intent and appearances. Treatment of Back Seat Dodge '38 for clothes moths presented an awkward situation, which was deftly addressed by the Getty Conservation Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum in behalf of LACMA, the owner of the artwork. In 2009, the National Gallery in London mounted an exhibition of The Hoerengracht (Dutch: Whores' Canal), a 1980s streetscape installation portraying the red light district of Amsterdam, Netherlands. From May 6 to June 19, 2010, Kienholz's Roxy's (1960) was meticulously reconstructed and visible through the aperture of two panoramic windows at David Zwirner Gallery in New York City. In 2011, Kienholz's work was visited with renewed attention in Los Angeles partly as a result of the Pacific Standard Time series of exhibitions, which saw his powerful 1972 installation Five Car Stud reinstalled at LACMA. The oversized installation is framed by five vehicles parked in a circle, their headlights illuminating a stark racial hatred castration scene. It was exhibited in Los Angeles and Germany in 1972, then purchased by a Japanese collector and kept in storage for almost 40 years, known only through documentary photos from those exhibitions. In September 2011, it was re-installed at LACMA. At Art Basel 2012, it was purchased by the Prada Foundation. Legacy Kienholz is acknowledged as a pioneer, as early as 1960 with Roxy's, of what came to be known as installation art and assemblage art. He also produced early works of conceptual art with his Concept Tableau series in the mid-1960s. In 1968, Ed Kienholz's carefully documented and self-consciously outrageous behavior in what has been called the \\"TWA Incident\\" revealed aspects of what would later be called \\"performance art\\". In spite of his claims to be merely a rough working-class carpenter and mechanic, Kienholz was well aware of his position in the contemporary art scene, and acted assertively to shape his image and legacy.

Cat is an American action drama that aired on NBC during the 1966–1967 television season. The series was co-sponsored by R.J. Reynolds (Winston) and Lever Brothers and was created by Harry Julian Fink. Robert Loggia starred as the title character, Thomas Hewitt Edward Cat. The series preceded the 1968–1970 ABC television series It Takes a Thief, which was also about a cat burglar who used his skills for good. Synopsis > Out of the night comes a man who saves lives at the risk of his own. Once a > circus performer, an aerialist who refused the net. Once a cat burglar, a > master among jewel thieves. Now a professional bodyguard. Primitive... > savage... in love with danger. The Cat! The series had a hero who was a reformed thief, having spent an unspecified term in prison, and of Gypsy heritage. In the mold of famed private eye Peter Gunn and the waterfront bar Mother's, Cat operated out of the Casa Del Gato (House of the Cat) in San Francisco, of which he was part owner. Thomas (The Cat) was a master of the martial arts, who used his skills numerous times to stop antagonists in his pursuit of justice for the downtrodden, and for his various clients. He always worked on the side of the law...occasionally using his skills for the local police. His police contact was Police Capt. McAllister, a man with only one hand. R.G. Armstrong played McAllister in 12 episodes of the series.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060030/ He was one of two characters of TV series in the 1966 season who employed martial arts skills in the cause of justice. The other was Bruce Lee's character of Kato on the ABC- TV series The Green Hornet. These two characters were among the first on network television to employ martial arts skills as weapons against crime.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWgHqRraCW0 The Cat was also a master gymnast and acrobatic artist, who used his acquired skills as a circus performer to get into places that the police could not reach.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-hXsMbUqEs Casting Series star Robert Loggia had previously played a character known as \\"the Cat\\" in the 1958–60 Walt Disney television miniseries The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca, in which Loggia played Baca, an Old West Mexican-American lawman whose nickname was \\"the Cat\\", a fact viewers were reminded of each week in the series' theme song. Special edition of American Cowboy magazine. Page 28: \\"Walt Disney, the only producer of 1950s TV Westerns to focus on minority issues, powerfully told the full story of Baca's career in a ten-episode mini-series for ABC between 1958–1960, starring Robert Loggia. The title The Nine Lives of Elfago Baca, played off the hero's nickname 'El Gato', 'the cat'.\\" The series ran for 10 episodes and was recut into a feature movie. After T.H.E. Cat, Loggia, an actor with a long history of film and television credits, went on to star in a number of high-profile hit Hollywood films, including An Officer and a Gentleman, Scarface, Sylvester Stallone's Over the Top, the Tom Hanks hit film Big, and the science fiction action film Independence Day. In 1985, Loggia was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of crusty private detective Sam Ransom in the thriller Jagged Edge and had the starring role in another NBC series, Mancuso, FBI, for which he was nominated for an Emmy in 1989. Reception Though T.H.E. Cat was popular among children and teens, the series fared poorly in the ratings overall, a situation that prompted its cancellation after a single season.https://www.nndb.com/people/318/000023249/ Episodes # \\"To Kill a Priest\\", written by Harry Julian Fink, directed by Boris Sagal # \\"Sandman\\", written by J.D.

This causes the term \\"polar ice cap\\" to be something of a misnomer, as the term ice cap itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land, and cover less than 50,000 km2: larger bodies are referred to as ice sheets. The composition of the ice will vary. For example, Earth's polar caps are mainly water ice, whereas Mars's polar ice caps are a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and water ice. Polar ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of solar radiation from the Sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures. Earth's polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years. Seasonal variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun. Additionally, in geologic time scales, the ice caps may grow or shrink due to climate variation.

Portions of the ice that do not melt seasonally can get very thick, up to 3–4 meters thick over large areas, with ridges up to 20 meters thick. One- year ice is usually about 1 meter thick. The area covered by sea ice ranges between 9 and 12 million km2. In addition, the Greenland ice sheet covers about 1.71 million km2 and contains about 2.6 million km³ of ice. When the ice breaks off (calves) it forms icebergs scattered around the northern Atlantic. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, \\"since 1979, winter Arctic ice extent has decreased about 4.2 percent per decade\\". Both 2008 and 2009 had a minimum Arctic sea ice extent somewhat above that of 2007. At other times of the year the ice extent is still sometimes near the 1979–2000 average, as in April 2010, by the data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Still, between these same years, the overall average ice coverage appears to have declined from 8 million km2 to 5 million km2. =South Pole= A satellite composite image of Antarctica Earth's south polar land mass, Antarctica, is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet. It covers an area of about 14.6 million km2 and contains between 25 and 30 million km3 of ice. Around 70% of the fresh water on Earth is contained in this ice sheet. Data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that the sea ice coverage of Antarctica has a slightly positive trend over the last three decades (1979–2009). =Historical cases= Over the past several decades, Earth's polar ice caps have gained significant attention because of the alarming decrease in land and sea ice. NASA reports that since the late 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of sea ice per year while the Antarctic has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 km2) of sea ice per year. At the same time, the Arctic has been losing around 50 cubic kilometers (gigatons) of land ice per year, almost entirely from Greenland's 2.6 million gigaton sheet. On 19 September 2014, for the first time since 1979, Antarctic sea ice extent exceeded 7.72 million square miles (20 million square kilometers), according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The ice extent stayed above this benchmark extent for several days. The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.23 million square miles (18.72 million square kilometers). The single-day maximum extent in 2014 was reached on 20 Sep, according to NSIDC data, when the sea ice covered 7.78 million square miles (20.14 million square kilometers). The 2014 five-day average maximum was reached on 22 Sep, when sea ice covered 7.76 million square miles (20.11 million square kilometers), according to NSIDC. The current rate of decline of the ice caps has caused many investigations and discoveries on glacier dynamics and their influence on the world's climate. In the early 1950s, scientists and engineers from the US Army began drilling into polar ice caps for geological insight. These studies resulted in “nearly forty years of research experience and achievements in deep polar ice core drillings... and established the fundamental drilling technology for retrieving deep ice cores for climatologic archives.” Polar ice caps have been used to track current climate patterns but also patterns over the past several thousands years from the traces of and found trapped in the ice. In the past decade, polar ice caps have shown their most rapid decline in size with no true sign of recovery. Josefino Comiso, a senior research scientist at NASA, found that the “rate of warming in the Arctic over the last 20 years is eight times the rate of warming over the last 100 years.” In September 2012, sea ice reached its smallest size ever. Journalist John Vidal stated that sea ice is \\"700,000 sq km below the previous minimum of 4.17m sq km set in 2007\\". In August 2013, Arctic sea ice extent averaged 6.09m km2, which represents 1.13 million km2 below the 1981–2010 average for that month.National Snow and Ice Data Center A real hole near the pole, 4 September 2012 Mars Mars's north polar region with ice cap, composite of Viking 1 orbiter images (Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech) In addition to Earth, the planet Mars also has polar ice caps. They consist of primarily water-ice with a few percent dust. Frozen carbon dioxide makes up a small permanent portion of the Planum Australe or the South Polar Layered Deposits. In both hemispheres a seasonal carbon dioxide frost deposits in the winter and sublimes during the spring. Data collected in 2001 from NASA missions to Mars show that the southern residual ice cap undergoes sublimation inter-annually. The most widely accepted explanation is that fluctuations in the planet's orbit are causing the changes. Pluto On 29 April 2015, NASA stated that its New Horizons missions had discovered a feature thought to be a polar ice cap on the dwarf planet Pluto. The probe's flyby of Pluto in July 2015 allowed the Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer to confirm that the feature was in fact an ice cap composed of methane and nitrogen ices. A photo describing the frozen methane and nitrogen on Pluto gathered from New Horizons.

It was first published in the 1832 edition of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir. It was also included in the 1836 edition of The Token and Atlantic Souvenir, edited by Samuel Goodrich. It later appeared in Twice-Told Tales, a collection of short stories by Hawthorne published in 1837. Plot summary The story begins with the sexton standing in front of the meeting-house, ringing the bell. He is to stop ringing the bell when the Reverend Mr. Hooper comes into sight. However, the congregation is met with an unusual sight: Mr. Hooper is wearing a black semi-transparent veil that obscures all of his face but his mouth and chin from view. This creates a stir among the townspeople, who begin to speculate about his veil and its significance. As he takes the pulpit, Mr. Hooper's sermon is on secret sin and is \\"tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament\\". This topic concerns the congregation who fear for their own secret sins as well as their minister's new appearance. After the sermon, a funeral is held for a young lady of the town who has died. Mr. Hooper stays for the funeral and continues to wear his now more appropriate veil. It is said that if the veil were to blow away, he might be \\"fearful of her glance\\". Mr. Hooper says a few prayers and the body is carried away. Two of the mourners say that they have had a fancy that \\"the minister and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand\\". That night another occasion arises, this time a joyous one—a wedding. However, Mr. Hooper arrives in his veil again, bringing the atmosphere of the wedding down to gloom. By the next day, even the local children are talking of the strange change that seems to have come over their minister. Yet, no one is able to ask Mr. Hooper directly about the veil, except for his fiancée Elizabeth. Elizabeth tries to be cheerful and have him take it off. He will not do so, even when they are alone together, nor will he tell her why he wears the veil. Eventually, she gives up and tells him goodbye, breaking off the engagement. The one positive benefit of the veil is that Mr. Hooper becomes a more efficient clergyman, gaining many converts who feel that they too are behind the black veil with him. Dying sinners call out for him alone. Mr. Hooper lives his life thus, though he is promoted to Father, until his death. According to the text, \\"All through life the black veil had hung between him and the world: it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman's love, and kept him in that saddest of all prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen the gloom of his dark-some chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of eternity\\". Even though Elizabeth broke off their engagement, she never marries and still keeps track of the happenings of Hooper's life from afar. When she finds out that he is deathly ill she comes to his death bed to be by his side. Elizabeth and the Reverend ask him once again to remove the veil, but he refuses. As he dies, those around him tremble. He tells them in anger not to tremble, not merely for him but for themselves, for they all wear black veils. Father Hooper is buried with the black veil on his face. Analysis \\"The children fled from his approach\\", illustration by Elenore Abbott, 1900 Like many of Hawthorne's works, the setting of the story is a town in Puritan New England. The scene provides the backdrop for a psychological exploration of the themes of sin, repentance, and morality.Merriman, C.D. \\"Nathaniel Hawthorne\\" Jalic Inc. 2007. Much of the story focuses on the acrimonious reaction of the congregation to the seemingly benign veil. Hawthorne uses their reaction as a critique of the Puritan image of original sin, using the veil as a representation not of \\"secret sin\\" but the inherent sinful nature of all people.Morsberger, Robert E. \\"Minister's Black Veil\\". New England Quarterly 46.3: 454-63. 455 The story is both allegorical and didactic. The main themes are hidden sin and underlying guilt, with Hooper's method of preaching being to wear his sin on his face in a literal way. The townspeople grow uncomfortable with him because they start to become aware of their own sin.Stibitz, E. Earle. \\"Ironic Unity in Hawthorne's 'The Minister's Black Veil'\\" Illinois: Duke University Press, 1962: 182-190. Hawthorne keeps the motive of the veil unknown to the reader. But the interpretation of the story generally rests on some moral assessment or explanation of the minister's symbolic self-veiling. Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe proposed that the issue of the minister's self-veiling was a mystery conceived to be solved or inferred by the reader. While Poe proposed this, Hawthorne never lets the reader know the reasoning behind the veil.Carnochan, W.B. \\"The Minister's Black Veil\\": Symbol, Meaning and the Context of Hawthorne's Art. California: Nineteenth Century Fiction, 1969: 182. While the veil is the main symbol in the story, it is also ironic. Hooper, in his stubborn use of the veil parable of one sin, is unconsciously guilty of a greater sin: that of egotistically warping the total meaning of life. In addition to standing for a man's concealment or hypocrisy and for Hooper's own sin of pride with its isolating effects, it stands also for the hidden quality of second sin.Stibitz, E. Earle. \\"Ironic Unity in Hawthorne's 'The Minister's Black Veil'\\" Illinois: Duke University Press, 1962: 182. Hawthorne's use of ambiguity can be portrayed in many different ways: the manipulation of setting, manipulation of lighting and effects, and the use of an unreliable narrator to weave a shocking story that could or could not be likely. The narrator's credibility tends to be questionable because it is not a direct source. In using a third-person narrator, the minister's motives are never solidified, which keeps up the suspense.Graham, Wendy C. \\"Gothic Elements and Religion in Nathaniel Hawthorne's Fiction\\" Tectum Verlag, 1999: 29 Hidden nature of guilt: Hooper arouses in a sermon the notion of secret sin and the sad mysteries in which we hide from our nearest and dearest. Hooper acknowledges the problem of sin, the guilt that is admitted openly, and the guilt of sin that is repressed or hidden from the world. When the Reverend Hooper makes the people aware of the darkness within his being, he dissolves the barrier between his repugnant, repressed self and his conscious self. This barrier is characterized by the veil, which is transferred into the expression of hidden guilt. Hooper, in the story, announces to the congregation at his bedside that everyone wears a black veil; he implies that everyone has some form of secret guilt. Communion of sinners: Hooper leads the townspeople in realizing that everyone shares sin no matter how much they try to avoid facing it. All people sin and it is up to them whether they face their sin or ignore it. Hooper tries to teach a lesson. In content, the lesson may be very much like the sermon on \\"secret sin\\" Hooper was scheduled to teach, but the townspeople are uncomfortable with the medium. The veil is something they have to see every day, rather than a sermon just once or twice a week.Bell, Millicent. \\"New Essays on Hawthorne's Major Tales\\". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press., 1993: 21. Morality: Hawthorne's use of Hooper's veil teaches that whether we face it or not, we all sin and must accept what we have done, because judgment will come for everyone. Hooper decides to represent hidden sin and guilt in a literal way to reach out to his followers.Bell, Millicent. \\"New Essays on Hawthorne's Major Tales\\". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press., 1993: 21. John H. Timmerman notes that because of Hawthorne's writing style Hooper's insistent use of the black veil, Hooper stands as one of his arch-villains. This is from Hooper's act of separating himself from the rest of humanity and denying his love for Elizabeth in favor of the veil.Timmerman, John H. \\"Hawthorne's 'The Ministers Black Veil.'\\" Calvin College. =Symbols= The veil can be a symbol of the ways and practices of the Puritans, as well as people today, misleading others of the sins they have committed while completely and truly facing themselves. The veil is used as a daily reminder of people's sins, undeniable truths, guilt, and secrets that they are just unwilling to admit. In his lesson, Hooper uses a parable to influence his congregation, and possibly even further on to Puritan society. However, he pays a high price for this parable: The community's admiration for him turns to confusion and fear, and he is forced to live a lonely, isolated life. Many people in the congregation assume that Hooper is keeping a secret sin from them and in turn and since black veils are a sign of mourning, they thus assume death. The black veil is a symbol of secret sin and how terrible human nature can be. This could represent the secret sin that all people carry in their hearts, or it could be a representation of Mr. Hooper's specific sin, which some readers think to be adultery. Hooper as Everyman bearing his lonely fate in order to portray a tragic truth; and there is the implicit one of human imbalance, with Hooper's actions out of all proportion to need or benefit.Stibitz, E Earle. \\"Ironic Unity in Hawthorne's 'The Minister's Black Veil'\\" Duke University Press. 1962. 182 Edgar Allan Poe speculated that Minister Hooper may have committed adultery with the lady who died at the beginning of the story, because this is the first day he begins to wear the veil, \\"and that a crime of dark dye, (having reference to the young lady) has been committed, is a point which only minds congenial with that of the author will perceive.\\" Minister Hooper also seems to be unable to tell his fiancée why he wears the veil due to a promise he has made, and is not willing to show his face to the lady even in death. Finally, two funeral attendees see a vision of him walking hand in hand with the girl's spirit.Poe, Edgar Allan. \\"Nathaniel Hawthorne's Tales\\" Edited. New York. W.W. Norton & Company. 1987. 331-335. In a different view, the black veil could represent the Puritan obsession with sin and sinfulness. Puritans held beliefs of predestination and that only \\"God's elect\\" will be saved when the day of judgement comes, and this weeding out process of finding the saved versus not saved was a large part of Puritan life. The reaction to the minister's veil is one of annoyance and fear, \\"'I don't like it,' muttered an old woman, as she hobbled into the meetinghouse. 'He has changed himself into something awful, only by hiding his face.'\\"Baym, Nina, and Mary Loeffelholz. Norton Anthology of American Literature. New York: W. W. Norton &, 2007. 1312 We are given no clues in the story up to this point as to how or why or when the minister came to have the black veil over his face, it is just there, and as far as we are told the minister is doing nothing different from his normal routine. The one and only difference is a simple veil covering his face and the way his congregation thinks about him now. This is Hawthorne criticizing the overly judgmental nature of the Puritans belief on sin, for them sin was an undeniable mistake, \\"Hooper need not have committed any specific sin; for the hardened Puritan, his humanity was sinful enough, and he wore it the way the medieval penitent would his hair shirt. Anything less than absolute perfection was absolute corruption\\"Morsberger, Robert E. \\"Minister's Black Veil.\\" New England Quarterly 46.3: 454-63. 456-7 The inclusion of an old woman used to introduce us to the Puritan's rough ways was no mistake, Hawthorne wanted to show the most \\"hardened\\" Puritan elder and their reaction to the minister as evidence of how judgmental even the most seasoned Puritan can be. On the next page following the old woman's quote Hawthorne uses the narrator to point out what the congregation is really feeling on the inside, even though their outward reaction displays something entirely different, \\"A subtle power was breathed in his words. Each member of the congregation, the most innocent girl, and the most hardened of breast, felt as if the preacher had crept upon them, behind his awful veil, and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought.\\"Baym, Nina, and Mary Loeffelholz. Norton Anthology of American Literature. New York: W. W. Norton &, 2007.1313. This \\"iniquity of deed or thought\\" seems to hark back to the Spanish inquisition (hence the use of iniquity) and suggests the Puritan congregation is starting to realize their own faults: that being the overly harsh judgement they put on the minister and anyone else for superstitious things such as a black veil. The fear ultimately draws from the congregation's thoughts over being saved or not being saved. They sound loud and proud in being critical of the minister for his veil, but they are clearly weak and not confident inside their own minds about their personal salvation, so the harsh judgement of others could possibly be seen as a way to relieve themselves for a people were never sure about whether they were really going to heaven.Morsberger, Robert E. \\"Minister's Black Veil.\\" New England Quarterly 46.3: 454-63. 457-548 Inspiration Hawthorne may have been inspired by a true event. A clergyman named Joseph Moody of York, Maine, nicknamed \\"Handkerchief Moody\\", accidentally killed a friend when he was a young man and wore a black veil from the man's funeral until his own death.Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 201. Critical response Edgar Allan Poe offered a few critiques of Nathaniel Hawthorne's tales. Hawthorne received a mixed review from Poe, who writes that \\"high imaginations gleam from every page\\". He notes, however, that versatility is lacking in Hawthorne's tone and character development. Poe claims that Hawthorne is a man of \\"truest genius\\" but needs to work on subject areas of his writing. In his review of Twice-Told Tales, Poe also reveals a disdain for allegory, a tool which Hawthorne uses extensively.Poe, Edgar Allan. \\"Nathaniel Hawthorne's Tales\\" Edited. New York. W.W. Norton & Company. 1987. 331-335. Legacy and adaptations Reverend Hooper's sermon in the short story was the launching point of the dramatic work The Minister's Black Veil by Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio (2016), directed by Romeo Castellucci, with Willem Dafoe as Reverend Hooper, text by Claudia Castellucci and original music and sound design by Scott Gibbons.

She currently teaches English in Greenville, South Carolina.  Biography  Faulkner was born in Powdersville, South Carolina, United States, and graduated from Wren High School in January 1993. Faulkner was angry that The Citadel would not allow women. Faulkner became the first woman to attempt to enter the Corps of Cadets at The Citadel, which previously had a male-only admissions policy. Her application to the school was accompanied with having her gender blanked out of her high school transcripts. Faulkner enrolled after a successful lawsuit, Faulkner v. Jones et al., against the military academy. The suit alleged that the Citadel, which received state money, was \\"denying her equal protection under the Constitution.\\" Her lawyer, Val Vojdik, said, \\"We are seeking educational opportunity... We are seeking equal access to a public program we pay for.\\" Faulkner was allowed to attend classes as a day student by January 1994, but was not allowed to live on campus or wear the uniform. On campus, she was called \\"Mrs. Doubtgender\\" and faced other slurs from cadets. In 1994, bumper stickers appeared on cars in South Carolina that read \\"Shave Shannon,\\" in an attempt to humiliate her. In August 1994, a judge ordered Faulkner to shave her head as the male Citadel students did each year. In 1995, T-shirts for sale appeared in Charleston reading \\"1,952 bulldogs and one bitch.\\" In July 1995, Faulkner and a federal judge, C. Weston Houck, toured the woman's college that the state of South Carolina wanted to open as an alternative for women. Later that July, the same federal judge ruled that she should be admitted fully to The Citadel, and The Citadel planned to appeal the decision. In 1995, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Faulkner must be fully admitted. During the time she fought The Citadel in court, she \\"endured taunts and death threats.\\" She was also called \\"Shrew Shannon\\" by The Citadel's newspaper, and the article was dismissed by the president of The Citadel, Claudius Watts, as \\"satire.\\" Faulkner matriculated into The Citadel with an otherwise all-male corps of cadets on August 15, 1995 under the escort of United States Marshals. After only four hours of initial training, she suffered heat-stress. She was one of five cadets who became ill. She spent the remainder of the first week in the infirmary before voluntarily resigning, citing emotional and psychological abuse and physical exhaustion. After her departure, the male cadets openly celebrated on the campus. She told Oprah Winfrey on her show that she had gained weight during the court trials due to the stress she was facing. Diana Nyad criticized Faulkner for gaining weight and for not being fully prepared for training. Faulkner was one of thirty cadets to drop out. Two decades later, in a 2012 interview with the Post and Courier newspaper, Faulkner said that what precipitated her leaving so abruptly was a threat to kill her parents by a person present when she entered. Her parents' home was vandalized. In 1999, she told the Associated Press, \\"I went into it knowing I may not get anything out of it. I was doing it for the next woman.\\" Writer Pat Conroy paid for Faulkner's education after she left the Citadel, and she became a middle school teacher in South Carolina. Faulkner attended Anderson College. After graduating in 1999, she was hired by Carolina High School. In August 1996, four women were admitted to The Citadel. By December 2009, The Citadel had graduated 205 female cadets since Faulkner's admission. In March 2018, Faulkner returned to The Citadel as an invited speaker at a symposium about Conroy. Her statement that she would not criticize the school and considers herself \\"a Citadel alumni\\" drew a sharp attack from state representative Nancy Mace, who was the first woman to graduate from The Citadel in 1999. , Faulkner is an English teacher in Greenville and pursuing a graduate degree at Southern Wesleyan University. In popular culture Garry Shandling makes reference to Faulkner in a 1995 episode of The Larry Sanders Show, entitled \\"Nothing Personal\\". Faulkner is mentioned indirectly in the King of the Hill episode \\"Jumpin' Crack Bass\\" (1997). In the episode, she is referred to as \\"that pushy gal who's tryin' to get into The Citadel\\". Lisa Simpson's experience in The Simpsons' 8th-season finale, \\"The Secret War of Lisa Simpson\\" (1997), broadly resembles Faulkner's.

The YF-104 was the next airplane to fly with the J79 followed by a re-engined Grumman F11F Tiger in a Navy-sponsored program to gain experience with the engine before the first flight of the F4H (F-4). The J79 was used on the F-104 Starfighter, B-58 Hustler, F-4 Phantom II, A-5 Vigilante, IAI Kfir and SSM-N-9 Regulus II supersonic cruise missile. It was produced for more than 30 years. Over 17,000 J79s were built in the US, and under license in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Japan. A downgraded version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon with a J79 was proposed as a low-cost fighter for export, and though a prototype aircraft was flown, it found no customers. The J79 was replaced by the late 1960s in new fighter designs by afterburning turbofans such as the Pratt & Whitney TF30 used in the F-111 and F-14, and newer generation turbofans with the Pratt & Whitney F100 used in the F-15 Eagle which give better cruise fuel efficiency by-passing air around the core of the engine. For their part in designing the J79, Gerhard Neumann and Neil Burgess of General Electric Aircraft Engines were jointly awarded the Collier Trophy in 1958, also sharing the honor with Clarence Johnson (Lockheed F-104) and the US Air Force (Flight Records).Collier Trophy winners, 1950–1959 , National Aeronautic Association. Retrieved: 7 April 2008 Design Sectioned compressor stage of a J79 The J79 is a single-spool turbojet with a seventeen-stage compressor with, what was at the time, a novel arrangement of variable stator blades which allow the engine to develop pressure similar to a twin-spool engine at a much lower weight. Anyone new to variable stators had to overcome the complexity of the linkages and the difficulty of sealing the pivots and airfoil root/casing clearances. Two spools needed more knowledge about bearings and sealing. GE studied both options for nearly a year before deciding, in 1952, that they should pursue variable stators for the 12:1 pressure ratio(PR) compressor.\\"Starting Something Big\\" Robert V. Garvin, AIAA Inc. 1998, , p.13 Rolls-Royce had tested a rig compressor with four stages of variable stators in 1949 but did not pursue the idea at the time for the 6.5:1(PR) Avon.Rolls-Royce Aero Engines\\" Bill Gunston, Patrick Stephens Ltd. 1989, , p.133 ConnorsThe Engines of Pratt & Whitney A Technical History\\" Jack Connors, AIAA Inc. 2010, , p.221 tells us that Pratt and Whitney chose two spools for the 12:1(PR) J57 as they knew a lot more about bearings and sealing than about variable stators. The J79 was originally known as the X-24A\\"seven decades of progress\\" General Electric, Aero Publishers Inc. 1979, , p.89 and was supported by a demonstrator engine, the GOL-1590. The compressor blades are made of stainless steel and are mounted on disks (the first seven stage's disks being made of titanium) and spaced with corrosion-resistant (not stainless) steel spacers. The J79 makes a particular howling sound at certain throttle settings. This strange feature led to the NASA operated F-104B Starfighter, N819NA, being named Howling Howland.Bashow 1986, p. 16. Early engines also produced noticeable quantities of smoke, especially at mid-throttle/cruise settings, a disadvantage in a combat aircraft making them vulnerable to visual detection. Later models were redesigned to be \\"smokeless\\". The turboshaft counterpart to the J79 is the General Electric LM1500, used for land and marine applications. Many J79 derived engines have found uses as gas turbine power generators in remote locations, in applications such as powering pipelines. The J79 has two commercial derivatives: CJ805-3 (a non-afterburning engine, fitted with thrust reverser and sound suppressor), and the CJ805-23 (with a free-wheeling aft fan and thrust reverser) fitted to the Convair CV-880 and the Convair CV-990 respectively. With air-start systems gas turbine engine compressor spools are rotated by the action of a large volume of compressed air acting directly on the compressor blades or driving the engine through a small, geared turbine motor.

His numerous grotesque tales and novels, sometimes on the border of speculative fiction, science fiction and realism, place him in a unique and unorthodox position among Italian writers.Cassell Dictionary of Italian Literature, 1996, p.310 He won a number of awards, including the prestigious Strega Prize. Life He was born in Pico, now in the province of Frosinone (then in province of Terra di Lavoro, the roughly modern-day province of Caserta), to a noble family. In 1932, he graduated in Russian language and literature at the University of Florence. During his time in Florence he worked on various magazines including Letteratura and Campo di Marte. He later worked on other magazines and newspapers including Oggi, Il Mondo and Corriere della Sera. He focused his translation efforts upon Russian and German authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol and Hugo von Hofmannsthal. He spent much of his life in Rome and at the family home at Pico, as well as the gaming houses of Sanremo and Venice, where he was an avid gambler. He died in Rome. He was an atheist.Giovanna Ghetti Abruzzi, L'enigma Landolfi, Bulzoni, 1979, p. 307. Writings Landolfi is a writer of rare stylistic power.Alberto Asor Rosa, Storia della letterature italiana (Florence: La Nuova Italia, 1985) p.626 His originality lies principally in his ability to incorporate his wide knowledge of European literature into his Italian inheritance, with a poet's (and translator's) close concern with language. His work reveals the clear influence of writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and Gogol.Alexander Stille, Los Angeles Times, 4 June 1989 Susan Sontag saw him as something of a cross between Borges and Isak Dinesen, but thought him probably better than either.New York Review of Books, 23 January 1964 Landolfi constantly strives to enrich his own style, drawing on obscure or even archaic formulations and at times creating his own languages. In an almost Pirandellian fashion, Landolfi is constantly haunted by the unresolved conflict between art and life.Cassell Dictionary of Italian Literature, 1996, p.309 He wrote a number of short stories and novels, poetry and theatrical pieces, the early work being in general the most significant, particularly the works of his so-called 'youthful maturity', the collection of short stories Dialogo dei massimi sistemi (1937). La Pietra Lunare (1939), his first novel, opens on a grotesque and almost hallucinatory scene of 'provincial life' from which the main character, Giovancarlo, is possessed by Gurù, the goat-girl, who allures him through a realm of phantasmagorical horror into the bowels of the earth and an erotic initiation. The world seems divided between two opposing realities, between the misery of everyday life and another strange and marvellous world. Racconto d'Autunno (1947) is his best known work outside Italy. Its story is, in more ways than one, a metaphor for an end to the old and the beginning of the new. While ghosts, terror and war dominate the landscape, and a gothic horror story is the main plot, there is nonetheless a sense that this book is a lamentation on an epoch that came to a violent end during World War II. Cancroregina (1950) is a strange science-fiction story, in the form of a diary written by a man who is stuck in orbit in outer space and cannot return to earth. A caso, a collection of short stories, won him the Strega Prize in 1975. His daughter Idolina founded, in 1996 the Centro Studi Landolfiani.

Since 2018, Mace has served as a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives for District 99, covering Hanahan, northeast Mount Pleasant, and Daniel Island, South Carolina. Early life and education Mace was born at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to United States Army officer James Emory Mace and school teacher Anne Mace. In 1999 she became the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, receiving a degree in business administration. Mace went on to earn a master's degree in journalism and mass communication from the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia.  Career  In 2008, Mace started a consulting business called The Mace Group. She worked for the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign in South Carolina. Mace is the author of In the Company of Men: A Woman at The Citadel, published by Simon & Schuster in 2001, about her experience in becoming the first woman to graduate from the Corps of Cadets portion of The Citadel. Political career =2014 United States Senate campaign= On August 3, 2013, Mace announced that she would seek the GOP nomination for the United States Senate in South Carolina for the 2014 election. Mace won 6.2 percent of the vote with 19,560 votes cast in her name in the Republican primary. =South Carolina State House= 2017 election On September 18, 2017, Mace announced and filed as a Republican to run in a special election for the South Carolina State House District 99 seat being vacated by Jimmy Merrill, who resigned earlier that month following an indictment and plea deal for several ethics violations. She received 49.5% of the votes in the November 14 Republican primary, 13 votes short of winning the nomination outright. She defeated the second place challenger, Mount Pleasant town councilman Mark Smith on November 28 in a runoff, 63-37%. Mace defeated Democrat Cindy Boatright in the January 16, 2018, general election by a margin of 2,066 to 1,587 votes or 57-43%. Mace assumed office on January 23, 2018. 2018 campaign Mace won re-election against Democratic nominee and Mount Pleasant resident Jen Gibson in the general election on November 6. Tenure In 2019, Mace successfully advocated for the inclusion of exceptions for rape and incest in a fetal heartbeat abortion ban bill that passed in the South Carolina state House. In a speech on the state house floor, Mace revealed that she had been raped at age 16. She has stated that she opposes abortion but does not believe the government has the right to tell a victim of rape or incest they do not have the right to an abortion. Mace co- sponsored a bill to oppose offshore drilling off of South Carolina's coast. She broke sharply with President Trump's plan to offer oil drilling leases off of South Carolina beaches. Mace earned a 100% Lifetime rating from the Conservation Voters of South Carolina for her voting record against offshore drilling and seismic testing. Mace received the 2019 Tax Payer Hero Award from the South Carolina Club for Growth.

The zoo features animal feedings, kayak tours, behind-the-scenes tours, and a train ride, along with the attraction Treetop Trek. The zoo has also featured a dinosaur exhibit several times in its past; its most recent exhibit \\"Dinosaurs are Back\\" ran from November 2017 to April 2018. Brevard Zoo is a nonprofit organization accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The zoo is divided into four loops: Expedition Africa, Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond, Wild Florida, and Rainforest Revealed. These loops are accessed off of the main loop that encircles the flamingo pond. History In 1986, the East Coast Zoological Society of Florida, Inc. (ECZS) formed. One of their goals was to build a zoo for Brevard County to \\"serve as a conversation hub where people could gather to learn about animals and nature. A place to escape from the manmade world and reconnect with the diversity of the life with which we share this planet.\\".https://brevardzoo.org/about-us/ Brevard Zoo. Our History. Retrieved April 20, 2020. In 1992, construction of the zoo began, with over 16,000 people coming together to help build the zoo. The Brevard Zoo claims to have had \\"The World's Largest Volunteer Community Build.\\" The Brevard Zoo celebrated its grand opening on March 26, 1994. A record 328,973 visitors attended in 2007. This included 175,046 paid daily guests. The others included reciprocal members of other zoos, and annual members. The zoo has an annual budget of $5 million most of which is earned and not raised through fundraising or grants.Space Coast Business.com accessed January 19, 2008 In October 2012, one of the southern white rhinos from this zoo was transferred to Alabama's Birmingham Zoo to take part in a breeding program with its two female southern white rhinos.http://www.articles.sun- sentinel.com/2012-11-08/news/fl-florida-rhino-breeding-20121108_1_rhinos- brevard-zoo-aquariums-species-survival-plan In 2014, the black-throated monitor died. It was donated to the zoo when it was two years old in 2005. In 2017, the zoo renovated their Australia and Asia exhibits and reopened them as \\"Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond.\\" In 2019, the zoo renovated their La Selva exhibits and reopened then as \\"Rainforest Revealed.\\" Park areas =Wildlife Detective Training Academy= The Wildlife Detective Training Academy, or WDTA, is a building focused specifically towards younger children and features terrariums containing many of the zoo's reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, and a few mammals including chinchillas and flying squirrels. It also features interactive activities, such as a sand pit, where children can dig up bones from an animal \\"crime scene\\", and an animal hospital where children can learn about animal anatomy and veterinary science. The WDTA also features a new mystery every month in which children can investigate and find clues throughout the zoo. The building is located to the right of the main entrance in a separate building. After Paws On reopened in 2009, visitors now have to go through Paws On to enter the WDTA. =Expedition Africa= Expedition Africa offers kayaking on the grounds of the zoo. Trained staff lead the kayak trips and provide informative dialogue during a slow glide past African-themed exhibits. These exhibits include: giraffes, a blue crane, white rhinos, ostriches, impalas, scimitar-horned oryx, camels, cheetahs and zebras. After kayaking, visitors can climb up to an observation platform where they can feed the giraffes at eye-level. Siamang gibbons are located in-between the entrances to the Expedition Africa and Lands of Change loops. Cheetahs were added in February 2010. Meerkats were added in 2014. Two Grevy's zebra mares were added to the white rhino exhibit on President's Day 2015. The zoo also has a population of scimitar oryx, a species of oryx that has been extinct in the wild since 2000. On February 3, 2017, a new oryx calf was born at the zoo. =Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond= As its name implies, this loop features animals from Australia and Oceania. Visitors can find animals such as the red kangaroo, emu, and wallaby.Brevard Zoo retrieved July 1, 2008 Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond also hosts the free-flight aviary where visitors have the option of feeding rainbow lorikeets. The aviary is home to: galahs, lorikeets, cockatiels, kookaburras, and shelducks, among others. It is divided into two sections - the \\"lorikeet side\\" and the \\"cockatiel side.\\" Right across from the aviary is a state of the art kangaroo walkabout where guests can get up close and personal with the zoo's kangaroos and emus. Inside the kangaroo walkabout, there are several solar panel \\"trees\\" that were donated to the zoo by Florida Power and Light. The solar panels do provide shade for the kangaroos, but their most important function is that they provide all the energy for the komodo dragon house, where two komodo dragons are located. Siamang gibbons are located in-between the entrances to the Africa and Lands of Change: Australia and Beyond. =Wild Florida= River otters, alligators, crocodiles, and bobcats are just some of the animals on exhibit. This loop also contains a pack of the nearly extinct red wolf. Feeding is demonstrated in this loop. There is also an area to kayak into the wetlands in the back of the loop. =La Selva= La Selva houses the zoo's jaguars, cotton-top tamarins, and golden-headed lion tamarins. This loop also feature's green iguanas, a Baird's tapir, a family of capybara, and a Hoffmann's two-toed sloth. In March 2007, a newly constructed vulture exhibit opened, which houses king vultures, turkey vultures, and black vultures. Vulture feedings and demonstrations are offered to visitors much the same way they are conducted within the Wild Florida loop. This loop is currently under construction and expected to reopen at the end of 2019 under the new name \\"Rainforest Revealed.\\" =Paws On= Paws On once provided a place for children to play in a playground, and a petting zoo for children to explore. The Contact Yard (petting zoo) had goats, chickens, a fallow deer, a miniature horse, and a miniature donkey. It was closed for renovations in 2007. It reopened in April 2009 and now contains an updated Contact Yard, a shallow swimming area, an aquarium mimicking the underwater environment of the nearby Indian River Lagoon with animals such as Tarpons, stingrays, and black drums; a touch tank with horseshoe crabs, hermit crabs, and Florida crown conchs; a pizzeria, and various other attractions aimed towards children of all ages. Animals from the old Paws On that were kept include the Soil Cube and the Whale Slide. The Contact Yard now contains alpacas, pygmy goats, an African spurred tortoise, patygonian cavies, chickens and armadillos. Other animals include a great horned owl and Florida box turtles.

The Australian migration zone covers such Australian controlled territories as the government may determine. Prior to 2001, the Australian migration zone consisted of the mainland, and some external territories.. Norfolk Island, for example, was not part of the Australian migration zone until 2016.Norfolk Island Legislation (Migration) Transitional Rule 2016 Under Australia’s universal visa policy, a non-citizen must hold an Australian visa within the Australian migration zone.. Without such a visa, or a bridging visa, the non-citizen is an unlawful non-citizen. and treated as an “unauthorised arrival\\". However, the main impact of the migration zone is that unauthorised arrivals outside the zone have very limited access for review by Australian courts. In the Australian government’s strategy to stem the flow of unauthorised arrivals into Australia, in September 2001, the government passed the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001 and the Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 which removed (\\"excised\\") a number of external territories from the Australian migration zone. The excised territories included Ashmore, Cartier, Christmas and Cocos Islands, which lay in the Indian Ocean between Indonesia and Australia. The effect of the change was to limit the ability of unauthorised arrivals arriving there, termed \\"offshore entry persons\\", to apply for a visa on arrival. However, the Minister was still empowered to grant a visa to such persons “in the public interest”.Section 46A, inserted by the 2001 Act. In 2010, a landmark High Court ruled that the processing procedures on Christmas Island were unlawful and unconstitutional. After these territories were excised, increasing numbers of asylum seekers attempted to reach the Australian mainland by-passing those islands. To combat this tactic, on 30 October 2012, the Australian government excised the entire Australian mainland from the Australian migration zone. The objective of the change was to limit judicial review for boat arrivals. The legislation to excise the mainland itself from the migration zone was passed by Parliament on 16 May 2013.Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Act 2013 Before the excise, asylum seekers who reached the mainland by boat could not be sent for immigration processing to offshore Australian immigration detention facilities on Nauru or Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.Parliament excises mainland from migration zone The excising of islands from the Australian migration zone was and remains a controversial aspect of Australian immigration policy. Refugee advocates argue that Australia is not meeting its obligations under international law to protect refugees. This was not accepted by the Howard Government, which contended that international law obliged Australia to provide temporary protection only and not necessarily permanent settlement. Migration zone etc. --offshore resources activities. Impact on unauthorised arrivals The Australian government claims that in the excised areas Australia has no obligation to grant asylum seekers a visa to settle permanently in Australia (as opposed to temporary protection). The main objective of excising areas from the Australian migration zone is to limit access of unauthorised arrivals to review by Australian courts. Asylum seekers who land in an excised area may only apply for refugee status with the UNHCR. The Acts also included the powers to move unauthorised arrivals to another country where their claim for protection could be considered. Under this authority, thousands of asylum seekers have been moved to off-shore immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island, Nauru, and Manus Island. In subsequent years the government excised other islands, sometimes attempting to do so retroactively, after asylum seekers had already landed. However, the Rudd Government abolished the temporary protection visa scheme in 2008. The practice of diverting boat-borne arrivals to Christmas Island remained, effectively disallowing judicial review. On 16 May 2013, the Australian Parliament passed an Act to excise the entire Australian mainland from the migration zone. Legal implications of excision At times there has been confusion over the effect on Australia's sovereignty over the excised area. Various constitution authorities have voiced the opinion that excising territory from the migration zone does not affect Australia's sovereignty. The \\"excision\\" of areas from the migration zone has no impact on the rights of Australian citizens and permanent residents to travel to and remain in that area, and no documentation is required to travel between these areas and the rest of Australia. Nor is there any impact on the rights of those non-citizens who arrive in these territories with valid visas. Bringing Norfolk Island within the zone Norfolk Island, an Australian external territory, was brought within the Australian migration zone on 1 July 2016. From that date, anyone living on Norfolk Island needed to be an Australian citizen or hold a visa under the Australian Migration Act 1958, and all island legislation on the matter ceased to apply. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection became responsible for administering the system and non-citizen permit holders (except those holding visitor permits) or permanent residents of Norfolk Island were given comparable Australian visa categories. However, a new temporary visa, called Provisional Resident Return visa (subclass 159) was created for those persons who held a work permit for Norfolk Island, who were then only entitled to work on Norfolk Island, and not the rest of Australia.

She sank after an accident off the coast of Turkey following a joint NATO training exercise on 4 April 1953.  Career (US)  Named after a type of pufferfish of the Atlantic coast of the United States and the West Indies, Blower (SS-325) was launched 23 April 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. Richard F. J. Johnson, wife of Commander Johnson, and commissioned 10 August 1944, Lieutenant Commander J. H. Campbell in command. Blower arrived at Pearl Harbor 16 December 1944 and, after undergoing voyage repairs and training exercises got underway for her first war patrol 17 January 1945. She completed three war patrols before the termination of hostilities, all in the Java and South China seas. All three patrols proved unprofitable for Blower and she arrived at Fremantle, Australia, from her last patrol 28 July 1945. Blower departed the Southwest Pacific in September 1945 and, after engaging in training exercises around the Marianas and Caroline Islands for several months, proceeded to the United States via Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Diego 29 January 1946. From 1946 through 1949 Blower was attached to the Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet. She operated mainly along the west coast on scheduled torpedo exercises submerged sound school operations, and training programs. During the latter part of 1946 she made a cruise to Japan, via Pearl Harbor and the Marianas. Early in 1947 she participated in fleet operations near Pearl Harbor. During August–September 1948 Blower operated in Alaskan waters with patrolling along the contour of the Arctic ice pack in the Chukchi Sea, carrying out radar tracking and sonar exercises. Returning to San Diego, the ship continued scheduled operations until early 1950 when she departed for the east coast to join Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at Philadelphia 3 March and underwent repairs at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard until September. On 27 September she arrived at New London, Connecticut, where she trained Turkish naval personnel.  Career (Turkey)  Blower was decommissioned at the Naval Submarine Base New London on 16 November 1950, and transferred to Turkey under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program, where she was recommissioned as the second TCG Dumlupınar - an important name in Turkish history, and the name of the final and defining battle of the Turkish War of Independence. After serving Turkey for close to three years, TCG Dumlupınar was lost due to an accident on 4 April 1953, when, while returning from the NATO training mission \\"Blue Sea\\", she collided with the Swedish freighter M/V Naboland off Nara Point in the Dardanelles and sank. Ninety-four submariners died in the accident due to drowning, bodily injury, and carbon dioxide poisoning. Presently, the TCG Dumlupınar, along with its perished crew, lies at a depth of 90 meters. =The Dumlupınar Tragedy= Late evening on 3 April 1953, Turkish submarines TCG İnönü I and TCG Dumlupınar started their voyage home to the TAF Naval Yards in Gölcük after completing their respective missions in a regular NATO training exercise in the Mediterranean. On 4 April 1953 at 02:10am, they entered the Dardanelles (aka, Çanakkale Strait) en route to Gölcük with 96 crew members - 88 men inside the vessel, and 8 men on deck. There was heavy mist in the strait that night, which severely limited visibility. Lieutenant Hüseyin İnkaya was on deck duty when the Dumlupınar was suddenly and violently struck by something unseen off Nara point - the narrowmost (1.2 km, 0.75 mi) and deepest (113 m, 370 ft) point of the Dardanelles, as well as the point where the currents are the strongest at up to 5 nautical miles versus 1–2 elsewhere on the strait. The eight crew members who were on deck at the moment of collision were thrown off into the water due to the force of the impact, with two of them dying terribly in the sub's propellers, and one drowning in the ensuing commotion. Dumlupınar had been rammed by Swedish cargo ship M/V Naboland in her bow torpedo room on the starboard side, and started to take water from her front compartments. Due to the gravity of the damage caused, and the subsequent explosion in her central compartment, Dumlupınar sank within minutes. Most communications were severed along with any electrical power. The 88 surviving men inside the submarine, seeing that the vessel was taking water from the bow, tried to reach the stern to seek shelter in the torpedo room, with many of them perishing in the rapidly rising waters. Of the original 88, only 22 were able to reach and lock themselves in the stern torpedo compartment, and released an emergency communications buoy with the hope of contacting surface rescue workers. Shortly after the collision, a customs ship that was anchored in nearby Eceabat Harbor was alerted to the incident by a small motorboat that had heard the impact, and had implored them to get to the scene. When the customs ship reached the site of the incident, they saw that M/V Naboland had lowered their rescue boats and life jackets to aid any surviving members of Dumlupınar, and were firing flares to alert potential rescue workers in the area. The customs ship accepted on board the five rescued sailors from Dumlupınar that had not gone down with the submarine, and took them to local hospitals. Three of the hospitalized officers succumbed to their injuries the next day. Nobody on the surface was aware of the level of casualties at the time, and authorities called the rescue vessel Kurtaran to the scene to help the remaining sailors. While waiting for Kurtaran, the sun began to rise, the heavy mist started to clear, and the customs ship spotted the emergency communications buoy that had been released by the trapped sailors. Second handsman of the customs ship Selim Yoludüz reached for the phone located inside of the communications buoy and read the inscription on it, which said, \\"The submarine TCG Dumlupınar, commissioned to the Turkish Navy, has sunk here. Open the hatch to establish contact with the submarine\\". Following these directions, Yoludüz established contact with the sunken submarine, and was responded to by Lieutenant Selami Özben, who informed Yoludüz that the submarine was leaning 15 degrees to the starboard side after impact with a cargo ship, and that the surviving 22 members of crew were locked away in the stern torpedo compartment with no power or supplies. Yoludüz, in turn, informed Lieutenant Özben that they were in the Nara Bay area of Çanakkale, at approximately 90 meters depth, that the rescue ship Kurtaran was on its way, and that they would do everything they can to rescue the trapped sailors. Kurtaran arrived at the scene at approximately 11:00am on 4 April, about 9 hours after the initial impact, alongside Admiral Sadık Altıncan and Governor Safaeddin Karnakçı. Throughout the ensuing rescue operation, Lt.Özben kept in regular contact with Yoludüz, as well as the Admiral of the Çanakkale Sea Forces Zeki Adar, and the second captain of the sister submarine İnönü I, Suat Tezcan. The rescuers implored the trapped sailors to keep their spirits up, and advised them to refrain from talking, singing, or smoking in order to preserve precious oxygen. Despite numerous attempts by engineers, divers, and US and Turkish navy vessels, the rescue efforts provided no results due to the severe currents and the sunken depth of the Dumlupınar, and the morale of the trapped crew began to decline. By afternoon time, the voices of the 22 sailors were quieting, and were being replaced by prayers. Finally, the rescue workers told the sailors, \\"Gentlemen, now you can talk, you can sing, you can even smoke\\". Lt. Özben responded with a final \\"For our country\\", and at approximately 15:00 (3pm) on 4 April, the cable that was holding the communications buoy broke, and no more news were heard from Dumlupınar. Despite the lack of communication, operations continued in order to rescue the trapped men, with the whole country following along via radio and newspapers. On 7 April 1953, three days after the accident, it was declared that the rising carbon dioxide levels inside the submarine would have killed any surviving crew, and the rescue operation was abandoned. The following day, at 15:00 (3pm), a memorial ceremony was held on the ship Başaran. The incident, which captured the attention of the whole country, has since inspired numerous songs and tributes in honor of the fallen sailors, and is commemorated every year on 4 April.

It is part of the Donkey Kong franchise and follows the gorilla Donkey Kong as he sets out to defeat a series of evil kings and conquer the jungle. Jungle Beat is designed for use with the DK Bongos, a bongo drum-style GameCube controller previously used with the Donkey Konga series of music games. The player uses the DK Bongos to control Donkey Kong through various side-scrolling levels as he collects bananas, swings on vines, chains combos, rides animals, and defeats enemies and bosses. The debut project of the 65-member Nintendo EAD Tokyo, Jungle Beat development began around July 2003, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a new Donkey Kong game. Development was led by director Yoshiaki Koizumi and producer Takao Shimizu, who sought to create a simple, accessible game in contrast to more complex contemporary games. Koizumi conceived a game that used the DK Bongos instead of a standard gamepad to control the player character, and applied lessons he had learned from previous projects during development. Because the tone differed from previous Donkey Kong games, the team chose to exclude most of the franchise's existing elements and characters. Jungle Beat was released in Japan in December 2004, with Western releases following a few months later in 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its use of the DK Bongos; they also praised its visuals and level design. Criticism was directed at its short length and low difficulty level. The team that worked on Jungle Beat went on to develop the critically acclaimed Super Mario Galaxy (2007), which notably retained and refined concepts that were introduced in Jungle Beat. Jungle Beat was rereleased as part of Nintendo's New Play Control! line of GameCube ports for the Wii in 2008; the port contains reworked controls and levels. This version was later released as a downloadable game for the Wii U in 2016. Gameplay A screenshot of the first level. The combo count builds up based on how many objects Donkey Kong bounces off of without touching the ground. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is a 2.5D, rhythm-based platform game in which the player controls the gorilla Donkey Kong through a series of side-scrolling levels. It features a simple plot: Donkey Kong sets out on a journey to defeat a series of evil kings and conquer the jungle. While it is compatible with a traditional GameCube controller, Jungle Beat is designed for use with the DK Bongos, a GameCube controller that resembles a pair of bongo drums and was previously used for the Donkey Konga (2003) music game. Hitting the left drum causes Donkey Kong to move left, while hitting the right drum causes him to move right. The player hits both drums to jump and claps in front of the DK Bongos' built-in microphone to send a shockwave. The player uses these controls to perform backflips, slap the terrain, swing on vines, and jump between walls. As the player starts the game, they select a kingdom to explore; there are 16 kingdoms in total and they are gradually unlocked as the campaign progresses. Each kingdom features three levels: two main platforming stages and one boss fight. Unlike traditional platformers, Jungle Beat contains score-attack elements: the goal is not simply to get to the end of the level, but to get as many points, or \\"beats\\", as possible. Beats are obtained by grabbing bananas, which are scattered throughout levels or can be summoned by defeating enemies or interacting with objects. The player can perform combos in midair while grabbing the bananas to increase their beat count. When performing combos, a counter is started, rising with each successive combo move acquired before landing. Beats also serve as Donkey Kong's health, as the player loses beats if they are damaged by enemies or hazards. If the beat count reaches zero, the player receives a game over and must restart the kingdom from the beginning. Like previous Donkey Kong franchise games, in certain levels the player must ride animals, each of which offers a unique attribute: squirrels allow Donkey Kong to glide slowly through the air; wildebeests charge right continuously and plow through objects that provide bananas; orcas carry Donkey Kong through water; and birds allow Donkey Kong to fly. Between most levels, there is a short minigame where the player must tap the bongos as fast as they can to earn extra bananas. The final level of each kingdom contains a boss fight against a large enemy. The game features several types of bosses, each of which must be defeated in a different manner: gorillas must be taken on in a Punch-Out!!-style arena; tanks resembling elephants must be defeated by throwing back bombs that they fire; and birds must be defeated by destroying the giant egg they are carrying. At the end of the kingdom, the total sum of beats (after deducting any damage taken during the boss fight) is tallied up. Completing a kingdom earns a crest, while additional crests are earned by achieving certain amounts of beats. Crests are required to play new kingdoms, which is determined by the number shown. Clearing all the kingdoms in a section unlocks the next set of kingdoms. Players can revisit earlier levels to try to earn more beats, thus earning more crests. Development Donkey Kong Jungle Beat was the debut project of Nintendo EAD Tokyo, a game development division of Japanese video game company Nintendo that was formed in 2003 with a 65-person team. The idea for Jungle Beat originated at Nintendo's primary office in Kyoto, shortly before staff moved to Tokyo to form the new division, when Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that EAD Tokyo develop a new Donkey Kong game. As such, shortly after EAD Tokyo was established in July 2003, development began. Division heads Yoshiaki Koizumi and Takao Shimizu—who had previously led development on Nintendo's Super Mario Sunshine (2002)—respectively served as director and producer. Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka also served as producers, while Koichi Hayashida was the assistant director and contributed to some level design. With Jungle Beat, Koizumi and Shimizu sought to create an accessible, easy-to-understand game. The idea to control Donkey Kong using the DK Bongos originated from Koizumi, who had handled character controls and virtual camera systems on previous projects. He had been \\"hearing from many people\\" that controlling characters in modern games was becoming challenging, which developed into a desire to create a game with a simple control scheme that did not rely on a traditional gamepad. Upon seeing the DK Bongos, he conceived the central idea for Jungle Beat. Using the DK Bongos presented some challenges; since the controller restricted the player's movements, EAD Tokyo had to come up with new game mechanics as a workaround. The developers chose to change the camera angle when Donkey Kong encounters an enemy—altering the control scheme as a result—to keep his abilities and the action varied. The automatic camera also allowed Koizumi to avoid camera problems he found in previous 3D games he had worked on. EAD Tokyo prioritized simplicity during the development of Jungle Beat. Shimizu commented that, as contemporary video games took considerable time to complete and lost appeal if an individual had to stop playing, Jungle Beat levels were designed to take between five and ten minutes, without any shortcuts, to complete. He felt that the game would appeal to a busy person because it did not contain long save or load times. The developers reflected the game's simplicity through its story, which only features Donkey Kong trying to be \\"the best\\"; they sought to instead tell the story through the gameplay. Tonally, Koizumi wanted Jungle Beat to be \\"over the top\\" and hoped it \\"would make even bystanders giggle and enjoy themselves.\\" The decision to exclude elements and characters from previous Donkey Kong games—the only elements returning being the Donkey Kong character and bananas—was made because of the tone, which differed from its predecessors, and because the developers wanted to reflect the style of EAD Tokyo. During its showing at the Nintendo World event in November 2004, Koizumi and the team carefully observed player feedback, and used said feedback to polish the game shortly before its release. EAD Tokyo aimed to release Jungle Beat during Japan's 2004–2005 winter season, which Shimizu commented presented a considerable challenge. The team was ultimately able to complete the game in time for the 2004 Christmas shopping season. A two-player multiplayer game mode was planned, but did not appear in the finished product. Mahito Yokota composed the game's soundtrack. Like he did on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (2002), sound programmer Masafumi Kawamura attempted to synchronize the music with the gameplay, like when Donkey Kong jumps. Release Nintendo announced Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in May 2004, before a demo was showcased at E3 2004 later that month. IGN staff described it as \\"[t]he sleeper hit of the show\\" and wrote that attendees did not want to stop playing. After the showing, in July 2004 it won two Game Critics Awards—selected by journalists from publications such as Time, Entertainment Weekly, and CNN—for \\"Best Original Game\\" and \\"Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game\\". It was also showcased at Nintendo World, which took place in five locations across Japan in November 2004. Jungle Beat was initially released in Japan on December 16, 2004. A European release followed on February 4, 2005, and a North American one on March 14, 2005. The game was released as both a standalone title and a bundle with the DK Bongos. The European version released on the same day as the Game Boy Advance Donkey Kong game DK: King of Swing. To promote the North American release, Nintendo sent 20 individuals dressed up as apes to participate in the 20th Los Angeles Marathon, which took place on March 6, 2005. The individuals wore Jungle Beat- branded clothing, carried DK Bongos, and chanted the game's title as they ran. =New Play Control! version= In October 2008, Nintendo announced that Donkey Kong Jungle Beat would rereleased as one of the New Play Control! titles, a product line comprising seven updated ports of GameCube games for the Wii. The rerelease, New Play Control! Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, was released in Japan on December 11, 2008, as the line's first release. This was followed by a North American release on May 4, 2009, and a European one on June 5, 2009. It was also released as a downloadable game on the Wii U's eShop on November 3, 2016. In lieu of the DK Bongos, the New Play Control! version of Jungle Beat is controlled using the Wii Remote, using its Nunchuk accessory to control Donkey Kong's movement and its motion detection feature to clap. To accommodate the more traditional control scheme, the level designs were altered to include more obstacles, and players do not have to collect crests to progress. It also replaces the banana-based health meter with a more traditional life system, and adds a boss rush mode and support for widescreen television displays. Reception Donkey Kong Jungle Beat received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews across both its releases. Most reviewers considered it unique and fun to play but rather short given the retail price. It was praised for its wide appeal; possessing both a simplicity targeted at new gamers, and a complex, skill-oriented combo system to attract more hardcore gamers. IGN praised the GameCube version's graphics, saying, \\"DK's fur makes StarFox Adventures' models look primitive\\". Criticisms include the game's short length, despite the replayability offered by the score system in levels. There were also complaints of repetitive boss fights, as the same four bosses are used several times throughout the game with limited features to distinguish them. One of the primary criticisms, however, was the lack of past characters and elements from Rare's Donkey Kong Country games. However, despite these criticisms it was rated the 95th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list. Non video-game publications also praised the GameCube version. The New York Times gave it a favorable review and called it \\"wildly entertaining\\". The Sydney Morning Herald gave it four stars out of five and called it \\"a charming romp through dazzling jungle environments via glistening ice chambers, volcanic caverns and aquatic wonderlands. But sadly, many players will complete Jungle Beat in just a few hours.\\" Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four and stated that \\"the bongos are, indeed, special. They mean the difference between a predictable game and one that marches to a different drummer.\\" Common Sense Media gave the Wii version four stars out of five and stated that \\"The bottom line is that it’s fun but brief. Even with its relatively low price tag, the new Jungle Beat might make a better rental than purchase.\\" Impact and legacy Many gameplay elements from Donkey Kong Jungle Beat were reused in Super Mario Galaxy, which was made by the same development team. The helper monkeys were originally going to appear in the game as enemies, but were later removed. These gameplay elements would also be used in its sequel. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a stage based on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat appears in the form of Rumble Falls. It is a stage that scrolls upward, similar to Melee's Icicle Mountain stage. One of the music pieces that can be played on the stage is the BGM of the level \\"Battle for Storm Hill.\\" Additionally, Donkey Kong's \\"Final Smash\\" move involves him repetitively hitting bongo drums and clapping for a brief time, similar to how Jungle Beat is played, and grows in range and damage if the player pressed buttons in sync with the beat. Several stickers and trophies based on the game can be collected.

It was released in 1993 and recorded in Germany at Kai Hansen's studios in Hamburg. The opening track is a short rendition of the first movement of Franz Schubert's \\"Symphony No. 8\\", commonly known as his \\"Unfinished Symphony\\". In addition, the title track features a brief arrangement of \\"Caprice no. 24\\" by Niccolò Paganini, whereas \\"Evil Warning\\" features a brief arrangement of \\"Winter\\" by Antonio Vivaldi. The opening of the track \\"Never Understand\\" features a brief arrangement of the song \\"Asa Branca\\" by Luiz Gonzaga. The opening section of the closing track \\"Lasting Child\\", entitled \\"The Parting Words\\", is an adaptation of the theme of Felix Mendelssohn's \\"Variations sérieuses\\", Op. 54. Production and recording When commenting on the production and recording of the album, vocalist Andre Matos said that recording the album was difficult due to the inexperience of him and his bandmates, and also due to the difference of musical influences between them and the producers. He also referred to the recording as \\"an exile\\": Producer Charlie Bauerfeind was not confident that drummer and co-founder Marcos Antunes would be skillful enough for the music he expected to put in the album, so he told the band they could either fire him and hire Alex Holzwarth as a session musician or use electronic drums - or otherwise he would leave the project. The band decided to do as he said and replaced Antunes with Holzwarth, a decision Matos regards as being very difficult. One of the songs, however, was performed by a different drummer: Kate Bush cover \\"Wuthering Heights\\", played by then Gamma Ray drummer Thomas Nack. Matos said Nack was a big fan of Bush and \\"could play those lines perfectly\\".

There have been investigations by both the Soviet, and Belarusian governments, which have been conclusive as to the perpetrators who are the Soviet NKVD. This is based on former NKVD members confession and the eyewitness testimonies of 55 villagers, from villages such as Cna, Cna-Yodkava, Drazdova, Padbaloccie and others, that gave evidence that NKVD brought people in trucks and executed them during 1937 – 1941. President of the United States Bill Clinton visited Kurapaty forest in 1994, when he came to Belarus with a \\"thank you\\" visit after Belarus agreed to transfer their post-Soviet nuclear weapons to Russia. Clinton presented a small granite monument \\"To Belarusians from the American people\\", perhaps the first post-Soviet cultural artifact from the U.S. on the Belarusian soil. The monument was damaged three times by unidentified vandals, but subsequently restored. In 2001, when the Kurapaty site was threatened by a planned widening of the Minsk Ring Road, youth from the Belarusian Popular Front, Zubr and smaller organizations occupied the site and sat out a bitter winter in tents, trying to halt the road construction, with no success. On October 29, 2004, the Jewish community of Belarus installed a monument in memory of the Jews and other nationals who were murdered in Kurapaty forest. The brown granite stone has two inscriptions in Yiddish and in Belarusian: \\"To our fellow-believers-- Jews, Christians and the Muslims--the victims of Stalinism from the Belarusian Jews.\\" Each year in November, on Dziady (the All Saints or the day when Belarusians commemorate their deceased forefathers), hundreds of people visit this site of crimes of Soviet political repression.

Early life Educated at Selborne College, East London (where he acquired his nickname) he was a keen sportsman excelling at cricket, rugby and tennis. After school, he joined Barclays bank at Umtata. After a short spell in the Johannesburg branch of the bank, he returned to East London. The hostel at Selborne College is named in his honour. Military career Norton's peacetime military training was done with the Middelandse Regiment, but after the outbreak of the Second World War he was transferred to the Kaffrarian Rifles in East London. In 1943, he transferred in to the 1/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment) On 31 August 1944 during the attack on Montegridolfo, Italy, Lieutenant Norton's platoon was pinned down by heavy fire. On his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety, he advanced alone and attacked the first machine-gun emplacement, killing the crew of three. He then went on to the second position containing two machine-guns and 15 riflemen, and wiped out both machine-gun nests, killing or taking prisoner the remainder of the enemy. Throughout these attacks he was continuously under fire from a self-propelled gun, nevertheless he calmly went on to lead his platoon against the remaining enemy positions. The award of the Victoria Cross was gazetted on 24 October 1944. He later achieved the rank of Captain. Later life After the war he moved to Rhodesia, where he ran a large tobacco plantation and became a Rhodesian citizen. Gerard Ross Norton died on 29 October 2004.

Their sound is characterised by a mix of energetic drumming, angular guitar and bass riffs, and call-and-response vocals.  History  Love of Diagrams were formed in Melbourne in 2001 by Monika Fikerle on drums, Luke Horton on guitar and vocals, and Antonia Sellbach on vocals and bass guitar. The trio were described by Heather Phares of AllMusic, as providing \\"a fiery, angular sound that recalls post-punk greats like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Pylon.\\" Locally they \\"made a name for themselves with their kinetic live act and consistent touring.\\" In 2003 they released their debut instrumental album, The Target Is You, on local-based Unstable Ape Records, which received much critical acclaim. They then played an extensive tour throughout Europe and Japan. Whilst touring across Australia, they supported international bands including, Death Cab for Cutie, Electrelane, Les Savy Fav, Stereolab, The Rogers Sisters and Sonic Youth. They released their first extended play, We Got Communication, in 2004 which is their first work to feature vocals. Its five tracks included three new songs and two remixes of other tracks. Amazon.com editorial reviewer opined \\"the new vocal material certainly matches the high energy of their original instrumental work.\\" Two tracks from the EP were also released on a 7\\" vinyl single, \\"No Way Out\\", in the UK through The Passport Label, and the band played a handful of London shows in November 2005. \\"No Way Out\\" was used on an episode of The O.C. in season three, \\"The Game Plan\\". Their self-titled EP was released in September 2006 on Unstable Ape Records, in the United States in January 2007 via Matador Records, and the United Kingdom in February.

The College was ranked among the \\"Best Regional Universities – Midwest\\" by U.S. News & World Report in 2012. History The Congregation of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart of the Roman Catholic Order of Preachers (Dominican Order), today commonly known as the \\"Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids\\", Michigan, led by Mother Aquinata Fiegler, OP, founded the Roman Catholic Novitiate Normal School in Traverse City, Michigan in 1886. The School's mission was to educate young women who had yet to make their vows in the Order of Preachers, i. e., \\"novitiates\\", to be parochial elementary school teachers throughout Michigan, and it trained and sent forth numerous sister teachers successfully. In 1911 the School was transferred to Grand Rapids, along with the motherhouse of the Sisters, pursuant to an invitation of the Bishop of the young Diocese of Grand Rapids.Aquinas College, \\"1886-1939\\", accessed 13 January 2017. In response to the need for their sister teachers to hold baccalaureate degrees, in 1922 the Sisters reorganized the Novitiate Normal School as Sacred Heart College and also commenced admitting lay women. The State of Michigan granted a charter to award two-year degrees to women to the new College in the same year. The site of the new College was transferred to the newly erected motherhouse of the Sisters on East Fulton Street, in the margins of Grand Rapids. At some time between 1922 and 1931 it was renamed as Marywood College.Aquinas College, \\"Heritage and Traditions\\", accessed 13 January 2017. In 1931, it was reorganized as Catholic Junior College, transferred to a site on Ransom Street adjacent to the Grand Rapids Public Library, and became the first Roman Catholic college in the United States governed by women religious to become coeducational. Bishop Joseph G. Pinten of Grand Rapids instigated the reform to admit men alongside women. At that time it awarded two-year degrees. In 1939 Catholic Junior College added a third year to its curriculum. The College began awarding four-year baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Aquinas College in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas, OP and its founder, Mother Aquinata Fiegler, OP, in 1940, but the articles of incorporation to legally effect the institutional change were not filed with the State of Michigan until 1941. In 1945, Mother Euphrasia Sullivan, OP executed for the College the purchase of the Holmdene Mansion, erected by Edward Lowe in 1908, and its arboreal lands, at 1607 Robinson Road, bordering East Fulton Street. The College relocated to the former Lowe estate where it is sited to this day. The North Central Association accredited it in 1946. In 1948 students instituted a chapter of the Dominican Third (Secular) Order (tertiaries; TOP). In May 1950 the outdoor Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima was dedicated, in memory of the members of Aquinas College who sacrificed their lives in the Second World War, after a student and alumni campaign of two years.Aquinas College, \\"1940-1949\\", accessed 13 January 2017. The 1950s and 1960s were a period of great growth and construction, and during them the College abandoned and sold the original campus on Ransom Street. In 1955 the new Administration Building, now the \\"Academic Building\\", was erected.Aquinas College, \\"1950-1959\\", accessed 13 January 2017. In 1974 the College became legally independent of the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids. In 1975 the name of the athletic teams was changed from the \\"Tommies\\" to the \\"Saints\\", pursuant to a student poll, because African American members had been racially ridiculed as \\"Toms\\".Aquinas College, \\"1970-1979\\", accessed 14 January 2017. In 1977 the College was accredited to award its first graduate degree, the Master's of Management in business, which was distinct from the conventional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree awarded by other institutions because it was primarily based on the humanities and not mathematics. In 1993 the College awarded its first doctorate degree, albeit honoris causa.Aquinas College, \\"1990-1999\\", accessed 14 January 2017. Also in 1997, the College officially named its mascot, a St. Bernard (dog), \\"Nelson\\" in honor of President Paul Nelson, who retired that year. In 1998 the College was reorganized into three \\"schools\\", each led by a \\"dean\\" and subdivided into departments: the School of Education, the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the School of Management. Msgr. Arthur F. Bukowski Roman Catholic Chapel, so named in honor of the first President of the College. Campus The arboreal campus is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The College has four dormitories: Dominican Hall, Hruby Hall, Regina Hall, and St. Joseph Hall. It also has five apartment buildings on campus and five \\"living learning communities\\", denominated \\"houses\\" on campus. \\"The Moose\\" (Cook Carriage House) Student publications and radio Publications *The Paraclete, a Catholic news and commentary publication; and *The Torch The student radio station is \\"AQ Sound\\". Administration The College is headed by a President and Board of Trustees. The College's first administrator was Monsignor Bukowski, for whom its chapel is named. In February, 1969, Dr. Norbert J. Hruby succeeded Monsignor Bukowski as President. Hruby Hall, an administrative building and residence hall on campus, bears his name. Aquinas’ third President, Dr. Peter D. O’Connor, served from 1986 to 1990. Mr. R. Paul Nelson served as the fourth President from 1990 to 1997. Dr. Harry J. Knopke served as the fifth President from 1997 to 2006. On July 1, 2006, Provost C. Edward Balog was named Interim President and he became the College's sixth President in May 2007; he retired on June 30, 2011. Dr. Juan Olivarez became the seventh President on July 1, 2011 and retired upon completion of the school year in the spring of 2017. Dr. Kevin Quinn is the eighth and current President of the college. In March 2014, Dr. Gilda Gely became Provost and Dean of Faculty. Notable members of the Board of Trustees include Chairman Lt. General John Nowak, United States Air Force (Ret.) and Sr. Nathalie Meyer, OP, Prioress of the Dominican Sisters of Grand Rapids. Trustees Emeriti include Msgr. William Duncan, Vicar General of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids; Sr. M. Aquinas Weber, OP; and local philanthropists Martin Allen, Jr., Peter Wege, and Kate Pew Wolters. Academics The College has more than 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students and offers 61 majors,, accessed 12 January 2017. awarding Bachelor's degrees and Master's degrees. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association. Many graduates continue to graduate schools: approximately 90% of pre-medical students are accepted into medical schools. The opportunity to study away is a major attraction to many students, as many study for a semester at an international institution. Programs currently offered include: England, Spain, Italy, Ireland, France, Costa Rica, Germany, Japan, and Dominican Exchange ( U.S.). Short term faculty led trips are also offered.

The Office was established under the Commonwealth Gene Technology Act 2000 (the Act). This legislation sets forth a nationally consistent regulatory system for gene technology in Australia. In Australia, all dealings with live and viable genetically modified organisms (GMOs), including import, are illegal unless authorised under the Act. The OGTR has developed a range of documents to provide organisations and interested parties with guidance on monitoring and compliance activities under the Act. Under the act, the regulator may issue technical and procedural guidelines in relation to GMOs (under section 27 of the Act), in relation to certification of facilities to specified containment levels (section 90) and in relation to accreditation of organisations (section 98). The Act, the Gene Technology Regulations 2001 (the Regulations) or instruments issued by the Regulator can require compliance with these guidelines in conducting dealings with GMOs or in obtaining and maintaining certification or accreditation. To ensure the necessary approvals or authorisations are obtained prior to importation, the OGTR is working closely with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) especially in relation to GM seeds/grains. The regulator The regulator is an independent statutory office holder responsible for administering the Gene Technology Act 2000 (the Act) and corresponding state and territory laws. The regulator is appointed by the governor-general only with the agreement of the majority of all jurisdictions. She is responsible for administering the national regulatory system for gene technology as set out in the Act. The OGTR staff are part of the Department of Health. =Office-holders= Dr Raj Bhula is the current Gene Technology Regulator, appointed for a period of five years commencing 18 July 2016. Bhula has over 20 years experience in regulation of pesticides in Australia. She was Executive Director of Scientific Assessment and Chemical Review at the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and Program Manager Pesticides for almost 10 years. Bhula represented Australia at international expert committees including as the Codex Committee for Pesticide Residues and contributed to technical groups of the OECD Working Group on Pesticides. Much of this work has included the development of technical policy and risk assessment methodologies. The regulator's roles and functions In administering the gene technology regulatory system the Regulator has specific responsibility to protect the health and safety of people, and to protect the environment, by identifying risk posed by or as a result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with GMOs. Section 27 of the act sets out the functions of the regulator to: * perform functions in relation to GMO licences as set out in the act (Part 5), which outlines the licensing system under which a person can apply to the Regulator for a licence authorising dealings with GMOs * develop ** draft policy principles and policy guidelines, as requested by the LGFGT ** codes of practice * issue technical and procedural guidelines in relation to GMOs * provide information and advice to ** other regulatory agencies, about GMOs and GM products ** the public, about the regulation of GMOs ** the Legislative Governance Forum on Gene Technology about the *** operations of the Regulator and the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee *** effectiveness of the legislative framework for the regulation of GMOs, including in relation to possible amendments of relevant legislation * undertake or commission research in relation to risk assessment and the biosafety of GMOs * promote the harmonisation by regulatory agencies of risk assessments relating to GMOs and GM products * monitor international practice in relation to the regulation of GMOs * maintain links with international organisations that deal with the regulation of gene technology and with agencies that regulate GMOs in countries outside Australia * conduct other functions conferred by the Act, the Regulations or any other law, such as ** monitoring and enforcing the legislation ** reporting quarterly to the minister and Federal Parliament. Governance arrangements The Act and Regulations and corresponding state and territory laws provide a nationally consistent system to regulate development and use of gene technology in Australia. The legislation establishes the Regulator as an independent statutory office holder to administer the national scheme. Under the intergovernmental Gene Technology Agreement, the states and territories have committed to maintaining corresponding legislation with the Commonwealth. The Regulator is charged with performing functions and exercising powers under the Act and corresponding legislation. While the Regulator must consider risks to human health and safety and the environment relating to dealings with GMOs, other agencies have responsibility for regulating GMOs or genetically modified (GM) products as part of a broader or different mandate. During development of the gene technology legislation, it was determined that the Regulator's activities should form part of an integrated legislative framework that also includes a number of other regulatory authorities with complementary responsibilities and expertise. This arrangement both enhances coordinated decision-making and avoids duplication. The Gene Technology Act was accompanied by consequential amendments of the other relevant Acts relating to requirements for reciprocal request and provision of advice and exchange of information between the Regulator and other relevant regulatory agencies. These requirements include the following: * the Regulator must consult Commonwealth regulatory agencies prescribed in the Regulations on all licence applications for dealings involving the intentional release of GMOs to the environment * there are requirements for agencies regulating GM products to consult and/or notify the Regulator regarding applications for registration of products that are GM or contain GMOs. These provisions support an adequate and timely flow of information between the agencies to inform assessments and decisions. (Accordingly, where other agencies approve GM products, they seek advice from the Regulator and provide notification of their decisions to the Regulator for inclusion on the GMO Record.)

It tells the experiences of a bohemian writer during Bilbao's Main Week fiestas. Plot summary Álex de la Iglesia signs only two pages of this novel. In this introduction he states he has found a laptop computer lost by the poet Juan Carlos Satrústegui. On it, he has read a file called Payasos en la lavadora. Since Satrústegui has entered a mental sanatorium, de la Iglesia talks with the writer's mother and decides to publish the text after correcting it. It is a parody of the old literary technique of the false document found by chance, probably influenced by the fact that, in real life, de la Iglesia writes his film scripts on a laptop computer, which he has lost at least twice. According to this introduction, the rest of the fifteen chapters are Juan Carlos Satrústegui's autobiographical tale. Satrústegui considers himself a genius, superior to all those he comes across. But the reader soon realises his psychic problems (obsessions, deliria, paranoia, lack of empathy) become worse due to the drugs he uses in fiestas, the want of slept and the beatings he earns when dealing with the lumpen. Allusions/references to other works The novel is full of references to popular culture (the very title is about a Spanish TV commercial advertisement for machine soap) and philosophy, with strong contrasts between a literary and grandiloquent language and a rude and crude one, depending on Satrústegui's unstable moods.

The special strength of AMS among the mass spectrometric methods is its power to separate a rare isotope from an abundant neighboring mass (\\"abundance sensitivity\\", e.g. 14C from 12C). The method suppresses molecular isobars completely and in many cases can separate atomic isobars (e.g. 14N from 14C) also. This makes possible the detection of naturally occurring, long-lived radio-isotopes such as 10Be, 36Cl, 26Al and 14C. Their typical isotopic abundance ranges from 10−12 to 10−18. AMS can outperform the competing technique of decay counting for all isotopes where the half-life is long enough. The method Generally, negative ions are created (atoms are ionized) in an ion source. In fortunate cases, this already allows the suppression of an unwanted isobar, which does not form negative ions (as 14N in the case of 14C measurements). The pre-accelerated ions are usually separated by a first mass spectrometer of sector-field type and enter an electrostatic \\"tandem accelerator\\". This is a large nuclear particle accelerator based on the principle of a Tandem van de Graaff Accelerator operating at 0.2 to many million volts with two stages operating in tandem to accelerate the particles. At the connecting point between the two stages, the ions change charge from negative to positive by passing through a thin layer of matter (\\"stripping\\", either gas or a thin carbon foil). Molecules will break apart in this stripping stage. The complete suppression of molecular isobars (e.g. 13CH− in the case of 14C measurements) is one reason for the exceptional abundance sensitivity of AMS. Additionally, the impact strips off several of the ion's electrons, converting it into a positively charged ion. In the second half of the accelerator, the now positively charged ion is accelerated away from the highly positive centre of the electrostatic accelerator which previously attracted the negative ion. When the ions leave the accelerator they are positively charged and are moving at several percent of the speed of light. In a second stage of mass spectrometer, the fragments from the molecules are separated from the ions of interest. This spectrometer may consist of magnetic or electric sectors, and so-called velocity selectors, which utilizes both electric fields and magnetic fields. After this stage, no background is left, unless a stable (atomic) isobar forming negative ions exists (e.g. 36S if measuring 36Cl), which is not suppressed at all by the setup described so far. Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these can be separated by methods borrowed from nuclear physics, like degrader foils and gas-filled magnets. Individual ions are finally detected by single-ion counting (with silicon surface-barrier detectors, ionization chambers, and/or time-of-flight telescopes). Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these detectors can provide additional identification of background isobars by nuclear-charge determination. =Generalizations= Schematic of an accelerator mass spectrometer The above is just one example. There are other ways in which AMS is achieved; however, they all work based on improving mass selectivity and specificity by creating high kinetic energies before molecule destruction by stripping, followed by single-ion counting. History L.W. Alvarez and Robert Cornog of the United States first used an accelerator as a mass spectrometer in 1939 when they employed a cyclotron to demonstrate that 3He was stable; from this observation, they immediately and correctly concluded that the other mass-3 isotope, tritium (3H), was radioactive. In 1977, inspired by this early work, Richard A. Muller at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory recognised that modern accelerators could accelerate radioactive particles to an energy where the background interferences could be separated using particle identification techniques. He published the seminal paper in Science showing how accelerators (cyclotrons and linear) could be used for detection of tritium, radiocarbon (14C), and several other isotopes of scientific interest including 10Be; he also reported the first successful radioisotope date experimentally obtained using tritium. His paper was the direct inspiration for other groups using cyclotrons (G. Raisbeck and F. Yiou, in France) and tandem linear accelerators (D. Nelson, R. Korteling, W. Stott at McMaster). K. Purser and colleagues also published the successful detection of radiocarbon using their tandem at Rochester. Soon afterwards the Berkeley and French teams reported the successful detection of 10Be, an isotope widely used in geology. Soon the accelerator technique, since it was more sensitive by a factor of about 1,000, virtually supplanted the older \\"decay counting\\" methods for these and other radioisotopes. Applications The applications are many. AMS is most often employed to determine the concentration of 14C, e.g. by archaeologists for radiocarbon dating. An accelerator mass spectrometer is required over other forms of mass spectrometry due to their insufficient suppression of molecular isobars to resolve 13CH and 12CH2 from radiocarbon. Because of the long half-life of 14C decay counting requires significantly larger samples. 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl are used for surface exposure dating in geology. 3H, 14C, 36Cl, and 129I are used as hydrological tracers. Accelerator mass spectrometry is widely used in biomedical research. In particular, 41Ca has been used to measure bone resorption in postmenopausal women.

It was released in April 1980, through record label Stiff. Its fusion of post- punk and jangle pop was influential on the forthcoming alternative rock genre, with R.E.M. among others citing the album as an influence. Although it was not commercially successful initially, it has remained critically lauded in the decades since its release.  Background  On the album, band member Glenn Mercer has said \\"The sound we were after was a reaction against the punk scene [...] Being a little older, we felt it had all been done before. We wanted the guitars to be cleaner, and we started experimenting with a lot of percussion.\\"  Critical reception  Although not commercially popular upon release, Crazy Rhythms was a critical success, coming in a number 17 in the Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll, beating out such notable critics' favorites as David Bowie's Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), Joy Division's Closer, The Rolling Stones's Emotional Rescue and The Specials' debut album. David Hepworth, in Smash Hits, wrote that the band \\"have the power to really draw you into their strange little suburban world.\\" In their retrospective review, The Guardian called Crazy Rhythms \\"one of those albums during whose course you hear the most exciting sound in music: things changing.\\" Rolling Stone branded it \\"a landmark of jangly, guitar-driven avant-pop, and its shimmering sound can still be heard in bands like R.E.M.\\" PopMatters wrote that the album \\"stands as a wildly inventive and influential record that stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best music of the American post-punk era. With their very first album, The Feelies managed to speak directly to the zeitgeist of the American independent underground without becoming overexposed or repetitive.\\" Tiny Mix Tapes wrote, \\"Crazy Rhythms, released in April 1980 amongst a veritable shitstorm of like-minded groups, stands grinning madly at the top of the pile – a shining monument to new wave at its quirky best.\\" Crazy Rhythms was ranked number 49 in Rolling Stone's list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s, and number 69 on Pitchforks list. In September 2009 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.

When Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558, there were several Catholic plots designed to remove her and severe measures were taken against Catholic priests. Many great houses had a priest hole built so that the presence of a priest could be concealed when searches were made of the building. They were concealed in walls, under floors, behind wainscoting and other locations and were often successful in concealing their occupant. Many priest holes were designed by Jesuit lay brother Nicholas Owen, who spent much of his life building priest holes to protect the lives of persecuted priests. After the Gunpowder Plot, Owen himself was captured, taken to the Tower of London and tortured to death on the rack. He was canonised as a martyr by Pope Paul VI in 1970. Background The measures put in force shortly after Elizabeth's accession became much harsher after the Rising of the North (1569) and the Babington Plot in particular, the utmost severity of the law being enforced against seminary priests. \\"Priest hunters\\" were tasked to collect information and locate any priests.\\"Priest Holes\\", Historic UK An Act was passed prohibiting a member of the Roman Catholic Church from celebrating the rites of his faith on pain of forfeiture for the first offence, a year's imprisonment for the second, and imprisonment for life for the third. All those who refused to take the Oath of Supremacy were called \\"recusants\\" and were guilty of high treason. A law was also enacted which provided that if any \\"papist\\" should be found converting an Anglican, or other Protestant, to Catholicism, both would suffer death for high treason. In November 1591, a priest was hanged before the door of a house in Gray's Inn Fields for having said Mass there the month previously. Laws against seminary priests and \\"Recusants\\" were enforced with great severity after the Gunpowder Plot (1605) episode during James I's reign. Arrest for a priest meant imprisonment, and often torture and execution. Location and use One of the hides at Harvington Hall, accessed by tilting a step on the Grand Staircase. England's castles and country houses commonly had some precaution in the event of a surprise, such as a secret means of concealment or escape that could be used at a moment's notice. However, in the time of legal persecution the number of secret chambers and hiding-places increased in the houses of the old Catholic families. These often took the form of apartments or chapels in secluded parts of the houses, or in the roof space, where Mass could be celebrated with the utmost privacy and safety. Nearby there was usually an artfully contrived hiding-place, not only for the officiating priest to slip into in case of emergency, but also to provide a place where the vestments, sacred vessels, and altar furniture could be stored on short notice.Allan Fea, Secret Chambers and Hiding Places: Historic, Romantic, & Legendary Stories & Traditions About Hiding-Holes, Secret Chambers, Etc. Third and Revised Edition (London: Methuen & Co., 1908) Accessed July 27, 2013. Priest's holes were built in fireplaces, attics and staircases and were largely constructed between the 1550s and 1605. =Nicholas Owen= Many such hiding places are attributed to a Jesuit lay brother, Nicholas Owen (died 1606), who devoted the greater part of his life to constructing these places to protect the lives of persecuted priests. Priest hole on second floor of Boscobel House, Shropshire They were sometimes built as an offshoot from a chimney. Another favorite entrance was behind panelling; an example is Ripley Castle in North Yorkshire. Others were incorporated into water closets, for example at Chesterton Hall, near Cambridge. Harvington Hall in Worcestershire has seven priest holes throughout the house, including access through the main staircase, panelling, and a false fireplace. After the Gunpowder Plot, Owen himself was captured at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire, taken to the Tower of London and tortured to death on the rack. He was canonised as a martyr by Pope Paul VI in 1970. Effectiveness The effectiveness of priest holes was demonstrated by their success in baffling the exhaustive searches of the \\"pursuivants\\" (priest- hunters), described in contemporary accounts of the searches. Search-parties would bring with them skilled carpenters and masons and try every possible expedient, from systematic measurements and soundings to the physical tearing down of panelling and pulling up of floors. Another ploy would be for the searchers to pretend to leave and see if the priest would then emerge from hiding. He might be half-starved, cramped, sore with prolonged confinement, and almost afraid to breathe lest the least sound should throw suspicion upon the particular spot where he was concealed. Sometimes a priest could die from starvation or by lack of oxygen. See also *Priest hunter *Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom *English and Irish Penal Laws *Come Rack! Come Rope!

It is an alkaloid found in some species of toads (especially the skin), mushrooms and higher plants. The name bufotenin originates from the toad genus Bufo, which includes several species of psychoactive toads, most notably Incilius alvarius, that secrete bufotoxins from their parotoid glands.Bufo Alvarius. AmphibiaWeb. Accessed on May 6, 2007. Bufotenin is similar in chemical structure to the psychedelics psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, and DMT, chemicals which also occur in some of the same fungus, plant, and animal species as bufotenin. Nomenclature Bufotenin (bufotenine) is also known by the chemical names 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-HO-DMT), N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, dimethyl serotonin, and mappine. History Bufotenin was first isolated from toad skin, and named by the Austrian chemist Handovsky at the University of Prague during World War I. The structure of bufotenine was first confirmed in 1934 by Heinrich Wieland’s laboratory in Munich, and the first reported synthesis of bufotenine was by Toshio Hoshino and Kenya Shimodaira in 1935. Sources =Toads= Bufotenin is a chemical constituent in the poison and eggs of several species of toads belonging to the genus Bufo, but most notably in the Colorado River toad (formerly Bufo alvarius, now Incilius alvarius) which is the only toad species in which bufotenin is present in large enough quantities for a psychoactive effect. Extracts of toad venom, containing bufotenin and other bioactive compounds, have been used in some traditional medicines such as ch’an su (probably derived from Bufo gargarizans), which has been used medicinally for centuries in China. The toad was \\"recurrently depicted in Mesoamerican art\\", which some authors have interpreted as indicating that the effects of ingesting Bufo secretions have been known in Mesoamerica for many years; however, others doubt that this art provides sufficient \\"ethnohistorical evidence\\" to support the claim. In addition to bufotenin, Bufo venoms also contain digoxin-like cardiac glycosides, and ingestion of the venom can be fatal. Ingestion of Bufo toad venom and eggs by humans has resulted in several reported cases of poisoning, some of which resulted in death. Contemporary reports indicate that bufotenin-containing toad venom has been used as a street drug; that is, as a supposed aphrodisiac (it is not an aphrodisiac but definitely is a lethal poisonRodrigues, R.J. Aphrodisiacs through the Ages: The Discrepancy Between Lovers’ Aspirations and Their Desires. ehealthstrategies.com ), ingested orally in the form of ch’an su, and as a psychedelic, by smoking or orally ingesting Bufo toad venom or dried Bufo skins. The use of chan'su and love stone (a related toad venom preparation used as an aphrodisiac in the West Indies) has resulted in several cases of poisoning and at least one death. The practice of orally ingesting toad venom has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention.The Dog Who Loved to Suck on Toads. NPR. Accessed on May 6, 2007.Psychoactive toad: Cultural references Albert Most, founder of the Church of the Toad of Light and a proponent of spiritual use of Bufo alvarius venom, published a booklet titled Bufo alvarius: The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran DesertHow ‘bout them toad suckers? Ain’t they clods? Smoky Mountain News. Accessed on May 6, 2007 in 1983 which explained how to extract and smoke the secretions. Bufotenin is also present in the skin secretion of three arboreal hylid frogs of the genus Osteocephalus (Osteocephalus taurinus, Osteocephalus oophagus, and Osteocephalus langsdorfii) from the Amazon and Atlantic rain forests. =Anadenanthera seeds= Bufotenin is a constituent of the seeds of Anadenanthera colubrina and Anadenanthera peregrina trees. Anadenanthera seeds have been used as an ingredient in psychedelic snuff preparations by indigenous cultures of the Caribbean, Central and South America since pre- Columbian times. =Other sources= Bufotenin has been identified as a component in the latex of the takini (Brosimum acutifolium) tree, which is used as a psychedelic by South American shamans, and in the seeds of Mucuna pruriens Pharmacology =Uptake and elimination= In rats, subcutaneously administered bufotenin (1–100 μg/kg) distributes mainly to the lungs, heart, and blood, and to a much lesser extent, the brain (hypothalamus, brain stem, striatum, and cerebral cortex), and liver. It reaches peak concentrations at one hour and is nearly completely eliminated within 8 hours. In humans, intravenous administration of bufotenin results in excretion of (70%) of injected drug in the form of 5-HIAA, an endogenous metabolite of serotonin, while roughly 4% is eliminated unmetabolized in the urine. Orally administered bufotenin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. =Lethal dose= The acute toxicity () of bufotenin in rodents has been estimated at 200 to 300 mg/kg. Death occurs by respiratory arrest. In April 2017, a South Korean man died of bufotenin poisoning after consuming toads that had been mistaken for edible Asian bullfrogs, while in Dec. 2019, five Taiwanese men became ill and one man died after eating Central Formosa toads that they mistook for frogs. =Effects in humans= Fabing & Hawkins (1955) In 1955, Fabing and Hawkins administered bufotenin intravenously at doses of up to 16 mg to prison inmates at Ohio State Penitentiary. A troubling toxic blood circulation effect causing a purpling of the face was seen in these tests. A subject given 1 mg reported “a tight feeling in the chest” and prickling “as if he had been jabbed by needles.” This was accompanied by a “fleeting sensation of pain in both thighs and a mild nausea.” Another subject given 2 mg reported “tightness in his throat”. He had tightness in the stomach, tingling in pretibial areas, and developed a purplish hue in the face indicating blood circulation problems. He vomited after 3 minutes. Another subject given 4 mg complained of “chest oppression” and that “a load is pressing down from above and my body feels heavy.” The subject also reported “numbness of the entire body” and “a pleasant Martini feeling-my body is taking charge of my mind”. The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, as if he were looking through a lens filter. Fabing and Hawkins commented that bufotenin's psychedelic effects were \\"reminiscent of LSD and mescaline but develop and disappear more quickly, indicating rapid central action and rapid degradation of the drug\\". Isbell (1956) In 1956, Harris Isbell at the Public Health Service Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky experimented with bufotenin as a snuff. He reported “no subjective or objective effects were observed after spraying with as much as 40 mg bufotenine”; however subjects who received 10–12 mg injected intramuscularly reported “elements of visual hallucinations consisting of a play of colors, lights, and patterns”. Turner & Merlis (1959) Turner and Merlis (1959) experimented with intravenous administration of bufotenin (as the water-soluble creatinine sulfate salt) to schizophrenics at a New York state hospital. They reported that when one subject received 10 mg during a 50-second interval, “the peripheral nervous system effects were extreme: at 17 seconds, flushing of the face, at 22 seconds, maximal inhalation, followed by maximal hyperventilation for about 2 minutes, during which the patient was unresponsive to stimuli; her face was plum-colored\\". Finally, Turner and Merlis reported that: After pushing doses to the morally admissible limit without producing visuals, Turner and Merlis conservatively concluded: “We must reject bufotenine…as capable of producing the acute phase of Cohoba intoxication”. McLeod and Sitaram (1985) A 1985 study by McLeod and Sitaram in humans reported that bufotenin administered intranasally at a dose of 1–16 mg had no effect, other than intense local irritation. When given intravenously at low doses (2–4 mg), bufotenin oxalate caused anxiety but no other effects; however, a dose of 8 mg resulted in profound emotional and perceptual changes, involving extreme anxiety, a sense of imminent death, and visual disturbance associated with color reversal and distortion, and intense flushing of the cheeks and forehead. Ott (2001) In 2001, ethnobotanist Jonathan Ott published the results of a study in which he self-administered free base bufotenin via insufflation (5–100 mg), sublingually (50 mg), intrarectally (30 mg), orally (100 mg) and via vaporization (2–8 mg). Ott reported “visionary effects\\" of intranasal bufotenin and that the \\"visionary threshold dose\\" by this route was 40 mg, with smaller doses eliciting perceptibly psychoactive effects. He reported that \\"intranasal bufotenine is throughout quite physically relaxing; in no case was there facial rubescence, nor any discomfort nor disesteeming side effects\\". At 100 mg, effects began within 5 minutes, peaked at 35–40 minutes, and lasted up to 90 minutes. Higher doses produced effects that were described as psychedelic, such as \\"swirling, colored patterns typical of tryptamines, tending toward the arabesque\\". Free base bufotenin taken sublingually was found to be identical to intranasal use. The potency, duration, and psychedelic action was the same. Ott found vaporized free base bufotenin active from 2–8 mg with 8 mg producing \\"ring- like, swirling, colored patterns with eyes closed\\". He noted that the visual effects of insufflated bufotenin were verified by one colleague, and those of vaporized bufotenin by several volunteers. Ott concluded that free base bufotenin taken intranasally and sublingually produced effects similar to those of Yopo without the toxic peripheral symptoms, such as facial flushing, observed in other studies in which the drug was administered intravenously. =Association with schizophrenia and other mental disorders= A study conducted in the late 1960s reported the detection of bufotenin in the urine of schizophrenic subjects; however, subsequent research has failed to confirm these findings. Studies have detected endogenous bufotenin in urine specimens from individuals with other psychiatric disorders, such as infant autistic patients. Another study indicated that paranoid violent offenders or those who committed violent behaviour towards family members have higher bufotenin levels in their urine than other violent offenders. A 2010 study utilized a mass spectrometry approach to detect levels of bufotenin in the urine of individuals with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and asymptomatic subjects. Their results indicate significantly higher levels of bufotenin in the urine of the ASD and schizophrenic groups when compared to asymptomatic individuals. Legal status =Australia= Bufotenin is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance according to the Criminal Code Regulations of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is also listed as a Schedule 9 substance under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as \\"Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO.\\"Poisons Act 1964 . slp.wa.gov.au Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 is determined to be enough for court of trial and is considered intent to sell and supply.Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (2015) . slp.wa.gov.au =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, bufotenin is a Class A drug under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. =United States= Bufotenin (DEA Drug Code 7403) is regulated as a Schedule I drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration at the federal level in the United States and is therefore illegal to buy, possess, and sell.§1308.11 Schedule I. deadiversion.usdoj.gov =Sweden= Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying Bufotenin as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.

A railway engineer by training, Crofts introduced railway themes into many of his stories, which were notable for their intricate planning. Although outshone by Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler and other more celebrated authors from the golden age of detective fiction, he was highly esteemed by those authors, and many of his books are still in print. Birth and education Crofts was born at 26 Waterloo Road, Dublin, Ireland. His father, also named Freeman Wills Crofts, was a surgeon-lieutenant in the Army Medical Service but he died of fever in Honduras before the young Freeman Wills Crofts was born. In 1883, Crofts' mother, née Celia Frances Wise, remarried the Venerable Jonathan Harding, Vicar of Gilford, County Down, laterArchdeacon of Dromore, and Crofts was brought up in the vicarage at Gilford. He attended Methodist College and Campbell College in Belfast. In 1912 he married Mary Bellas Canning, daughter of the manager of the Coleraine branch of the Provincial Bank. Engineering career In 1896, at the age of seventeen, Crofts was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Berkeley Deane Wise, who was chief engineer of the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway. In 1899 Crofts was appointed Junior Assistant on the construction of the Londonderry and Strabane Extension of the Donegal Railway. In 1900 he became District Engineer at Coleraine for the L.M.S. Northern Counties Committee at a salary of £100pa, living at 11 Lodge Road in the town.'Who Was Freeman Wills Crofts', Derek Martin, The Bann Disc Vol 10, Coleraine Historical Society, October 2004. In 1922 Crofts was promoted to Chief Assistant Engineer of the railway, based in Belfast. He lived at 'Grianon' in Jordanstown, a quiet village some six miles north of Belfast, where it was convenient for Crofts to travel by train each day to the railway's offices at York Road. One of the projects he worked on was the design of the 'Bleach Green Viaduct' in Whiteabbey, close to his Jordanstown home. This was a significant 10 arch reinforced concrete viaduct approved in 1927 and completed in 1934. It carried a new loop line which eliminated the need for trains between Belfast and the north west to reverse at Greenisland. Croft continued his engineering career until 1929. In his last task as an engineer, he was commissioned by the Government of Northern Ireland to chair an inquiry into the Bann and Lough Neagh Drainage Scheme. Writing career In 1919, during an absence from work due to a long illness, Crofts wrote his first novel, The Cask (1920), which established him as a new master of detective fiction. Crofts continued to write steadily, producing a book almost every year for thirty years, in addition to a number of short stories and plays. He is best remembered for his favourite detective, Inspector Joseph French, who was introduced in his fifth book, Inspector French's Greatest Case (1924). Inspector French always set about unravelling each of the mysteries presented him in a workmanlike, exacting manner – this approach set him apart from most other fictional sleuths. In 1929, he abandoned his railway engineering career and became a full-time writer. He settled in the village of Blackheath, near Guildford, in Surrey, and a number of his books are set in the Guildford area, including The Hog's Back Mystery (1933) and Crime at Guildford (1935). Many of his stories have a railway theme, and his particular interest in the apparently unbreakable alibi often focused on the intricacies of railway timetables. At the end of his life, he and his wife moved to Worthing, Sussex in 1953, where they lived until his death in 1957, the year in which his last book was published. Crofts also wrote one religious book, The Four Gospels in One Story, several short stories, and short plays for the BBC. Marriage, affiliations and other interests In 1912 he wed Mary Bellas Canning, the daughter of John J. C. Canning of Coleraine, Ireland, bank manager. They had no children. He was a member, with Dorothy L. Sayers and Agatha Christie, of the Detection Club which met in Gerrard Street. In 1939 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Crofts was not only a railway engineer and writer, but also an accomplished musician. He was organist and choirmaster in Killowen Parish Church, Coleraine, St Patrick's Church, Jordanstown and the parish church of St Martin's in Blackheath. Reputation Crofts was esteemed, not only by his regular readers, but also by his fellow writers of the so-called Golden Age of Detective Fiction. Agatha Christie included parodies of Inspector French alongside Sherlock Holmes and her own Hercule Poirot in Partners in Crime (1929). Raymond Chandler described him as \\"the soundest builder of them all when he doesn’t get too fancy\\" (in The Simple Art of Murder). His attention to detail and his concentration on the mechanics of detection makes him the forerunner of the \\"police procedural\\" school of crime fiction. However, it has also given rise to a suggestion of a certain lack of flair – Julian Symons describing him as of \\"the humdrum school\\".

The United States opened a consulate in Sydney in 1836, with other countries later following including Switzerland (1855), Germany (1879) and Japan (1896, in Townsville). The diplomatic corps was first established in Canberra in 1936 when the United Kingdom appointed its first High Commissioner to Australia. Canada appointed a representative in 1937 and the United States of America opened a mission in 1940. In 1946, Australia and the United States upgraded their diplomatic relations to the ambassadorial level and exchanged ambassadors in September of that year. Other countries, including France, Canada and Sweden, followed soon afterwards. Initially residences and chanceries were in the Canberra suburbs of Red Hill and Forrest. The majority of missions are today in the lakeside suburb of Yarralumla or the suburb of O'Malley in the Woden Valley.

It was opened in 1992 at a cost of . The centre's original tenant was the Newcastle Falcons NBL team who moved to the new venue in 1992 from their previous home at the Broadmeadow Basketball Stadium. After the Falcons folded at the end of the 1999 season its only tenant was the Hunter Jaegers netball team who played in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. The Jaegers played in the centre from 1997 until 2008. From 2003 the NEC served as the home court for another NBL team, the Hunter Pirates (formerly the Canberra Cannons before the team was moved to Singapore to become the Singapore Slingers after the 2005-06 NBL season). The Newcastle Showgrounds themselves also housed the early Newcastle Rebels back in 1908-1909. This rugby league franchise played two seasons in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership. The Entertainment Centre is renowned for being one of Australia's most flexible multi-purpose stadiums, able to accommodate sports events, various performances and expos. The Newcastle Show uses the Centre for various displays and the showbag area. The stadium has also played host to some of Kostya Tszyu's early fights as an Australian-based fighter. The venue has a listed seating capacity of 4,658, but it can host anywhere between 2,000 and 7,528 for various events. The stadium is air-conditioned (installed as a requirement of the NBL when it moved to playing in the summer), equipped with top-grade lights, and also has scoreboards used for basketball and netball games. The venue is owned by Venues NSW and operated by AEG Ogden.  Purpose  The Newcastle Entertainment Centre was built as a multi-purpose facility to host concerts, sporting events, exhibitions and functions.  Modes  = Concert = The Centre has the following capacities in its different concert modes: * General Admission mode - up to 7,528 patrons * End Stage mode - up to 6,193 patrons seated * Reduced mode - variable between 2,500 and 7,528 patrons Curtaining allows the adapting of the venues to suit more intimate modes for performers. = Sports = The Centre has hosted numerous basketball, netball, boxing, bull riding, ice staking and tennis events. In sports mode, the Centre can accommodate between 2,000 and 5,000 patrons. When Newcastle's team competed in the NSWRFL Premiership in 1908 and 1909, the Newcastle Showground was used as the team's home ground.

In this image most krill swim in an upside down position directly under the ice. Only one animal (in the middle) is hovering in the open water. A sympagic environment is one where water exists mostly as a solid, ice, such as a polar ice cap or glacier. Solid sea ice is permeated with channels filled with salty brine. These briny channels and the sea ice itself have its ecology, referred to as \\"sympagic ecology\\". Residents of temperate or tropical climates often assume, mistakenly, that ice and snow are devoid of life. In fact, a number of varieties of algae such as diatoms engage in photosynthesis in arctic and alpine regions of Earth. Other energy sources include Aeolian dust and pollen swept in from other regions. These ecosystems also include bacteria and fungi, as well as animals like flatworms and crustaceans. A number of sympagic worm species are commonly called ice worms. Additionally, the ocean has abundant plankton, and prolific algal blooms occur in the polar regions each summer as well as in high mountain lakes, bringing nutrients to those parts of the ice in contact with the water. In the spring, krill can scrape off the green lawn of ice algae from the underside of the pack ice.

Location Gardener's House – home to the Goulds in 1943 The village is situated northeast of Worbarrow Bay on the Jurassic Coast, about south of Wareham and about west of Swanage. The village lies in a secluded east-west valley between two ridges of the Purbeck Hills. To the north is the main ridge with Povington Hill () and its highest point, Ridgeway Hill (). To the south is the ridge above Gad Cliff that runs from the headland of Worbarrow Tout in the west to the knoll of Tyneham Cap () in the east.Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 Landranger map series no. 195, 2015 Access Tyneham is only accessible when the Lulworth Ranges are open to the public. The military firing ranges are owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and are part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School. Safety warnings about explosives and unexploded shells are posted at Mupe Bay by the MoD: visitors are advised to keep to official footpaths and observe local site notices because tanks and armoured vehicles are used in this area. History Evidence of Roman occupation has been found on several occasions in the valley around Tyneham and there have been fishing communities associated with the parish since the Iron Age. It seems that it was once the possession of Robert, Count of Mortain the half-brother of William I of England. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Tigeham, meaning \\"goat enclosure\\". A century later, the village was known as Tiham and only in later times as Tyneham. The limestone church of St Mary dates from the 13th Century. In 1683 Nathaniel Bond (1634–1707) of Lutton acquired Tyneham from the Williams family. He also bought Creech Grange in 1691 and the family still hold their Purbeck estates. Tyneham school was established by the Reverend Nathaniel Bond (1804–89) in 1860. It was later declared as property of the rectory and was closed in 1932 due to lack of pupils. The village and of surrounding heathland and chalk downland around the Purbeck Hills, were requisitioned just before Christmas 1943 by the then War Office (now MoD) for use as firing ranges for training troops. 225 people were displaced,Tyneham & Worbarrow – As time passed by... Retrieved 29 June 2014 the last person leaving a poignant notice on the church door: This measure was supposed to be temporary for the duration of World War II, but in 1948 the Army placed a compulsory purchase order on the land and it has remained in use for military training ever since. Although littered with scrap used as targets, and subject to regular shelling, the land has become a haven for wildlife as it has been free from farming and development. In 1975, after complaints from tourists and locals, the Ministry of Defence began opening the village and footpaths across the ranges at weekends and throughout August. Many of the village buildings have fallen into disrepair or have been damaged by shelling and in 1967 the then Ministry of Works pulled down the Elizabethan manor house, though the church remains intact, and has a stained- glass window by Martin Travers. The church and school house have since been preserved as museums. In 2008, Tyneham Farm was reopened to the public and conservation work there is ongoing. In 1985 the village was used for the filming of Comrades, which depicts the story of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. The church had a fibreglass tower and large additional gravestones, and Post Office Row was fronted with fibreglass cottages.

For example, SphI (CGTAC/G) and BbuI (CGTAC/G) are isoschizomers of each other. The first enzyme discovered which recognizes a given sequence is known as the prototype; all subsequently identified enzymes that recognize that sequence are isoschizomers. Isoschizomers are isolated from different strains of bacteria and therefore may require different reaction conditions. In some cases, only one out of a pair of isoschizomers can recognize both the methylated as well as unmethylated forms of restriction sites. In contrast, the other restriction enzyme can recognize only the unmethylated form of the restriction site. This property of some isoschizomers allows identification of methylation state of the restriction site while isolating it from a bacterial strain. For example, the restriction enzymes HpaII and MspI are isoschizomers, as they both recognize the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' when it is unmethylated. But when the second C of the sequence is methylated, only MspI can recognize it while HpaII cannot. An enzyme that recognizes the same sequence but cuts it differently is a neoschizomer. Neoschizomers are a specific type (subset) of isoschizomer. For example, SmaI (CCC/GGG) and XmaI (C/CCGGG) are neoschizomers of each other. Similarly Kpn1 (GGTAC/C) and Acc651 (G/GTACC) are neoschizomers of each other. An enzyme that recognizes a slightly different sequence, but produces the same ends is an isocaudomer.

Walkers are traditionally led across by the governor of Michigan, currently Gretchen Whitmer. In an average year, 40,000 to 65,000 people participate in the five-mile walk. This is nearly the combined population of the three counties connected by the bridge. The Labor Day bridge walk is the sole exception to the rule prohibiting pedestrians on the bridge. History The 2004 Mackinac Bridge Walk The walk was started and took place in late June 1958 during the Bridge's dedication ceremony, led by Governor G. Mennen Williams. That first year only 68 people walked across the bridge. The walk was changed to Labor Day in 1959, and until 1964, participants in the walk alternated north and south in consecutive years. During the 2007 bridge walk, celebrating the bridge's 50th anniversary, participation was estimated at 60,000 walkers.

He is the earliest documented pirate to have worn an eyepatch. He is described by the former British adviser and historian, Charles Belgrave, as 'one of the most vivid characters the Persian Gulf has produced, a daring freebooter without fear or mercy'Charles Belgrave, The Pirate Coast, G. Bell & Sons, 1966 p. 122 (perhaps paradoxically his first name means 'mercy' in Arabic). He began life as a horse dealer and he used the money he saved to buy his first ship and with ten companions began a career of buccaneering. He was so successful that he soon acquired a new craft: a 300-ton boat, manned by 350 men.Charles Belgrave, p122 He would later have as many as 2000 followers, many of them black slaves. At one point his flagship was the 'Al-Manowar' (derived from English).Charles Belgrave, p126 Name His name, Rahmah ibn Jabir ibn Adhbi Al Jalhami, means Rahmah son of Jabir son of Adhbi of the Jalahimah. His name should be written 'Al Jalhami' if transliterated from Arabic, as 'Al Jalahimah' is the plural name for his tribe. Description Rahmah was described by James Silk Buckingham: Early life He was born in Grane (present-day Kuwait) around 1760. Rahmah's father, Jabir bin Adhbi, led their tribe from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar around 1766. After his tribe migrated alongside the Al Khalifa, the two had a subsequent falling out after the Al Khalifa refused to share the economic gain made from trade ventures. Rahmah's tribe nonetheless agreed to fight alongside the Al Khalifa in their battle against the Persians in Bahrain in 1783. After Bahrain was annexed by the Al Khalifa, Rahmah's tribe, feeling dissatisfied with their share of the rewards, moved first to Bushehr and eventually to Khor Hassan in northwest Qatar. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Over a short course of time, Rahmah overtook his eldest brother Abdullah in a struggle for leadership of the tribe; consequently, the tribe adopted piracy as a livelihood. His base in Khor Hassan, which would serve as his base of operation against the Al Khalifa, was surrounded by a protected bay which contributed to the area's defensive capabilities. He resided in a fort with mud walls and there were only a few huts in the vicinity. As a result of no centralized authority existing in Qatar from the 18th to 19th centuries, Rahmah was able to establish dominion over much of the peninsula for a period after the Al Khalifa relocated to Bahrain. Alliance with Saudis Rahmah's alliances with regional powers tended to be on the basis of shared opposition to the Al Khalifa: he formed an alliance with the first Saudi dynasty when it conquered Bahrain, and he founded and relocated to the fort of Dammam in 1809. Though some of his exploits were deemed piratical by the British, J. G. Lorimer, a British historian, remarks on Rahmah's scrupulously-correct conduct and his compliance with the laws of warfare. He generally avoided encounters with British cruisers so that he would not incur their anger. In 1809, after the British expedition of the Pirate Coast, many Qasimi refugees fled to Khor Hassan. Rahmah, the leader of Khor Hassan, reached a compromise with the British in which he agreed not to harbour any fugitivites in return for the sparing of the town. The British also sent a warning to the Saudi amir to demand the prevention of Rahmah from launching any attacks on the British. He influenced the Saudis to launch an invasion of Bahrain in 1809. That greatly strengthened his position in Qatar, rendering him the most powerful tribal leader in the peninsula. Within a short duration, Rahmah had captured eighteen Utub vessels. However, in 1811, the combined forces of Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman and the Al Khalifa successfully drove out the Wahhabi from Qatar and Bahrain. Rahmah then transferred his headquarters from Khor Hassan to his fort in Dammam. Alliance with Omanis In 1816, he allied himself with the rulers of Muscat in their failed invasion of Bahrain,Charles Belgrave, p128 and broke his alliance with the Saudis. The Saudis then destroyed the fort of Dammam in July 1816, and he took refuge in Bushehr, bringing around 500 families with him. Said bin Sultan proposed that he become a subject of Muscat and settle in Oman, but Rahmah refused. He moved back to Dammam in 1818. Subsequent campaigns He assisted the British forces in the Persian Gulf campaign of 1819 against the Al-Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah. The operation was carried out after repeated incidents of piracy perpetrated against British-flagged vessels by the Al-Qasimi. In January 1820, he and his crew were in preparation to launch a naval invasion on Bahrain from Qatif's port but aborted their plans after being warned by the British. The next month, he travelled to Shiraz with three vessels to proffer his assistance to the prince of Shiraz in his planned expedition of Bahrain. His hostilities against Bahrain continued throughout 1821 and 1822; he and his crew went on to capture 7 Bahraini vessels and kill 20 men. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. He settled in Bushehr from November 1822 until February 1824, whereupon he returned to his residence in Dammam. He went to Muscat at the beginning of 1825 and lent his assistance to Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Shakhbout in his expedition against the Qasimi tribe of Ras Al Khaimah. Near the end of that year, he commenced a series of predatory attacks on Qatif as punishment for the non-payment of the protection tax owed to him. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The British decided not to interfere with his actions if his attacks remained confined to the people of Qatif. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. He soon reshifted his focus to the Al Khalifa and went to war with them at the beginning of 1826. After a great number of casualties on his side, he fled to Bushehr where he sought material and military assistance from the British political resident. Having failed to convince the British for aid, he set off to Dammam with a reinforcement of 35 Balochis from Bushehr and continued waging his war against the Al Khalifa. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Death Rahmah raided a ship belonging to the Al Khalifa rulers of Bahrain in October of 1826. After his nephew, Shaikh Ahmed bin Salman Al Khalifa discovered the stolen goods, he decided to intercept Rahmah at sea and return the stolen items at once. In order to reach his uncle, he added the oars of the boat of the Chief of Al Binali tribe, Isa bin Turayf Al Binali, to his own boat to reach his opponent on time. Hours later and practically blind with cataracts, Rahmah inquired about an approaching boat. After being told its captain was Shaikh Ahmed bin Salman his nephew, he mocked his nephew’s bravery saying “The son of Maryoom (Shaikh Ahmed’s mother Maryam was Rahmah’s sister) sails?!” After being asked why Rahmah was surprised to see his nephew he said “How can he set sail if he has not approached fair maidens.” It was maritime custom to lead a ship after marriage as young men were not allowed due to young age to guide the ship. Nevertheless, Shaikh Ahmed approached his uncle and fired. After Rahmah sensed his end might near and having heard his slave called ‘Tarar’ was killed, he took his eight year old son Shaheen and went to the inner galley of his ship. He used the charcoal from his hookah to light up the gunpowder keg. Within seconds, he killed himself and his son and blasted into smithereens that scattered at sea. He died in his ship Al-Ghatroushah in 1826, in a sea battle against the Al-Khalifa ships. Rahmah lit the gunpowder kegs with his eight-year-old son by his side, killing all of his men and the Al- Khalifa men that were raiding his ship, preferring to die by his own hand than to die by the hands of Al- Khalifa.[https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100022870193.0x0000ab Hughes Thomas (1856), p 528. Legacy Rahmah's legacy lasted long after his death; in the 1960s Charles Belgrave wrote of how old men in the coffee shops throughout the region would still talk of his exploits.

Classically, it begins with a single red and slightly scaly area known as a \\"herald patch\\". This is then followed, days to weeks later, by a rash of many similar but smaller round or oval lesions, mainly on the trunk and upper limbs. About 20% of cases show atypical deviations from this pattern. It usually lasts less than three months and goes away without treatment. Sometimes malaise or a fever may occur before the start of the rash or itchiness, but often there are few other symptoms. While the cause is not entirely clear, it is believed to be related to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) or human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7). It does not appear to be contagious. Certain medications may result in a similar rash. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms. Evidence for specific treatment is limited. About 1.3% of people are affected at some point in time. It most often occurs in those between the ages of 10 and 35. The condition was described at least as early as 1798. Signs and symptoms Pityriasis rosea on torso The symptoms of this condition include: * Recent upper respiratory tract infections in 8–69% of patients have been reported by some studies. * Occasionally, prodromal flu- like symptoms, including headache, joint pain, mild fever, and fatigue, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting, and feeling generally unwell, precede other symptoms. * In most cases, a single, 2 to 10cm (1\\" to 4\\") oval red \\"herald\\" patch appears, classically on the trunk or neck, having an appearance similar to ringworm. Occasionally, the herald patch may occur in a hidden position (in the armpit, for example) and not be noticed immediately. The herald patch may also appear as a cluster of smaller oval spots, and be mistaken for acne. Rarely, it does not become present at all. * After the herald patch appears, usually some days or weeks later, a rash of many small (5–10 mm; ¼\\" to ½\\") pink or red, flaky, oval or round spots appear. They are mostly situated on the trunk and upper limbs. They follow the skin's cleavage lines, which on the upper chest and back produce a characteristic \\"christmas-tree\\" distribution. * In 6% of cases an \\"inverse\\" distribution may occur, with rash mostly on the extremities. In children, presentation can be atypical or inverse, and the course is typically milder. * About one in four people with PR have mild to severe symptomatic itching. (Moderate itching due to skin over-dryness is much more common, especially if soap is used to cleanse the affected areas.) The itching is often non- specific, and worsens if scratched. This tends to fade as the rash develops and does not usually last through the entire course of the disease. About a fifth of cases have an atypical form, with significant variations in symptoms including the size, distribution, morphology, and evolution of the lesions. In addition to typical papules and scales, forms appearing as very large plaques (pityriasis rosea gigantea), urticaria, large blisters, patches resembling erythema multiforme, oral lesions, and various other appearances have been noted. A vesicular form can mimic chicken pox. Variations in distribution include inverted forms, with rashes on the face or extremities without appearing on the trunk, as well as more uncommon versions localized to the armpits, groin, or extremities (pityriasis rosea circinata et marginata of Vidal) or unilateral spread. Causes The cause of pityriasis rosea is not certain, but its clinical presentation and immunologic reactions suggest a viral infection as a cause. Some believe it to be a reactivation of herpes viruses 6 and 7, which cause roseola in infants,http://www.dermnetnz.org/viral/pityriasis-rosea.html though some investigations have found no evidence of this. Diagnosis A herald patch of pityriasis rosea which started before the rest of the lesion and was initially mistaken for a fungal infection Experienced practitioners may make the diagnosis clinically. Classical symptoms are usually straightforward to recognize, but the wide range of atypical forms may cause difficulty for the clinician in diagnosing some cases. Misdiagnosis by nondermatologists is not uncommon. If the diagnosis is in doubt, tests may be performed to rule out similar conditions such as Lyme disease, ringworm, guttate psoriasis, nummular or discoid eczema, drug eruptions, other viral exanthems. The clinical appearance of pityriasis rosea in some cases is similar to that of secondary syphilis, and rapid plasma reagin testing should be performed if there is any clinical concern for syphilis. A biopsy of the lesions will show extravasated erythrocytes within dermal papillae and dyskeratotic cells within the dermis. A set of validated diagnostic criteria for pityriasis rosea is as follows: A patient is diagnosed as having pityriasis rosea if: # On at least one occasion or clinical encounter, he / she has all the essential clinical features and at least one of the optional clinical features, and # On all occasions or clinical encounters related to the rash, he / she does not have any of the exclusional clinical features. The essential clinical features are the following: # Discrete circular or oval lesions, # Scaling on most lesions, and # Peripheral collarette scaling with central clearance on at least two lesions. The optional clinical features are the following: # Truncal and proximal limb distribution, with less than 10% of lesions distal to mid-upper- arm and mid-thigh, # Orientation of most lesions along skin cleavage lines, and # A herald patch (not necessarily the largest) appearing at least two days before eruption of other lesions, from history of the patient or from clinical observation. The exclusional clinical features are the following: # Multiple small vesicles at the centre of two or more lesions, # Two or more lesions on palmar or plantar skin surfaces, and # Clinical or serological evidence of secondary syphilis. Treatment The condition usually resolves on its own, and treatment is not required. Oral antihistamines or topical steroids may be used to decrease itching. Steroids do provide relief from itching, and improve the appearance of the rash, but they also cause the new skin that forms (after the rash subsides) to take longer to match the surrounding skin color. While no scarring has been found to be associated with the rash, scratching should be avoided. It's possible that scratching can make itching worse and an itch- scratch cycle may develop with regular scratching (that is, you itch more because you scratch, so you scratch more because you itch, and so on). Irritants such as soaps with fragrances, hot water, wool, and synthetic fabrics should be avoided. Lotions that help stop or prevent itching may be helpful. Direct sunlight makes the lesions resolve more quickly. According to this principle, medical treatment with ultraviolet light has been used to hasten resolution, though studies disagree whether it decreases itching or not. UV therapy is most beneficial in the first week of the eruption. A 2007 meta-analysis concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of most treatments. Oral erythromycin was found to be effective for treating the rash and relieving the itch based on one early trial; however, a later study could not confirm these results. Prognosis In most patients, the condition lasts only a matter of weeks; in some cases it can last longer (up to six months). The disease resolves completely without long- term effects. In a ten-year epidemiological study of 939 people in the United States, less than two percent had a recurrence. Epidemiology The overall prevalence of PR in the United States has been estimated to be 0.13% in men and 0.14% in women. It most commonly occurs between the ages of 10 and 35. It is more common in spring. PR is not viewed as contagious, though there have been reports of small epidemics in fraternity houses and military bases, schools and gyms.

The case inspired a number of questions about the fairness of the Canadian justice system, especially given that Marshall was Aboriginal; as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation put it, \\"The name Donald Marshall is almost synonymous with 'wrongful conviction' and the fight for native justice in Canada.\\"Reluctant Hero: The Donald Marshall Story CBC.ca, URL accessed 10 January 2006. The case inspired the Michael Harris book, Justice Denied: The Law Versus Donald Marshall and the subsequent film Justice Denied. His father, Donald Marshall Sr., was grand chief of the Mi'kmaq Nation at the time. Early life Marshall was born on 13 September 1953 on the Membertou First Nation in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He was the oldest of 13 children of Donald Marshall Sr., the Grand Chief of the Mi'kmaq, and his wife Caroline (née Googoo). Wrongful conviction Marshall was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering acquaintance Sandy Seale in 1971. Marshall and Seale, both 17 years old, a Mi'kmaw and a boy of African descent, (Original NYT article with 3 September 2009 correction) respectively, had been walking around Wentworth Park in Sydney, Nova Scotia during the late evening with the intent to \\"roll a drunk\\" as stated in his trial. They confronted and attempted to rob Roy Ebsary and Jimmy MacNeil, two older men they encountered in the park. A short scuffle occurred and Seale fell, mortally wounded by a knife blow from Ebsary. Ebsary never admitted that he had stabbed Seale and then lied about his role to the police who immediately focused on Marshall, who was 'known to them' from previous incidents. Police speculated that Marshall, in a rage for some reason, had murdered Seale. Marshall spent 11 years in prison before being acquitted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1983. A witness came forward to say he had seen another man stab Seale, and several prior witness statements pinpointing Marshall were recanted. In this appeal, which acquitted him of the previous murder charge, Marshall was assumed to have lied in his first trial about his and Seale's activities on the night of Seale's death. The accusation was that he and Seale had actually approached Ebsary with the intention of robbing him when they were in the park that night. Ebsary was subsequently tried and convicted of manslaughter. When Marshall's conviction was overturned, the presiding judge placed some blame on Marshall for the miscarriage of justice, calling him \\"the author of his own misfortune.\\" This was viewed as a \\"serious and fundamental error\\" by the Royal Commission report. Anne Derrick, Q.C., well-known social justice advocate lawyer, worked as Marshall's counsel, and Order of Canada recipient Clayton Ruby was co-counsel for Marshall, along with Anne Derrick, during the 1989 Royal Commission on Marshall's prosecution.\\"Nova Scotia (Attorney-General) v. Nova Scotia (Royal Commission Into Marshall Presecution), 1989, 2 S.C.R. 788\\" . Retrieved 16 June 2014. The Crown Attorney's failure to provide full disclosure (contradictory and coerced statements by witnesses, because they believed the evidence not provided had no bearing in the case) brought about changes in the Canadian rules of evidence regarding disclosure. The prosecution must provide full disclosure without determination on what may be useful to the defence (that is the defence's duty to decide). Compensation and aftermath Marshall ultimately received a lifetime pension of $1.5 million in compensation. His conviction resulted in changes to the Evidence Act in Canada which was amended so that any evidence obtained must be presented to the defence on disclosure. Prior to this case, Crown Attorneys had discretion to present what they determined to be pertinent to a case. After 1983, the C.A. must provide all evidence with no determination on its usefulness. The rationale of the law is that it is more appropriate for the defense to determine what may or may not assist an accused. In response, a Royal Commission was formed to investigate what had caused the miscarriage of justice; this led to an influential case on judicial independence in Canada, Mackeigan v. Hickman. Fishing rights battle Subsequently, Marshall reached prominence as the primary petitioner in the landmark Supreme Court of Canada case R. v. Marshall [1999] 3 SCR 456 regarding treaty rights allowing Aboriginal people to catch and sell fish under the relevant treaties. The treaty right was established, and Marshall was acquitted. Subsequent arrests In January 2006, Marshall faced charges of attempted murder, uttering death threats and dangerous driving following a New Year's Eve party in which Marshall was accused of attacking a man with a vehicle. The charges were dropped after both men agreed to participate in a healing circle.Once wrongly convicted, Marshall faces new woes, The Globe and Mail In 2008, Marshall faced charges of assault against his wife, uttering threats against his wife and her ex-husband and breach of an undertaking.Donald Marshall, once wrongly convicted, faces psychiatric check CBC News Death Marshall died 6 August 2009, in Sydney, Nova Scotia, from complications of a 2003 lung transplant.

It also reached No. 6 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and produced five singles, including the international hit \\"If It Makes You Happy\\". The album received very positive reviews from critics, who praised its intricate production and Crow's louder and more assured singing. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, the album was awarded Best Rock Album and Crow received the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance award for \\"If It Makes You Happy\\". Retrospectively, it is often regarded as Crow's best album. Background and recording Sheryl Crow is the follow-up to Sheryl Crow's 1993 album Tuesday Night Music Club, which was written by a group of musicians known as the \\"Tuesday Music Club\\". The group existed as a casual collective formed by Crow and musicians Bill Bottrell, David Baerwald, Kevin Gilbert, Brian MacLeod, David Ricketts, and Dan Schwartz. The album was a commercial success and produced several hit singles, including \\"All I Wanna Do\\", \\"Strong Enough\\", and \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\". It was certified 7× Platinum in the United States and 2× Platinum in the United Kingdom. Crow was also awarded Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record of the Year at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards. Tensions between Crow and other members of the group began to arise following Crow's performance of \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman in March 1994. Crow offhandedly agreed with the host when she was asked if the track was autobiographical, even though it was primarily written by Baerwald and based on the book of the same name by his friend John O'Brien. As a result, several members of the Tuesday Music Club group felt betrayed, and O'Brien himself committed suicide three weeks later. Nevertheless, O'Brien's parents insisted that Crow had nothing to do with the tragedy, noting that he \\"was just mad about it [...] But the problems that drove him toward the end were – you know, that's a long, long bloody trip.\\" After Tuesday Night Music Club, Crow wanted to prove her authority as a musician. According to her, \\"My only objective on this record was to get under people's skin, because I was feeling like I had so much shit to hurl at the tape.\\" Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena, California, the same studio where Tuesday Night Music Club was recorded, but sessions were then relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana because Crow \\"was feeling ghosts in that room\\". Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co-wrote three songs that would appear on the album, but eventually left because he could not sort out his differences with Crow. As a result, Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. She also played most of the instruments on the album, including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studios in New Orleans, although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound. Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine. Music and lyrics Musically, Sheryl Crow was described as a combination of rock, blues, alternative rock, country, folk, and light hip hop loops. Unlike its predecessor, it also features a more off-balance production and a richer instrumentation, with \\"lots of fuzz, wurlitzer, hammond, moog. Nothing extreme, perhaps, but almost psychedelic when joined to big mainstream melodies\\", one critic explained. The album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and moral and ethical issues, among others. For example, \\"Home\\" is a folk ballad where Crow recounts the emotional difficulties of a deteriorating relationship, while \\"Superstar\\" deals with a woman fantasizing about stardom. The song \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\", which features hand claps and organ licks, is about the need to escape a constricted life. The opening track, \\"Maybe Angels\\", was described as \\"a cryptic ode to UFOs and government conspiracies that plays like an X-Files theme song.\\" Crow explained that the song is \\"an extraterrestrial yarn that finds Kurt Cobain joining John Lennon in heaven's winged choir\\". The track \\"Redemption Day\\" is a protest against the US indifference to the Bosnian War. It was inspired when Crow visited the country as part of a USO trip with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. The song was later covered by Johnny Cash, appearing on his 2010 posthumous record American VI: Ain't No Grave. The track \\"Hard to Make a Stand\\" references abortion, while \\"Love Is a Good Thing\\" criticizes Walmart's gun sales policy with the lyrics \\"Watch out sister/Watch out brother/Watch our children as they kill each other/with a gun they bought at the Wal-Mart discount stores.\\" The song caused some controversy, resulting in Walmart banning sales of the album at their stores. The album's lead single, \\"If It Makes You Happy\\", underwent several different arrangements before being turned into a rock song. According to musician Jeff Trott, who co-wrote the song along with Crow, \\"It started off as a twangy, David Lynch- esque sort of thing. Then [...] we played it like punk rock, really fast, as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn't, and usually when you find the right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!\\" Trott initially wrote the song when he was a member of Pete Droge's backing band, but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody. Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians. For example, \\"Sweet Rosalyn\\" features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos, while \\"Everyday Is a Winding Road\\" features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House. Release Sheryl Crow was released on CD and cassette formats on September 24, 1996. The album reached No. 6 on the US Billboard 200 chart and sold 143,000 copies in the first two weeks of release. As of January 2008, the album had sold 2.4 million units in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has been certified 3× platinum by the RIAA. In the United Kingdom, Sheryl Crow reached No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified 3× platinum by the BPI. Unlike the American edition, the British edition of the album contains the bonus track \\"Free Man\\". Sheryl Crow also reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. In Europe, it was certified platinum by the IFPI. A special edition of the album, entitled Sheryl Crow – Signature Tour Edition, was released in Australia and Japan in 1997. It contains the bonus tracks \\"Sad Sad World\\" and an alternate version of \\"Hard to Make a Stand\\" as well as a bonus CD with six songs recorded live at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London on November 26, 1996. This 2-CD set was also released as Sheryl Crow – Special Edition in the United Kingdom in 1997. The song \\"If It Makes You Happy\\" was released as the lead single on September 20, 1996, and became an international hit, peaking at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and selling 82,000 units in the first two weeks of release. It was also a success in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart. Other countries where the single charted include Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand and Switzerland. A music video was made for the song under the direction of Keir McFarlane. \\"Everyday Is a Winding Road\\" was released on November 8, 1996 as the album's second single. The song was also a success, reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. The tracks \\"Hard to Make a Stand\\", \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\", and \\"Home\\" were released as the album's last three singles. \\"A Change Would Do You Good\\" was a modest success, peaking at No. 16 on the Mainstream Top 40 and No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart. Critical reception Upon release, Sheryl Crow received very positive reviews from music critics. Eric Weisbard of Spin praised the album's production, stating that the record \\"goes much further\\" than its predecessor and that its \\"bigger beats and dirtier guitar/keyboard effects [work] well with Crow's literate hippie-chick persona\\". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated similar pros, commenting: \\"If there's such a thing as a professional lo-fi album, Sheryl Crow is it.\\" He also noted Crow's louder and more assured singing, concluding that she \\"doesn't expose that much of herself [...] she's an emotional centrist. But at the very least, she's building a bridge to a lasting career\\". Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine praised Crow's vocals, especially on \\"If It Makes You Happy\\", which he felt was probably the album's best song. Despite the praise, the last third of the album was considered the weakest part and the song \\"Ordinary Morning\\" was considered a poor choice for a closer. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke also criticized the album for being underdeveloped and lacking originality, and unfavorably compared the song \\"Hard to Make a Stand\\" to \\"Tumbling Dice\\" by the Rolling Stones and \\"Sweet Jane\\" by the Velvet Underground. The Village Voices Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention grade and quipped that it was indebted to \\"not just Alanis but Tchad\\". In February 1997, Sheryl Crow was ranked at number 26 in The Village Voices 1996 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards, the album was awarded Best Rock Album and Crow received the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance award for the song \\"If It Makes You Happy\\". Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine referred to the album as \\"a postmodern masterpiece of sorts – albeit a mainstream, post-alternative, postmodern masterpiece. It may not be as hip or innovative as, say, the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, but it is as self- referential, pop culture obsessed, and musically eclectic.\\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine highlighted the album's \\"quirky, stream-of-conscious lyrics\\" and elaborate sound collages, stating that \\"none of [Crow's] other full-length albums have been as consistent, immaculately produced or distinctly modern.\\" In 1999, Rolling Stone selected Sheryl Crow as one of the essential albums of the decade. In 2002, the magazine also ranked it at number 44 in its list of Women in Rock: The 50 Essential Albums. In 2003, the album was featured in the Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums list by Slant Magazine. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly magazine placed the album at number 39 in their list of Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Sheryl Crow at number 475 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Neale, ca 1800 Hare Hall is a house and grounds located in Gidea Park in the London Borough of Havering, east London. It was built in 1769-70 as a country house for John A. Wallinger and since 1921 has housed the Royal Liberty School. The Palladian mansion was built to designs by James Paine, who included it in his published Plans.Plans, vol. II, plates 60-63, according to Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Paine, James\\". The main north front is of five bays, with a rusticated basement storey, above which the two upper storeys are unified by a giant portico and pilasters at the angles. Attached to the south front by short corridors there were pavilions containing service rooms. The principal rooms were on the first floor, and were approached by a central staircase with curved ends and a wrought iron balustrade. The main front was of Portland stone, but the south front was of red brick. In 1896 the house was considerably enlarged on that side by filling in the space between the pavilions. At the stud maintained at Hare Park, Cherimoya, foaled in 1908, was bred by the South African mining entrepreneur and horseman William Broderick Cloete; after Cloete's death in the sinking of the Lusitania, during the First World War Hare Park became Hare Hall Camp and housed the 2nd Battalion of the Artists Rifles.

During his time at Oxford he was awarded two rugby union Blues playing in the Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1999 and 2000. Club career Danielli joined The Borders from Bath in September 2004, where he had been since the summer of 2001, prior to which he played for Bristol Shoguns. With the Borders club being disbanded by the SRU in 2007 Danielli moved to Ulster. His try scoring feats for Ulster did not go un-noticed with the IRB stating he was close to making the IRB player of the year list in 2009. His rate of nearly a try every two games made him one of the most dangerous wingers in the Magners League. International career Danielli represented England Students and Under 21s. However, in January 2003 he opted to play for Scotland. He made his international debut against Italy during the World Cup warm-up match in August 2003 scoring a try.

He also scored a try in his Murrayfield Six Nations debut against England in 2004. He dropped out of the international picture in 2005, but was recalled to the Scotland squad for the 2006 Six Nations championship. He was also picked as part of the Scotland 2007 World Cup training squad. He struggled to regularly break into the Scottish first- fifteen due to competition from the likes of the Lamont brothers and Chris Paterson. However, he returned to the international scene on 28 February 2009 (against Italy in the Six Nations) with a try-scoring man of the match performance. He would continue to start throughout this campaign. After injury he returned to the Scotland team again for the match against Italy during the 2010 Six Nations Championship.

Marie, Ontario in Canada, at the turn of the 20th century. Early Years Born in Brewer, Maine, Clergue studied law at the University of Maine after which he was involved in a number of business ventures until coming to Ontario, Canada. Career Clergue came to Sault Ste. Marie backed by Philadelphia businessmen. He saw the potential for industry with the location of the town. He helped establish a hydro-electric dam which provided the town with cheap and abundant electricity. Following the 1895 construction of a new canal and lock, he founded paper mill St. Mary's Paper (closed in 2011), Algoma Steel, as well as a portion of the Algoma Central Railway connecting the city to the transcontinental artery of Canada, for which the city is most noted. He also established the Helen and Gertrude mines. He used all of his ventures collectively to build his empire. Algoma Steel was started by using pig iron from the Helen mine to make steel rails. By 1903, Clergue had overextended himself and the companies that he had founded continued under new management. Later years and death He spent his latter years in Montreal, Quebec, in Canada where he died in 1939 and his remains were return to the United States for burial at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor.

Megafauna are any animals with an adult body weight of over . Paleoecology The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the 'Ice Age', spanned 125,000 to 14,500 years ago and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age which occurred during the final years of the Pleistocene epoch. The Ice Age reached its peak during the last glacial maximum, when ice sheets commenced advancing from 33,000 years BP and reached their maximum positions 26,500 years BP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000 years BP, and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 years BP which is consistent with evidence that this was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level 14,500 years ago. A vast mammoth steppe stretched from the Iberian peninsula across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon where it was stopped by the Wisconsin glaciation. This land bridge existed because more of the planet's water was locked up in glaciation than now and therefore the sea levels were lower. When the sea levels began to rise this bridge was inundated around 11,000 years BP. During the last glacial maximum, the continent of Europe was much colder and drier than it is today, with polar desert in the north and the remainder steppe or tundra. Forest and woodland was almost non- existent, except for isolated pockets in the mountain ranges of southern Europe. The fossil evidence from many continents points to the extinction mainly of large animals at or near the end of the last glaciation. These animals have been termed the Pleistocene megafauna. Scientists frequently define megafauna as the set of animals with an adult body weight of over 44 kg. Across Eurasia, the straight-tusked elephant became extinct between 100,000–50,000 years BP. The cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), interglacial rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus), heavy-bodied Asian antelope (Spirocerus), and the Eurasian hippopotamuses died out between 50,000-16,000 years BP. The woolly rhinoceros and mammoths died out between 16,000-11,500 years BP. The giant deer died out after 11,500 BP with the last pocket having survived until about 7,700 years BP in western Siberia. A pocket of mammoths survived on Wrangel Island until 4,500 years BP. As some species became extinct, so too did their predators. Among the top predators, the sabre-toothed cat (Homotherium) died out 28,000 years BP, the cave lion 11,900 years BP, and the leopard in Europe died out 27,000 years BP. The Late Pleistocene was characterized by a series of severe and rapid climate oscillations with regional temperature changes of up to 16 °C, which has been correlated with megafaunal extinctions. There is no evidence of megafaunal extinctions at the height of the LGM, indicating that increasing cold and glaciation were not factors. Multiple events appear to also involve the rapid replacement of one species by one within the same genus, or one population by another within the same species, across a broad area. The ancestors of modern humans first appeared in East Africa 195,000 years ago. Some migrated out of Africa 60,000 years ago, with one group reaching Central Asia 50,000 years ago. From there they reached Europe, with human remains dated to 43,000-45,000 years BP discovered in Italy, Britain, and in the European Russian Arctic dated to 40,000 years ago. Another group left Central Asia and reached the Yana River, Siberia, well above the Arctic circle, 27,000 years ago. Remains of mammoth that had been hunted by humans 45,000 YBP have been found at Yenisei Bay in the central Siberian Arctic. Modern humans then made their way across the Bering land bridge and into North America between 20,000-11,000 years ago, after the Wisconsin glaciation had retreated but before the Bering land bridge became inundated by the sea. These people then populated the Americas. In the Fertile crescent the first agriculture was developing 11,500 years ago.  Extinction  Four theories have been advanced as likely causes of these extinctions: hunting by the spreading humans (or overkill hypothesis, initially developed by geoscientist Paul S. Martin),Marc A. Carrasco, Anthony D. Barnosky, Russell W. Graham Quantifying the Extent of North American Mammal Extinction Relative to the Pre-Anthropogenic Baseline plosone.org December 16, 2009 the change in climate at the end of the last glacial period, disease, and an impact from an asteroid or comet. These factors are not necessarily exclusive: any or all may have combined to cause the extinctions. Of these, climate change and the overkill hypothesis have the most support, with evidence weighing towards the overkill hypothesis. Although not mutually exclusive, which factor was more important still remains contested. Where humans appeared on the scene, megafauna went extinct; but at the same time, the climate was also warming. Large body size is an adaptation to colder climes, so a warming climate would have provided a stressor for these large animals; however, many fauna simply evolved a smaller body size over time. There is overwhelming archaeological evidence suggesting humans did indeed hunt some or many of the now extinct species, such as the mammoth in North America; on the other hand, there is not much evidence for this in Australia for most of the megafauna that went extinct there, aside from a large bird. A 2017 study in Nature Communications asserts that humans were the primary driver of the extinction of Australian megafauna. One paper arguing genetic evidence shows there were many species of megafauna that went extinct \\"invisibly\\" argues that this means climate change was primarily responsible. Regardless, evidence suggests that humans were a major factor responsible for these extinctions.

The main predators of the region were Arctotherium and Smilodon. =Eurasia= A painting by Heinrich Harder showing an aurochs fighting off a wolf pack As with South America, some elements of the Eurasian megafauna were similar to those of North America. Among the most recognizable Eurasian species are the woolly mammoth, steppe mammoth, straight-tusked elephant, aurochs, steppe bison, cave lion, cave bear, cave hyena, Homotherium, Irish elk, giant polar bears, woolly rhinoceros, Merck's rhinoceros, narrow-nosed rhinoceros, and Elasmotherium. In contrast, today the largest European land mammal is the European bison or wisent. By the advent and proliferation of modern humans (Homo sapiens) circa 315,000 BP, the most common species of the genus Homo in Eurasia were the Denisovans and Neanderthals (fellow H. heidelbergensis descendants), and Homo erectus in Eastern Asia. Homo sapiens is the only species of the genus Homo that remains extant. =Australia= Sir Richard Owen and a Dinornis (moa) skeleton Australia was characterized by marsupials, monotremes, crocodilians, testudines, monitors and numerous large flightless birds.

He taught at Clare College, Cambridge, and was the Regius Professor of Modern History there from 1983 to 1988.  Early life  Ehrenberg (Elton) was born in Tübingen, Germany. His parents were the Jewish scholars Victor Ehrenberg and Eva Dorothea Sommer. In 1929, the Ehrenbergs moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia. In February 1939, the Ehrenbergs fled to Britain. Ehrenberg continued his education at Rydal School, a Methodist school in Wales, starting in 1939. After only two years, Ehrenberg was working as a teacher at Rydal and achieved the position of assistant master in mathematics, history and German. There, he took courses via correspondence at the University of London and graduated with a degree in Ancient History in 1943. Ehrenberg enlisted in the British Army in 1943. He spent his time in the Army in the Intelligence Corps and the East Surrey Regiment, serving with the Eighth Army in Italy from 1944 to 1946 and reaching the rank of sergeant. During this period, Ehrenberg anglicised his name to Geoffrey Rudolph Elton. After his discharge from the army, Elton studied early modern history at University College London, graduating with a PhD in 1949. Under the supervision of J. E. Neale, Elton was awarded a PhD for his thesis \\"Thomas Cromwell, Aspects of his Administrative Work\\", in which Elton first developed the ideas that he was to pursue for the rest of his life. Elton naturalised as a British subject in September 1947.  Career  Elton taught at the University of Glasgow and from 1949 onwards at Clare College, Cambridge and was the Regius Professor of Modern History there from 1983 to 1988. Pupils included John Guy, Diarmaid MacCulloch, Susan Brigden and David Starkey. He worked as publication secretary of the British Academy from 1981 to 1990 and served as the president of the Royal Historical Society from 1972 to 1976. Elton was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1986 New Year Honours. = The Tudor Revolution in Government = Elton focused primarily on the life of Henry VIII but also made significant contributions to the study of Elizabeth I. Elton was most famous for arguing in his 1953 book The Tudor Revolution in Government that Thomas Cromwell was the author of modern, bureaucratic government which replaced medieval, household-based government. Until the 1950s, historians had played down Cromwell's role by calling him a doctrinaire hack who was little more than the agent of the despotic Henry VIII. Elton, however, made Cromwell the central figure in the Tudor revolution in government. Elton portrayed Cromwell as the presiding genius, much more so than the King, in handling the break with Rome and the laws and administrative procedures that made the English Reformation so important. Elton says that Cromwell was responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms by creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of church lands and thoroughly removing the medieval features of the central government. That change took place in the 1530s and must be regarded as part of a planned revolution. In essence, Elton was arguing that before Cromwell, the realm could be viewed as the King's private estate writ large and that most administration was done by the King's household servants rather than by separate state offices. Cromwell, Henry's chief minister from 1532 to 1540, introduced reforms into the administration that delineated the King's household from the state and created a modern bureaucratic government. Elton shone Tudor light into the darker corners of the Realm and radically altered the role of Parliament and the competence of Statute. Elton argued that by masterminding such reforms, Cromwell laid the foundations of England's future stability and success.Arthur J. Slavin, \\"G.R. Elton and His Era: Thirty Years On.\\" Albion 15#3 (1983): 207-229. Influence Elton elaborated on his ideas in his 1955 work, the bestselling England under the Tudors, which went through three editions, and his Wiles Lectures, which he published in 1973 as Reform and Renewal: Thomas Cromwell and the Common Weal. His thesis has been widely challenged by younger Tudor historians and can no longer be regarded as an orthodoxy, but his contribution to the debate has profoundly influenced subsequent discussion of Tudor government, particularly on the role of Cromwell. = Historical perspective = Elton was a staunch admirer of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. He was also a fierce critic of Marxist historians, who he argued were presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the English Civil War was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was largely due to the incompetence of the Stuart kings.See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II (Cambridge University Press, 1974). Elton was also famous for his role in the Carr–Elton debate when he defended the nineteenth century interpretation of empirical, 'scientific' history most famously associated with Leopold von Ranke against E. H. Carr's views. Elton wrote his 1967 book The Practice of History largely in response to Carr's 1961 book What is History?. Elton was a strong defender of the traditional methods of history and was appalled by postmodernism, saying, for example, that \\"we are fighting for the lives of innocent young people beset by devilish tempters who claim to offer higher forms of thought and deeper truths and insights – the intellectual equivalent of crack, in fact. Any acceptance of these theories – even the most gentle or modest bow in their direction – can prove fatal.\\"Ó Tuathaigh, M. A. G., 'Irish Historical \\"Revisionism\\": State of the Art of Ideological Project?' in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325. Ex-pupils of his such as John Guy claim he did embody a \\"revisionist streak,\\" reflected both in his work on Cromwell, his attack on John Neale's traditionalist account of Elizabeth I's parliaments, and in his support for a more contingent and political set of causes for the English Civil War of the mid-seventeenth century. In 1990 Elton was one of the leading historians behind the setting up of the History Curriculum Association. The Association advocated a more knowledge-based history curriculum in schools. It expressed \\"profound disquiet\\" at the way history was being taught in the classroom and observed that the integrity of history was threatened. Daily Telegraph 19th March 1990 Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. For instance, his 1963 book Reformation Europe is in large part concerned with the duel between Martin Luther and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Elton objected to cross-disciplinary efforts such as efforts to combine history with anthropology or sociology. He saw political history as the best and most important kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as Marxism.  Family  Elton was the brother of the education researcher Lewis Elton and the uncle of Lewis's son, the comedian and writer Ben Elton. He married a fellow historian, Sheila Lambert, in 1952. Elton died of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge on 4 December 1994. Works He edited the second edition of the influential collection The Tudor Constitution. In it, he supported John Aylmer's basic conclusion that the Tudor constitution mirrored that of the mixed constitution of Sparta. *The Tudor Revolution in Government: Administrative Changes in the Reign of Henry VIII, Cambridge University Press, 1953. *England Under The Tudors, London: Methuen, 1955, revised edition 1974, third edition 1991. *ed.

The Motueka flows from the mountains 40 km west of the city of Nelson in the southeast of the catchment and flows north to the Tasman Bay. Geography The Motueka River lies 60 kilometres to the south of Nelson, and flows for 120 kilometres, first through rough hill country and then the more gently undulating terrain southwest of Tasman Bay, passing by many small communities such as Ngātīmoti, Woodstock, Riwaka, Brooklyn and many others as it makes it way its outflow into the bay close to the town of Motueka. These communities are connected to the town of Motueka in the north and in the south by the Motueka Valley Highway. The Motueka has three major tributaries, the Motupiko River, Wangapeka River and the Baton River, as well as smaller tributaries called the Pearse, Dove, Tadmor, and Rainy. Geology The river runs through a wide band of granite and areas of recent alluvium, with a complex mix of sedimentary and igneous rocks, originating from the mountainous terrain of the Arthur Range which form the western boundary of the catchment area. and a region of clay-bound gravels to the eastern boundary. As well as the granites, the wide variety of rock types found along the course of the river include complex basement rock, ultramafic, old and young sedimentary rocks. Flooding and river flow The Motueka is a large river with average annual flow of 59 cubic meters per second and a flow range from 6 to more than 2,100 cubic meters per second. The average monthly flow has seasonal variation and it at its highest in winter and spring. The mountain catchment areas to the west and southeast have the highest rainfall and provide most of the mean annual flow for the Motueka River. Significant flooding was a serious problem for the local population and a major flood in 1877 led to widespread erosion and changed the course of the river in several areas. There have since been serious flooding in January 1895, July 1929, June 1954 and April 1957 but this was thought to have been addressed when the Motueka Catchment Control Scheme was completed in 1982. In May 2010, however, twenty homes were flooded by the Motueka River in the Wangapeka area near Tapawera and residents had to be evacuated. Fishing The river is well known for its excellent Brown trout fishing throughout its entire length. Large numbers of trout range below the Wangapeka confluence and very large trophy fish have been caught. Watersports The river is also noted for rafting, canoeing or just drifting down on an inner-tube. Kayaks can be hired from a number of commercial companies and organised trips are available. Invasive algae Precautions have been taken to control the spread of an invasive algae Didymosphenia geminata, commonly known as 'didymo' or 'rock snot', a species of diatom, in the Motueka River and its tributaries,. This algae grows in warm and shallow water and can form large mats on the bottom of rivers. It is not considered a health risk but can affect stream habitats and sources of food for fish and make recreational activities unpleasant. It is considered a nuisance organism or invasive species. The microscopic algae can be spread in a single drop of water, so anglers must clean their waders and boots before moving to different rivers or face a fine of up to $100,000 or up to five years in prison. Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) project  The Motueka River has a wide range of land uses over its catchment of over 2000 square kilometers which include agriculture, with hops, tobacco, Asian pears and kiwifruit grown on the banks of the middle and the lower reaches and commercial forestry on lowland and hill areas. The livestock farming uses include sheep and beef farming and, increasingly, dairy farming, which requires a number of cow crossings on the river that can affect water quality, through introducing fecal coliform microbes and conflict with sports such as fishing. A special research project was therefore established as part of a nine-year programme that began in July 2000 and ended in September 2010. The aim of the research was to provide information to support the management of the environment of the area using an 'Integrated Catchment Management' (ICM) approach. This recognises the catchment or river basin as an ecosystem and includes consideration of social, economic and political factors. Water quality The Motueka River is relatively unpolluted compared to most New Zealand rivers and usually meets the water quality requirements for swimming under baseflow conditions.

Candle Records was originally based in Melbourne, Australia and founded in September 1994 by Chris Crouch. The label concentrated only on local bands with an \\"emphasis on strong lyrics and a wistful, often humorous Australian feel\\" and was run more like a co-op than a corporation. Bands on the label would help each other, promoting the label and CD releases, as well as doing shows together. The first release by the label was The Simpletons's EP, The Nod, in October 1994. This was followed later that year by The Lucksmiths' Boondoggle and Cuddlefish's Grap's Fruity Elixir. Candle went on to have over 100 releases. They took over independent record shop, PolyEster Records, on Melbourne's Brunswick Street and opened a Sydney office ran by Danielle Atkinson. Crouch decided to close the label down on 31 March 2007, citing \\"time for a change\\". The last release by the label was Darren Hanlon's single, \\"Elbows\\", in February 2007. Just before closing down the record label, Candle put on a big farewell show that toured the east coast of Australia. Starting in Brisbane, and then moving to Sydney and finally Melbourne, the all-star show consisted of sets by regular Candle family members The Lucksmiths, Darren Hanlon, Anthony Atkinson and the Running Mates, The Girls From The Clouds, Mid-State Orange and The Small Knives.

When a god is respected or worshipped by means of a representative animal, an animal cult is formed (Teeter et al., 2002, p. 355). Animal cults may be classified according to their outward form or according to their inward meaning, which may of course undergo transformations (Thomas 1911, p. 51). The classical author Diodorus explained the origin of animal worship by recalling the myth in which the gods, supposedly threatened by giants, hid under the guise of animals. The people then naturally began to worship the animals that their gods had disguised themselves as and continued this act even after the gods returned to their normal state (Lubbock, 2005, p. 252). In 1906, Weissenborn suggested that animal worship resulted from man's natural curiosity. Primitive man would observe an animal that had a unique trait and the inexplicability of this trait would appeal to man's curiosity (Weissenborn, 1906b, p. 282). Wonder resulted from primitive man's observations of this distinctive trait and this wonder eventually induced adoration. Thus, primitive man worshipped animals that had inimitable traits (Weissenborn, 1906b, p. 282). Lubbock put forward a more recent view. Lubbock proposed that animal-worship originated from family names. In societies, families would name themselves and their children after certain animals and eventually came to hold that animal above other animals. Eventually, these opinions turned into deep respect and evolved into fully developed worship of the family animal (Lubbock, 2005, p. 253). The belief that an animal is sacred frequently results in dietary laws prohibiting their consumption. As well as holding certain animals to be sacred, religions have also adopted the opposite attitude, that certain animals are unclean. The idea that divinity embodies itself in animals, such as a deity incarnate, and then lives on earth among human beings is disregarded by Abrahamic religions (Morris, 2000, p. 26). In Independent Assemblies of God and Pentecostal churches, animals have very little religious significance (Schoffeleers, 1985; Peltzer, 1987; Qtd. in Morris, 2000, p. 25). Animals have become less and less important and symbolic in cult rituals and religion, especially among African cultures, as Christianity and Islamic religions have spread. (Morris, 2000, p. 24). The Egyptian pantheon was especially fond of zoomorphism, with many animals sacred to particular deities—cats to Bastet, ibises and baboons to Thoth, crocodiles to Sobek and Ra, fish to Set, mongoose, shrew and birds to Horus, dogs and jackals to Anubis, serpents and eels to Atum, beetles to Khepera, bulls to Apis. Animals were often mummified as a result of these beliefs. Hunting cults =Bear= There is evidence that connects the Greek goddess Artemis with a cult of the bear. Girls danced as \\"bears\\" in her honour, and might not marry before undergoing this ceremony (Thomas 1911, p. 51). According to mythology, the goddess once transformed a nymph into a bear and then into the constellation Ursa Major. The existence of an ancient bear cult among Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic period has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings (Wunn, 2000, p. 434-435). Ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and their peculiar arrangement are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic era. (Wunn, 2000, p. 435). Ainu Iomante ceremony (bear sending). Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870. The Ainu people, who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear \\"kamui\\" in their language, which translates to mean god. While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods (Kindaichi, 1949, p. 345). For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term \\"kamui\\" is used, it essentially means a bear (Kindaichi, 1949, p. 345). The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit (Kindaichi, 1949, p. 348). =Whale= Vạn Thủy Tú temple, one of Vietnamese Whale worship in Vietnamese folk religions Whales were little understood for most of human history as they spend up to 90% of their lives underwater, only surfacing briefly to breathe (Bird 2007). Many cultures, even those that have hunted them, hold whales in awe and feature them in their mythologies. A prevalent whale cult in Japan occurs around the coastal area. There are cemeteries with memorial stones dedicated to the whales which were hunted and killed to feed the people (Naumann, 1974, p. 4). Buddhist epitaphs mark these stones which implore that Buddha be reborn as a whale (Naumann, 1974, p. 4). Along with these memorials, there is evidence that whale embryos, found in a deceased mother's womb, were extracted and buried with the same respect as a human being (Naumann, 1974, p. 5). For certain shrines, the bones of a perished whale were also deposited in the area (Naumann, 1974, p. 5). In Alaska, there are cultures that have ceremonial tributes whales after they are captured in a hunt (Lantis 1938, p. 445). Some tribes bring the hump, the fins, or the nose of the whale into their camps or the whaler's house. These parts are meant to represent the entirety of the whale and are honored as such during the festival (Lantis 1938, p. 445). The bones of a whale are also given ritual treatment. The Alaskan tribes that participate in such acts believe that their ceremonies protect the whale's soul from injury and the soul can then be free to return to the sea (Lantis 1938, p. 445). In China, Yu-kiang, a whale with the hands and feet of a man was said to rule the ocean (Siebert 2011, pp. 15–16). In the Tyrol region of Austria, it was said that if a sunbeam were to fall on a maiden entering womanhood, she would be carried away in the belly of a whale (Frazer 1913, p. 72). Paikea (also maori name for humpback whales), the youngest and favourite son of the chief Uenuku from the island of Mangaia, in the present day Cook Islands, was said by the Kati Kuri people of Kaikoura to have come from the Pacific Islands on the back of Tohora (maori name for southern right whales) a whale many centuries before. The whale features in Inuit creation myths. When 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus return order to the world (Siebert 2011, pp. 15–16). The Tlingit people of northern Canada say that the orcas were created when the hunter Natsihlane carved eight fish from yellow cedar, sang his most powerful spirit song and commanded the fish to leap into the water (Heimlich & Boran 2001, p. 7). In Icelandic legend a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but in the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him. In East African legend, King Sulemani asked God that he might permit him to feed all the beings on earth. A whale came and ate until there was no corn left and then told Sulemani that he was still hungry and that there were 70,000 more in his tribe. Sulemani then prayed to God for forgiveness and thanked the creature for teaching him a lesson in humility (Siebert 2011, pp. 15–16). Some cultures that associate divinity with whales, such as some Ghanaians and Vietnamese, coastal Chinese except for southernmost region, Japanese (also known as Ebisu), occasionally hold funerals for beached whales; a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture.(Viegas 2010) See also the below-mentioned Ebisu in fish part for more details. In some lore, whales have been told to work for Ryūgū-jō as well. Indigenous Ainu tribes on Hokkaido refereed killer whales as Repun Kamuy, \\"God of Sea/Offshore\\" in their folklore and myths that the deities will bring fortunes (whales) to coastal people. The Bible mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some commentators to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead (Lamentations 4:3). The story of Jonah being swallowed by a \\"big Fish\\" is told both in the Qur'an () and in the Bible. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40 (Jonah 1-4). Domesticated mammals =Cattle and buffalo= Many religions have considered cattle to be sacred, most famously Hinduism from India and Nepal, but also Zoroastrianism, and ancient Greek and Egyptian religion. Cattle and buffalo are respected by many pastoral peoples that rely on the animals for sustenance and the killing of an ox is a sacrificial function (Thomas 1911, p. 51). The Toda of southern India abstain from the flesh of their domestic animal, the buffalo. However, once a year they sacrifice a bull calf, which is eaten in the forest by the adult males (Thomas 1911, p. 51). The buffalo plays an important part in many Toda rituals. These buffalo are currently endangered. The Ancient Egyptians worshipped a great number of deities who were either depicted entirely as cattle, or incorporated cattle features in their appearance. Hesat, a goddess of milk and motherhood, was depicted as a full cow, as was Mehet-weret, a sky goddess, identified as the Celestial Cow whose body made up the sky, and whose four legs marked the four cardinal directions. Bat (goddess), a goddess of music and dance, was depicted as a woman with bovine ears and horns, as was Hathor, a very major goddess who borrowed a lot of her attributes from Bat. The great antiquity of the worship of Bat is evidenced by her appearance on the Narmer Palette, made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs. When identified with the Celestial Cow Mehet- weret, the sky goddess Nut may also take the form of a cow, as in the Book of the Heavenly Cow. When acting in her role as a heavenly goddess, the mother goddess Isis may also be shown with bovine horns, adopting the traditional headdress of Hathor. As well as these female cow goddesses, the Egyptians also had a number of male bull gods. Conspicuous among these was the bull god Apis, who was embodied in a living bull kept at the Temple of Ptah at Memphis. Regarded as Ptah's herald, the Apis bull was distinguished by certain marks, and when the old bull died a new one was sought. The finder was rewarded, and the bull underwent four months' education at Nilopolis. Its birthday was celebrated once a year when oxen, which had to be pure white, were sacrificed to it. Women were forbidden to approach it once its education was finished. Oracles were obtained from it in various ways. After its death it was mummified and buried in a rock-tomb. A similar practice was in place at Heliopolis with the Mnevis bull, the herald of Ra, and at Hermonthis with the Buchis bull, the herald of Montu. After their death, all these sacred bulls were considered to become part of Osiris (Thomas 1911, p. 51). Similar observances are found in our own day on the Upper Nile. The Nuba and Nuer revere cattle. The Angoni of Central Africa and the Sakalava of Madagascar keep sacred bulls. In India respect for the cow is widespread, but is of post- Vedic origin; there is little actual worship, but the products of the cow are important in magic (Thomas 1911, p. 51). While there are several animals that are worshipped in India, the supreme position is held by the cow (Margul, 1968, p. 63). The humped zebu, a breed of cow, is central to the religion of Hinduism (Margul, 1968, p. 63). Mythological legends have supported the sanctity of the zebu throughout India (Margul, 1968, p. 64). Such myths have included the creation of a divine cow mother and a cow heaven by the God, Brahma and Prithu, the sovereign of the universe, created the earth's vegetation, edible fruits and vegetables, disguised as a cow (Margul, 1968, p. 64). According to Tadeusz Margul, observations of the Hindu religion and the cow has led to a misunderstanding that Hindi have a servile relationship with the zebu, giving prayers and offerings to it daily. Typically, however, only during the Cow Holiday, an annual event, is the cow the recipient of such practices (Margul, 1968, p. 65). Margul suggests that sanctity of the cow is based on four foundations: abstaining from cow slaughter, abstaining from beef consumption, control of breeding and ownership, and belief in purification qualities of cow products (milk, curd, ghee, dung, and urine) (Margul, 1968, p. 65-66). =Sheep= The Ancient Egyptians worshipped several gods with the head of a ram, including Khnum, Heryshaf, Banebdjedet, Ra (sometimes) and Kherty. Amun, the god of Thebes, Egypt, was also associated with the ram, and in later periods was sometimes represented as ram-headed. His worshippers held the ram to be sacred, however, it was sacrificed once a year. Its fleece formed the clothing of the idol (Thomas 1911, p. 52). =Goat= Pavement mosaic with the head of Pan. Roman artwork, Antonine period, 138–192 CE. Silenus, the Satyrs and the Fauns were either capriform or had some part of their bodies shaped like that of a goat. In northern Europe the wood spirit, Leszi, is believed to have a goat's horns, ears and legs (Thomas 1911, p. 51). A deity known as the Goat of Mendes is associated with the pentagram. In Greece, Italy, and Egypt, the goat was worshipped in both goat form and phallic form (Neave 1988, p. 8). This type of worship has sometimes been said to have originated from the goat's increased sex drive. One male goat was capable of fertilizing 150 females (Neave 1988, p. 8). The Greek god Pan was depicted as having goat characteristics, such as hooves, horns, and a beard. Along with Pan, the goat was closely related to Dionysus during the Roman era (Neave 1988, p. 8). To honor Dionysus, Romans would tear apart a goat and eat it alive. The goat was commonly associated with dark arts and the devil. This association was amplified in Egypt during the Middle Ages (Neave 1988, p. 8). Excavations in Central Asia have revealed ancient ritual goat-burial that show a religious significance of the goat predominantly in the area (Sidky 1990, p. 286). These findings have been used as evidence for a goat-cult of Asia originating either in the Neolithic or Bronze Ages (Sidky 1990, p. 286). =Dog= A dog after being decorated in the Kukur tihar festival in Nepal. Dogs have a major religious significance among the Hindus in Nepal and some parts of India. The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day Tihar festival that falls roughly in November every year. In Hinduism, it is believed that the dog is a messenger of Yama, the god of death, and dogs guard the doors of Heaven. Socially, they are believed to be the protectors of our homes and lives. So, in order to please the dogs they are going to meet at Heaven's doors after death, so they would be allowed in Heaven, people mark the 14th day of the lunar cycle in November as Kukur-tihar, as known in Nepali language for the dog's day. This is a day when the dog is worshipped by applying tika (the holy vermilion dot), incense sticks and garlanded generally with marigold flower. Actual dog worship is uncommon. The Nosarii of western Asia are said to worship a dog. The Karang of Java had a cult of the red dog, each family keeping one in the house. According to one authority the dogs are images of wood which are worshipped after the death of a member of the family and burnt after a thousand days. In Nepal it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja. Among the Harranians dogs were sacred, but this was rather as brothers of the mystae (Thomas 1911, p. 51). =Horse= The Uffington White HorseHorse worship has been practiced by a number of Indo- European and Turkic peoples. In the nomadic tradition, the horse is one of the mythological animals, embodying the connection with the other world, with the supernatural. The horse, exceptionally white, has always been associated with the sun, with daytime clarity, with fire, air, sky, water, solar heroes, as an expression of good human aspirations in daily work and struggle against difficulties. The white sun horse is an attribute of divine forces that are constantly fighting against evil — an opposition to death. In the beliefs and rites of the nomads, first, the horse itself, second, its separate parts — the skull, cervical vertebrae, skin, hair, and third, objects associated with it — bridle, clamp, sweat, reins, whip, fallen horseshoe, image, etc., act as the patroness and protector of people. The horse is seen to have the ability to drive out evil forces from the human body. Heavenly horse 天马. A Chinese ancient ceremonial bronze finial with a standing horse, 4th-1st century BC, which was used in rituals dedicated to the cult of Heavenly Horses. A vivid evidence of this is an artifact found in the Northern part of China in the early twentieth century, finished in the form of a horse. Dating of the artifact revealed that it was created in the period between 4th and 1st century BC. It is the only one in the world that was found in the entire territory of the Eurasian steppes — a bronze top with the image of a horse, which was used in rituals dedicated to the cult of Heavenly Horses. There is some reason to believe that Poseidon, like other water gods, was originally conceived under the form of a horse. In the cave of Phigalia Demeter was, according to popular tradition, represented with the head and mane of a horse, possibly a relic of the time when a non-specialized corn-spirit bore this form. Her priests were called Poloi (Greek for \\"colts\\") in Laconia. The mule and the horse are sacred to the Roman god Consus. In Gaul we find a horse- goddess, Epona. There are also traces of a horse-god, Rudiobus. Hayagriva is a horse-headed deity that appears in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Gonds in India worship a horse-god, Koda Pen, in the form of a shapeless stone, but it is not clear that the horse is regarded as divine. The horse or mare is a common form of the corn-spirit in Europe (Thomas 1911, p. 52). Among the Balkan culture, swaddling an unmarried person in a horse-girth is a typical ritual. It is thought that the sexual potency of the horse is passed to the individual wrapped in its girth (Vukanović 1980, p. 112). Along with the Balkan swaddling, Virgil's Aeneid bases the founding of the great city of Carthage upon a horse (Qtd. in Brown 1950, p. 32). When the Phoenicians dug up a horse head from the ground they decided to build their city (Carthage) upon that spot because the horse was a sign of success (Qtd. in Brown 1950, p. 32). Thus, Brown argued that the horse was sacred to the Phoenician people (Brown 1950, p. 32). =Elephant= A statue of Ganesha - the elephant-headed Hindu god of wisdom and obstacle removal In Thailand it is believed that a white elephant may contain the soul of a dead person, perhaps a Buddha. When one is taken the capturer is rewarded and the animal brought to the king to be kept ever afterwards. It cannot be bought or sold. It is baptized and fêted and mourned for like a human being at its death. In some parts of Indo-China the belief is that the soul of the elephant may injure people after death; it is therefore fêted by a whole village. In Cambodia it is held to bring luck to the kingdom. The cult of the white elephant is also found at Ennarea in southern Ethiopia (Thomas 1911, p. 51). In India, the popular Hindu god Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a torso of a human. In Surat, unmarried Anāvil girls participate in a holiday referred to as Alunām (Naik, 1958, p. 393). This holiday is to honor the goddess Pārvatī. During this celebration, a clay elephant is prepared (most likely to celebrate Pārvatī's creation of Ganesha from a paste of either turmeric or sandalwood). Every day, the unmarried women worship this elephant by dancing, singing songs, and abstaining from eating salt. On the final day of Alunām, the clay elephant is immersed in some body of water (Naik, 1958, p. 393). Certain cultures also used elephant figurines to display the animal's importance. There was evidence of an ancient elephant cult in Sumatra (Schnitger, 1938, p. 41). Stone elephant figurines were built as \\"seats of the souls\\" in the Sumatran culture (Schnitger, 1938, p. 41). In North Borneo, however, wooden elephant figurines were placed on the top of a bamboo pole. This bamboo pole was only erected after the tribe chief had collected a certain number of human heads (Schnitger, 1938, p. 41). Wild mammals =Hare= In North America the Algonquian tribes had as their chief deity a \\"mighty great hare\\" to whom they went at death. According to one account he lived in the east, according to another in the north. In his anthropomorphized form he was known as Menabosho or Michabo (Thomas 1911, p. 51). The Ancient Egyptians also worshipped a hare goddess, named Wenut. She was associated with the city of Hermopolis, and her image appears on the standard of the Hermopolitan nome. =Deer= Artemis with a deer, the Diana of Versailles in the Louvre Galerie des Caryatides that was designed for it The deer is important in the mythology of many peoples. To the Greeks it was sacred to the goddess Artemis, while in Hinduism it is linked to the goddess Saraswati. The deer also held spiritual significance to the pastoralist cultures of the Eurasian Steppe. The golden stag figurine found in the Pazyryk burials is one of the most famous pieces of Scythian art. =Wolf= In the story of Rome's foundation, wolves are used in totemic imagery. The founding brothers Romulus and Remus are raised by a mother wolf, making the wolf the symbolic mother of Rome. Among the Ancient Egyptians, the gods Anubis and Wepwawet both took the form a wolf, jackal or wild dog, or a man with the head of such a creature. Anubis was a funerary deity, considered the patron of the mummification process and a protector of tombs. In the afterlife, it was he who performed the crucial role in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony that decided the individual's post mortum fate. In earlier times Anubis was the supreme god of the underworld, but he was later replaced in that role by the human-formed Osiris. It is possible that the Egyptians originally conveived of Anubis as a wild dog because of the animals' location on the outskirts of towns, near the tombs of the dead, or possibly because of their scavengeing of corpses, which led them to congregate near tombs. Wepwawet was a deity more focussed on the world of the living, whose chief role was to 'open the way', whether this be opening the way of the pharaoh to victory in battle, opening the way for the priests in a ritual procession, or any other application. The great antiquity of Wepwawet's worship in Egypt is evidenced by the Narmer Palette, made by the very first of the dynastic pharaohs, including the image of a wolf on a standard as a part of a ritual procession. It has been suggested that Wepwawet's depiction as a wolf stems from the animal's keen sense of smell, allowing it to 'open the way' to find something important. = Big cats = Granite statue of the lion-headed Egyptian deity Sekhmet from the temple of Mut at Luxor, dating to 1403–1365 BC, exhibited in the National Museum of Denmark The cult of the leopard is widely found in West Africa. Among the Ashanti people a man who kills one is liable to be put to death; no leopard skin may be exposed to view, but a stuffed leopard is worshipped. On the Gold Coast a leopard hunter who has killed his victim is carried round the town behind the body of the leopard; he may not speak, must besmear himself so as to look like a leopard and imitate its movements. In Loango a prince's cap is put upon the head of a dead leopard, and dances are held in its honour (Thomas 1911, p. 52). In Ancient Egypt, there were several feline-shaped deities. The earliest attested of these was the goddess Mafdet. During the First Dynasty 2920–2770 BC, Mafdet was regarded as the protector of the Pharaoh's chambers against snakes, scorpions and other evil. She was often depicted with the head of a leopard or lynx(Hornblower, 1943). In later periods, other feline deities were more dominant. There were several lion-headed deities, included goddesses such as Sekhmet, Tefnut, Bastet (early form), Pakhet, Mehit and Menhit, and gods such as Maahes. All of these were fierce deities, dedicated to destroying the enemies of the gods and the pharaoh. Sekhmet, the most famous Egyptian lion- goddess, was considered a daughter of the chief god Ra and was worshipped as a beneficent goddess who protected Egypt from pestilence and misfortune(Engels, 2001), though at the same time was greatly feared due to her destructive capabilities, as demonstrated in the Book of the Heavenly Cow. Bastet, formerly called Bast, was originally worshipped as a fierce lioness, though in later times was 'tamed' and worshipped as a gentler domestic cat. During the Late Period of ancient Egypt from 664 BC until the 4th century AD, the practice of mummifying small cats in Bastet's honour grew in popularity. Cat mummies were used as votive offerings to the goddess, mostly during festivals and by pilgrims (Ikram, 2015). Hundreds of thousands of cat mummies were excavated at cat cemeteries in Bubastis, Saqqara, Speos Artemidos and Gizeh (Conway, 1891; Herdman, 1890; Zivie & Lichtenberg, 2005). There was a lion-god at Baalbek. The pre-Islamic Arabs worshipped the lion-god Yaghuth. In modern Africa we find a lion-idol among the Balonda (Thomas 1911, p. 52). The lion was also sacred to Hebat, the mother goddess of the Hurrians. In Judaism the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה, a \\"Young Lion\\" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. Thus the Lion of Judah started to be reverenced in some others abrahamic cults, symbolising their prophets, as such as Jesus and Haile Selassie I, the ras Tafari. In Mesoamerica the jaguar was revered as a symbol of fertility and warriorship among the Aztec, Maya and Olmec, and had an important role in shamanism. =Tiger= The Indian goddess Durga riding a tiger. Guler school, early 18th century. Of great importance in Chinese myth and culture, the Tiger is one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals. Also in various Chinese art and martial art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the Chinese dragon- the two representing matter and spirit respectively. The White Tiger () is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations. It is sometimes called the White Tiger of the West (西方白虎), and it represents the west and the autumn season (Cooper 1992, pp. 226–27). The tiger replaces the lion as king of the beasts in cultures of eastern Asia, representing royalty, fearlessness and wrath. In Chinese children stories, it is often depicted that the stripes on a tiger's forehead represent the character 王 (\\"king\\") (Cooper 1992, pp. 226–27). Some cultures that celebrated tiger worship are still represented contemporarily. In the suburbs of Kunming, China, there is a tourist attraction where the tiger worship of the Yi people is displayed for visitors. This attraction called the Solar Calendar Square is complete with a growling tiger statue, measuring to be five meters high (Harrell & Yongxiang 2003, p. 380). In Chuxiong of China, a similar attraction exists. A tiger totem is presented for tourists; the totem portrays the Yi belief of the tiger setting the entire world in motion. A tiger dance of the Shuangbai County is also performed at such places explaining the history of the Yi and their worship of tigers (Harrell & Yongxiang 2003, p. 380). Along with these tourist attractions that display historical practices of the Yi, there is also additional evidence for tiger worship. Tigers were found depicted on small stones. These stones were pierced and worn as amulets, suggesting that the tiger had a certain power of protection for its wearer (Waterbury 1952, p. 76). The Queen Mother deity of the west, Hsi Wang Mu, sometimes possessed a tail of a tiger in her depictions and, like the tiger, was associated with the mountains (Waterbury 1952, p. 76). The tiger was also a deity for both the Tungus and the Black Pottery people (Waterbury 1952, p. 80). In Korean history and culture, a tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirit and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power. It appears in not only the Korean foundation mythology but also in folklore, as well as a favorite subject of Korean art such as painting and sculpture. For example, the 19th-century painting named “Sansindo” (산신도) depicts the guardian spirit of a mountain leaning against a tiger or riding on the back of the animal. The animal is also known to do the errands for the mountain's guardian spirit which is known to wish for peace and the well-being of the village. So, the tiger was ordered by the spiritual guardian of the mountain to give protection and wish for peace in the village. People drew such paintings and hung them in the shrine built in the mountain of the village where memorial rituals were performed regularly. In Buddhism, there is also a shrine that keeps the painting of the guardian spirit of the mountain. Called “Sansintaenghwa”, it is depiction of the guardian spirit of the mountain and a tiger.Standard Korean Language Dictionary In many parts of Vietnam, the tiger is a revered creature. In each village, there might be a tiger temple. This worshiping practice might have stem from the fear of tigers used to raid human settlements in the ancient time. Tigers are admired for their great strength, ferocity and grace. Tiger is also considered a guardian deity. Tiger statutes are usually seen at the entrance of temples and palaces, keeping evil spirits from entering those places. The tiger is associated with the Hindu deities Shiva and Durga. In Pokhara, Nepal the tiger festival is known as Bagh Jatra. Celebrants dance disguised as tigers and \\"hunted\\". The Warli tribe of Maharashtra, India worship Waghia the lord of tigers in the form of a shapeless stone (Thomas 1911, p. 52). In Vietnamese folk religion and Dongbei folk religion tiger-gods are also found. =Monkey= The three wise monkeys over the Tōshō-gū shrine in Nikkō, Japan In Hinduism the monkey deity, Hanuman, is a prominent figure. He is a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction. In orthodox villages monkeys are safe from harm (Thomas 1911, p. 52). Chinese religions and mythologies give monkeys and apes cultural significance as metaphors for people. Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys, for example, Sun Wukong or \\"Monkey King\\" is the main protagonist in Wu Cheng'en's picaresque novel Journey to the West. In traditional Chinese folk religion, monkeys are supernatural beings that could shape shift into either monkey-demons or were-monkeys, and legends about monkey-human interbreeding are common. In Daoism, monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed to have longevity like a xian \\"transcendent; immortal\\", and to be innately adept at circulating and absorbing qi \\"breath; life force\\" through the Daoist discipline of daoyin \\"guiding and pulling\\". Similar to Daoism, Chinese Buddhism paradoxically treats monkeys as both wise and foolish animals. On the one hand, the Jataka tales say that Gautama Buddha was a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation; and on the other hand, monkeys symbolized trickery and ignorance, represented by the Chan Buddhist \\"mind monkey\\" metaphor for the unsettled, restless nature of human mentality. Monkeys are said to be worshipped in Togo. At Porto Novo, in French West Africa, twins have tutelary spirits in the shape of small monkeys (Thomas 1911, p. 52). The hamadryas baboon was sacred to the Ancient Egyptians, and often appeared as a form of a deity. Egyptian deities depicted as baboons include Hapi (Son of Horus), Babi (mythology) and Thoth, although the latter is more often shown with the head of an ibis. A group of 6 or 8 baboons were also a common feature in scenes showing the sun god at dawn as he rose over the horizon, with the baboons raising their hands to him in praise. This is probably inspired by the observed behaviour of baboons, as they are known to 'chatter' at sunrise, as if greeting the sun. =Hippopotamus= In Ancient Egyptian religion, the hippopotamus had both positive and negative associations. On the one hand, the strong maternal instinct of female hippos led to the worship of several female hippo goddesses, usually as goddesses of pregnancy and motherhood, and protectors of women and children. The most famous of these hippopotamus goddesses is Taweret, who was a very common household deity among the common people of Egypt, and many amulets were made in her form. Others included Opet or Ipet, who was similar to Taweret but a little more stately, as well as Reret, who personified the constellation of Draco. On the other hand, the destructive capabilities of the hippopotamus towards useful boats led to it also being seen as a force of chaos, and so it also became associated with the god of disorder, Seth. Though normally depicted as a man with the head of the mysterious \\"sha\\" animal, in scenes of the battles between Seth and Horus, Seth can sometimes be shown in hippopotamus form, with Horus standing on a papyrus raft and spearing him with a harpoon. This victory of Horus over Seth was symbolically re-enacted during royal hunting expeditions, with the king taking the role of Horus, and a wild hippopotamus embodying Seth. The king's successful slaughter of the hippopotamus thus connected his martial prowess to that of Horus himself, demonstrating his right to be king. =Rodent= In some countries, e.g. India, a small number of temples are dedicated to the worship of wild mice. Whilst widely regarded as a creature to be avoided, for pestilential reasons in such temples the animals are actively encouraged. It is frequently associated with Ganesh. As a creature capable of survival, it is to be revered and respected. Birds =Crow/raven= The Raven is the chief deity of the Tlingit people of Alaska. All over that region it is the chief figure in a group of myths, fulfilling the office of a culture hero who brings the light, gives fire to mankind, and so on (Thomas 1911, p. 51). A raven story from the Puget Sound region describes the \\"Raven\\" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally bird land) that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with bird land that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live. In the creator role, and in the Raven's role as the totem and ancestor of one of the four northwest clan houses, the Raven is often addressed as Grandfather Raven. It is not clear whether this form of address is intended to refer to a creator Raven who is different from the trickster Raven, or if it is just a vain attempt to encourage the trickster spirit to act respectably. Together with the eagle-hawk the crow plays a great part in the mythology of southeastern Australia (Thomas 1911, p. 51). Ravens also play a part in some European mythologies, such as in the Celtic and Germanic Religions, where they were connected to Bran and the Morrigan in the former and Woden in the latter. =Hawk= North Borneo treated the hawk as a god, but it was technically the messenger of the people's Supreme God (Waterbury 1952, p. 62). There were rituals that involved the hawk when the natives wished to make decisions about certain events, such as journeys from home, major agricultural work, and war (Waterbury 1952, p. 62). In North Borneo we seem to see the evolution of a god in the three stages of the cult of the hawk among the Kenyahs, the Kayans and the sea Dyaks. The Kenyahs will not kill it, address to it thanks for assistance, and formally consult it before leaving home on an expedition. It seems, however, to be regarded as the messenger of the supreme god Balli Penyalong. The Kayans have a hawk-god, Laki Neho, but seem to regard the hawk as the servant of the chief god, Laki Tenangan. Singalang Burong, the hawk-god of the Dyaks, is completely anthropomorphized. He is god of omens and ruler of the omen birds, but the hawk is not his messenger. For he never leaves his house. Stories are, however, told of his attending feasts in human form and flying away in hawk form when all was over (Thomas 1911, p. 52). According to Florance Waterbury, hawk worship was universal (Waterbury 1952, p. 26). This particular bird was \\"a heavenly deity; its wings were the sky, the sun and moon were its eyes\\" (Waterbury 1952, p. 26). The hawk is commonly associated with the Egyptian god Horus. As a god of the sky, divine authority, war, victory and civilisation, Horus became the patron deity of the pharaohs. The souls of former pharaohs were said to be the followers of Horus and therefore, the hawk (Waterbury 1952, p. 26). Horus was originally depicted by the Egyptians as a full hawk, but after the Fourth and Fifth Dynasty depictions with a human body and a hawk head became more common. (Waterbury 1952, p. 27). Other Egyptian deities shown in the form of a hawk or hawk-headed man include Qebehsenuef, Sopdu, Ra (not always) and Sokar. Egypt was not the only location of hawk worshippers. There were several other cultures which held the hawk in high regard. The hawk was a deity on the island of Hawaii and symbolized swift justice (Waterbury 1952, p. 62). Along with the lone island from the Hawaiian archipelago, the Fiji islands also had some tribes who worshipped a hawk god (Waterbury 1952, p. 62). Furthermore, although animal worshipping is not a part of Sikh culture, a white falcon bird is mostly regarded in Sikhism as it was associated with the sixth guru and especially the tenth guru. The tenth guru would always carry a white falcon perched on his hand when going out to hunt. The tenth guru was known as the Master of White Hawk. Many people believe that the bird carried by Guru Gobind Singh was a hawk, however historians believe that the bird was a gyrfalcon or a saker falcon. =Frigatebird= On Easter Island until the 1860s there was a Tangata manu (Bird man) cult which has left us Paintings and Petroglyphs of Birdmen (half men half frigatebirds). The cult involved an annual race to collect the first sooty tern egg of the season from the islet of Moto Iti and take it to Orongo. The Frigate Bird Cult is thought to have originated in the Solomon Islands before immigrating to Easter Island where it became obsolete (Balfour 1917, p. 374). The Frigate-Bird was a representation of the god Make-make, the god of the seabird's egg on Easter Island (Balfour 1917, p. 374). =Ibis= In Ancient Egypt, the ibis was considered sacred as it was viewed as a manifestation of Thoth, a god of the moon and wisdom. In art, Thoth was usually depicted as a man with the head of an ibis, or more rarely as a baboon. Sacred ibises were kept and fed in temples in his honour, and mummified ibises were given to him as votive offerings. It is thought that the association of the ibis with Thoth may have originated from the curved shape of the bird's beak, which resembles a crescent moon. =Vulture= Another species of bird that was considered sacred in Ancient Egypt was the Egyptian vulture. At the city of Nekheb in Upper Egypt there was a temple dedicated to the goddess Nekhbet, who was depicted in art as a vulture, sometimes wearing a royal crown. Nekhbet was closely associated with the Egyptian royal family, and was considered a personal protector of the Egyptian king. She was often portrayed or invoked alongside a similar goddess named Wadjet, who was depicted as a cobra and had her main temple at Buto in Lower Egypt. Nekhbet and Wadjet thus often featured together on temple reliefs and stelae, representing in heraldic format the union between Upper and Lower Egypt. These two goddesses were considered so important that they could be referred to by the simple title \\"nebty\\" (\\"the two ladies\\") without any confusion as to their identity. Out of the five names that made up the Ancient Egyptian royal titulary, one of them, the \\"nebty name\\" was dedicated to the Two Ladies. This great honour of patronage over one of the king's names was shared only with such major gods as Ra and Horus. Egyptologists have theorised that the association of Nekhbet with the vulture may have originated from observations of a mother vulture's behaviour as it protects its chicks by \\"mantling\\" them with its wings, leading to its association with a protective and maternal goddess. In fact, the Egyptian word \\"mut\\" (\\"mother\\") is spelt in hieroglyphs with a picture of a vulture. Due to the vulture's maternal connotations and its early use in the iconography of Nekhbet, in later periods a vulture headdress came to be worn by a large number of Egyptian goddesses, as well as by human queens. The goddess Mut, worshipped at Thebes, Egypt alongside Amun and Khonsu, was written in hieroglyphs with a picture of a vulture, and would be indistguishable from the common nown \\"mother\\" except for the fact that in the goddess's name the vulture bears a royal flail. Goddesses who wore the vulture headdress in later periods included Mut, Hathor, Isis and Wadjet, although only Nekhbet appeared as a vulture in its entirety. Other non-mammals =Serpents= Belur, Karnataka, India Quetzalcoatl depicted as a snake devouring a man, from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis. The worship of the serpent is found in many parts of the Old World, and in the Americas (Thomas 1911, p. 52). In India snake worship refers to the high status of snakes in Hindu mythology. Over a large part of India there are carved representations of cobras (nagas) or stones as substitutes. To these human food and flowers are offered and lights are burned before the shrines. Among the Dravidians a cobra which is accidentally killed is burned like a human being; no one would kill one intentionally. The serpent-god's image is carried in an annual procession by a celibate priestess (Thomas 1911, p. 52). At one time there were many prevalent different renditions of the serpent cult located in India. In Northern India, a masculine version of the serpent named Nagaraja and known as the \\"king of the serpents\\" was worshipped. Instead of the \\"king of the serpents,\\" actual live snakes were worshipped in South India (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 1). The Manasa-cult in Bengal, India, however, was dedicated to the anthropomorphic serpent goddess, Manasa (Bhattacharyya 1965, p. 1). In Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey. but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshippers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the danh-gbi kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. Danh-gbi has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa. but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe (Thomas 1911, p. 52). In Ancient Egyptian religion, serpents had both positive and negative representations. On the one hand, the Egyptians worshipped a number of beneficent snake deities, including Wadjet, Renenutet, Meretseger, Nehebkau and Mehen. The uraeus was a fierce divine cobra that protected Egyptian kings and major deities. On the other hand, the serpent Apophis was a malevolent demon, who endeavoured to destroy the chief deity Ra. The Sumerians had a serpent god Ningizzida. =Other reptiles= As well as the serpent, the Nile crocodile was another important reptile in Ancient Egyptian religion. Several deities were depicted in crocodilian form, but the most famous and important of these was undoutedly the god Sobek. Sobek was a powerful and fearsome god, associated with violence and strength, and acted as a fierce protector against evil, and a punisher of wrongdoers. It is easy to see why he was associated with the crocoodile, which similarly is a very fearsome creature. Sobek also had a role relating to fertility, particularly the fertility brought to the land by the Nile flood, in whose waters crocodiles live. Sobek's main temple was located in the city of Crocodilopolis in the Fayyum area, and he also had the important Temple of Kom Ombo, which he shared with the god Horus. Sobek was also worshipped as a secondary deity in the temples of other gods, particularly those of his mother, the goddess Neith. Other Egyptian crocodile gods include Shemanefer, the lesser-known brother of Sobek, as well as Khenty- Khety and Wenty, about whom little is known. =Fish= A modern interpretation of Dagon as a \\"fish-god\\" According to the Jewish scholar Rashi, the Canaanite god Dagon was a fish god. This tradition may have originated here, with a misinterpretation, but recently uncovered reliefs suggest a fish- god with human head and hands was worshipped by people who wore fish-skins (Thomas 1911, p. 51). In Japan, there was a deity called Ebisu-gami who, according to Sakurada Katsunori, was widely revered by fishing communities and industries (Qtd. in Naumann, 1974, p. 1). Ebisu, in later traditions, normally appeared in the form of a fisherman holding a fishing pole and carrying a red tai (a perch), but would sometimes take the form of a whale, shark, human corpse, or rock (Naumann, 1974, p. 1). The general image of Ebisu, however, appears to be the whale or the shark, according to Sakurada (Qtd. in Naumann, 1974, p. 2). During Ebisu-gami festivals, there have been legends told of strange fish creatures which have arrived and been considered sacred. Examples of such fish creatures include familiar species of fish with multiple tails (Naumann, 1974, p. 2). Sometimes these fish were considered to be simply an offering to the deity. Other times, however, they were considered to be Ebisu himself, visiting on the festival day (Naumann, 1974, p. 2). Large marine megafaunas such as whales and whale sharks (also called as \\"Ebisu-shark\\") were often referred as Ebisu himself to bring mass of fish among them, and as guardians of fishermen. The Ancient Egyptian goddess Hatmehit from the city of Mendes was depicted as a fish, fish-woman hybrid, or a woman with a fish emblem or crown on her head. She was a goddess of life and protection. Fish, specifically Nile perch, were also held sacred to the Egyptian goddess Neith at her temple at Esna, though she was never depicted in their form. =Amphibians= The Ancient Egyptians worshipped a goddess in the form of a frog, named Heqet. She was a goddess of fertility, both the fertility of the land and the fertility of human reproduction. She was particularly associated with the final stages of the Nile flood, as well as the final stages of human birth. She was portrayed as a divine midwife, and was considered the consort of the god Khnum due to their similar roles. =Insects= The dung beetle, or scarab, was an important symbol in Ancient Egyptian religion. The behaviour of the beetle rolling its ball of dung along the ground was likened to the sun god rolling the sun across the sky. As a result, the beetle god Khepri received worship in the city of Heliopolis, the main sanctuary of the sun god Ra. In addition, the birth of young beetles from eggs laid in dung was an important symbol of rebirth, so amulets in the shape of scarabs were often included in tombs. Another insect venerated by the Egyptians was the scorpion. The goddess Serqet was depicted wearing a scorpion on her headdress, and was prayed to in order to heal venomous stings and bites. She was one of a group of four goddesses frequently invoked together to protect the body in funerary customs, the others being Isis, Nephthys and Neith. The four were often charged with protecting particular organs, assisting the Four Sons of Horus. Though less famous than the other three canopic goddesses, Serqet's worship is clearly very ancient, with images of scorpions appearing very early in Egyptian art, and even appearing in the names of several early kings. Though the association of Serqet with the scorpion has long been assumed her original function, recent scholarship has questioned whether the original animal in her headdress may have actually been a waterscorpion, and the association with the land scorpion came later. As well as Serqet, there were several more minor scorpion goddesses, including Hededet and Ta-Bitjet. A group of seven scorpions also appear as protectors of Isis in the myth of her raising of her son Horus. Oracular animals Animals are frequently used for the purposes of divination. Birds are especially common in this role, as by their faculty of flight they offer themselves to the interpretation as messengers between the celestial and human spheres. Augury was a highly developed practice of telling the future from the flight of birds in Classical Antiquity. The dove appears as an oracular animal in the story of Noah, and also in Thisbe in Boeotia there was a dove-oracle of Zeus. Animal imagery was also often employed in the oracular utterances in Ancient Greece (Lightfoot 2008, p. 237, fn. 105). Parrot astrology is a form of divination using green parakeets which originated in South India and is still practised in modern times (Naidu Ratnala 2005). In Chinese traditional religion, the tortoise is an oracular animal. A popular North American tradition is Groundhog Day, in which on February 2 each year a groundhog is used to predict whether there will be an early spring. Notable oracular animals of the modern period include Lady Wonder, Punxsutawney Phil, Maggie the Monkey, Lazdeika the Crab, Paul the Octopus, and Sonny Wool. Shamanism and animals Animals were an important aspect of the Shaman religion in Central Asia. Also known as \\"assistant spirits,\\" \\"guardian spirits,\\" and \\"helping spirits,\\" animal spirits are an integral part of a shaman's work. The more animal spirits a shaman had under his control, the more powerful the shaman (Waida, 1983, p. 228-229). When a shaman set out to journey spiritually to the outer world, animals were a key component, assisting him in his work. There were three primary reasons for a shaman to take such a journey: to find a lost soul, to bring an animal spirit to the high gods, or to lead a soul to its new resting place in the underworld. All of these were extremely important to followers of shamanism and animals were extremely important in facilitating the shaman's efforts (Waida, 1983, p. 231). An example of animal spirits in Shamanism comes from the Yenisei Ostiaks culture. During a healing procedure, a shaman invokes a number of animal spirits to help him. The spirits arrive and enter his body. The shaman is not possessed by these spirits; he is free to expel them at any time (Waida, 1983, p. 223). His body begins to leap all over the place, symbolizing that his soul is rising, leaving the earth and going up to the sky. It is a bird spirit that is lifting him through the atmosphere and he cries for it to take him higher so he can see further. According to Adolf Friedrich, at this point the shaman's essence has, in fact, transformed into the bird spirit that crossed the threshold into his body (Waida, 1983, p. 223). He finally spots what he is looking for, the soul of his ill patient. Still assisting him, the animal spirits carry the shaman to the patient's soul. The shaman retrieves it and returns the soul to its rightful place, healing the patient. Without the presence of animal spirits, the shaman could not have accomplished such a feat (Waida, 1983, p. 231). In the Inner Eurasian religion, the transformation of a shaman's essence into an animal spirit is referred to as \\"becoming animal\\" (Baldick 2000, p. 167). The importance of animals in this shamanic religion is shown by the capabilities that animals grant to human beings. Without the assistance of animals, humans from Inner Eurasia were not capable of reaching the sky, traveling rapidly throughout the earth, or going beneath the earth's outer crust, all of which were important activities to the culture (Baldick 2000, p. 167). Heaven was not attainable for a person without the assistance of an eagle. Because of the eagle, an animal, the Inner Eurasians believed that they were capable of achieving their after-life and living in the home of their ancestors and Supreme God after their departure from the earth (Baldick 2000, p. 167). Heaven was represented by the people in assemblies of animals, usually grouped in sevens or nines (Baldick 2000, p. 167). When participating in hunting or warfare, Inner Eurasians also took on animal qualities because they believed it would increase their success (Baldick 2000, p. 167). Animals were a central part of this religion (Baldick 2000, p. 167). Religion and animals =Buddhism= One of the most important sanctions of the Buddhist faith is the concept of ahimsa, or refraining from the destruction of life (Regenstein 1991, p. 234). According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. Thus, the world is not specifically meant for human use and should be shared equally amongst all creatures (Epstein 1990). Buddhists recognize that all animals are sentient and are capable of feeling pain, grief, fear, happiness, and hunger (Regenstein 1991, pp. 234–235). The Dalai Lama once said \\"Even ants and other insects will run away from danger... They have intelligence and want to live too. Why should we harm them?\\" (Qtd. in Regenstein 1991, p. 235). Not believing in inflicting harm on any living, sentient being, some Buddhists also follow a vegetarian diet to avoid causing pain to animals (Regenstein 1991, p. 238). Avoiding the destruction of life can affect aspects beyond a Buddhist's diet, such as travel plans. In order to avoid crushing any living thing, be it plant, insect, or animal, some Buddhist monks do not travel during rainy seasons (Regenstein 1991, p. 236). Originally, shortly after Buddhism was first founded, monks traveled during all seasons, but public opinion changed this. The people protested that so much life was crushed and destroyed when monks traveled during the wet season. As a result, monks were required to seek shelter during this season and abstain from journeys (Chapple 1993, p. 22). Living creatures, including humans, culminate to form one large, united life-force in the Buddhist religion. Buddhists, therefore, believe that to harm another living creature is to, in fact, harm yourself as all life-forms are interrelated (Regenstein 1991, p. 237). There are many tales that depict humans sacrificing their lives so that an animal may live. A jataka, or previous incarnation story, tells how the Buddha, (upon hearing the distraught cries of a lioness struggling to feed her hungry cubs), leapt from a cliff and smashed his body to death as an offering, so that she could feed his flesh to them (Chapple 1993). =Hinduism= Hinduism is one of the six primary religions of India (Regenstein 1991, p. 221). Hinduism has evolved over several centuries from Vedic times when there was no restriction on animal worship and also animal consumption for food, to later Buddhist and Jain-influenced eras that led to a wider concept adoption of non-violence or ahimsa and respect for animals, as a major constituent in Dharmic belief systems (Regenstein 1991, p. 223). Humans and animals are believed to be one family and therefore, humans should treat all living creatures with respect and kindness. It is also believed that human beings themselves re-incarnate as animals based on their deeds or karma. Pets are often treated as if they are truly members of the family (Regenstein 1991, p. 223-224). There are some exceptions to ahimsa in Hinduism - mainly dealing with religious rituals to please gods on special occasions and for daily sustenance. While Hindu belief proscribes the slaughter for human pleasure or lavishness , animal sacrifice has been an accepted ritual in some parts of India (Regenstein 1991, p. 225).An example of such lavishness would be hunting for pleasure, a fur coat made from animal skin, etc. An explanation for this supposed paradox is that a sacrificial animal is not really considered to be an animal, but a symbol. Thus, when the animal is sacrificed, they are sacrificing the symbol and not the animal (Regenstein 1991, p. 226). =Jainism= Mahavira, the 24th Teerthankar of Jainism, believed that the only way to be released from the cycle of life (birth, death, and then rebirth), one must follow ahimsa and not harm any living creature (Regenstein 1991, p. 229). Some Jains will carry a broom with them and sweep their path as they walk to avoid stepping on any living creature. Jains will also wear masks over their mouths to prevent swallowing insects and inspect their fruit for worms. The fruit inspection is not, however, because of their aversion of worms, but for the protection of the worms themselves (Regenstein 1991, p. 229-230). Jains are also only allowed to eat during daylight hours, when their vision is not restricted, so that they avoid eating insects or other small creatures that could possibly be in their food (Regenstein 1991, p. 230). Jainism includes a lay form which is somewhat less restrictive (Regenstein 1991, p. 231). Basically lay Jains must distinguish between what forms of violence are necessary and unnecessary, but do not have to abstain entirely (Vallely 2002, p. 5). This results in avoiding all forms of hunting, tilling the soil (tilling involved disturbing creatures embedded in the earth), and brewing (brewing involved using living organisms such as yeasts) (Regenstein 1991, p. 231). Food will never be prepared especially for them. They beg for food from others believing that because the food was prepared for someone else, they are not the cause of violence towards living creatures (Vallely 2002, p. 5). Lay Jains, who have the financial capacity, will visit animal markets and buy/rescue animals destined for slaughter for the good that it does. (Regenstein 1991, p. 232).

The artist collective also organizes workshops and participates in educational activities on a community level during these tours. Each touring collection consists of about 300 items. In 2005, the collective donated its 2000-2005 collections to Artexte Information Centre. This not-for-profit arts organization maintains the collections and provides on-site access to them. Artexte also provides further access to these collections with an electronic guide to individual works, organized by touring year: Projet MOBILIVRE-BOOKMOBILE Project Guide External links * Category:Canadian artist groups and collectives ","title":"Mobilivre"},{"id":"1128104","text":"Lise Bacon, (born August 25, 1934) is a Canadian Liberal politician.

This particular model is based on a Saf-T-Liner HDX chassis. A \\"book mobile\\" serving children in Blount County, Tennessee, United States, in 1943 A bookmobile or mobile library is a vehicle designed for use as a library. They have been known by many names throughout history, including traveling library, library wagon, book wagon, book truck, library-on-wheels, and book auto service. Bookmobiles expand the reach of traditional libraries by transporting books to potential readers, providing library services to people in otherwise underserved locations (such as remote areas) and/or circumstances (such as residents of retirement homes). Bookmobile services and materials (such as Internet access, large print books, and audiobooks), may be customized for the locations and populations served. Bookmobiles have been based on various means of conveyance, including bicycles, carts, motor vehicles, trains, watercraft, and wagons, as well as camels, donkeys, elephants, horses, and mules. History =19th century= The Perambulating Library of 1859 in Warrington, England In the United States of America, The American School Library (1839) was a traveling frontier library published by Harper & Brothers. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History has the only complete original set of this series complete with its wooden carrying case. The British Workman reported in 1857 about a perambulating library operating in a circle of eight villages, in Cumbria. A Victorian merchant and philanthropist, George Moore, had created the project to \\"diffuse good literature among the rural population\\". The Warrington Perambulating Library, set up in 1858, was another early British mobile library. This horse-drawn van was operated by the Warrington Mechanics' Institute, which aimed to increase the lending of its books to enthusiastic local patrons. =20th century= 1951 video of a \\"bibliobus\\" serving small villages in the Netherlands One of the earliest mobile libraries in the United States was a mule-drawn wagon carrying wooden boxes of books. It was created in 1904 by the People's Free Library of Chester County, South Carolina, and served the rural areas there. Another early mobile library service was developed by Mary Lemist Titcomb (1857–1932). As a librarian in Washington County, Maryland, Titcomb was concerned that the library was not reaching all the people it could. The annual report for 1902 listed 23 \\"branches\\", each being a collection of 50 books in a case that was placed in a store or post office throughout the county. Realizing that even this did not reach the most rural residents, the Washington County Free Library began a \\"book wagon\\" in 1905, taking the library materials directly to people's homes in remote parts of the county. With the rise of motorized transport in America, a pioneering librarian in 1920 named Sarah Byrd Askew began driving her specially outfitted Model T to provide library books to rural areas in New Jersey. The automobile remained rare, however, and in Minneapolis, the Hennepin County Public Library operated a horse-drawn book wagon starting in 1922. Following the Great Depression in the United States, a WPA effort from 1935 to 1943 called the Pack Horse Library Project covered the remote coves and mountainsides of Kentucky and nearby Appalachia, bringing books and similar supplies on foot and on hoof to those who could not make the trip to a library on their own. Sometimes these \\"packhorse librarians\\" relied on a centralized contact to help them distribute the materials. At Fairfax County, Virginia, county-wide bookmobile service was begun in 1940, in a truck loaned by the Works Progress Administration (\\"WPA\\"). The WPA support of the bookmobile ended in 1942, but the service continued.Barbuschak, Christopher, Virginia Room Archivist/Librarian, City of Fairfax Regional Library, Statement by E-Mail, sent Thursday, 16 August 2018, 10:56:52 pm:[...]\\"in a history book entitled Fairfax County VA A History. On page 618, we found this sentence: \\"Herndon's Fortnightly Club established a library in 1889, and for many years this facility and the county's bookmobiles were the only library services available in the northwestern part of the county.\\" Fairfax County did not have bookmobiles until 1940. \\" [...] The \\"Library in Action\\" was a late-1960s bookmobile program in the Bronx, NY, run by interracial staff that brought books to teenagers of color in under-served neighborhoods. Bookmobiles reached the height of their popularity in the mid-twentieth century.Berger, M. (1977). Reading, Roadsters, and Rural America. The Journal of Library History (1974–1987), 12(1), 42–49. =21st century= 2016 video of a \\"bibliobús\\" serving small towns in Catalonia Bookmobiles are still in use in the 21st century, operated by libraries, schools, activists, and other organizations. Although some feel that the bookmobile is an outmoded service, citing reasons like high costs, advanced technology, impracticality, and ineffectiveness, others cite the ability of the bookmobile to be more cost-efficient than building more branch libraries would be and its high use among its patrons as support for its continuation. To meet the growing demand for \\"greener\\" bookmobiles that deliver outreach services to their patrons, some bookmobile manufacturers have introduced significant advances to reduce their carbon footprint, such as solar/battery solutions in lieu of traditional generators, and all-electric and hybrid-electric chassis. Bookmobiles have also taken on an updated form in the form of m libraries, also known as mobile libraries in which patrons are delivered content electronically. The Internet Archive runs its own bookmobile to print out-of-copyright books on demand. The project has spun off similar efforts elsewhere in the developing world. The Free Black Women's Library is a mobile library in Brooklyn. Founded by Ola Ronke Akinmowo in 2015, this bookmobile features books written by black women. Titles are available in exchange for other titles written by black female authors.

The service started with three camels in October 1996 and had 12 in 2006, delivering more than 7,000 books —in English, Somali, and Swahili.

The figure is attested in the Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies as they were extended in the age of Alfred, where Beowa is inserted as the son of Scyld and the grandson of Sceafa, in lineages carried back to Adam.Kathleen Herbert, Looking for the Lost Gods of England, 1994:15, noted by John Grigsby, Beowulf & Grendel2005:64. Connections have been proposed between the figure of Beowa and the hero Beowulf of the poem of the same name and English folk song figure John Barleycorn. Etymology Beow is an Old English word for barley. In the Anglo-Saxon genealogies, Beowa is the son or grandson of Sceafa, the Old English word for sheaf. The noun beow has an Old Norse parallel in Bygg, the word for \\"grain.\\" Related comparisons have been made between the figure of Beow and Byggvir, attested in the Prose Edda as a servant of the god Freyr.Alexander (2002:28). Theories Some scholars posit a connection between the mythical figure of Beowa and the legendary Beowulf. As the two characters possess many of the same attributes, it has been suggested that \\"a god Beowa, whose existence in myth is certain, became confused or blended with Beowulf.\\"Lawrence (1909:249). Another possibility is that the (first) scribe responsible for the Beowulf text conflated two names. At the beginning of the poem, there is a character called Beowulf, the son of Scyld Scefing, but this character is not the Beowulf who is the protagonist of the poem. Rather than accepting that there are two different characters with this unusual name, many modern editions of the poem replace this name with \\"Beow\\".\\"Ðā wæs on burgum Bēowulf Scyldinga\\", translated \\"Then it fell to Beow to keep the forts\\". (Heaney, Beowulf: a new verse translation, 2000:4/5). J. R. R. Tolkien, one of the proponents of reading \\"Beow\\" here, suggested that the use of \\"Beowulf\\" as Scyld Schefing's son was a scribal error for the original \\"Beow\\", noting that the two scribes who produced the Beowulf manuscript were \\"both extremely ignorant of and careless with proper names\\", and called the occurrence of \\"Beowulf\\" in this place in the manuscript \\"one of the oddest facts in Old English literature\\" and \\"one of the reddest and highest red herrings that were ever dragged across a literary trail\\". Kathleen Herbert draws a link between Beowa and the figure of John Barleycorn of traditional English folksong. Herbert says that Beowa and Barleycorn are one and the same, noting that the folksong details the suffering, death, and resurrection of Barleycorn, yet also celebrates the \\"reviving effects of drinking his blood.\\"Herbert (2007:16).

The screenplay is based on the first third of the 1998 novel A Widow for One Year by John Irving. Plot The film is set in an exclusive beach community on Long Island, where children's book author and artist Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) lives with his wife Marion (Kim Basinger) and their young daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning), who usually is supervised by her nanny Alice. Their home is filled with photographs of the couple's teenaged sons, who were killed in an automobile accident; the tragedy left Marion deeply depressed and her marriage in a shambles. The one shared experience that holds the family together is a ritualistic daily viewing of a home gallery of family photographs of the deceased sons. Ted and Marion temporarily separate, each alternately living in the house and in a rented apartment in town. Ted hires Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster) to work as his summer assistant and driver, since his own license was suspended for drunk driving. An aspiring writer, Eddie admires Ted, but he soon discovers the older man is a self- absorbed womanizer with an erratic work schedule that leaves the young assistant to fill his time as best he can. Eddie and Marion soon engage in a sexual relationship, which seems not to bother Ted, who is enjoying trysts of his own with local resident Evelyn Vaughn (Mimi Rogers) during sketching sessions at which she serves as his model. When Ruth walks into the room while Eddie and her mother are making love, Ted becomes upset with his wife and advises Eddie he may have to testify about the incident if Ted decides to fight for full custody of the child. Marion eventually leaves Ted and their daughter, taking with her all the photographs and negatives of her dead sons, save one that is being reframed after it was broken, injuring Ruth. Eddie takes the initiative to retrieve the one remaining reframed picture so that Ruth can have at least one partial image of her brothers. Ted reveals to Eddie the story of the car accident that caused his sons' deaths. Ted suggests his and Marion's drunkenness and Ted's failure to remove snow from the rear tail light and turn signal lights likely contributed to their sons' deaths. Eddie learns more about what may have contributed to Marion's intense despair, mental states, and choice to abandon her remaining child. At the end of the film, Ted does not fully understand why Marion left, and he questions, \\"What kind of mother leaves her daughter?\\" At the end of the story, Ted stops while playing alone in his squash court, looks into the camera with resignation, then lifts the door in the floor and descends. Cast * Jeff Bridges as Ted Cole * Kim Basinger as Marion Cole * Jon Foster as Eddie O'Hare * Bijou Phillips as Alice * Elle Fanning as Ruth Cole * Mimi Rogers as Evelyn Vaughn * Donna Murphy as Frame Shop Owner * John Rothman as Minty O'Hare * Harvey Loomis as Dr. Loomis Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 144 reviews, and an average rating of 6.46/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though uneven in tone, this is one of the better adaptations of John Irving's novels, with Jeff Bridges giving one of his best performances.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film \\"surely the best movie yet made from Mr. Irving's fiction\\" and added, \\"It may even belong in the rarefied company of movies that are better than the books on which they are based . . . If you examine the story closely, you can find soft spots of implausibility and cliché. But the shakiness of some of the film's central ideas . . . matters far less than it might . . . The Door in the Floor nimbly shifts between melodrama and comedy, with a delightful and perfectly executed excursion into high farce near the end, and it seems perpetually to be discovering new possibilities for its characters . . . Mr. Foster and Ms. Basinger are both very good, but the film is dominated by Mr. Bridges' performance . . . [He] not only dominates the movie, he animates it. He is heroically life-size.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film 3½ out of four stars, calling it \\"extraordinary in every way, from the pitch-perfect performances to the delicate handling of explosive subject matter.\\" He added, \\"It's bumpy going at times. But Williams is a talent to watch and a wonder with the actors. Basinger's haunted beauty burns in the memory – this is her finest work. And Bridges, one of the best actors on the planet, blends the contradictions of Ted . . . into an indelible portrait. You can't shut the door on this spellbinder. It gets into your head.\\" James Christopher of The Times observed, \\"What's strange about the film is that it's pitched like a play. There are no obvious ructions yet it bristles with small riddles and puzzling inconsistencies . . . The chemistry is absurd and tragic. Bridges is the obvious pull; Basinger is a one-note trauma. The story is curiously spellbinding, and fabulously ambivalent about their sins.\\" Awards and nominations Jeff Bridges was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Male but lost to Paul Giamatti for Sideways. Tod Williams was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay but lost to Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor for Sideways, and was nominated for the Golden Shell at the San Sebastian Film Festival but lost to Bahman Ghobadi for Turtles Can Fly. The film received the National Board of Review Award for Excellence In Filmmaking.

He served as Minister of Agriculture in the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, and in 1965 was a signatory to Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence. He maintained a lifelong interest in politics. Despite having lived in southern Africa for fifty-five years, farming several properties in the region, he remained a lover of all things Scottish. Early life Angus, Marquess of Graham, aged twenty-one (later The 7th Duke of Montrose) As Marquess of Graham, the Duke was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War. He was in HMS Kandahar as part of Lord Louis Mountbatten's flotilla in the North Sea and later served in the Mediterranean and at Aden. Life The Marquess of Graham completed three years at Oxford and graduated Bachelor of Arts. Lord Graham (as he then was) first went to Southern Rhodesia in 1930, taking up a position with A.E. & I., the South African subsidiary of ICI. While he was on holiday in England in 1939, war with Germany was declared and he signed up with the Admiral Commanding Reserves and was appointed Lieutenant in the RNVR, joining HMS Kandahar. In 1954 he inherited his father's titles and became the 7th Duke of Montrose. He enjoyed hunting trips in Kenya, where he met his second wife, Susan Semple. The family grew up on Derry Farm at Nyabira outside Salisbury, where the crops included maize and tobacco. A pedigree Brahman cattle stud was established after importing bloodstock from Texas. Although, in an article published in Illustrated Life Rhodesia in the mid-1970s, Montrose indicated that he saw his family remaining in Rhodesia for future generations, he and his family moved to South Africa in 1979 and then to Scotland, where he spent his final days.

It is related to several other tools used for the same purpose, including chromosome walking. Chromosome jumping is used to bypass regions difficult to clone, such as those containing repetitive DNA, that cannot be easily mapped by chromosome walking, and is useful in moving along a chromosome rapidly in search of a particular gene. Chromosome jumping allows more rapid movement through the genome compared to other techniques, such as chromosome walking, and can be used to generate genomic markers with known chromosomal locations. Chromosome jumping enables two ends of a DNA sequence to be cloned without the middle section. Genomic DNA may be partially digested using restriction endonucleases and with the aid of DNA ligase, the fragments are circularized. From a known sequence, a primer is designed to sequence across the circularised junction. This primer is used to jump 100 kb-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularisation. Thus, sequences not reachable by chromosome walking can be sequenced. Chromosome walking can be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for gene-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome.

It was used alongside the panokseon warships in the fight against invading Japanese naval ships. The ship's name derives from its protective shell-like covering.Bryan, Eric, \\"The Turtle Ship\\", Military History Monthly, 34, July 2013, p. 27. This design is often recognized as the first armored ship in the world. The first references to older, first- generation turtle ships, known as gwiseon (귀선; 龜船, ), come from 1413 and 1415 records in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, which mention a mock battle between a gwiseon and a Japanese warship. However, these early turtle ships soon fell out of use as Korea's naval preparedness decreased during a long period of relative peace., Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth- Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , p.192 Turtle ships participated in the war against Japanese naval forces supporting Toyotomi Hideyoshi's attempts to conquer Korea from 1592 to 1598. Korean Admiral Yi Sun-Shin, who won all battles against Japanese Navy, is credited with designing the improved turtle ship. His turtle ships were equipped with at least five different types of cannons and greatly contributed to winning 16 times from 16 battles against the Japanese Navy until they were destroyed in the Battle of Chilcheollyang since their first appearance in the Battle of Sacheon (1592). Their most distinguishable feature was a dragon-shaped head at the bow (front) that could launch cannon fire or flames from the mouth. Each was also equipped with a fully covered deck to protect against arrow fire, musket-shots, and incendiary weapons. The deck was covered with iron spikes to discourage enemy men from attempting to board the ship. Construction According to the Nanjung Ilgi, Yi's wartime diary, Yi decided to resurrect the turtle ship in 1591 from pre- existing designs (see picture, illustrated nearly 200 years later) after discussing the matter with his subordinates. Once concluding that a Japanese invasion was possible, if not imminent, Yi and his subordinate officers, among whom Na Dae-yong (羅大用) is named as the chief constructor,Leesunsin.prkorea.com: Admiral Yi Sun-sin's People designed and built the first modern turtle ship. Yi's diary, along with the book entitled Hangnok written by his nephew Yi Beon, described numerous important details about the structures, construction progress, and the use of turtle ships in battle, as well as the testing of weaponry used in the ships. The mounted weapons, Korean cannons with ranges from about 300 to 500 metres, were tested on March 12, 1592. Yi completed his first turtle ship and launched it on March 27, 1592, one day before the Siege of Busanjin and the Battle of Dadaejin. It is unknown precisely how many of Admiral Yi’s Turtle Ships were constructed.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 53 The cost of one of these armored warships would have been high, especially if the deck was lined with hexagonal iron plates as some sources suggest.Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , p.195–197 Structure Many different versions of the turtle ships served during the war, but in general they were about long, and strongly resembled the panokseon's bottom structure. The turtle ship was technically a hull that was placed on top of a panokseon with a large anchor held in the front of the ship and other minor modifications. On the bow of the vessel was mounted a dragon head which emitted sulfur smoke to effectively hide its movement from the enemy in short distance combat. The dragon head, which is considered the most distinguishing feature of the vessel, was large enough for a cannon to fit inside. The dragon head served as a form of psychological warfare, with the aim of striking fear to the enemy. Early versions of the turtle ship would burn poisonous materials in the dragon's head to release a poisonous smoke. In the front of the ship was a large anchor. Below the anchor was a wooden crest that was shaped like a face, and these were used to ram into enemy ships. Similar to the standard panokseon, the turtle ship had two masts and two sails. Oars were also used for maneuvering and increased speed. Another advantage the turtle ship had was that it could turn on its own radius. The turtle ship had 10 oars and 11 cannon portholes on each side. Usually, there was one cannon porthole in the dragon head's mouth. There were two more cannon portholes on the front and back of the turtle ship. The heavy cannons enabled the turtle ships to unleash a mass volley of cannonballs (some would use special wooden bolts several feet in length, with specially engineered iron fins). Its crew complement usually comprised about 50 to 60 fighting marines and 70 oarsmen, as well as the captain. Sources indicate that sharp iron spikes protruded from hexagonal plates covering the top of the turtle ship. An advantage of the closed deck was that it protected the Korean sailors and marines from small arms and incendiary fire. The spikes discouraged Japanese from engaging in their primary method of naval combat at the time, grappling an enemy ship with hooks and then boarding it to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Korean written descriptions all point to a maneuverable ship, capable of sudden bursts of speed. Like the panokseon, the turtle ship featured a U-shaped hull which gave it the advantage of a more stable cannon-firing platform, and this ability to turn within its own radius was useful to attack enemies by spinning at the same spot using cannons mounted on the four sides of the turtle ship as cannons in those days took considerable time after firing and before cooling and reloading. The main disadvantage of a U-shaped bottom versus a V-shaped bottom was a somewhat slower cruising speed. Later Turtle Ships held some structural changes as opposed to earlier versions.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 52 For example, later iterations of the Turtle Ship had a higher bulwark height.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 52 This alteration in the design was made so that more bulwark slots could be added.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 52 In turn, these slots could be used for additional weaponry or ventilation for the vessel’s occupants.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 52 Early illustrations also show initial versions of the ship consisting of overlapping planks on the deck structure, while later depictions show the deck of the vessel covered with flush, hexagonal plates made of wood or iron.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 52 Nonetheless, in both earlier and later versions, the Turtle Ship was designed to be surprisingly fast, as it was both oar and sail-powered.Holz, Heidi. \\"Complementary Keys to Naval Victory.\\" Naval History, August 2009. pp. 52 Decking Early 15th century Korean turtle ship in an illustration dating to 1795 16th century Korean turtle ship in a depiction dating to 1795 based on a contemporary, late 18th century model.Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War.

Sources that question claims of iron plating also exist. While it is clear from the available sources that the roof of the ship was covered with iron spikes to prevent boarding,Turnbull, Stephen: Samurai Invasion. Japan’s Korean War 1592-98 (London, 2002), Cassell & Co , p.244Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , p.193 there is split opinion among historians on whether the turtle ship was iron clad.Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , pp.192–199Roh, Young-koo: \\"Yi Sun-sin, an Admiral Who Became a Myth\\", The Review of Korean Studies, Vol. 7, No. 3 (2004), p.13 One Japanese chronicle mentions a clash in August 1592 which involved three Korean turtle ships \\"covered in iron\\". However, according to Samuel Hawley, this phrase does not necessarily indicate that the vessels were covered with iron plates; it could refer to the iron spikes protruding from their roofs, a fitting described for the first time three weeks earlier in Yi Sun-sin's diary.Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , p.602 Stephen Turnbull, however, points out the fact that in February 1593 the Japanese government ordered the military to use iron plate in building ships, possibly in response to the Korean attacks. There are no contemporary Korean sources from Yi Sun-sin's time which refer to the turtle ship as ironclad.Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth- Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , p.195–197 Admiral Yi Sun-sin himself makes no mention of such a design in his comprehensive war diary. His nephew Yi Beon, who also witnessed the war and left a historical account of the events, does not mention iron cladding either. The annals of King Seonjo, a many thousand pages long compilation of all kinds of official documents of the period, are also silent on the subject. Prime Minister Ryu Seong-ryong even explicitly described the turtle ship as \\"covered by wooden planks on top\\". There is also the question of motivation for adding metal plating. Since the Japanese did not commonly employ cannons on their ships until decades later, let alone use plunging cannon fire, any plating would have logically been designed as an anti-incendiary measure, not to withstand cannonballs. The Japanese did commonly use fire arrows and a form of exploding grenades called in naval battles during this period. As it was, Yi Sun-Shin, who was largely cut off from government supplies throughout his campaigns, found the small amount of fifty pounds of iron worth mentioning in his war diary. Therefore, Hawley believes that it is unlikely that Admiral Yi would have passed in silence over the estimated six tons (twelve thousand pounds) of iron necessary for even a single outfit. Such a large amount of iron was equivalent to one ship's entire ordnance, and would have probably been considered more useful for casting additional cannons, particularly since the Koreans were well aware that Japanese warships were practically devoid of naval guns.Swope, Kenneth M. Swope: \\"Crouching Tigers, Secret Weapons: Military Technology Employed During the Sino-Japanese-Korean War, 1592–1598\\", The Journal of Military History, Vol. 69 (Jan. 2005), pp. 11–42 (32) Confronted with a Japanese enemy who relied on small arms fire and boarding tactics, and faced by the logistical and financial difficulties involved in acquiring such a large amount of iron, any iron cladding of the Korean vessels has been deemed by Hawley inherently superfluous: Evidence for an iron plated turtle ship is found, according to Stephen Turnbull, in a 1795 drawing of the turtle ship where the shell is shown as being covered by a distinct hexagonal pattern, implying that there is something covering the wood shell. Hawley, however, questions the historical accuracy of this drawing since it departs in important ways from the 16th century ships such as its lack of the reported iron spikes (see image) and the different shape and number of the dragon heads displayed at the bow.Hawley 2005, pp. 198-199 The Korean designation \\"turtle ship\\" is already attested in the year 1413, for an early type of the vessel which by all accounts did not feature any kind of armour.Hawley 2005, 192 Hawley puts forth the hypothesis that the idea of ironclad turtle ships has its origins in the writings of late 19th-century Westerners returning from Korea.Hawley, Samuel: The Imjin War. Japan's Sixteenth-Century Invasion of Korea and Attempt to Conquer China, The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch, Seoul 2005, , p.197f. The progression from casual comparison to a statement of fact that the turtle ships anticipated the modern ironclad by centuries can be roughly charted in retrospect, starting no earlier than ca. 1880. Coming in touch with local tales of ancient armoured ships in a period which saw the rise of Western-type ironclad warship to global prominence, these authors may have naturally conjured up the image of metal armour, instead of a more traditional heavy timber shell. For instance, when Korea was threatened by the French Navy, the government ordered an ironclad ship be built \\"like the turtle ship\\". However, despite all efforts the design failed to float. Turnbull believes that the 19th century experience should not rule out a \\"limited amount of armor plating in 1592\\". Weapons =Dragon's head= Dragon Head on the Turtle Ship in the War Memorial of Korea museum The dragon's head was placed on the top of the ship at the bow. Several different versions of the dragon head were used on the turtle ships. The dragon head was first placed as an early form of psychological warfare to scare Japanese soldiers. One version carried a projector that could release a dense toxic smoke that was generated to obscure vision and interfere with the Japanese ability to maneuver and coordinate properly. Yi's own diary explains that a cannon could be fitted in the mouth of the dragon to be fired at enemy ships.Google Book Search. This type of cannon was usually a hwangja-chongtong. =Spikes= Deck Spikes on the Turtle Ship in the War Memorial of Korea museum Metal spikes were used to cover the top of the turtle ship to deter boarding tactics used by the Japanese. According to historical records, the spikes were covered with empty rice sacks or rice mats to lure the Japanese into trying to board, since the boarding would appear safe. However, modern authors have found this to be unlikely since such an arrangement would have invited enemy fire arrows.Hae-Ill Bak: “A Short Note on the Iron-clad Turtle Boats of Admiral Yi Sun-sin,\\" Korea Journal 17:1 (January 1977): 34-39 (36f.) =Cannon= Three large chongtong at the Jinju Fortress museum.

There was also an arquebus known as Seungja (Victory). The Seungja ranged while the Hwangja was the lightest but with a range of . According to Hae-Ill Bak, one Japanese record of the Battle of Angolpo records the experience of two Japanese commanders on July 9, 1592 in their battle against turtle ships: \\"their (turtle ships') attack continued until about 6 o'clock in the afternoon by firing large fire-arrows through repeated alternate approaches, even as close as 18-30 feet. As a result, almost every part of our ships - the turret, the passages and the side shielding - were totally destroyed...\\" Tactical use Yi resurrected the turtle ship as a close-assault vessel, intended to ram enemy ships and sink them, similar to their use in past centuries. Despite smaller numbers, disabling or sinking enemy's lead command ship could severely damage command structure and morale of the enemy fleet. After ramming, the turtle ship would unleash a broadside volley of cannonballs. Because of this tactic, the Japanese called the turtle ships because they would blast and ram into enemy ships. This kind of attack was used during the Battle of Dangpo and Battle of Sacheon (1592). The turtle ship's main use of the plating was as an anti- boarding device, due to the top plating of the turtle ship and its protruded spikes. Grappling hooks could not gain direct hold on the plating, and jumping on top of the turtle ship often meant being impaled. The heavy timber plating deflected arrows and arquebus rounds. Later, the turtle ship was used for other purposes such as spearheading attacks or ambushing Japanese ships in tight areas such as in the Battle of Noryang. Despite popular depiction, the turtle ship was not an extremely slow ship. The turtle ship had oar propulsion as well as sails, and could turn on its axis like the panokseon. Admiral Yi constructed the turtle ship to be fast and agile for the purpose of ramming. Turtle Ships played a major role in the Korean victory over the Japanese navy in the Battle of Angolpo (also sometimes called the Battle of the Yellow Sea).Ridler, Jason. \\"Battle of the Yellow Sea.\\" Salem Press Encyclopedia, 2019, pp. 1.

It was at the south end of the Liverpool dock system, on the River Mersey. To the north it was connected to Harrington Dock. The dock was named after the Herculaneum Pottery Company that had previously occupied the site. History From 1767, a tidal basin in the area that would become the dock was used for unloading copper for a smelting works. Between 1794 and 1841 it was the site of a pottery. In 1864, a new dock designed by George Fosbery Lyster was blasted from the foreshore, providing two graving docks. This dock opened in 1866. Ten years later, a third graving dock was added. Beginning in 1873, the dock handled petroleum. In 1878, specialist casemates were built to store this and other volatile cargo within the sandstone cliffs above. The dock continued in this capacity until the task of oil handling was transferred across the river to Tranmere Oil Terminal and Stanlow Oil Refinery. During 1881 the dock facility was enlarged further and a fourth graving dock was constructed in 1902. Liverpool remained an important port during the Second World War, with Herculaneum Dock acting as a terminus for the North Atlantic Convoys. Herculaneum Dock was formerly served by its own station on the Liverpool Overhead Railway. The station (and railway) closed on 30 December 1956. By 1958 demolition of the station had been completed. In 1972, Herculaneum Dock closed being filled in during the 1980s to create a car park. After closure The area south of the dock contained a tank farm; this was reclaimed for the Liverpool Garden Festival and residential properties. In 2004, the site was bought by national property developer David McLean Homes and a riverside residential development, called City Quay, Liverpool was built on the dock. Since the closing of Herculaneum Dock, what was the main dock area is now a car park and where the graving docks were are now office buildings. The map of 1901 shows the entrance to the dock with the letter 'L'. A restaurant has since been built on this.

It flows northwest between the Lyttelton Range and Dunedin Range, turning east on rounding the latter range to enter the sea south of Cape Scott. The coastal extremity of the glacier was charted in 1911–12 by the Northern Party, led by Victor Campbell, of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13. The geographical feature lies situated on the Pennell Coast, a portion of Antarctica lying between Cape Williams and Cape Adare.

It has specialist investigative capabilities and delivers and maintains national information sharing systems. History =Predecessors= On 1 January 2003, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) was established under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, superseding the National Crime Authority (NCA), the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments (OSCA). CrimTrac was established as an agency in the Attorney-General's Department in 1990. =Establishment and legal framework= On 1 July 2016, the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (National Policing Information) Act 2016 (Cwlth) amended the ACC Act to implement the carrying over of CrimTrac's functions to the ACC, including the provision of systems and services relating to national policing information and nationally coordinated criminal history checks. It was formed to strengthen the country's response to crime affecting Australia. As a Commonwealth statutory authority, the ACIC also has responsibilities under the Public Service Act 1999 and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The role and functions of the ACIC are underpinned by supporting legislation in each state and territory. Roles and functions The mission is to make Australia safer through improved national ability to connect, discover, understand and respond to current and emerging crime threats, and criminal justice issues, including the ability for police and law enforcement to access essential policing knowledge and information. The organisation is uniquely equipped as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency with investigative, research and information delivery functions. The agency works closely with a broad range of national and international partners to achieve their purpose, while taking account of criminal threats to Australia, and stakeholders’ needs, the ACIC creates a national intelligence picture of crime, targets serious and organised crime, delivers information capability and services to front line policing and law enforcement, and provides crime and justice research that produces an evidence base for addressing crime in Australia. They support and collaborate closely with the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC)], whose director is also that of the ACIC's CEO. The AIC undertakes criminological research, which helps inform law enforcement's collective response to crime. The AIC provides independent monitoring, and research programs that enhance knowledge of crime and criminal justice issues in Australia, and it also provides strategic advice to inform policy development and reform. The ACIC works with law enforcement partners to improve the ability to stop criminals exploiting emerging opportunities and gaps in law enforcement information. They report to the Minister for Home Affair, and is accountable to and monitored and reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. The ACIC Board ACIC Board includes representatives of Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement and key national security and regulatory agencies. The Board also provides strategic direction to the ACIC and is responsible for determining special operations and special investigations. They are subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), which is tasked with preventing, detecting and investigating law-enforcement related corruption issues. The ACIC delivers information-sharing solutions between state, territory and federal law enforcement agencies including biometric matching, child protection, firearm services, police reference services, missing persons and domestic violence. The agency does this by bringing together essential law enforcement information from around the country and making it accessible to all Australian police and other law enforcement agencies. They also manage the National Police Checking Service,National Police Checking Service which service enables controlled access to disclosable police history information from all Australian police agencies. These capabilities are specifically designed to equip police with the information they need to investigate, solve and prevent crimes. This vital information can improve an officer's decision-making and contribute to a safer Australia. The ACIC's coercive powers are used in special operations and special investigations to obtain information where traditional law enforcement methods are unlikely to be or have not been effective, and similar to those of a Royal Commission, authorise examiners, who are appointed by the Governor General of Australia, to compel persons to give evidence for the purposes of special ACIC operations or investigations. Examinations are conducted in private, witnesses at examinations are able to claim protection so that the answers, documents or things they provide are not admissible in evidence against them in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty except in limited circumstances. The coercive powers also authorise examiners to issue notices to be served on persons requiring them to produce documents or things relevant to a special operation or investigation. This power is broad, and a notice to produce may be issued to a person, a corporation or a Commonwealth government agency. Organisation The ACIC head office is in the Australian Capital Territory, and the agency has regional offices in each state and the Northern Territory. The ACIC also has officers internationally deployed and works closely with law enforcement and criminal intelligence agencies in transnational criminal investigations. Services The ACIC has a variety of services at their disposal, such as Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network, Biometric and Forensic Services, Child protection, Fire arms services, Domestic violence, National Criminal Intelligence System, and the National Police Checking Service.'''

The name was given to daughters of men belonging to the Lepidus branch of the Aemilius family. The first Aemilia Lepida to be mentioned by Roman historians was the former fiancée of the younger Cato. Subsequent Aemiliae are known because of their marriages. Aemilia Lepida (1st century BC), wife of Metellus Scipio This Aemilia was daughter of Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, wife of Metellus Scipio and former fiancée of Cato. Her daughter was Cornelia Metella, last wife and widow of Pompey the Great. Although Aemilia Lepida was engaged to be married to Cato the Younger, she in fact married someone else, leaving Cato to marry Atilia. In the words of Plutarch:Plutarch, Parallel Lives, \\"Cato the Younger\\", 7 > When he thought that he was old enough to marry,— and up to that time he had > consorted with no woman,— he engaged himself to Lepida, who had formerly > been betrothed to Metellus Scipio, but was now free, since Scipio had > rejected her and the betrothal had been broken. However, before the marriage > Scipio changed his mind again, and by dint of every effort got the maid. > Cato was greatly exasperated and inflamed by this, and attempted to go to > law about it; but his friends prevented this, and so, in his rage and > youthful fervour, he betook himself to iambic verse, and heaped much > scornful abuse upon Scipio, adopting the bitter tone of Archilochus, but > avoiding his license and puerility. Lepida and Cato were first cousins with > Lepida's father and Cato's mother being blood siblings. Aemilia Lepida, wife of Domitius Ahenobarbus Aemilia Lepida may have been the name of the wife of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC), due to the name of Ahenobarbus's granddaughter, Domitia Lepida the Younger. Her only child was her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC). Her son married Antonia Major, a niece of Roman Emperor Augustus and a daughter to Augustus' sister Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. Their children were Domitia Lepida the Elder, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32) and Domitia Lepida the Younger. Aemilia died before 31 BC. Aemilia Lepida, wife of L. Cornelius Sulla Faustus Aemilia Lepida was a Roman noble woman who lived in the 1st century BC. She was the first wife of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Faustus, who was consul in 5 BC. She bore him several children including her son, suffect consul of 31, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus. One of her daughters-in-law was Domitia Lepida the Younger a great niece of Emperor Augustus and a granddaughter of triumvir Mark Antony. One of her grandchildren was consul Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix. Aemilia Lepida (exiled 20), niece Lepidus the Younger Aemilia Lepida was the niece of Lepidus the Younger and sister to Manius Aemilius Lepidus. She married the wealthy senator Publius Sulpicius Quirinius. In her younger years, she was engaged to Emperor Augustus’ heir Lucius Caesar. She had borne a daughter to senator Mamercus Aemilius Scaurus. In 20, she was charged with adultery, poisoning, consulting astrologers, falsely to claim to bear a son to her ex-husband and attempting to poison her ex-husband. At her trial her brother defended her. During her trial, the Games were held. Other distinguished ladies, accompanied her into the theatre and protested her innocence to Emperor Tiberius. She was found guilty and was exiled.Tacitus, Annales. 3.22–23; Suetonius, Twelve Caesars: \\"Tiberius\\" 49.1. Aemilia Lepida (1st century), wife of Galba Aemilia Lepida from the Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum Aemilia Lepida was daughter of Manius Aemilius Lepidus, consul in AD 11. This Aemilia Lepida is usually identified with Lepida, wife of the short-lived Roman Emperor Galba. She bore him two sons before her death. She died relatively young, and their sons also died young. Galba never remarried.Suetonius, Twelve Caesars: \\"Galba\\". When Lepida lived, Agrippina the Younger (a widow after Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus' death) tried to make shameless advances to Galba, who was devoted to his wife and thus completely uninterested. On one occasion Lepida's mother gave Agrippina the Younger, while in the company of a whole bevy of married women, a public reprimand and slapped her in the face. Aemilia Lepida, fiancee of Claudius Aemilia Lepida (4/3 BC – ?) was the daughter of Lucius Aemilius Paullus and his wife Julia the Younger. She was the first great-grandchild of the Emperor Augustus, and at one time was a fiancée of the future Emperor Claudius. Lepida had several children with her husband, Marcus Junius Silanus, and two of her sons became consuls.Barrett, Anthony, 'Caligula: The Corruption of Power' (Touchstone, 1989), p. 122. Aemilia Lepida (died 36), wife of Drusus Aemilia Lepida (died 36) was daughter of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, consul in 6 and niece to the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus (executed 14 AD). Despite her uncle's disgrace, and due to her father's high standing with the Roman emperors and the Senate, she married her second cousin Drusus Caesar. Tacitus reports that during their marriage \\"she had pursued her husband with ceaseless accusations\\". In 36, she was charged with adultery with a slave and committed suicide, \\"since there was no question about her guilt\\".Annales 6.40 References Category:Ancient Roman prosopographical lists of women Category:Aemilii Lepidi ","title":"Aemilia Lepida"},{"id":"1128174","text":"A permanent autonomous zone (PAZ) is a community that is autonomous from the generally recognized state or authority structure in which it is embedded.

It is a co-production film between the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the Czech Republic. The film is based on the 1952 short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury. It is about \\"time tourists\\" who accidentally interfere too much with the past, completely altering the present. It failed at the box office, earning $11 million against a production budget of $80 million. It received negative reviews from critics. Plot In the year 2055, the Chicago-based Time Safari company offers the opportunity for rich people to hunt dinosaurs in the past via time travel technology. As a precaution against the potential change of the past, the company preys only on the dinosaurs who would otherwise die of natural causes and keeps the clients from stepping off the designated path. Because of the dangers of interfering with the timeline, the company's activities are vocally criticized by Sonia Rand, the developer of the time machine software \\"TAMI\\", who feels disappointed for not receiving credit during her work and is worried that some clients may alter the past through their activities. A trip with clients Eckels and Middleton goes afoul when the gun brought by team leader Travis Ryer fails to go off. The dinosaur, an Allosaurus, rushes the group, scattering the clients. Ryer is able to kill the dinosaur and afterwards, regroups the clients and returns to 2055 without further harm. The next day, however, Members of Time Safari including CEO Charles Hatton hear reports of global increases in temperature and humidity, and Ryer observes a sudden increase in plant life. On their next trip, Ryer and a new group of clients find that the Allosaurus he and the team intend to hunt is already dead and the volcano erupts much sooner. The team quickly returns and reports the changes, causing the government to shut down Time Safari for an investigation. Ryer learns from Rand that Chicago is being struck by \\"time waves\\" that cause drastic alterations to the city as they pass due to something that happened on a previous expedition. Ryer and Rand narrowly escape a building after a time wave causes the appearance of thousands of beetles and a tree bursting through its structure. Rand warns that more time waves can be expected, and each will affect more advanced life forms, people being the last. Ryer and Rand return to Time Safari to try to fix what has gone wrong along with the government. Unfortunately, another time wave strikes that leaves the city without power and now covered by dense vegetation. Evaluating the machine's logs, they find that the Eckels/Middleton expedition had come back a few grams heavier and that the bio-filter was turned off and recognize that they can use the time machine to go back to intercept their past selves so as to prevent whatever happened, but will only have a few seconds to act, and so must work to figure out who they need to stop. The Time Safari finds their equipment and gear free of anything, so Ryer and Rand lead a group through the city - now filled with evolved and deadly hybrids and other new hazards that kill some of their party members in order to find Eckels and Middleton. Eckels is safe but asserts he remained on the path, while Middleton, poisoned by the new wildlife, commits suicide before they can stop him. However, they are able to find a dead butterfly on the sole of the suit he used for the safari. The party makes it back to Time Safari after more time waves hit, now finding the time machine partially underwater and unusable. Rand obtains the hard drive containing the TAMI software with plans to use it with the nearby university's particle accelerator as a substitute time machine. With Ryer and Rand as the only two survivors, they finally make it to the university, Rand noted that the appearance of simian- like Babboonlizards from the latest time wave means the next one will wipe away humanity. Rand prepares the accelerator and stays behind while Ryer goes through the time portal, just as the last time wave hits turning Rand into a humanoid catfish-like creature. Ryer catches up to the previous expedition, catches Middleton to prevent him stepping on the butterfly, tells team member Jenny that the bio-filter is off at the same time asking her to give his earlier self a recording of the events he has witnessed. The expedition returns without incident to the future they had left and Ryer shares the footage with Rand, presumably to use it to bring down Time Safari, and make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

Crimtrac had been responsible for developing and maintaining national information-sharing services between state, territory and federal law enforcement agencies. It was established to deliver on the vision of sharing national policing information to achieve local, national and international policing outcomes. CrimTrac worked in partnership with Australia's police agencies to provide services that allowed police to easily share information with each other across state and territory borders. CrimTrac's information-sharing capabilities were specifically designed to equip police with the information needed to make decisions to assist in investigating and preventing crime. CrimTrac ensured that vital information was shared across Australia's nine police agencies to provide a national view of policing. Under the Australian Constitution, each state and territory is responsible for maintaining law and order within its borders, with the Australian Federal Police serving the Commonwealth. Criminals have exploited borders to avoid detection, but when police have a national view of policing information, this minimises opportunities for offenders to evade the law by crossing borders. It is essential to have effective and efficient information sharing systems to support law enforcement and the operational officers who protect our community. Through its services, CrimTrac contributed directly to the effectiveness and efficiency of police and law enforcement agencies in Australia. History CrimTrac was established to modernise the IT systems created by the National Exchange of Policing Information (NEPI) formed in 1990 and to add new systems required by Australian police to meet changing national law enforcement needs. These include biometric identification of persons of interest via fingerprints and DNA, and other policing information. Fifty million dollars was provided by the Federal government following the 1998 election, and procedural and administrative work commenced to create CrimTrac and transition the NEPI systems over. An Inter- Governmental Agreement (IGA) signed by Federal, State and Territory law enforcement ministers in July 2000 has underpinned the agency's endeavours. CrimTrac commenced as a small national agency located in the national capital - Canberra, and staffed by Australian Public Servants. Police specialists and contractors assist where necessary. It has required strong cooperation from all police services, particularly on Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Even with the advantage of an IGA, CrimTrac's startup, growth and management in the first five years was challenging as it addressed its NEPI legacy whilst scoping new IT systems to deliver better shared policing information. Those years required sustained effort by the staff of CrimTrac and by its Board of Management, drawn from the IGA parties, at Police Commissioner level. CrimTrac continues to face challenges as a result of Australia's federational style of government, which has produced nine different sets of criminal legislation and nine individual police systems that must communicate to allow the centralisation of policing information. The national DNA database took eight years to become fully functional because of minor differences in Commonwealth, state and territory legislation. While Australian police services and law enforcement agencies need and want better information systems to support officers on the beat, they do not wish these systems to necessarily replace their existing systems. Their systems are at differing levels of sophistication and evolution on different computing platforms, architectures and types and formats of information stored. They have been built and had evolved to suit jurisdictional, not national requirements. To achieve optimal outcomes from its new or improved national IT systems, CrimTrac had worked hard for a new and better culture of information sharing between police services. Regular and informative liaison characterises CrimTrac's modus operandi with police and strong arguments accompany all CrimTrac business cases where police services may be asked to contribute or share information. The impact of the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 is also taken into account through the requirement for all new projects that involve the national sharing of sometimes sensitive and usually confidential personal information to prepare a privacy impact assessment. Improving legacy IT systems or building new ones understandably has involved controversy as existing state and territory-based policing information systems were scrutinised by CrimTrac in order to establish \\"best of breed\\" designs, to analyse better information-sharing practices for national adoption and to persuade police jurisdictions to use new CrimTrac systems. In the almost eight years since CrimTrac was established, distrust and controversy has been replaced by support and cooperation from all the partner police services. Biometrics CrimTrac's NCIDD and NAFIS systems provide police agencies with biometric matching capabilities that assist the police with identity management and to resolve crime. =National Automated Fingerprint Identification System= The National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS) is a fingerprint and palm print database and matching system, which is available to Australian police and immigration authorities. The NAFIS assists Australian police to solve crime by quickly and reliably establishing a person's identity from fingerprint and palm impressions. The NAFIS enables near ‘real time’ upload of prints from crime scenes which makes it possible for police to identify a suspect in minutes. The NAFIS contains finger and palm print images collected from individuals by Australian police and immigration authorities. It also contains unsolved fingerprint and palm print crime scene images, which Australian police can search against. The NAFIS contains fingerprint or palm print records for more than 3.3 million people, with a total of 5.6 million sets of prints. In the 2011-12 financial year users conducted 428,831 searches on prints from individuals. During this period, there was 367,751 searches conducted on finger and palm prints from latent fingerprints, which are collected at crime scenes. =National Criminal Investigation DNA Database= The National Criminal Investigation DNA Database (NCIDD) provides Australian police with the ability to match DNA profiles across state and territory borders. The NCIDD contains DNA profiles from samples collected by Australian police. These profiles are derived from samples collected at crime scenes, or from convicted offenders, suspects, items belonging to missing persons and unknown deceased persons. The NCIDD enables police agencies to compare DNA profiles from a crime scene with convicted offenders throughout Australia. Additionally, the database allows police to match profiles from two or more unsolved crime scenes, linking seemingly unrelated police investigations. By 30 June 2012, the NCIDD had linked 69,606 individuals to crime scenes, and had made 12,216 crime scene to crime scene links. At 31 December 2012, there were 713,200 profiles recorded on the NCIDD. As well as their ongoing day to day value to Australian police, the international value of these systems was proven following the Bali bombings in 2002 and the Australian response to the Thailand tsunami of 2004. Child Protection =National Child Offender System= The National Child Offender System (NCOS) provides operational police with tools to achieve nationally consistent registration and management of child offenders. The NCOS consists of the Australian National Child Offender Register (ANCOR) and the Managed Person System (MPS). The ANCOR supports online crime prevention and allows authorised police officers to register, case manage and share information about registered persons. It assists police to uphold child protection legislation in their state or territory. The MPS holds information on offenders who are charged but not convicted, or after an offender's reporting obligations have been completed. =Child Exploitation Tracking System= The Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS) is a joint initiative between CrimTrac, police agencies and Microsoft. The primary objective of the CETS is to improve police efforts to identify children exposed to significant risk of sexual abuse, and reduce police exposure to child exploitation material. The CETS automatically matches seized child exploitation material with previously identified material. This makes it easier for police to identify material created by an offender, and increases police capacity to identify victims. Police Reference Services =National Police Reference System= The National Police Reference System (NPRS) enables Australian police agencies to integrate their data with data from other police agencies. The NPRS supports police and other law enforcement agencies by providing key reference data to support first responders, investigators and analysts. In the 2011-12 financial year, more than 53,000 police users conducted 35 million transactions using the NPRS. During this period, 10 million person records with 5.7 million photographs were available for law enforcement purposes. On average, there are 96,000 daily transactions made on the NPRS. Some of the information included about a person of interest on the NPRS includes: name; identity information (including photographs); information on warnings, warrants and whether an individual is wanted by police; offence history; protection and violence orders; firearms involvements; and information relating to the child protection register. The NPRS also contains information on missing persons, unidentified persons and bodies, and escapees. In May 2012 the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) was the first authorised non-police agency to gain access to NPRS for law-enforcement purposes. =National Firearms Licensing and Registration System= The National Firearms Licensing and Registration System (NFLRS) holds information on: • past and current firearm license holders • licensed firearms dealers • registered, lost or stolen firearms. CrimTrac collects and shares firearm license and registration information between all police agencies and approved external agencies. Police officers responding to an incident can be advised if a person is the registered owner of a firearm. There are more than 4.5 million firearms recorded on the NFLRS. =National Vehicles of Interest= The National Vehicle of Interest (NVOI) system records stolen, recovered and suspect vehicle details. This service enables Australian police agencies to share information on vehicle registration, driver license and vehicle owner details. In the 2011-12 financial year, more than 188,000 incidents were registered on the system. National Police Checking Service CrimTrac worked together with Australia's police agencies to deliver the National Police Checking Service (NPCS). The NPCS enhances the safety and security of the community by ensuring the integrity of individuals placed in a position of trust. The NPCS provides Australian police agencies, and other agencies accredited with CrimTrac, with a national view of police history information. A National Police History Check involves checking and releasing police information about an individual, subject to relevant legislation and policies. This is used to assess an individual's suitability for employment, Australian citizenship, or appointment to positions of trust. CrimTrac delivers the NPCS to more than 120 organisations across the country. These include police agencies, public and private sector organisations and not-for-profit organisations. The NPCS processed approximately 3 million checks in the 2011-12 financial year. Approximately 29 per cent of all checks require further investigation by police. CrimTrac is working with New Zealand Police in a trial of sharing police history information.

He was the first resident of Utah to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games, in 1912, in the running high jump event. Jumping Alma Richards was born in Parowan, Utah, one of ten children of Morgan Richards and Margaret Adams. His father was from Wales. His mother's parents were from Ireland. As a farm boy with an eighth grade education, he decided to quit school and explore the world. But shortly after his departure he met a Native American named Thomas Trueblood who convinced Richards to return to school. While Richards was a student at Brigham Young University High school in Provo, Utah, BYU coach Eugene L. Roberts saw him playing basketball and instructed him to jump over a six-foot-high bar - which he did, easily. Coach Roberts then proceeded to raise money to get Richards to the 1912 Trials in the High Jump. Richards proceeded to defeat American champion George Horine in the final and to win the gold medal in the high jump event at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912. He also defeated the Native American Olympian Jim Thorpe who tied for fourth place in the high jump. Richards was the first Utah native to win an Olympic Gold Medal. Richards graduated from Brigham Young in 1913, and from Cornell University in 1917, where he was also a member of the Quill and Dagger society. The Olympics did wonders for his self-confidence, and whereas he was once just a marginal student, his aptitude and attitude now were boundless. He thrived at Cornell, in the classroom and on the track. He was the national AAU high jump champion in 1913 and later, as he expanded his repertoire, he became a decathlete as well. By the time of the national AAU championships of 1915, held in conjunction with the World's Fair in San Francisco, he became the national decathlon champion, finishing some 400 points ahead of Avery Brundage,Avery Brundage. trackfield.brinkster.net who would later head the International Olympic Committee. Richards was the United States' best decathlete and high jumper due to enter the 1916 Olympic Games, but those Games were never held, because of the outbreak of World War I. Later years After graduating with honors from Cornell, Alma attended graduate school at Stanford, before enrolling in law school at the University of Southern California. He got his law degree and, as high jumpers do, he passed the bar. But he chose not to practice law. Instead he went into teaching. He became a science teacher in Los Angeles at Venice High School, where he remained for 32 years until he retired. Richards was buried, according to his wishes, in the Parowan Cemetery. He was posthumously inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame (1970),Honorees. Utah Sports Hall of Fame Helms Hall of Fame and Brigham Young University Hall of Fame. Personal life Alma's first wife was Marian Gardiner Richards. They had one child Joanna Richards. His second wife was Gertrude Huntimer Richards and they had three Children.

The program premiered on the Nine Network on 22 September 1999, before moving to Network Ten which aired the program from 2000 until November 2009. The show was hosted by comedian Rove McManus through his production company Roving Enterprises, and featured an ensemble cast who presented various segments throughout the course of the show. The show won the Logie Award for \\"Most Popular Light Entertainment Program\\" five times (2002, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009). History =Origins: The Loft Live= Rove McManus began his television career hosting the RMITV-produced The Loft Live on Melbourne's Channel 31, a community-access television station. It was a straightforward tonight show, with a comic monologue from the host, pre- recorded skits and guest interviews. The show had unusually high production values for a community access show. =1999: Rove (Nine Network)= The Nine Network developed the show into a commercial production. In 1999, the show, named Rove, ran in a late-night timeslot for 10 episodes. The show featured McManus and three co-hosts he referred to as 'the kids on the couch': Peter Helliar, Corinne Grant and Dave Callan. However, Nine decided not to renew the program and the cast moved to Network Ten the following year. =Move to Network Ten= 2000–2006: Rove Live 2006 Rove Live logo The new show, very similar to the Nine production, was named Rove Live. The show was sometimes known as Rove [Live] or Rove (Live), owing to the use of (square) brackets around the word 'Live' in some of the show's graphics. Dave Callan left the show after one year, to pursue standup comedy and radio opportunities. Corinne Grant left the show at the end of 2005, to concentrate on The Glass House and other interests. Carrie Bickmore joined the cast in 2006, presenting a parody news segment. Meshel Laurie joined the cast for only one year. In November 2006, Rove Live was suspended until further notice due to the death of McManus's wife Belinda Emmett. Rove wrote a personal message on the Rove Live website, saying that it \\"is a very difficult period for all of us and some time away is the best thing for me right now\\". 2007–2009: Rove The show reverted to the title of Rove in 2007. Production moved from the Global Television facility in Nunawading to the old Seven Network studios in South Melbourne. It now occupied the premium timeslot of 8:30pm on Sunday nights. Peter Helliar returned to McManus's side. Bickmore's role in the show increased. Following the cancellation of the show The Glass House, Dave Hughes joined Rove. The comedy duo Hamish & Andy, who had previously collaborated with Roving Enterprises with their television show Real Stories, began appearing every second week. Their associate Ryan Shelton also began presenting a segment each week. Each year, the show's set changes in some way from the previous. In a previous year, the set was changed to be less like a traditional late-night talk show and more like a variety show. In 2007, the show's set was reconfigured back into a more traditional late-night talk show again, even going so far as having a view of the Melbourne cityscape in the background. In July 2007, a special show was filmed at Times Square in New York City. Rove, Helliar and Adam Hills attended, and a live Australian audience was present. In late July a second special was filmed in Los Angeles at the Bob Barker Studio. Hayden Guppy now also co-host of Video Hits also became a cast member, who shows TV viewers what the cast does during ad breaks. In 2008, Myf Warhurst, who co-hosted a breakfast radio show with Peter Helliar on Triple M, joined the cast as an infrequent addition whenever a regular cast member was unavailable. Again in 2008, Elmo returned as a guest. In 2009 the program moved premises to ABC Studios in Elsternwick, Victoria which houses a new set. Dave Hughes, Hamish Blake and Andy Lee began only appearing on a fortnightly appearance. Between May and July 2009, actor Brian Wenzel had a weekly skit at the end of the show. After 12 July, the show went off-air to let the team take a mid-year break due to the show starting in February (earlier than 2007 and 2008). It was also announced that this episode would be Bickmore's and Hughesy's final episode as regular cast members, due to them both leaving to focus on their new show, The 7pm Project, which premiered on 20 July 2009, and is also produced by Roving Enterprises. =Series finale= Various news reports appeared in the lead up to the scheduled season finale for the 2009 season of Rove. The Herald Sun originally reported that McManus had confirmed that his show would not return until later in 2010. Despite not appearing on a list of shows at Ten's 2010 launch event, it was rumoured that Rove would return in 2010 with a new format, similar to Hey Hey It's Saturday, which rated over two million viewers for its two reunion shows. McManus made a comment to the Herald Sun and stated \\"This show is my love and my passion and it's always what I've wanted to do.\\" McManus then continued to say \\"If everything else fell down, as long as I still get to do this thing I love then I’m happy. We have that connection with the audience at the moment and that's where my enthusiasm is coming from.\\" However, rumours appeared the day before the 2009 finale of Rove in that \\"staff on his TV show were told this week to look for alternative work next year.\\" Ten's publicity department denied these claims by stating: \\"We have checked with Roving (Enterprises) and no such discussion was had. As for what changes may or may not be made with Rove for 2010, this will be announced on the show this Sunday, stay tuned.\\" McManus was spotted earlier dining with Merrick Watts and Peter Helliar in Sydney, prompting talk that he might return to radio in 2010. The rumour of the show ending later revealed to be true as during the finale on 15 November 2009, McManus confirmed that the show would be ending with the 2009 finale. He said: \\"It's purely my decision. It's not one I've made lightly or flippantly. The timing was right to stop, stand back and see what happens next.\\" The final show finished at 11:11pm AEDT with a montage of clips from the 2009 season and a performance by Powderfinger. Rove's last words was a variation of his signature sign off: \\"I'm Rove McManus, say bye to your mum for me.\\" Cast =Main cast= * Rove McManus (1999–2009) * Hamish Blake (2007–2009) * Andy Lee (2007–2009) * Peter Helliar (1999–2009) * Ryan Shelton (2007–2009) * Corinne Grant (1999–2005) * Carrie Bickmore (2006–2009) * Dave Callan 1999–2000) * Meshel Laurie (2006) * Judith Lucy (2009) * Dave Hughes (2007–2009) * Ron Steward (2006) * Kristie Warner (2006) Secondary cast * Jess Harris (2009) * Nick Maxwell (2008–2009) * Tom Piotrowski (2008) * Hayden Guppy (2008–2009) * Myf Warhurst (2008–2009) * Brian Wenzel (2009) Format  The show starts with Rove performing a comedic monologue about a variety of news events that have occurred during the previous week. He then introduces Peter Helliar and the other cast members present on the couch that week. PeteSpace, a parody of social-networking website MySpace, consists of Helliar presenting a selection of celebrities, news-makers and online video clips that make up his top events of the week. Kristy at the news desk presented by Kristy Warner, was a parody news report, similar to the long-running Weekend Update segment of the American sketch show, Saturday Night Live (replaced Carrie at the news desk from 17 August 2009 onwards). Judith Lucy presented by Judith Lucy. Lucy delivers a satirical and comedic commentary on a personal or newsworthy topic (Replaced Hughsey! from 17 August 2009 onwards). Throughout each show, Rove will interview several celebrity guests. Each interview ends with a segment titled Public Probe where he will ask his guests five different questions that have been posted to the website by the general public. At the end of the interview, Rove would usually spruik the product or event that guest was promoting, and the words The Plug will appear on the screen. Throughout the course of the show, a variety of other segments are shown, presented by members of the Rove cast: * Kevin Rudd PM was a small dramatic- comedy mini series about the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. The series involves video news clips of Rudd that are spliced together. Two other segments are occasionally shown, not necessarily every week. * Hamish & Andy Comedians Hamish Blake and Andy Lee presented a pre-recorded report, frequently on location overseas. * Ryan Shelton also presented a segment known as Philosophisationing with Ryan Shelton. The final segment of the show was What Have We Learnt?, in which each cast member, and usually each guest, give a humourus example of what they have learned during the week. Peter Helliar always answers last and ends with \\"and you can read all about it in my new book...\\" The show will usually end with a live performance from a band in the studio, and McManus will end the show by saying his trademark line \\"Say hi to your mum for me!\\" Starting in 2005 the band performs before the closing credits. In previous years the credits would roll while the band performed. In 2006, Rove had a house band, which may have been the same band as the main act, or an Australian band of much smaller stature than the main act. They would play live music when returning from ad breaks. =Former show elements= * 20 bucks in 20 seconds was a titled segment at the end of an interview with a guest where Rove would ask questions for twenty seconds. Once the time was up, Rove would always ask the question: \\"Who would you turn gay for?\\" unless the guest was openly gay, in which case Rove would ask: \\"Who would you turn straight for?\\". A popular solution to this question was to respond \\"I'd turn gay for you, Rove\\". In a particular episode featuring known prankster and member of The Chaser team, Chas Licciardello, Licciardello expressed his annoyance that everyone answered \\"I'd turn gay for you, Rove\\" but that nobody ever followed up on it. He then leapt on Rove and French kissed him, before licking Rove on the face. This segment was again replaced by Final Five in 2009, and halfway through the 2009 series, it changed once again and became the \\"Public Probe\\", where Rove would ask the guest 5 questions submitted online from the public. * All That Glitters: Rove, along with regular presenters and guest artists perform a scripted radio play with the help of a Foley artist live on the show. * Amazing Talents: Viewers with 'amazing' (or just plain bizarre) 'talents' are brought to the studio and given a few minutes to display their skills. This could be balancing lawn furniture, or nailing a fork into each nostril. This is comparable to the \\"Stupid Human Tricks\\" segment on the Late Show with David Letterman. * Carrie at the Newsdesk was a parody news report, similar to the long-running Weekend Update segment of the American sketch show, Saturday Night Live. The segment had been presented by a variety of personalities in Bickmore's absence. While on maternity leave in 2007, Bickmore was replaced by Jane Hall and Meshel Laurie. In 2008, Bert Newton and Myf Warhurst have presented the segment when Bickmore was ill. * Final Five where he will ask his guests five different questions and often include their opinion on something that has happened during the week in popular culture (such as asking Alan Cumming what he thought of Matthew Newton's bum in Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities). The last question was always a visual question where Rove will show the interviewee an unusual image and ask them to say what they think about the image. * Flick Your Switch: The show broadcasts a live video shot of an area of an Australian city. Rove then asks those residents of the area who are watching the show and willing to respond to flick their houselights on and off, sometimes to give answers to questions. This segment started in 2004 when Rove pointed a camera at Kirribilli House and asked the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, to flick his light switch if he was willing to be interviewed on the show. When the desired result was not achieved, Rove then asked the neighbours to flick their switch if they would try to help get Howard on the show. On 19 April 2005, Rove succeeded in his goal of getting someone at Kirribilli house to flick their switch. A special ferry filled with participants in a dress-up competition for the show stopped on Sydney Harbour outside Kirribilli House, the passengers chanting \\"Flick your switch\\". Rove and viewers were surprised to see the lights flick. It was neither Mr or Mrs Howard as they were both on an international visit at the time. It is believed that it was one of Howard's children or an aide. The show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush had a similar element for the second season involving the audience flashing their house lights on and off at a prescribed moment. A camera in a mystery location would search for someone taking part, thus selecting him or her to play a game that involved throwing things out of his or her windows. * Guides: Rove, Pete and Corinne created guides to help people. The guides they did were: Guide To Having A Baby, Guide To Driving, Guide To Breaking Up, Guide To House Hunting and Guide To Job Interviews. * Hang Up, Don't Hang Up: Rove called a regular audience member from a different time zone, and tried to engage in conversation. However, during the call Peter Helliar revealed random instructions from the keypad of an oversized phone prop. For example, Sing your words, or Make the live-lister say the word \\"bucket\\". If Peter pulled out Hang up, Rove hung up and ended the call without saying goodbye or even finishing his sentence. * Hot Topic: A vox populi segment, in which purportedly random people were asked their opinions. These answers were evidently scripted, and many of their responses included references to Network Ten shows. * Hughesy! was presented by Dave Hughes. Hughes delivered a satirical and comedic commentary on a personal or newsworthy topic. * Hughesy Loses It: Dave Hughes engaged in a weekly rant about something trivial, this is very similar to Nickelodeon's \\"Dave's Raves\\" a years prior by Dave Lawson on Sarvo. He often used the catchphrase 'Seriously!' * Help Me Hughesy!: Dave Hughes responded humorously to viewer questions, frequently with taped reports. * I Want My Stuff Back: Rove helps a 'Live Lister' receive back property that they have lent to someone. * It Takes You: Parody of It Takes Two, in which Rove picked a member of the audience to sing with a celebrity. This segment appeared once on 3 June 2007. The professional was Dean Geyer. * ': Viewers can register their name, address and various other details on the show's website to join the Live List. A broadcast team will occasionally visit a viewer (the first the viewer knows about it is when they see the front of their house live on television). What happens from then on varies greatly—from performing a quick two-minute interview live from their house, to being sent away to perform a certain task (usually to win a prize), sometimes being sent as far away as Fiji, New York City or the United Kingdom. * My Charader: Charades. The title is a play on the song \\"My Sharona\\" by The Knack. The game is hosted by Rove and involves two teams. Before Corinne Grant left the show, she and a guest would play on one team, and Peter Helliar and a guest on the other team. * Not So Frequently Asked Questions: Rove, Peter and Corinne are asked questions that aren't asked very often. This usually ends with a pre-recorded skit. * The Pentagon of Probable Embarrassment: Rove has an audience member spin a wheel with a one in five chance of winning $5000, although the other four items on the wheel are repelling. Other items on the wheel included: \\"Breakfast in your pants\\", \\"Kiss Pete's Grandma\\", \\"Soup on your head\\", \\"Eat a Fish Eye\\" and \\"Mega-Wedgie\\". * Petesclusive: Peter Helliar will chat to a 'guest' (celebrity or world figure) who has recently been involved in a famous story or scandal. Helliar's guests are a photograph of the famous person with his or her mouth digitally replaced by Rove's mouth. This is similar to a regular bit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. * Ron's Review: 78-year-old Ron Steward reviewed a new movie and a rating out of 5 stars. Ron's Review occurred around every three weeks. Peter Helliar also reviews the same movie. The main humorous appeal of this segment was the fact that Ron was quite an elderly man which led to a variety of jokes regarding Ron's age, which, although many were at his own expense, he appeared to take in good humor. Another humorous part of the segment is Ron's ever-recurring rating of three-and-a-half stars (out of 5). In 2006 Rove conducted a semi-humorous campaign to have Ron nominated for the best newcomer Logie Award. * Rove's Audience's Got Talent: Parody of Australia's Got Talent, where Rove plucked a member of the audience and put them into a performance utilising a particular talent. Peter Helliar, Dave Hughes and a celebrity guest acted as judges. This segment has only occurred twice. * Roving with Rove: A pre-recorded vox populi segment in which McManus asks people in street for their thoughts. * Rydeas: Comedian Ryan Shelton presented a new invention or idea, often incorporating the syllable 'Ry'. * So Rove's Audience Thinks They Can Dance: Parody of So You Think You Can Dance, where Rove picks a member of the audience, dresses him or her in an unusual costume, and forces him/her to dance. Like It Takes You, this segment has only appeared once. * Sex Office: a drama/sitcom style television show set in the 1970s, in which everyone in the office (except one individual) is engaging in frequent casual sex. * Tell Us Where To Go: At a viewer's request, Corinne Grant was sent on location somewhere in Australia to witness a local event, to see a local landmark or to meet a local personality. The segment is pre-recorded and introduced by Rove and Corinne in front of a large map of Australia (without Tasmania) lowered onto the stage. At the end of the segment, Corinne gives Rove a present from the adventure (something sexual or inappropriate or both), and a magnet is placed on the drop-down map approximately where the location was. Due to Australia being very closely populated on the eastern coast, and southeastern corner in particular, the \\"approximate\\" placement of the magnets has been evermore loosely interpreted. This segment was dropped with the departure of Grant in 2005. * Two Minutes at Your House: In addition to being chosen to participate in stunts and contests, \\"Live List-ers\\", as they are referred to, may be visited by the show's camera crew for a live crossover to their house lasting about two minutes. In reality, these segments are often well beyond the suggested two minutes, as the timer doesn't commence counting down until the person has been verified to be at home, and Rove tells the clock to start. If a particular story isn't finished, pet not shown, or talent not displayed, the segment will often continue even if the timer has expired. Some broadcasts have hinted at prior planning of the segment. * What's Hot, What's Not: Rove would describe something that is hot (popular) at the moment and compare it with something that is not (e.g. What's Hot – Lamborghinis. What's Not – Lamb Bikinis. What's Hot – Desperate Housewives. \\"What's Not\\" – Dentist Archives). * What the...?: Rove receives viewer submissions of objects that might make one say \\"What the...?\\" The submissions could be newspaper clippings, DVD boxes, photographs of odd signs or animals doing inappropriate things to each other. Many are mistakes of translation from foreign languages or other unintentional humor. This segment was abandoned in 2007. * Who's in the Swivel Chair?: A celebrity was pushed around the studio on a swivel chair. Each week the name of the celebrity was announced by Bruce Mansfield. * Words that sound better when said by Dave: Dave Callan recited certain words and names which, owing to his thick Irish accent, sound quaint to the Australian audience. The sketch was abandoned when Callan left after the first series in 2000. Some of Callan's famous words include: 'trousers', 'haberdashery', 'Archbishop Desmond Tutu' and 'man-boob'. * Joke credits: At the end of every episode there were fake credits shown with the real credits. There was a common theme for the credits each week. * Song parodies: Rove performs a parody of a recent music video. He has parodied Shannon Noll's What About Me, Missy Higgins's Scar, Britney Spears's Oops!... I Did It Again and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor. * Sketches: Rove, Pete and Corinne Grant performed three sketches on the show together. The first one was about a sleepover, the second was about wheelchair rugby and the third was about horse racing. Ratings The show has sometimes struggled in the ratings. This was most obvious in the ratings for the final show of 2005, which was broadcast on 22 November. The show gave away six cars, and had media heavyweights Bert Newton, Jerry Seinfeld and Kath & Kim as guests. The show rated 19th for the day, with only 797,000 viewers nationwide. On 16 May 2006, the ratings peaked over a million for the first time since 2002 when 1,040,762 viewers watched nationwide. This episode involved an intruder entering the Big Brother house live during the show. The final episode for 2006 attracted only 700,000 viewers nationally.Seven Network Ratings Report for Tuesday, 7 November 2006 This wasn't intended to be the final episode, but eventuated as the result of the death of McManus' wife Belinda Emmett. The first episode of the revamped series, which began 1 April 2007, attracted 1,693,000 viewers nationwide, and was the highest rating program for the day. For the second episode of the season which aired on 8 April, viewership fell to 999,000. The third episode was shown on 22 April achieving around 1,073,000 viewers.14% fewer eyes watched Big Brother Since then, the show has consistently rated above 1,000,000 viewers nationally. Rove's final show for 2007 featured then Leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd, as well as Australian Greens leader Bob Brown, comedian Jerry Seinfeld and actor Jason Donovan. It was watched by 1.368 million viewers. The season premiere for 2008, broadcast on 30 March, only attracted 777,000 viewers. 855,000 viewers watched the 2009 return of Rove, up nearly 100,000 viewers on the previous year. Ratings frequently average 800,000–1 million viewers. International broadcasters In 2004, the show began broadcasting on TV3 in New Zealand at a late night time slot. The show quickly gained a following and it was given a Friday prime time slot (8:30pm–9:30pm). It was not broadcast live in New Zealand (in spite of its former title Rove Live) but, rather, five days after the Australian broadcast. Controversy On 28 June 2009, McManus interviewed Sacha Baron Cohen (appearing in character as Brüno Gehard). During the course of the interview, Brüno joked that \\"I hear [Cohen's] wife gets less sex than Katie Holmes\\". However, when televised, the words \\"Katie Holmes\\" were censored. A further joke at the expense of Holmes towards the end of the interview was not even televised. Throughout the interview, Brüno made numerous jokes about other celebrities especially Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. These jokes were not similarly censored. Other media  =Radio= Rove, Peter and Corinne hosted a radio program originating from FOX FM in Melbourne for Austereo's Today Network, and selected regional stations until 2004. It was initially known as Saturday Morning Rove. It was then called Rove Live Radio. =Soundtracks= Two soundtracks have been released featuring musical performances from the show, as well as a compilation of Rove's What The?, and a rap song about Home and Away character Alf.

Amiloride is often used with a thiazide or other loop diuretic. It is taken by mouth. Onset of action is about two hours and it lasts for about a day. Common side effects include high blood potassium, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and headache. The risk of high blood potassium is greater in those with kidney problems, diabetes, and those who are older. Amiloride is in the potassium-sparing diuretic family of medications. It works by increasing the amount of sodium and decreasing the amount of potassium released by the distal tubule of the kidney. Amiloride was developed in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Medical uses Amiloride may be used in combination with a thiazide diuretic for treatment of high blood pressure or (less commonly) in combination with a loop diuretic for treatment of heart failure. The potassium-sparing effects of amiloride offset the low blood potassium (hypokalemia) that is often induced by thiazides or loop diuretics, which is of particular importance in people for whom maintaining a normal level of potassium is critically important. For example, people that are taking Digitalis (i.e. digoxin) are at higher risk for changes in heart rhythm if their potassium levels get too high. The 2017 clinical practice guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines list amiloride as a \\"secondary\\" oral antihypertensive, with minimal efficacy. For people with resistant hypertension, already taking a thiazide diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a calcium channel blocker, the addition of amiloride (or spironolactone) was better at reducing blood pressure than adding a beta- blocker (bisoprolol) or an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin). When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, the addition of amiloride had positive effects on blood pressure and blood sugar tolerance. Amiloride may therefore be useful for preventing the metabolic side effects of thiazide diuretics, allowing for the use of higher thiazide doses (in line with how they were originally studied). Amiloride is the treatment of choice for Liddle phenotype, which is characterized by high blood pressure, low blood potassium, and metabolic alkalosis in conjunction with a low plasma renin activity and a low aldosterone. Some people with the Liddle phenotype have Liddle syndrome, which involves a genetic mutation resulting in upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), located in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells in the late distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney. Because Liddle phenotype usually involves an upregulation of ENaC channels, leading to retention of sodium and water and to hypokalemia, amiloride is useful as an ENaC channel inhibitor due to its promotion of sodium excretion and its potassium-sparing effects, restoring potassium to normal levels. Amiloride can be used as a monotherapy (single-drug therapy) or an adjunctive therapy alongside other diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) for the treatment of ascites and edema (swelling) due to cirrhosis of the liver. The 2012 clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) states that amiloride can be used to treat ascites in place of spironolactone if it isn't tolerated (e.g. due to the side effect of gynecomastia), though amiloride isn't a preferred drug due to cost and lack of efficacy. =Specific populations= Diabetics People with diabetes are at higher risk for kidney problems, which increases their risk for hyperkalemia (high blood potassium). The use of amiloride in people with diabetes requires careful potassium and kidney function monitoring to prevent toxicity. Amiloride must be discontinued for at least 3 days prior to glucose tolerance testing, due to the risk for fatal hyperkalemia. Poor kidney function People with poor kidney function (e.g. blood urea nitrogen >30 mg/dL, or serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL) are at high risk for hyperkalemia. Lactation There is no data on the use of amiloride in women that are breastfeeding. While diuretics can make lactation difficult, it is unlikely that amiloride would induce this effect in the absence of other diuretics. Pregnancy Data from the use of amiloride in animals suggests that it does not pose a risk to the developing fetus. However, when used in combination with the drug acetazolamide during the process of organ formation, amiloride increases the risk for kidney and ureter abnormalities. Limited human data from use during pregnancy suggests an association with a specific congenital penis abnormality if taken during the first trimester, as well as a risk for mild intrauterine growth restriction if taken throughout pregnancy. Contraindications Amiloride is contraindicated in people with kidney problems (e.g. anuria, acute or chronic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy), elevated blood potassium (≥5.5 mEq/L), or people that are hypersensitive to amiloride or any ingredients within the specific formulation. Use is also contraindicated in people that are already taking potassium-sparing drugs (e.g. spironolactone and triamterene) or whom are taking potassium supplements (e.g. potassium chloride) in most circumstances. Adverse effects Amiloride is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects to the use of amiloride include elevated blood potassium, mild skin rashes, headaches, and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, flatulence, and abdominal pain). Mild symptoms of high blood potassium concentrations include unusual skin sensations, muscle weakness, or fatigue, but more severe symptoms such as flaccid paralysis of the limbs, slow heart rate, and even shock can occur. Overdose There exists no overdose data on amiloride in humans, though it is expected than an overdose would produce effects consistent with its therapeutic effects; e.g. dehydration due to over-diuresis, and electrolyte disturbances related to hyperkalemia. It is unknown if amiloride can be dialyzed off, and no specific antidote against it exists. Treatment is generally supportive, though hyperkalemia can be treated.  Interactions  Amiloride may have important drug-drug interactions when combined with other medications that also increase potassium levels in the blood, leading to hyperkalemia. For example, the combination of amiloride with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like lisinopril, or angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonists like losartan, may lead to high levels of potassium in the blood, requiring frequent monitoring. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Diuresis Amiloride works by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with an IC50 around 0.1 μM, indicating potent blockade. Antagonism of ENaC thereby inhibits sodium reabsorption in the late distal convoluted tubules, connecting tubules, and collecting ducts in the nephron. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, and reduces potassium excretion. The drug is often used in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic to counteract with a potassium-losing effect. Due to its potassium- sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium concentration in the blood) can occur. The risk of developing hyperkalemia is increased in patients who are also taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, other potassium-sparing diuretics, or any potassium-containing supplements. Miscellaneous A fraction of the effects of amiloride is inhibition of cyclic GMP-gated cation channels in the inner medullary collecting duct. page 875 Amiloride has a second action on the heart, blocking Na+/H+ exchangers sodium–hydrogen antiporter 1 or NHE-1. This minimizes re-perfusion injury in ischemic attacks. Amiloride also blocks the Na+/H+ antiporter on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells in the nephron, abolishing more than 80% of the action of angiotensin II on the secretion of hydrogen ions in proximal tubule cells. Note that amiloride is not an angiotensin II receptor blocker (like losartan, for example). The Na-H transporter is also found in the Jejunum of the small intestine, as a result, amiloride also blocks the reabsoprtion of Na, and thereby water in the intestines. Amiloride is considered to be a reversible, pan-acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) inhibitor that prevents the transient flow of ions but not the sustained flow of ions. ASICs are members of the ENaC family of protein channels, and are found in the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, and the skin. Broadly, ASICs are involved in harm detection, chemosensation (pH changes specifically), and touch. =Pharmacokinetics= Absorption Amiloride has an oral bioavailability of 50%, meaning that about 50% of an oral dose is absorbed into the blood stream. Coadministration with food reduces the amount of amiloride that is absorbed by the body by about 30%, though it does not affect the rate of absorption. However, taking amiloride with food helps to reduce the incidence of its gastrointestinal side effects. After being taken, amiloride's diuretic effect occurs within 2 hours, with peak diuresis within 6–10 hours. The diuretic effects of amiloride persist for about 24 hours after administration. Distribution Amiloride cross the placenta and distributes into breast milk in vivo. Metabolism Amiloride is not metabolized by the liver. In comparison, the ENaC inhibitor triamterene is metabolized by the liver. Excretion About 50% of amiloride is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, while around 40% is excreted in the feces (likely drug that wasn't absorbed). The half-life of amiloride in humans is between 6 and 9 hours, which may be prolonged in people with poor kidney function. =Pharmacogenomics= A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein NEDD4L may impact how amiloride affects a person's blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. Chemistry A photograph of pure amiloride HCl powder. Amiloride's chemical structure is composed of a substituted pyrazine ring structure with a carbonylguanidinium substituent. Amiloride's pKa is 8.67, which is due to the guanidinium group. In high pH (alkaline, low hydrogen concentration) environments, the guanidinium group is deprotonated and the compound is rendered neutral, depleting its activity on sodium channels. Amiloride, as a pure substance, is highly fluorescent, with excitation wavelengths at 215, 288, and 360 nm, emitting light at 420 nm. Light at wavelength 420nm. This is the emission wavelength for light due to amiloride fluorescence. History Amiloride was first synthesized and discovered by the Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories in the late 1960s. The drug was discovered as part of a screening process of chemicals that reversed the effects of mineralocorticoids in vivo. Amiloride was the only drug in the screen that was capable of causing the excretion of sodium (natriuresis) without a concomitant urinary excretion of potassium (kaliuresis). Thousands of amiloride analogues have been studied since its initial discovery, which have been used to study the effects of sodium transporters. Amiloride was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 5, 1981. Society and culture It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United States the wholesale price of a month's supply at the usual daily dose of the medication is about US$20.10. In the United Kingdom a month of medication costs the NHS about £24. Amiloride is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances, as it is considered a masking agent. Diuretics like amiloride act as masking agents by reducing the concentration of other doping agents due to promoting diuresis, increasing the total volume of the urine. The list includes other potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene and spironolactone. In 2008, amiloride and the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene were found in 3% of positive diuretic doping samples. =Formulations and trade names= * Amiloride hydrochloride ** Midamor (U.S.) * Co-amilozide (amiloride hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide) * Co-amilofruse (amiloride hydrochloride with furosemide) * Amiloride hydrochloride with cyclopenthiazide * Amiloride hydrochloride with bumetanide Research Amiloride is an inhibitor of NHE-1, which helps to maintain normal pH within cells. Cancer cells in leukemia, a type of blood cancer, have higher pH compared to normal cells. Amiloride affects the splicing and regulation of multiple genes involved in cancer, though they do not appear to be directly related to its effects on pH. Amiloride has been tested in vitro as an adjunct to the anticancer drug imatinib, which appeared to show a synergistic effect. Modified versions of amiloride, known as 5'-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA), are being studied for the treatment of leukemia. Amiloride and analogues 5'-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA). Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder due to a mutation in the CFTR gene, which encodes for the CFTR chloride channel. There is evidence that suggests that the molecular target of amiloride, ENaC, is also implicated in cystic fibrosis due to its effects on mucus in the lungs. Aerosolized formulations of amiloride have been tested in clinical trials, though long-term clinical trials have failed to show much utility. Due to its short duration of action, it was thought that longer-acting ENaC inhibitors may prove more effective. However, longer-acting ENaC inhibitors (i.e. benzamil) have also failed clinical trials, despite an improvement in both the solubility and potency of the drugs. A third generation amiloride analogue (N-(3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2-carbonyl)-N'-4-[4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)phenyl]butyl- guanidine methanesulfonate, research name \\"552-02\\"), with better pharmacokinetic properties, is being studied. Side-by-side comparison of the chemical structures of amiloride and one of its analogues, research name 552-02 (N-(3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2-carbonyl)-N'-4-[4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)phenyl]butyl- guanidine methanesulfonate). Pain induced by exposure to acid is attenuated by amiloride in human trials, which may indicate a role for amiloride in the treatment of pain in the future.

In the book, Tom and Hester stumble across the ice raft of Anchorage. Synopsis =Setting= Predator's Gold is set two years after Mortal Engines. In that time, lovers Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw have been using the Jenny Haniver, their deceased comrade Anna Fang's airship, to travel across the world trading and adventuring. =Plot summary= Tom and Hester meet adventurer and author Nimrod Pennyroyal aboard Airhaven, who persuades them to take him as a passenger. They are soon pursued by airships of the Green Storm, a fanatical splinter group of the Anti-Traction League, who want the Jenny Haniver as they believe it was stolen from their deceased leader and friend to Tom and Hester, Anna Fang. Despite evading the airships, the Jenny Haniver is damaged and drifts helplessly over the Ice Wastes. They are rescued by Anchorage, which was once a thriving Traction City that relied primarily upon trade, but had recently been devastated by an excavated biological weapon that killed most of the inhabitants. The survivors have set a course for North America, which is believed to be a radioactive wasteland since the Sixty Minute War. The city is ruled by the young margravine Freya Rasmussen, who treats all three of them as honoured guests and appoints Pennyroyal as the city's chief navigator because of his past experiences (detailed in his book America the Beautiful) traveling in America. As Anchorage's harbormaster works to repair the Jenny Haniver, Hester becomes jealous of Tom's growing closeness to Freya, and is also disturbed by the sightings of \\"ghosts\\" in the city. Eventually she sees Tom kissing Freya, and flies away from the city in the Jenny Haniver. Thereafter, Hester sells Anchorage's course to Piotr Masgard, the leader of the \\"Huntsmen\\" of the Traction City of Arkangel, who intends to capture the city through an airship invasion; rather than accepting money as payment for this information, she insists that when Arkangel eats Anchorage, Tom be returned to her. As she returns to the Jenny Haniver, however, she is drugged and kidnapped by a Green Storm informant. Hester is taken to Rogue's Roost, an island south of Greenland, where the Green Storm have converted Anna Fang's body into a Stalker. The commander, Sathya, hopes to restore Fang's memories by showing her Hester, but the resurrected Fang doesn't recognise her nor herself. Sathya reveals that, according to her intelligence, Hester's father was Thaddeus Valentine. Tom realizes that Pennyroyal never went to America, and based his entire book on an old explorer's map in the Reykjavík library. On his way to reveal Pennyroyal's deception to the chief engineer, Tom finds out that the \\"ghosts\\" sighted around Anchorage are thieves, operating out of a parasitic submarine-like limpet attached to the bottom of the city, who call themselves the Lost Boys and work out of a larger group in the sunken city of Grimsby. With their secret discovered, they kidnap Tom and leave the city. Tom develops a sort of friendship with a reluctant Lost Boy, Caul, on their trip to Grimsby. Caul tells him that the city is ruled by \\"Uncle\\", a man who founded it as a base of thieves and keeps the Lost Boys under constant surveillance. When they arrive in Grimsby, Tom is taken to see Uncle, who tells him there is something valuable in Rogues' Roost which he wants Tom to steal for him. In return, Tom will have the chance to rescue Hester. Tom climbs a ladder up the rocky cliffs to infiltrate the base, but he is soon discovered and reunited with Hester in her cell. Realising that Uncle sent Tom to die as a diversion, Caul prematurely detonates the charges the Lost Boys were positioning inside the Roost, sabotaging the operation, but saving Tom and Hester. In the confusion, most of the Lost Boys make their way to the chamber where the Stalker Fang is kept, but the Stalker easily kills them all. She then pursues Tom and Hester into the island hangar where the Jenny Haniver is kept, but lets them escape when she seemingly recognises Tom, and then takes command of the Green Storm forces from Sathya. In Grimsby, after Uncle severely beats Caul for his betrayal, then leaves him to die by hanging, and informs the younger man that he knew Anna Fang when he was younger. Fang was a slave in Arkangel, but Uncle began to love her and released her. She betrayed him by building an airship and escaping from slavery. After Uncle was disowned by his family, he built Grimsby to make sure that nobody kept a secret from him ever again. Uncle wanted to retrieve Fang from Rogue's Roost to reprogram her to become his slave. Caul is saved by fellow Lost Boy Gargle, who wanted to repay Caul's kindness to him. Gargle gives Caul the Reykjavik map that Uncle had all along, and sends him back to Anchorage on a limpet. Freya catches Pennyroyal secretly broadcasting a radio message asking for someone to come and get him off of Anchorage, and he subsequently admits to her that his claims of traveling to America were all lies. Arkangel chases Anchorage, leading to the Huntsmen led by Masgard capturing Anchorage and leaving it helpless on the ice to be eaten. Tom and Hester return to the city, where Pennyroyal has evaded capture. Hester sends Tom to hide, and later liberates the inhabitants, killing Masgard and the Hunstmen in the process. Tom confronts Pennyroyal, who knows that Hester sold Anchorage to Masgard, but doesn't tell Tom. Attempting to scare Tom off, Pennyroyal accidentally shoots Tom in the chest. He then steals the Jenny Haniver and escapes. Arkangel still pursues Anchorage, but becomes trapped over thin ice, leading Anchorage to drift on the ocean on an ice floe. With the revelation that Pennyroyal is a fraud, the inhabitants lose hope in the salvation of their city, until Caul arrives with the Reykjavik map, and convinces them to continue. Meanwhile, Pennyroyal escapes to the Hunting Ground, and soon publishes a book reimagining the events of Anchorage's flight west, with himself as the hero and exposing the Lost Boys. Arkangel is evacuated and eventually sinks to the bottom of the ocean. In Asia, the Green Storm, under the leadership of the Stalker Fang, topples the old Anti-Traction League.

It acts as a nicotinic antagonist and noncompetitive NMDA antagonist. The antiviral mechanism of action is antagonism of the influenzavirus A M2 proton channel, which prevents viral shedding.  Chemical structure  Amantadine (brand names Gocovri, Symadine, and Symmetrel) is the organic compound 1-adamantylamine or 1-aminoadamantane, which consists of an adamantane backbone with an amino group substituted at one of the four methyne positions. Rimantadine is a closely related adamantane derivative with similar biological properties; both target the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus. Medical uses =Parkinson's disease= Amantadine is used to treat Parkinson's disease-related dyskinesia and drug-induced parkinsonism syndromes. Amantadine may be used alone or combined with another anti- parkinson or anticholinergic drug. The specific symptoms targeted by amantadine therapy are dyskinesia and rigidity. Levodopa and amantadine is a common combination. A 2003 Cochrane review concluded evidence inadequately proved the safety or efficacy of amantadine to treat dyskinesia. The World Health Organization in 2008, reported amantadine is not effective as a stand- alone parkinsonian therapy. Amantadine was recommended for combination therapy with levodopa. =Influenza A= Amantadine is no longer recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A in the United States. Amantadine has no effect preventing or treating influenza B infections. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples were resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantidine) during the 2008–2009 flu season.CDC weekly influenza report – week 35, cdc.gov The CDC guidelines updated to recommend only neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza treatment and prophylaxis. The CDC currently recommends against amantadine and rimantadine to treat influenza A infections. Similarly, the 2011 World Health Organization virology report showed all tested H1N1 influenza A viruses were resistant to amantadine. Current WHO guidelines recommend against use of M2 inhibitors for influenza A. The continued high rate of resistance observed in laboratory testing of influenza A has reduced the priority of M2 resistance testing until further notice. A 2014 Cochrane review did not find evidence for efficacy or safety of amantadine used for the prevention or treatment of influenza A. = Extra-pyramidal side effects = An extended release formulation is used to treat dyskinesia, a side effect of levodopa which is taken by people who have Parkinson's disease. WHO recommendations are for amantadine as a combination therapy to reduce levodopa side effects. = Off-label uses = Fatigue in multiple sclerosis Amantadine also seems to have moderate effects on multiple sclerosis (MS) related fatigue. Awareness and consciousness in patients in a vegetative state Awakening with amantadine from a persistent vegetative state after subarachnoid haemorrhage In one case, a 36-year-old woman had a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and was in a persistent vegetative state. Under a treatment of amantadine, and nine months after the disease onset, the patient improved 5 points on the coma recovery scale, and was able to communicate adequately in two to six-word sentences.https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220305#ref-8  Contraindications  Amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end stage renal disease. The drug is renally cleared. Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated while taking amantadine. It is possible that amantadine will inhibit viral replication and reduce the efficacy of administered vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding amantadine for two weeks prior to vaccine administration and 48 hours afterwards. Adverse effects Amantadine has been associated with several central nervous system (CNS) side effects. About 10% or more of patients may experience falls, dizziness, and hallucinations. Other side effects may include constipation or dry mouth. Serious side effects may include drowsiness (especially while driving), depression, new or worsened hallucinations, inhibited actions (gambling, sexual activity, spending, other addictions) and diminished control over compulsions, and light headedness, falls, and hypotension (low blood pressure). Rare cases of severe skin rashes, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and of suicidal ideation have also been reported in patients treated with amantadine. Livedo reticularis is a rare possible side effect of amantadine use for Parkinson's disease. Mechanism of action =Parkinson's disease= The mechanism of its antiparkinsonian effect is poorly understood. Amantadine appears to be a weak antagonist of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake. Amantadine probably does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme. Moreover, the drug has many effects in the brain, including release of dopamine and norepinephrine from nerve endings. It appears to be an anticholinergic (specifically at alpha-7 nicotinic receptors) like the similar pharmaceutical memantine. In 2004, it was discovered that amantadine and memantine bind to and act as agonists of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 7.44 μM and 2.60 μM, respectively), and that activation of the σ1 receptor is involved in the dopaminergic effects of amantadine at therapeutically relevant concentrations. These findings may also extend to the other adamantanes such as adapromine, rimantadine, and bromantane, and could explain the psychostimulant-like effects of this family of compounds. =Influenza= Model of amantadine (red) inhibiting influenza A M2 protein (blue). The mechanisms for amantadine's antiviral and antiparkinsonian effects are unrelated. Amantadine targets the influenza A M2 ion channel protein. The M2 protein's function is to allow the intracellular virus to replicate (M2 also functions as a proton channel for hydrogen ions to cross into the vesicle), and exocytose newly formed viral proteins to the extracellular space (viral shedding). By blocking the M2 channel, the virus is unable to replicate because of impaired replication, protein synthesis, and exocytosis. Amantadine and rimantadine function in a mechanistically identical fashion, entering the barrel of the tetrameric M2 channel and blocking pore function—i.e., proton translocation. Resistance to the drug class is a consequence of mutations to the pore-lining residues of the channel, preventing both amantadine and rimantadine from inhibiting the channel in their usual way. Model of viral replication. Influenza B strains possess a structurally distinct M2 channel with channel-facing side chains that fully obstruct the channel vis-à-vis binding of adamantine-class channel inhibitors, while still allowing proton flow and channel function to occur; this constriction in the channels is responsible for the ineffectiveness of this drug and rimantadine towards all circulating Influenza B strains.  Interactions  Amantadine may affect the central nervous system due to dopaminergic and anticholinergic properties. The mechanisms of action are not fully known. Because of the CNS effects, caution is required when prescribing additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Certain drugs increase the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of déjà vu. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001) reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet- Bourgin, Chauvel, & Halgren, 1994), Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain. History It was first used in the FRG in 1966. Amantadine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 1968, as a prophylactic agent against Asian influenza. Amantadine trial experiments exposed volunteer college students to a viral challenge. The group that received amantadine (100 milligrams 18 hours before viral challenge) had less Asia influenza infections than the placebo group. Amantadine received approval for the treatment of influenza virus A in adults in 1976. An incidental finding in 1969 prompted investigations about amantadine's effectiveness for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A woman with Parkinson's disease was prescribed amantadine to treat her influenza infection and reported her cogwheel rigidity and tremors improved. She also reported that her symptoms worsened after she finished the course of amantadine. The published case report was not initially corroborated by any other instances by the medical literature or manufacturer data. A team of researchers looked at a group of ten patients with Parkinson's disease and gave them amantadine. Seven of the ten patients showed improvement, which was convincing evidence for the need of a clinical trial. The 1969 trial (lead author Robert S. Schwab, MD) included 163 patients with Parkinson's disease and 66% experienced subjective or objective reduction of symptoms. Additional studies from Schwab's team followed patients for greater lengths of time and in different combinations of neurological drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of amantadine in an extended release formulation developed by Adamas Pharma for the treatment of dyskinesia, an adverse effect of levodopa, that people with Parkinson's experience. Veterinary misuse In 2005, Chinese poultry farmers were reported to have used amantadine to protect birds against avian influenza. In Western countries and according to international livestock regulations, amantadine is approved only for use in humans. Chickens in China have received an estimated 2.6 billion doses of amantadine. Avian flu (H5N1) strains in China and southeast Asia are now resistant to amantadine, although strains circulating elsewhere still seem to be sensitive. If amantadine-resistant strains of the virus spread, the drugs of choice in an avian flu outbreak will probably be restricted to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir which block the action of viral neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of influenza virus particles. However, there is an increasing incidence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating influenza strains (e.g., H1N1), highlighting the serious need for the development of new anti-influenza therapies. In September 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the recall of Dingo Chip Twists \\"Chicken in the Middle\\" dog treats because the product has the potential to be contaminated with amantadine.

Paolo Quagliati (c. 1555 - 16 November 1628) was an Italian composer of the early Baroque era and a member of the Roman School of composers. He was a transitional figure between the late Renaissance style and the earliest Baroque and was one of the first to write solo madrigals in the conservative musical center of Rome. Life Quagliati was born in Chioggia to an aristocratic family. Most of his life he spent in the service of various royal and aristocratic families. In 1594 he became a Roman citizen, and between 1605 and 1608 Quagliati was employed by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese. Most likely he was organist at Santa Maria Maggiore from around 1608 until his death. During that time he also served as organist for various formal occasions around the city, and eventually he became private chamberlain to Pope Gregory XV. Towards the end of his life he was much respected, if not renowned, by his fellow composers, as can be judged from dedications of collections of music to him; however, some of this may have been less due to the quality of his music than to his direct papal connections and immense influence. Works and style Stylistically, Quagliati's music is clear, elegant, and he generally uses simple diatonic harmonies. Some of his books of madrigals are in two versions: one for singing by equal voice parts, in the old Renaissance style, and another in what he calls the \\"empty\\" style, for single voice with instrumental accompaniment. These were examples of the new Baroque style of monody, and he states as much in the preface to his 1608 publication: \\"I have decided to cater to both tastes.\\" Quagliati was probably the first to publish solo madrigals in Rome, though monody in the form of solo madrigals had already existed for more than twenty years in northern Italy. He wrote both sacred and secular vocal music, as well as some instrumental music. In his instrumental music, he makes little or no distinction between the style assigned to pieces with certain labels, such as ricercars or canzonas; this was an occasional practice at the time, and quite an annoying one to musicologists attempting to categorize music during this transitional period. Conventionally, a canzona around 1600 was a sectional instrumental piece, while a \\"ricercar\\" was a rather severe contrapuntal study, one of the ancestors of the fugue; the work of a few composers such as Quagliati make it necessary to qualify these terms as of imprecise usage. In 1606 he composed Il carro di fedeltà d'amore, which is considered the first secular 'azione scenica'«Una delle prime azioni (per dir così) rappresentate in musica che in Roma si siano sentite».These words were used by Pietro della Valle, the author of the verses. See also: Pietro della Valle, Della musica dell’età nostra che non è punto inferiore, anzi è migliore di quella dell’età passata (16 genn. 1640), in G. B. Doni, Trattati di musica, Gori, Firenze, 1763, in ANGELO SOLERTI, «L’origine del melodramma», Bocca, Torino, 1903, p. 155 in Rome. Of his surviving larger-scale works, one of the most interesting is La sfera armoniosa, which includes no less than 25 separate sections, including vocal solos and duets, all with an accompanying violin part. Much is written in the concertato style imported from northern Italy, though it would have seemed tame to a Venetian composer. He wrote this large work for the wedding of the nephew of the pope to Isabella Gesualdo, daughter of the famously murderous composer Carlo Gesualdo.

Ellis. The screenplay was written by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, based on a story by Gruber, Bress, and series creator Jeffrey Reddick. It is the sequel to the 2000 film Final Destination and the second installment of the Final Destination film series. The film stars Ali Larter, A. J. Cook, and Michael Landes. After the financial success of Final Destination, New Line Cinema contacted Reddick regarding plans for a sequel. Since the original film's crew was unavailable, New Line replaced most of the production team. Filming took place in Vancouver and Okanagan Lake. Final Destination 2 was released on January 31, 2003, and on DVD on July 22, 2003, which includes commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries, and videos. The film received mixed reviews from critics; in which negative assessments sorted the film as \\"silly and illogical\\" and \\"begins with the same flawed premise\\" of its precursor, while positive evaluations eulogized the film as \\"a real jolter for horror fans\\", \\"recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter\\", and \\"surprisingly good fun for the current crop of horror films\\". The film grossed $46 million domestically and $43 million overseas, earning $90 million internationally, making it the lowest-grossing film in the Final Destination franchise. It was also nominated for four awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film. A third film, Final Destination 3, was released in February 2006. Plot Exactly one year after the explosion of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. While waiting on the entrance ramp to Route 23, she has a premonition of a deadly pileup caused by a logging truck. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis, mother Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim, businesswoman Kat Jennings, stoner Rory Peters, pregnant Isabella Hudson, high school teacher Eugene Dix, and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Burke questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs, but Shaina, Dano, and Frankie are killed by a car carrier after Burke saves Kimberly at the last second. After the survivors are questioned at the police station, Evan is fatally impaled by a fire escape ladder while attempting to escape from a fire in his apartment. Aware of Death's presence, Kimberly seeks help from Clear Rivers, the last survivor of Flight 180 who committed herself to a psychiatric ward for protection after Alex Browning was killed by a falling brick. When Kimberly informs Clear that Evan was the first of the highway survivors to die, unlike in her premonition, Clear realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse order. Meanwhile, Tim is crushed by a windowpane while leaving the dentist with his mother. Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly and Burke to William Bludworth, who tells them that only new life can defeat Death. Believing that the birth of Isabella's baby would foil Death's plan, Burke sends fellow marshal Steve Adams to take her into custody while he gathers the other survivors in his apartment and explains Death's plan to them. When Nora attempts to leave via an elevator, a chain of accidents results in her head becoming trapped in the doors, and she is decapitated. The survivors take Kat's SUV to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor, prompting Adams to rush her to the hospital. Along the way, the survivors realize that the demises of the Flight 180 survivors affected all of their lives even before the highway pileup by saving them from prior deaths, which explains why Death is working backwards this time. The SUV then suffers a blowout, causing them to swerve into a stack of PVC pipes in a farm that penetrate the car and injure Eugene. Rescue workers arrive and assist the farm owners, the Gibbons family, with rescuing the others while Eugene is hospitalized. Using the Jaws of Life, Kat's rescuer accidentally activates her airbag, causing her head to be impaled on a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls onto a gasoline leak from a news van that explodes, launching a barbed wire fence into the air that dismembers Rory. Guided by a vision of a doctor named Kalarjian who Kimberly believes will euthanize Isabella, Kimberly, Clear, and Burke rush to a hospital to save her, only to find Isabella and her baby unharmed. However, an explosion from an oxygen leak in Eugene's ward kills both Clear and Eugene. Kimberly realizes that Isabella was never meant to die at all, deducing that her visions of 'Isabella' were actually of herself. Kimberly remembers that only the creation of a 'new life' can defeat Death. She drives into a lake to drown herself, but is defibrillated and revived by Dr. Kalarjian, creating 'new life'. Later, Kimberly and Burke have a picnic with the Gibbons and Kimberly's father. The Gibbonses explain that their son Brian was nearly hit by a news van after Rory saved him earlier. As a result, they witness Brian suddenly die in an explosion caused by a malfunctioning barbecue grill. Cast *Ali Larter as Clear Rivers *A.J.

The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he \\"wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.\\" Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. \\"Second unit is like an extension of directing, you're doing big action sequences on film and it was just something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, it was kind of a natural transition,\\" Ellis professed. \\"I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it,\\" Ellis added. \\"We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!\\" Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film. =Casting= A screenshot from the film showing the main cast (from left to right) A.J. Cook as Kimberly Corman, James Kirk as Tim Carpenter, Lynda Boyd as Nora Carpenter, Michael Landes as Officer Thomas Burke, Jonathan Cherry as Rory Peters, Terrence C. Carson as Eugene Dix, and Keegan Connor Tracy as Kat Jennings. Absent from the cast shot are Ali Larter as Clear Rivers and David Paetkau as Evan Lewis. The protagonist of the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed off-screen in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved the issue with the statement that \\"it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon's unwillingness to come back.\\" Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. \\"When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific,\\" Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear \\"[has] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her.\\" Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. \\"It's the same character that we saw before that the audience loved,\\" Ellis expressed. The role of Kimberly Corman was given to Canadian actress A.J. Cook, who previously starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides. Cook described her role as \\"a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, right in front of her eyes, so she had to grow up quick.\\" Ellis described her role as \\"a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear.\\" Cook added that \\"it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [Larter].\\" Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. \\"[We] were at the beginning of what's going to be a long successful career for her,\\" Perry cited. Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as \\"a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [and] who is very intrigued to begin with\\" and as \\"the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector.\\" Ellis pointed out that he \\"just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [Landes] brought this really good balance to his part.\\" Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments. Former Living Single star T. C. Carson was hired as Eugene Dix. Carson identified his role as \\"a very by- the-book type of person but soon has a change of heart as the corpses begin to pile up.\\" The crew was enticed of Carson's casting, with Bress mentioning how his \\"originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It's got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he's just such a great presence.\\" Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson \\"can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice.\\" Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as \\"a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'\\" In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since \\"he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that.\\" Bress bragged that \\"Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'\\" \\"What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share,\\" Perry appended. Blackwoods actress Keegan Connor Tracy played Kat Jennings. Tracy claimed that \\"[Kat] doesn't really buy it at first, but pretty soon even her cynical attitude can't ignore the truth of the situation they're all in.\\" Perry defined the role as \\"someone who is really so self-absorbed that without being overly malicious is incredibly rude and insensitive to the feelings of all those around her.\\" Her casting was assessed by Perry as \\"full of energy\\" and \\"embodies the self-aware nervous energy of Kat. [Tracy] created a character that you kind of dislike intensely but you don't dislike so much that you don't understand why she is the way she is.\\" Rounding up the cast are Lynda Boyd (Rachel Todd in You, Me and the Kids) as widow Nora Carpenter and James Kirk (Kyle Morgan in Once Upon a Christmas) as her son Tim Carpenter, David Paetkau (Hunter Kerrigan in Just Deal) as gambler Evan Lewis, Justina Machado (Vanessa Diaz in Six Feet Under) as pregnant Isabella Hudson, and Noel Fisher (Todd Tolanski of X-Men: Evolution) as farmer Brian Gibbons. Novice actors Sarah Carter, Alejandro Rae, and Shaun Sipos were hired as Kimberly's friends Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman correspondingly. Andrew Airlie portrayed Kimberly's father Michael Corman, while Enid-Raye Adams appeared as Dr. Ellen Kalarjian. alt= =Filming= Like the first film, the film was shot in and around Vancouver Island. \\"We know the arena, we know the people up there and let's be honest, there's an enormous economic incentive to shoot there. We were very fortunate to get [unit production manager] Justis Greene, who's been working as a line producer up there for 30 years and who was able to get us the best crew working in town right now. It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie,\\" Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death. The farm and lake scenes were filmed in Campbell River and Okanagan Lake respectively, though it is depicted in Greenwood Lake, New York. \\"We shot part of it at the lake where it was 37° cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. And the second stuff we shot in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool,\\" Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. \\"My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that,\\" Cook divulged. \\"We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator,\\" Landes enunciated. To avoid confusion with Larter and Carter, Cook was required to dye her hair brown for the role. \\"I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast,\\" Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. \\"It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn't want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn't want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, is a little bit of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there's no real love story,\\" Landes articulated. A montage of the process in rendering the death scene of Rory (Cherry). In the first image, a wide-angle view of Campbell River is shot for background use in the final result. In the second image, a lifecast of Cherry is positioned against a green screen and severed in pieces. In the third image, the first and second image are composited to be presented among the continuity of the film. =Effects= Digital Dimension took charge of the visual effects of the film. CG supervisor Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. \\"They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG,\\" Crosby indicated. \\"It began with R&D; on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role.\\" Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also used for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered. In spite of this, there are no CG cars incorporated in the actual film. \\"It was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but when they were done shooting they didn't end up needing any CG cars,\\" Crosby avowed. Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting. Landes experienced claustrophobia during the procedure. Fake blood was also used, but CG blood was also shown. =Music= Soundtrack Like its predecessor, no official album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs featured in the film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) and I Got You by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory's party). Score Final Destination 2: Original Motion Picture Score was the promotional film score conducted by Daytime Emmy-winning composer Shirley Walker. Though it was not officially released, it was made available alongside Willard: The Original Motion Picture Score on September 30, 2003. The score received positive reviews among commentators. Robert Koehler of Variety applauded that \\"Shirley Walker's score displays a thorough understanding of horror jolts.\\" Pete Roberts of DVDActive admired the score as \\"top notch.\\" Anthony Horan of DVD.net Australia told readers to \\"crank up the volume and prepare for a sonic feast\\". Nonetheless, Chris Carle of IGN Movies noted that \\"while the score is nothing you'll remember, it gets the job done.\\" Release =Box office= The film premiered in 2,834 theaters across the United States and Canada on January 31, 2003, earning $16,017,141 in its opening weekend with an average of $5,651 per theater.

Deleted scenes are a cross-examination with Isabella's husband Marcus Hudson (Roger Cross), a conversation between Eugene and Nora, a car chase concerning Kimberly's reckless driving, and Eugene's meeting with Death at the hospital, and extended versions of Kimberly's interrogation at the police station and the encounter with Bludworth. The first documentary labelled Bits & Pieces: Bringing Life To Death runs for 30 minutes and recalls the history of splatter film, on top of accounts in relation to the visual effects of the film. The second documentary entitled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back progresses for 18 minutes and brings out people recounting their own real-life experiences with death. The Terror Gauge, the third documentary, is a test screening system of the film in which viewers are subjected to biofeedback and neurological examination under neurophysiologist Dr. Victoria Ibric.

This DVD was released under New Line's Infinifilm DVD Library Reception =Critical response= Analogous to its forerunner, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 48% of critics gave the film positive write- ups based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's consensus of opinion is that \\"This sequel is little more than an excuse to stage elaborate, gory scenes of characters getting killed off.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds an average score of 38 based on 25 reviews. On June 14, 2010, Nick Hyman of Metacritic included Final Destination 2 in the website's editorial 15 Movies the Critics Got Wrong, denoting that \\"the elaborate suspense/action set pieces from the first two films are more impressive than most.\\" Negative evaluations condemned the film's plot, acting, and screenplay. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times groused that \\"perhaps movies are like history, and repeat themselves, first as tragedy, then as farce.\\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews stressed that \\"the movie mandates complete gullibility and vacuous attention in order to work on any level.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today groused on how that \\"there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths is troubling enough, but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [which] simply provokes disgust.\\" Justine Elias of The Village Voice asserted that \\"this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders.\\" David Grove of Film Threat stated that \\"[he] wasn't much scared by anything in Final Destination 2 which is silly and illogical.\\" Jeff Vice of Deseret News censured to \\"not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances\\"; while Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly reviled \\"everything else about the film is also deadly.\\" Conversely, other columnists applauded the film's comedic theme. A. O. Scott of The New York Times imparted \\"it's not as cheekily knowing as the Scream movies or as trashily Grand Guignol as the Evil Dead franchise, but like those pictures it recognizes the close relationship between fright and laughter, and dispenses both with a free, unpretentious hand.\\" C. W. Nevius of San Francisco Chronicle conveyed its \\"funnier than the original.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide pronounced \\"if this is your idea of fun, step right up.\\" William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found it as \\"a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs.\\" Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle admired how \\"it is surprisingly good fun for the current crop of horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. That said, it's most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended.\\" Nev Pierce of BBC saw that \\"it's simple, but effective\\"; whereas Sheila Norman-Culp of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution proclaimed that \\"what Final Destination did for the fear of flying, Final Destination 2 does for the fear of driving.\\" Amongst the cast ensemble, Carson, Cherry, Cook, Landes, Larter, and Todd were prominent amidst the analysis for their performances as Eugene, Rory, Kimberly, Thomas, Clear, and Bludworth respectively. Koehler of Variety said that \\"Carson as skeptical Eugene energizes what had been a rote conception on the page\\"; \\"Cherry offered some dry comic balance\\"; Larter was \\"casted little light\\"; Todd was squandered by his \\"single, distinctly flat scene\\"; and \\"the generally awful thesping, led by Cook, whose blurry grasp of emotions betrays Ellis' apparent disinterest in his actors.\\" Grove of Film Threat panned Cook, uttering that \\"she's no great actress, but she's a real looker\\" and teased that \\"since when did a horror movie suffer from having two dumb blondes as leads\\", the other actress referring to Larter, whom \\"spends the whole movie looking miserable with her frigid acting.\\" Dustin Putman of TheMovieBoy.com commented how \\"Cook is serviceable as the premonition-fueled Kimberly, but doesn't evoke enough emotion in the scenes following the brutal deaths of her close friends.\\" Robin Clifford of Reeling Reviews stated that \\"Cook was strident as the catalyst that sparks events with her premonitions of disaster and her fervent desire to cheat the Reaper\\" whereas Larter was \\"giving the smart-ass edge her character needs\\"; while Brett Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Larter \\"is again the bright spot\\", along with Cook and Landes who were \\"serviceable as leads\\" and Todd \\"whose purpose has still yet to be revealed in the franchise.\\" A screenshot from the film depicting the fictional pileup along Route 23 on May 13, 2001. This sequence was regarded as the \\"greatest car crash scene in movie history\\" and was nominated with a MTV Movie Award for Best Action Sequence in 2003. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. =Accolades= Like its predecessor, the film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film in 2004, as well as Choice Movie - Horror/Thriller in the 2003 Teen Choice Awards; likewise, the awards lost to 28 Days Later and The Ring, respectively. In the 4th Golden Trailer Awards, it was voted for the Golden Fleece, but lost to the surfer film Blue Crush. Furthermore, the Collision on Highway 23 was nominated for Best Action Sequence at the MTV Movie Awards in 2003, but lost it to the Battle for Helm's Deep of the fantasy film The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, another New Line film. The highway scene was regarded by Grove of Film Threat as \\"a monument to smashed cars, flying objects and scorched metal\\" and Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons as \\"utterly spectacular.\\" Anne Billson of Guardian.co.uk exclaimed it as \\"one of the most terrifying sequences I've ever seen, all the more effective for being grounded in reality; few drivers haven't felt that anxious twinge as the badly secured load on the lorry in front of them starts to wobble.\\" The Route 23 pileup scene was included in the lists of best car crashes or disaster scenes by Screen Junkies, Made Man, Unreality Magazine, All Left Turns, Chillopedia, Filmstalker, io9, UGO Entertainment, Filmcritic.com, and New York Magazine. Filmsite.org enlisted all fatalities in its Best Film Deaths Scenes. The demise of Kirk's character entered these listings of the most shocking deaths on film: George Wales of Total Film (#28), James Eldred of Bullz-Eye.com (#20), and Jeff Otto of Bloody Disgusting (#9).

It was designed by the Glenn L. Martin Company as the Martin Model 190 and was a high-altitude derivative of the company's B-26 Marauder. Two different designs were developed, first as a twin-engined aircraft and then as a four-engined aircraft. The four-engined version was ordered by the United States Army Air Forces, but the program was cancelled before any aircraft were built. Design and development =XB-33= Schematic blueprint drawing of the XB-33. The first version of the B-33 design, the XB-33, was a twin-tailed medium bomber with two Wright R-3350 engines and pressurised crew compartments; its design began in 1940. It would carry around 4,000 lb (1,814 kg) of bombs. Soon after design of the XB-33 began it became clear that a twin-engined aircraft would not achieve the performance requested by the army. The company moved on to developing a larger four-engined design, but the two prototypes ordered by the USAAF were not built. =XB-33A= Following the abandonment of the original twin-engined design, the company continued to design a larger four-engined aircraft, and two prototypes were ordered by the USAAF as the XB-33A; its bombload was to have been 12,000 lb (5,443 kg), as much as that of the B-24 Liberator, the heaviest US bomber flown in combat prior to the B-29. The original XB-33 design was to have been powered by the R-3350, the redesigned XB-33A was to have used Wright R-2600 engines. The main reason for this was the demand for R-3350s for the B-29, one of the most highly valued projects of the Army Air Forces. On January 17, 1942, the USAAF placed an order for 400 B-33As, to be built at the government-owned plant in Omaha, Nebraska, operated by Martin. On November 25, 1942, the project was cancelled to allow the Omaha plant to concentrate on manufacturing B-29s.

The company was formed by an Intergovernmental Agreement for Tasman Sea Air Services (also known as the Tasman Sea Agreement), a treaty signed by the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand in London on 10 April 1940.http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1940/4.html TEAL was first registered in Wellington as a limited liability company on 26 April 1940. The company's purpose was originally to transport mail, passengers and cargo across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, during World War II. The treaty was originally intended to end within three months after hostilities with Germany ended, however was extended in 1949,http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1949/13.html the agreement ended on 31 March 1954,http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1956/12.html with control and ownership passing into normal commercial arrangements. The shares were originally held by the New Zealand government (20%), Union Airways (19%), BOAC (38%) and Qantas (23%). Initial services July 1940 New Zealand airmail censored cover paid 1/6 to Dublin, Ireland, flown from Auckland to Sydney by Tasman Empire Airways service that started on 30 April 1940, and then flown on the Horseshoe route to Durban, South Africa and then by boat to the UK for forwarding to Dublin The inaugural service from Auckland to Sydney on 30 April 1940 was flown by Aotearoa, one of its two Short S30 flying boats. There was a connection at Sydney with the Qantas/BOAC route to Great Britain which meant that there was, for the first time, a regular through air service between New Zealand and Britain. This lasted less than six weeks as, when Italy entered World War II in June 1940, it was no longer possible to fly through the Mediterranean. The TEAL service then provided a connection with the Horseshoe route. The first four months of operation saw a weekly return service between Auckland and Sydney. This was expanded to thrice fortnightly with connections to San Francisco using Pan Am flights from Auckland (Pan Am was not flying into Australia). The connection to San Francisco ended in December 1941 when Japan entered the war. In the first year, the annual report revealed that 130 trans-Tasman flights had been completed carrying 1461 passengers for a profit, prior to tax and dividends, of NZ£31,479. By 1944, the trans-Tasman frequency had increased to three weekly return flights. After World War II shareholding passed to equal ownership by the governments of New Zealand and Australia. Four Short Sandringhams and later Short Solents were acquired, as well as an ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force PBY Catalina for survey flights. Coral Route Solent preserved at MoTaT The Coral Route is one of the most famous routes flown by TEAL. The New Zealand National Airways Corporation had initiated Pacific Island flights flying Douglas DC3 aircraft, from Auckland to Nadi (Fiji), Faleolo (Samoa), Aitutaki and Rarotonga (Cook Islands). These routes were later taken over by TEAL, which wanted to fly to Tahiti, but there was no airstrip at Papeete, so a flying boat was necessary. After completion of a survey flight by a TEAL-operated ex-RNZAF Catalina ZK- AMP in 1951, the Coral Route flight from Auckland to Papeete, Tahiti, via Laucala Bay at Suva, Fiji, Satapuala at Apia, Samoa, and Akaiamai at Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, was inaugurated by TEAL on 27 December 1951, using the Short Solent flying boats long used between Auckland and Sydney. In Samoa, the plane landed on the sea and a small motor boat operated by Fred Fairman would carry the passengers to shore. They would alight and go through customs in a small shed. The Faleolo airport was still a grass strip.Ron Reynolds Interviewed by his daughter Sonya Van Schaijik The Coral Route was born. It became the only air route into Tahiti, with Americans and others from Northern Hemisphere flying by land planes into Nadi in Fiji, making the short hop across to Suva to join the flying boat at Laucala Bay, for its fortnightly flight along the Coral Route, leaving on a Thursday morning for Samoa, alighting on the Satapuala lagoon about 2 p.m. Passengers were driven by cab through Samoan coastal villages to Apia, where they enjoyed respite and dinner at Aggie Grey's hotel until 2 a.m. when they were driven back out to Satapuala for a pre-dawn take-off to the Akaiami lagoon at Aitutaki where they went ashore for breakfast and an optional swim until mid-morning takeoff for Papeete, timed to ensure that arrival was after the end of the siesta period at 2 p.m. After launching ashore and completing Customs, passengers had to wait a further hour while their luggage was sprayed against horticultural pests, a time usually spent by the majority across the road from the Customshouse at Quinn's Bar. In all, a 30-hour leisurely introduction to life in the South Seas which made the Coral Route a legendary travel experience. On Thursday, 15 September 1960 the final Coral Route flight by the Solent Aranui returned to Auckland. It was one of the world's last long-range scheduled international flying boat services. Short Sandringham ZK-AMH RMA Auckland. A conversion of a Short Sunderland III, RAF serial JM715. Operated with TEAL from 1947 to 1950. Preserved and displayed in Southampton at Solent Sky Museum. Latterly Ansett Flying Boat Services VH-BRC Beachcomber, retired in 1981. Short Solent ZK-AMO RMA Aranui is now restored and on display at the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) in Auckland. Other routes From 1940-1950, TEAL operated a single route, from Auckland to Sydney with its Short flying boats; and from 1948-54 contracted an ANA DC-4 to serve Melbourne --Christchurch. From 1950-54 Wellington was also served by flying boat to Sydney. From 1954 with the introduction of the DC-6s, Christchurch--Sydney and Auckland--Sydney were started, with TEAL now operating its own Christchurch-- Melbourne and Auckland--Melbourne services. Services to Brisbane from Auckland and Christchurch followed in 1959; and Wellington resumed international service, at first only to Sydney, in 1960. Meanwhile, the flying boat service to Suva was replaced by DC-6 to Nadi in 1954; and when the last flying boat service closed in 1960, the flight was extended to Pago Pago and Tahiti. In late 1964, the French cancelled TEAL's licence to Tahiti and the Coral Route service terminated at Pago Pago. Air New Zealand were permitted to return to Tahiti in 1967. Fleet TEAL operated both landplanes and flying boats. Short S.30 Empire Class flying-boat The first services were flown by Short S.30 Empire Class flying boats. Between 1939and 1947, TEAL operated two of these. They were given Maori spiritual names, ZK-AMA Serial S886 Aotearoa(land of the long white cloud) and -AMC Serial S994 Awarua(two rivers). A third S.30, S885 ordered by TEAL was diverted to war duties in the North Atlantic and later destroyed. Short S.25 Sandringham Mk IV 'Tasman Class flying-boat' In 1946, TEAL acquired four Short S.25 Sandringham IV 'Tasman Class' flying boats. They were a fully streamlined conversion passenger transport variation of the Short Sunderland. Consideration was given to land plane operations but the government delayed the decision to move to land as the UK government offered generous terms on purchasing new types in development such as the Avro Tudor and Handley Page Hermes. The Sandringhams were given generic names, ZK- AMB Serial ML761 Tasman, -AMD Serial NJ255 Australia, -AME Serial NJ179 New Zealand, and -AMH JM715 Auckland. However they were unsuited for the harsher trans Tasman crossings. They were grounded for six months in 1948 due to engine cooling issues and disposed of at the end of 1949 when a more suitable custom built version of the Short Solent became available. Consolidated Boeing PB2B-1 Catalina TEAL flew two Boeing-built Consolidated PB2B-1 Catalinas from 1947 until 1949. They were loaned from the RNZAF and used as training and survey aircraft. They were registered on the civil aviation list as ZK-AMI and -AMP Maroro(Flying Fish - TEAL's emblem), -AMI was never named. A Solent operated by TEAL Short S.45 Solent Mk IV The replacements for the S.25 were the Short S.45 Solent IV of which TEAL acquired four, ZK-AML Aotearoa II, -AMM Ararangi, -AMN Awatere and -AMO Aranui. TEAL management were hoping to move to land based operations after the unsuccessful operation of the Sandringham. Original plans to operate Douglas DC-4 aircraft from Auckland's Whenuapai joint service airport alongside other overseas international operators. A Buy British policy and support for rebuilding the British aircraft industry forced the airline to continue operating flying boats including an offer to fly the mammoth Saunders-Roe Princess on a subsidized trial basis. This led to a further more exotic proposal to produce a six jet engine powered flying boat, the Saunders-Roe Duchess. This would've give jet speed to an already antiquated mode of air transport. A promise by the New Zealand Government was made that the Solent would be the last water based aircraft the airline would operate ended any thought of future flying boat development in New Zealand. The Solents were delivered during 1949 with one setting a new trans-Tasman crossing record of 5 hours 37 minutes. The Solents continued flying until 1954 with the introduction of the Douglas DC-6 landplanes. However, Solent Aranui based in Fiji continued on the Coral Route until 1960 operating from Suva after TEAL introduced land plane services to Nadi. S.45 Solent Mk III An extra Solent flying boat was purchased from BOAC in 1951 to ease pressure on growing passenger numbers and help with the new Wellington trans Tasman service operating from Evans Bay. ZK-AMQ Aparima remained in TEAL service until 1957, being used as a back up to the Coral Route regular -AMO Aranui based in Suva, Fiji. Douglas DC-6 The Douglas DC-6 was flown by TEAL between 1954 and 1961. Three were transferred to TEAL after the break-up of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines. Re-registered ZK-BGA Aotearoa III, -BGB Arawhata, and -BGC Arahia. They were original \\"short bodied\\" types fitted out with sleeper beds and long range tanks. The aircraft started replacing the flying boats service in May 1954. It meant the transfer of TEAL's Auckland International Airport operations from Mechanics Bay to the shared Whenuapai air force and civilian terminal, where it was to remain until 1965. In September 1956, Douglas ordered the re-skinning of all DC-6 wings. Work was completed on the fleet at Cathy Pacific Airlines' Hong Kong engineering facilities to allow a 2000 lb increase in payload. The land plane finally allowed TEAL to expand operations to Nadi, Fiji and from there directly to Tahiti. It also opened up land plane operations to Melbourne, helping move passengers during the 1956 Olympic Games,and Brisbane. It also ended the leasing of a Trans Australian Airlines DC-4 operating out of Christchurch on behalf of the airline. Wellington's rebuilt Rongotai Airport handled its first DC-6 service just after it re- opened in 1959, ending trans-Tasman flying boat operations from nearby Evans Bay. Originally to be replaced by the Lockheed L-188 Electra in 1960, the DC-6 remained in service due to engineering issues for the Electra, until 1961. They were handed over to the RNZAF to be used as troop transports, remaining in service with the air force until 1970. Lockheed L-188 Electra C The last new type to be operated by TEAL was the Lockheed L.188 Electra. Five of this type were operated between 1959 and 1972 by which time TEAL had changed its name to Air New Zealand. The airline wanted to introduce jet aircraft in the form of the Comet 4 airliner but Australian shareholders insisted on the Lockheed L188 Electra, citing that Qantas, Trans Australian Airlines, Ansett ANA and Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific had ordered the type. This would lower operating costs as all the airlines would be able to share a common parts pool with the Electra. The original three were named Aotearoa IV (ZK-TEA), Atarau (ZK-TEB), and Akaroa (ZK-TEC). In late September 1959, just prior to delivery a series of fatal accidents occurred in the US with the new aircraft. It was discovered that propeller vibration caused a weakening of the wing to engine mountings. The FAA ordered a reduced speed operation for the type until remedial repair works were completed in 1961. A fourth air frame was purchased from Qantas in 1965 to replace the lost air frame of ZK-TEC (see below), it was registered out of sequence as ZK-CLX but carried over the Akaroa name from the previous aircraft. Buy this time TEAL had changed its name to Air New Zealand. The fifth aircraft operated was leased from Qantas in 1970 for a year to operate a joint seat share service to Australia, Qantas titles appeared along the rear of the fuselage. This aircraft used the vacant TEAL allotted ZK-TED registration but remained unnamed. The remaining Electras were sold in 1972 to United States interests. Douglas DC-8 Series 52 On completion of the New Zealand Government's purchase of TEAL's Australian shareholdings in 1961, airline management promptly announced the purchase of pure jet powered aircraft for 1965. This was to coincide with the completion of a new International airport for Auckland and runway lengthening at Christchurch airport. Aircraft of interest included the Boeing 707-100 short bodied version operated by Qantas, Convair CV880, Douglas DC-8, and after some political lobbying by pro-British government interests, Vickers Standard VC-10. An offer by BOAC to lease surplus De Havilland Comet 4s to begin interim jet services immediately was turned down as uneconomical. After intense scrutiny of all types on offer, TEAL management approached the New Zealand Government for funds to purchase an initial three Douglas DC-8 Series 52 longer ranged jet airliners. The request was approved and an order placed in 1962 for delivery in early 1965. The aircraft were duly completed when TEAL announced a change of airline name on 1 April 1965 to Air New Zealand. The first DC-8 was already painted minus titles in anticipation of this. The aircraft never flying in actual TEAL service. After the name change, however, TEAL titles appeared on the tail fin of the new airliners for two years. Lockheed Electra L-188 crash On 27 March 1965, Teal's Lockheed Electra L-188 ZK-TEC Akaroa, crashed during a training flight at Whenuapai. The airline had done the following manoeuvre many times before: the Electra, flying at precisely 140 knots, could be flown over the runway threshold, throttled back to idle to drop almost vertically and land on the runway. As this would never be done on a passenger flight; the reason for the procedure remains a mystery. On board were a captain, a check captain, a flight engineer, a navigator; the airline's industrial personnel officer and an emergency procedures officer standing behind them. As Akaroa's speed dropped below 140 knots the aeroplane landed very heavily, collapsing the landing gear; Akaroa shed wings, engines, tailplane and tail as she skidded off the runway and across the grass towards the control tower. Somehow, the two standing officers stayed standing, the fire extinguishers were turned on and everyone was evacuated through the cockpit windows, with one man burning his hand on the escape rope. TEAL salvaged what they could from the wreck and the remains were quickly pushed into a gully behind the NAC hangars before the public saw them. The crash took place in the early hours of the morning. The training procedure was quickly deleted from TEAL's manuals. TEAL purchased from Qantas a replacement Electra, VH-ECC, after it changed its name to Air New Zealand on 1 April 1965. It took the registration, ZK-CLX. (At the time of the accident, ZK-TEC had its Air New Zealand titles painted on its fuselage in anticipation of the name change). Ownership transfer In April 1961 the Australian government decided to subsidise the wholly Australian-owned Qantas airline and the New Zealand government bought out the Australian government's shareholding, giving New Zealand 100% ownership. The airline changed to Air New Zealand (its present name) on 1 April 1965 at the same time as Douglas DC-8s entered service. TEAL's TE flight code carried over to Air New Zealand, which continued to use it for its international routes until 1989. Then its international flights began using the NZ code that belonged to NAC and had been used for that carrier's domestic flights.

He was one of the foremost figures in the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist revival, along with the evangelist Howell Harris and the hymnist William Williams. For 55 years Daniel Rowland was one of the leading evangelists in Wales.. Curacies Rowland was born in Nantcwnlle, Ceredigion, in either 1713 or 1711. For most of his life he was curate in the parishes of Nantcwnlle and Llangeitho. Following his conversion by Griffith Jones, Llanddowror, in 1735, he became renowned as a preacher and made Llangeitho memorable as a centre for Calvinistic Methodism in Wales. The Anglican Church authorities deprived him of his Nantcwnlle curacy in about 1763, an action which was unpopular with parishioners. Following this, he established a Methodist \\"cause\\" in Llangeitho, and by 1770 was said to be attracting congregations of over a thousand, making it necessary to preach outdoors. This practice became an influence on the English Methodist preacher George Whitefield. Preaching and relationship with Howel Harris Rowland's early preaching gave much attention to God's judgement in his sermons. As he matured in his ministry, he placed more emphasis on the saving work of Jesus on the Cross. His theology and character were seen as more consistent and stable than those of his counterpart Howel Harris, whom he met in 1737. One of the best-known of Rowland's sermons is \\"The Redeemer's Voice\\", which takes as its text a passage from the Book of Revelation. At first Rowland and Harris worked together as leaders of the Methodist revival, but by 1741, they had fallen out, and in 1750 they ceased to cooperate. Family One of Rowland's great-grandchildren was the novelist Anne Adalisa Puddicombe (Allen Raine).

It is in the Ross Dependency. Its melting season is in the summer. Description The glacier receives less than 10 cm of snowfall annually, and is (technically) an ecosystem. Its seasonal melting feeds Lake Hoare to the west and Lake Fryxell to the east. At the north side of its head sit the Hothem Cliffs. History The glacier was discovered and named in the course of the Terra Nova Expedition (1910–1913), under Robert Scott. Charles S. Wright, a Canadian physicist, was a member of the party that explored the area. Antarctic Specially Protected Area An area of about 1 km2 on the eastern side of the glacier is protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.131 because it contains some of the richest plant growth (bryophytes and algae) in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region. It is exceptionally important not only for its ecological and biological values, but also as a reference site for other similar ecosystems. The site comprises sloping ice-free ground with summer ponds and meltwater streams. It is unusual in receiving more consistent water flows than many other parts of the Dry Valleys region, and is sheltered from strong winds by the 20 m high glacier face.

ASIC's role is to regulate company and financial services and enforce laws to protect Australian consumers, investors and creditors. ASIC was established on 1 July 1998 following recommendations from the Wallis Inquiry. ASIC's authority and scope are determined by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. ASIC, which reports to the Treasurer, is responsible for the administration of all or parts of the following legislation: * Corporations Act 2001 * Insurance Contracts Act 1984 * National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 ASIC registers ASIC maintains Australia's company and business name registers, which can be searched online. The types of organisations that can be searched online include companies, registered bodies, foreign companies, associations, managed investment schemes and non-registered entities.ASIC Companies and organisations The information that is available includes current and/or historical information about the organisation, including past addresses, previous directors, and former names, as well as the organisation's unique identification number (ABN, ACN, ARBN, ARSN), type of company or organisation (e.g., proprietary company, limited by shares), date it was registered, the next review date, location of registered office (town or suburb only), and any professional licences or registrations (e.g. an Australian financial services licence or credit licence). History ASIC was originally formed as the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), established on 1 January 1991 by the (then) ASC Act 1989. The purpose of ASC was to unify corporate regulators around Australia by replacing the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Corporate Affairs offices of the states and territories. The corporate regulator became the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) on 1 July 1998, when it also became responsible for consumer protection in superannuation, insurance and deposit taking. It has since gained further responsibilities: in 2002 for credit, the Australian Stock Exchange in 2009, and Chi-X in 2011. Criticisms In 2012, ASIC called for powers to use data which had been intercepted by other intelligence agencies. In recent times ASIC has become the subject of criticism by consumers, consumer advocates and public officials over its inaction and inefficiencies in protecting consumers from large financial institutions. In 2015-2016 ASIC was subject to a class action claim of negligence by persons affected by the Storm Financial collapse for an alleged failure to take action, amounting to malfeasance. However, Justice Gleeson of the Federal Court of Australia struck out the statement of claim of the plaintiffs as being unarguable.. ASIC has not acted against the Financial Ombudsman Service (Australia) (FOS) despite the organisation being exposed as having generated misleading file notes and then attempting to offer them in the discovery phase in a Victorian Supreme Court case. FOS were caught out and exposed by a consumer and ASIC has not acted against FOS. ASIC did commence proceedings against the largest four banks in Australia in 2016 for rigging of Australian benchmark interest rates. However criticism has been leveled against the regulator for failing to take action for over five years. Questions remain about how this will affect consumer civil causes of action against banks involved, given that the statute of limitations tends to be six years in Australia. ASIC has recently become subject of heavy criticism in the debate about whether a Royal Commission into banking and financial services is required. Areas of responsibility ASIC's areas of responsibility include: *corporate governance *financial services *securities and derivatives *insurance *consumer protection *financial literacy. ASIC's consumer website www.moneysmart.gov.au was launched on 15 March 2011. MoneySmart replaced ASIC's two previous consumer websites, FIDO and Understanding Money.

It is formed by the structure known as the Purbeck Monocline. The ridge extends from Lulworth Cove in the west to Old Harry Rocks in the east, where it meets the sea. The hills are part of a system of chalk downlands in southern England formed from the Chalk Group which also includes Salisbury Plain and the South Downs. For most of their length the chalk of the Purbeck Hills is protected from coastal erosion by a band of resistant Portland limestone. Where this band ends, at Durlston Head, the clay and chalk behind has been eroded, creating Poole Bay and the Solent. The ridge of steeply dipping chalk that forms the Purbeck Hills continues further east on the Isle of Wight. The height of the chalk ridge and proximity to Poole Harbour and the south coast have made the hills of strategic importance. There are a number of Iron Age, Roman and Saxon archaeological sites, such as Nine Barrow Down. At Corfe Castle the hills are broken twice leaving a steep round hill between the ridges on which stood a medieval castle, guarding the only easy route through the hills, until the English Civil War of the 17th century, when it was slighted. Some of the ridge, around the village of Tyneham, near Lulworth, has been closed to the public for use by the army as a firing range.

It was mapped in the early 1900s and named during Operation Deep Freeze in the 1950s. There are several forms of algae living in the waters and a weather station located at the lake. Geography Lake Fryxell is deep, making it so the deepest portion of the lake is below sea level. The lake is dammed by Canada Glacier, making it so that it has no natural outflow. It is covered with about of ice, but during the summer months, the ice can clear along the shoreline. There are a few small islands as well as several shallow areas. The average annual ablation is between and , which is significantly lower when compared to other nearby frozen water bodies, such as the waters adjacent to Ross Island. =Watershed= The watershed contains thirteen streams flowing into the lake, forming a watershed that has an area roughly in size. Where a few of the streams enter the lake there are well-developed deltas. The streams flow for about 4–12 weeks out of the year. Nearly half of the water flowing into the lake comes from Canada, Lost Seal and Von Guerard streams. Climate Lake Fryxell is located within the McMurdo Dry Valleys, which experience an exceptionally dry climate partially due to katabatic winds descending from the nearby mountains. These winds can exceed under certain conditions and can raise the temperature, melting snow and evaporating water. Average precipitation in the area surrounding the valley is equivalent to about of rain a year and a mean annual temperature of with summer temperatures getting above freezing. Lake Fryxell Camp Mapped by the British Antarctic Expedition under Robert Falcon Scott, 1910–13, the lake was visited by Professor T.L. Péwé during Operation Deep Freeze, 1957–58, who named it for Dr. Fritiof M. Fryxell, glacial geologist of Augustana College, Illinois. Lake Fryxell is a focus of scientific research and contains a semi-permanent camp containing four labs and two other buildings. Electricity is generated at the camp using solar panels and a wind turbine. The four labs are used for experimenting with radioactive materials, electronics, chemicals and other materials. When staying at the camp, researchers sleep in tents, some of which are the same style as those used in some Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century. There is internet and phone access at the camp. Research activities largely deal with the lake itself and can include scientists diving into the water. The camp has existed since at least 1984. Ecology There are multiple forms of algae within the lake, including a sizable population of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Some samples of these bacteria live in very specific areas, such as specific water depths or locations causing them to experience differing physiochemical conditions. There is a lack of oxygen within Lake Fryxell, which is unique when compared to other lakes in the region because the anoxic region extends up to below the lake surface. This creates an environment similar to the planet about 2.4 billion years ago. Within anoxic areas, scientists have found bacterial mats that create small pockets saturated with oxygen.

M. solifugus is dark brown and grows to about 15 mm long and 0.5 mm wide. They have a high population density and are relatively common in their area. The ice worms are also very sensitive to temperature and can only survive from approximately -7 °C to 5 °C. Description Adult ice worms measure around 15 mm in length and about 0.5 mm in diameter. Their fluid and flexible body are able to squeeze through air holes and tiny crevasses in ice. It is believed that the ice worm has a lifespan of five to ten years. Ice worms have heavy pigment, absorbing all colours or reflecting dark brown; however, they burrow into glaciers to avoid strong sunlight. Carlo Emery named the species solifugus in 1898, meaning \\"fleeing from the sun\\". Distribution and habitat Ice worms populate coastal glaciers in North America from Alaska to northern Washington state. The worms appear on the surface in high density; researchers have counted between 30 and 300 ice worms per square metre. On Byron glacier alone, researchers estimate the worms numbered around 30 million. The total number in all the coastal glaciers easily surpasses the entire human population. Ecology Mesenchytraeus solifugus have a very narrow acceptable temperature range. Ice worms freeze at around −6.8 °C (19.8 °F), and their bodies decompose after continuous exposure to temperatures above 5 °C (41 °F). This decomposition process, known as autolysis, occurs when the cells produce digestive enzymes and self-destruct. The body, figuratively, melts. They are the only known worm to spend their entire life in temperatures near 0 C (32 °F). Even if other places are equally cold, ice worms never venture onto any other terrain. They eat the abundant snow algae and pollen carried by the wind. In the summer, ice worms follow a diurnal cycle--at the first light in the morning, they sink into the glacier. A few hours before sunset, they poke out from the snow. Ice worms can still be found in broad daylight. Many of them gather in glacial ponds or small streams. Scientists believe the water blocks out the sun's longer wavelengths which the worms avoid, and the freezing water provides the worms with a comfortable temperature. In fast-flowing glacial streams, ice worms cling onto the icy surface. Researchers have observed the worms gyrate their head in the stream, possibly catching algae and pollen carried by the water. In still ponds, ice worms gather in bundles. Researchers speculate this has something to do with their reproduction. Ice worms do not graze in groups on the surface. The bonding in the still pond provides the rare opportunity for breeding. Since in the winter the surface temperature on a glacier could reach −40 C (−40 °F), scientists doubt the worms follow the diurnal pattern. The worms most likely remain below the surface. The snowfall provides insulation and the temperatures below maintain a stable 0 C (32 °F). Ice worms can still find plenty of algae in the firn layer, the layer of packed snow in transition to ice. Scientists know little about the ice worm during the winter as the inaccessibility of glaciers prevents further study. Medical uses Researchers are now investigating what prevents the worm from freezing at 0 C (32 °F) and are looking at the evolutionary steps by which the ice worm diverged from other species. Understanding the ice worm's secret could help preserve vital organs for transplant, and could aid in the understanding of potential extraterrestrial life on cold planets, as well as species on Earth which survive in climates colder than previously thought possible.

The station was in operation from 1957 to 2002 as a private affiliate of CBC Television. It was broadcast on channel 5, cable 9 in Swift Current. It also operated rebroadcasters on channel 10 in Riverhurst, channel 2 in Cypress Hills, channel 3 in Ponteix, channel 2 in Eastend, channel 7 in Shaunavon and channel 2 in Val Marie. History The station began broadcasting on December 23, 1957, beginning its schedule at 6:00 pm, as a Christmas present to southern Saskatchewan. From start to finish, it was owned by Bill and Julie Forst and their company, Swift Current Telecasting. Many baby boomers fondly remember Uncle Gord's Cartoon Party which was broadcast in the 1960s and early 1970s. Hosted by longtime CJFB on-air personality Gordon Foth, the program was broadcast at noon on weekdays and featured cartoons such as \\"Popeye\\" which were elderly even then. However, in the one-channel environment of Southwestern Saskatchewan, the program was enjoyed by many school-aged children at home for lunch. In 1958 a weekly live television program reporting developments in agriculture, called Farming Today, was sponsored jointly by the Swift Current Research Station, the Swift Current Agricultural and Exhibition Association, and CJFB. The program was hosted by research station personnel and/or the local provincial agricultural representative. Research Station Staff involved in the program included: Baden Campbell, Peder Myhr and Mark Kilcher. Farming Today lasted for 25 years. In 1976, after fighting an application by Regina's CKCK-TV to extend CTV service to Swift Current, CJFB agreed to a protective arrangement which allowed it to delete local advertising from the CKCK signal. Towards the end of its life, the station also carried programming from Global, similar to CKRD-TV, and had produced one season of an agriculture series called Agribiz before the series relocated to Regina. The Forsts didn't have the resources to convert the station to digital, and opted to sell CJFB to the CBC in 2002. On May 31, CJFB signed off for the final time with a look back at the station's history. The next day, the station's main transmitter became CBKT-4, a semi-satellite of Regina's CBKT, providing a full CBC schedule to the area. CJFB-TV-1 (Channel 2) in Eastend and CJFB-TV-2 (Channel 2) in Val Marie were deleted, as they were in range of two existing CBKT rebroadcasters, CBCP-TV-1 (channel 7) in Shaunavon and CBCP-TV-3 (channel 3) in Ponteix, respectively. CITV-TV provides Global programming via local cable systems. CJFB's demise marked it the first television station in Canada to cease operations since 1991, and also the first television station of the 2000s in Canada to cease operations. CBC affiliates CKOS-TV in Yorkton and CKBI-TV in Prince Albert would also be sold to the CBC in 2002, also becoming CBKT semi-satellites. CBKT-4 was among 620 rebroadcasters closed down by the CBC on July 31, 2012, due to budget cuts affecting the network.Speaking notes for Hubert T.

Cancer Alley () is an area along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, in the River Parishes of Louisiana, which contains numerous industrial plants. Locations in this area with clusters of cancer patients have been covered by the news media, leading to the \\"Cancer Alley\\" moniker. History In 1987, when residents of one street in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, primarily African-American and low income, noticed the abundance of cancer cases within their community, “Cancer Alley” became the new name for Jacobs Drive. As similar incidences became more and more prevalent in surrounding areas, the “alley” grew to encompass an eighty-five mile stretch along the Mississippi River. Prior to media coverage of the issue, the area between Baton Rouge and New Orleans was simply known as the “petrochemical corridor”. In 2002, Louisiana had the second-highest death rate from cancer in the United States. While the national average is 206 deaths per 100,000, Louisiana's rate was 237.3 deaths per 100,000. However, the death rate from cancer in the area dubbed Cancer Alley was not higher than the rest of Louisiana. The same study says that among people of color, stomach cancer was increased and diabetes and heart disease were significantly higher in the industrial corridor and Louisiana than the USA as a whole. In 2000, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data showed that Louisiana ranked second throughout the nation for total onsite releases, third for total releases within the state, and fourth for total on- and offsite releases. Louisiana, which has a population of 4,469,970 people, produced 9,416,598,055 pounds of waste in 2000.

He joined the expedition to the Spice Islands led by explorer Ferdinand Magellan under the flag of King Charles I of Spain and, after Magellan's death in the Philippines, the subsequent voyage around the world. During the expedition, he served as Magellan's assistant and kept an accurate journal which later assisted him in translating the Cebuano language. It is the first recorded document concerning the language. Pigafetta was one of the 18 men who returned to Spain in 1522, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, out of the approximately 240 who set out three years earlier. These men completed the first circumnavigation of the world. Pigafetta's surviving journal is the source for much of what is known about Magellan and Elcano's voyage. At least one warship of the Italian Navy, a destroyer of the Navigatori class, was named after him in 1931. Early life Pigafetta's exact year of birth is not known, with estimates ranging between 1480 and 1491. A birth year of 1491 would have made him around 30 years old during Magellan's expedition, which historians have considered more probable than an age close to 40. Pigafetta belonged to a rich family city of Vicenza in northeast Italy. In his youth he studied astronomy, geography and cartography. He then served on board the ships of the Knights of Rhodes at the beginning of the 16th century. Until 1519, he accompanied the papal nuncio, Monsignor Francesco Chieregati, to Spain. :))) Voyage around the world Map of Borneo by Pigafetta. Nao Victoria, Magellan's boat Replica in Punta Arenas In Seville, Pigafetta heard of Magellan's planned expedition and decided to join, accepting the title of supernumerary (sobresaliente), and a modest salary of 1,000 maravedís. During the voyage, which started in August 1519, Pigafetta collected extensive data concerning the geography, climate, flora, fauna and the native inhabitants of the places that the expedition visited. His meticulous notes proved invaluable to future explorers and cartographers, mainly due to his inclusion of nautical and linguistic data, and also to latter-day historians because of its vivid, detailed style. The only other sailor to maintain a journal during the voyage was Francisco Albo, Victoria's last pilot, who kept a formal logbook. Return Casa Pigafetta, his palace in Vicenza. Pigafetta was wounded on Mactan in the Philippines, where Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan in April 1521. Nevertheless, he recovered and was among the 18 who accompanied Juan Sebastián Elcano on board the Victoria on the return voyage to Spain. Upon reaching port in Sanlúcar de Barrameda in the modern Province of Cadiz in September 1522, three years after his departure, Pigafetta returned to the Republic of Venice. He related his experiences in the \\"Report on the First Voyage Around the World\\" (), which was composed in Italian and was distributed to European monarchs in handwritten form before it was eventually published by Italian historian Giovanni Battista Ramusio in 1550–59. The account centers on the events in the Mariana Islands and the Philippines, although it included several maps of other areas as well, including the first known use of the word \\"Pacific Ocean\\" (Oceano Pacifico) on a map. The original document was not preserved. However, it was not through Pigafetta's writings that Europeans first learned of the circumnavigation of the globe. Rather, it was through an account written by a Flanders-based writer Maximilianus Transylvanus, which was published in 1523. Transylvanus had been instructed to interview some of the survivors of the voyage when Magellan's surviving ship Victoria returned to Spain in September 1522 under the command of Juan Sebastian Elcano. After Magellan and Elcano's voyage, Pigafetta utilized the connections he had made prior to the voyage with the Knights of Rhodes to achieve membership in the order.  The Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo  Statue of Antonio Pigafetta in Vicenza Antonio Pigafetta also wrote a book, in which a detailed account of the voyage was given. It is quite unclear when it was first published and what language had been used in the first edition. The remaining sources of his voyage were extensively studied by Italian archivist Andrea da Mosto, who wrote a critical study of Pigafetta's book in 1898 (Il primo viaggio intorno al globo di Antonio Pigafetta e le sue regole sull'arte del navigareandrea-da-mosto-1894) and whose conclusions were later confirmed by J. Dénucé. Today, three printed books and four manuscripts survive. One of the three books is in French, while the remaining two are in Italian language. Of the four manuscripts, three are in French (two stored in the Bibliothèque nationale de France and one in Cheltenham), and one in Italian. From a philological point of view, the French editions seem to derive from an Italian original version, while the remaining Italian editions seem to derive from a French original version. Because of this, it remains quite unclear whether the original version of Pigafetta's manuscript was in French or Italian, though it was probably in Italian. The most complete manuscript, and the one that is supposed to be more closely related to the original manuscript, is the one found by Carlo Amoretti inside the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan and published in 1800 (Primo viaggio intorno al globo terraqueo, ossia ragguaglio della navigazione alle Indie Orientali per la via d'Occidente fatta dal cavaliere Antonio Pigafetta patrizio vicentino, sulla squadra del capitano Magaglianes negli anni 1519-1522). Unfortunately, Amoretti, in his printed edition, modified many words and sentences whose meaning was uncertain (the original manuscript contained many words in Veneto dialect and some Spanish words). The modified version published by Amoretti was then translated into other languages carrying into them Amoretti's edits. Andrea da Mosto critically analyzed the original version stored in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana and published this rigorous version of Pigafetta's book in 1894. Regarding the French versions of Pigafetta's book, J. Dénucé extensively studied them and published a critical edition.denuce-1923 At the end of his book, Pigafetta stated that he had given a copy to Charles V. Pigafetta's close friend, Francesco Chiericati, also stated that he had received a copy and it is thought that the regent of France may have received a copy of the latter. It has been argued that the copy Pigafetta had provided may have been merely a short version or a draft. It was in response to a request, in January 1523, of the Marquis of Mantua that Pigafetta wrote his detailed account of the voyage.  Works  Antonio Pigafetta wrote at least two books, both of which have survived: * Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo (1524-1525); * Regole sull'arte del navigare (1524-1525) (contained in ).  Exhibition  In June 2019, in the context of the quincentenary of the circumnavigation, an exhibition entitled Pigafetta: cronista de la primera vuelta al mundo Magallanes Elcano opened in Madrid at the library of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). AECID was also involved in the publication of a book about the expedition La vuelta al mundo de Magallanes-Elcano : la aventura imposible, 1519-1522 ().

It implies that there is no universal or uniform social outlook, rather that there are fundamental conflicts that exist inherent to how society is currently organized. Most known examples are the theory of Karl Marx and Max Weber's three-component theory of stratification. Barrington Moore and political development In a non-Marxist sense, class analysis is a theory of political development, in which political regimes and systems are said to be shaped by the social class structure of the country. The main advocate for this theory is political scientist Barrington Moore Jr. In Moore's theory, Great Britain gradually attained a stable democratic governance, compared to neighboring countries such as France and Germany, due to the rapid displacement of peasantry during the enclosure movement which fully transformed Britain into an advanced, industrial society with a strong bourgeois class, which Moore sees as indispensable for a lasting liberal democracy. In contrast, France had a large peasantry that is stationary on land yet politically volatile, leading to the alternating between violent revolutions and monarchical reactions. Class size Sociologist Erik Olin Wright splits class analysis into a macro and micro level. The foundation of class analysis on a macro level can be identified with class structure. Examples of such class structure in a macro level can be analyzed within a firm, city, country, or the entire world. On a micro level, class analysis focuses on the effects that the class may have on an individual. Erik Olin Wright exclaims examples of this to be: \\"Analyses of labor market strategies of unskilled workers, or the effects of technological change on class consciousness, or political contributions of corporate executives\\". Macro and Micro level events can correlate with one another through different perspectives. Wright proclaims that Macro level events are not created and set on one large effect, but instead processed through multiple individuals in a very intricate and complex pattern. He dictates that Macro class size events are endorsed by an embodiment of multiple micro class events. He also states the opposite effect each size has on each other and how Micro level events relative to class relations can be reinforced by the context of macro level events. Neo-Weberian definition According to Richard Breen, Weber first begins to describe class analysis with the class situation of the capital market an individual lives in. He proclaims that members of the same social class share the same life chances They also develop under the same market which procures chances and limits according to the resources the individual and/or class provides to it. He also states that the individuals who understand the broad range of options a chance may give them, may also be given more opportunities by the market or be willing to share among the individuals respected class. Breen debriefs Weber's classification of social and how Weber classifies these classes not only through a social filter but by a grander economic one as well. He also makes note that social and economic mobility are a great key to the understanding class analysis. Here he dictates that although it is easier and more fluid to traverse through the social class, it is much more difficult to progress through the economic class, and a great limiter is a social class the individual is located in. These results in limited chances by the market and is a great factor in why class immobility occurs. Weber defines economic classes according to his time as: \\"'dominant entrepreneurial and propertied groups'; the petty bourgeoisie; workers with formal credentials (the middle class) and those who lack them and whose only asset is their labor power (the working class).\\" Class differentials in educational attainment and their explanation Sociologist John Goldthorpe explains that while educational attainment in developed countries has risen in the last decades due to endorsements of grants, loans and other social motivations, empirical data substantiates that the differentials in social-economic class still plays a major role in educational and economic attainment. He goes on to explain how people of lower social class tend to stay in the class of their upbringing by choosing to not pursue further educational attainment or the works needed to attain a better social status. Explanations for these phenomena include theories by Halsey and her associates, which state the connection between culture and class, how people of high social class or paramount culture set a more important objective on education compared to parents of lower classes. According to Goldthorpe, a more aggressive approach, as indicated by Bourdieu and Passeron, indicates that the educational system functions as a social control, in which dominant class enforce that schools run in a conservative manner and exploit the inequalities that come with every child due to their family's class background. This will ensure subjects of lower class status to accept failure or indulge in counter-school subcultures. Goldthorpe, however, states that in the last century there has truly been extensive opportunities for upward educational and class mobility defended by means of empirical data. Other theories proposed by different sociologists arise as well. One view claimed by Keller and Zavalloni indicate that to better understand these trends, sociologists must study the aspirations of an individual on a relative level according to their social level and situation and not conclude absolute ideals of aspirations to all the classes, which would be easier to work with. Goldthorpe also acknowledges Boudon's two-effect view in educational attainment. Those stand as the primary effects, which exist as the creation of class differentials in initial achievement, and second effects that affect children when they transition in the educational system. They both work hand in hand were although initial achievement might pursue an individual as they develop in the educational system (Primary), choosing whether to transition into the next level in the system might still be influenced by their class origins (second). Goldthorpe goes on to encourage researchers to enforce further attention to the second effect, because as we progress, even today, the limitations of the primary effects seem to be vanishing as more educational attainment resources and opportunities are being funneled into all class levels. Class and political partnership Goldthorpe describes how class influence on an individual's social situation is diminishing substantially in the world of politics. This evidently described by Sociologist M. Lipset during the latter half of the 20th century were liberal democratic working class advocated for their party to represent their problems In the 1950s but quickly diminished during the 1970s as class relations in political partnership was dissolving. This is particularly important, as some Marxist social groups state this to be the downfall of the working class and class analysis. Another example of this dissolution of political and class partnership is Britain's politics; in how political party conflicts tended to focus more on issues instead of interest of the class community. This in turn creates family-party separation which fuels different political party interest. Heath and his associates have theorized the dissolution of this partnership to be derivative of absolute and relative rates in class voting and social mobility. These theories develop through the class development of Britain during the latter half of the 20th centuries by implication of \\"trends in patterns of class mobility, in levels of class identification, and in class differences in political attitudes and values\\". Heath and his colleagues try to argue empirically against theories of Dunleavy and associates who stated that new structural cleavages were becoming the foundations for party support. On top of empirical support against, Goldthorpe explains that fluidity and boundaries are the major point against the theories of Dunleavy and his colleagues. Class interest Class interest is the interest one assumes when in a set location inside of class relations. Erik Wright describes such as examples as \\"range of issues, standards of living, working conditions, level of toil, leisure, material security, and other things\\". This is imperative information to understand when relating individual actions according to their class location. Class practices Class practices are the derived as the actions taken by the individual or group with the objective of their own class interest.

It lies at the start of the winding road that follows the river valley before climbing over Tākaka Hill, linking Golden Bay with the more populated coast of Tasman Bay to the southeast. The town is served by Takaka Aerodrome. Onetahua Kōkiri Marae is located in Tākaka. It includes Te Ao Marama wharenui (meeting house) and it is a marae (meeting ground) for Ngāti Rārua, Ngāti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu and Te Atiawa o Te Waka-a-Māui. History From 1853 to 1876, Tākaka was administrated as part of the Nelson Province. In June 2005, much of the town was temporarily evacuated after fire swept through Tākaka's biggest industrial complex, a dairy factory. There were fears that volatile chemicals stored at the plant might explode, leading to the release of poisonous gases, which later proved to be unfounded. In July 2020, the name of the town was officially gazetted as Tākaka by the New Zealand Geographic Board. Geography The area around Tākaka Hill has a cave system, including New Zealand's deepest vertical shaft, Harwood's Hole. Tākaka and Golden Bay are known for rock climbing, particularly around the area of Paynes Ford. This area is situated about 20 minutes walk from Tākaka and has over 200 bolted climbs. The most famous climb is 1080 and the letter G because of its unique \\"no-hands-rest\\" at the top and its views of Golden Bay. The town is also known for Te Waikoropupu Springs (colloquially known as Pupu Springs). The antipode of Tākaka is the town of Coriscada, Portugal. Economy Farming, sawmilling, limestone quarrying and tourism are major local industries. The area around Tākaka is mineral-rich, with gold, iron ore, copper, silver and asbestos all found locally, although not all in commercially viable amounts. There is also a small Fonterra dairy factory located in the township of Tākaka. Education Golden Bay High School is a co-educational state intermediate and high school for Year 7 to 13 students, with a roll of as of .

Made of marble that has weathered into many strange forms and with numerous sink holes, it is typical karst country. The marble is Ordovician in age and from the Takaka Terrane. There is only one road winding over and around the flanks of Tākaka Hill, State Highway 60, following the valleys of the Tākaka River to the northwest and the Riuwaka River to the southeast. In July 2020, the name of the pass was officially gazetted as Tākaka Hill Saddle by the New Zealand Geographic Board. It rises to 791 metres at its highest point and separates the coastal communities of Golden Bay from those of the more populous Tasman Bay to the southeast and because of its winding nature isolates Golden Bay from the rest of the South Island. Tākaka Hill is notable for its (now defunct) marble quarry and for many limestone caves and sinkholes, including Ngarua Caves which are open to the public and feature deposits of moa bones.

It was intended to demonstrate that the B-29 could still be put into service even if the first choice of engine, the air-cooled Wright R-3350 radial engine, ran into development or production difficulties. Design and development Starting life as the first YB-29 delivered to the United States Army Air Forces, it was sent in November 1943 to the Fisher Body Aircraft Development Section of General Motors to be converted to use Allison V-3420-17 liquid-cooled W24 (twin-V12, common crankcase) inline engines.Flying Magazine,August 1945, p. 51. Fisher was chosen for the modification as it was familiar with the engine, as it was to power the P-75 Eagle that they were then developing. Testing on it began in early 1944. Further development of the engine and the aircraft was delayed by a series of changes in the planned turbosuperchargers, as the originally specified GE Type CM-2 two-stage turbosupercharger became unavailable due to demands on GE's production of its other turbosuperchargers. Other turbosuperchargers were considered, but the end result was that the first flights of the B-39 had to be made without any turbosuperchargers at all. In addition, in early 1944, due to a sudden realization from the U.S. Army Air Forces that it required a long range air superiority fighter, Fisher was directed to focus on its other major project, the P-75 Eagle. In June 1944, Fisher received a contract for 2,500 P-75s. However, in October 1944, for a variety of reasons, the P-75 was canceled. Operational history General Motors modified B-29 to use Allison V-3420 engines Fisher finally focused again on the B-39. The first flight of the B-39 was made on 9 December 1944 at Cleveland, Ohio. The initial flight tests of the B-39, without turbosuperchargers installed, were impressive. However, the B-39 program was by now seriously delayed, and the flawed R-3350 B-29s had already been rushed into combat in June 1944. Despite continuing problems with the B-29s, the aircraft was functioning well enough in combat that it no longer made any sense to shift resources in the manufacturing base to a new engine for the B-29 and so the B-39 was not ordered into production.

The film chronicles the life of popular Hollywood film star Bo Laramie in the aftermath of a car crash caused by four paparazzo tabloid photographers. Bo soon goes on a quest to get revenge on the gang for almost killing him and his family. Paparazzi was released on September 3, 2004 in the United States. Plot Rising Hollywood movie star Bo Laramie (Cole Hauser) has finally achieved major success with his latest film \\"Adrenaline Force\\". Almost after the film's premiere, a persistent group of unscrupulous photographers — Kevin Rosner (Kevin Gage), Leonard Clark (Tom Hollander), Wendell Stokes (Daniel Baldwin) and their leader Rex Harper (Tom Sizemore) — harass Bo and his wife Abby (Robin Tunney), along with their 8-year-old son Zach (Blake Michael Bryan). When Bo takes Zach to soccer practice, he eyes Rex taking photos of Zach and confronts him, leading Rex to provoke Bo into punching him, caught on camera by his fellow photographers. Bo is sued as a result and is placed into anger management. Meanwhile, Rex vows to destroy Bo and those close to him. As Bo, Abby and Zach return from an event, Rex and his crew drive up beside them, in four different vehicles, and blind them by taking pictures. Bo's car is hit by a pickup truck while Rex and his crew snap photos of the wreck they caused. While Bo is not seriously injured, Abby's spleen is removed and Zach is placed in a coma. Bo is told by LAPD detective Burton (Dennis Farina) that the paparazzi each gave him the same story of finding the wreck after it happened, with no witnesses to dispute their claims. Some time later, Bo accidentally causes Kevin to wipe out on his motorcycle, careening onto a precipice. Bo tries to save him, but when Kevin gloats that they'll put his family through hell, Bo lets him fall to his death. Bo makes Leonard his next target, secretly placing a prop gun in the jacket left in Leonard's car, whilst Leonard invades Bo's movie set and is ejected by security. Following him, Bo calls 911, and describes Leonard's car, saying that the driver is waving a gun. Leonard is pulled over and, reaching into his jacket for his ID, instead pulls out the prop gun, causing the cops to shoot him dead. Convinced Bo will target them next, Rex and Wendell break into Bo's house to plant cameras inside. Abby runs into Wendell, who assaults her and threatens to kill Zach if she tells the police. Burton assigns Deputy Walker (Forry Smith) and Deputy Wilson (Donal Gibson) to provide extra security, but Bo sneaks out past the two deputies and into Wendell's house, discovering the feed from the cameras. Wendell arrives at his home where Bo confronts him with a baseball bat. In the morning, Bo puts the car back where it was at, and races to beat Burton, on his way to the house. Burton shows Bo a video taken by a camera in a button of Leonard's shirt on the movie set, and thinks someone planted the gun in Leonard's coat. Rex soon finds Wendell beaten to death, and Bo planted the bat in Rex's houseboat to frame him. Burton realizes traffic camera footage will prove what really happened at Bo's crash, along with the testimony of Emily (Andrea Baker), who was with Rex at the event, prompted by her guilt to come forward. At Wendell's house, Burton notices the video feed from the cameras in Bo's house and Rex entering with a gun. Rex goes to Bo and Abby's bedroom and opens fire, only for Bo to hit Rex and throw him to the floor. Bo viciously beats Rex, gloating about how he got his revenge. Rex is finally arrested, adding to a charge that he had previously harassed and raped Emily, and relentlessly photographed by paparazzi as he is led away. Later, as Bo is finishing filming, he's called to the hospital, where Zach has awakened from his coma. Bo, Abby and Zach later attend at the premiere of Bo's newest film, a sequel to Adrenaline Force, and Abby is now pregnant with a girl. After the film, Bo meets the press out front, taking a paparazzi's jibe at him in his stride.

Written by John T. Dugan (under the pen-name \\"John Kingsbridge\\") and directed by Ralph Senensky, it was first broadcast February 9, 1968. In the episode, telepathic aliens take control of Captain Kirk, Dr. Ann Mulhall (Diana Muldaur), and First Officer Spock's bodies in order to construct android hosts. This episode was the first appearance of Diana Muldaur in the Star Trek franchise. She appeared again as Dr. Miranda Jones in the third season episode, \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\" and as Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Plot The starship Enterprise receives a distress call from a lifeless planet. Upon arrival, a telepathic being named Sargon (voiced by James Doohan) addresses Kirk and Spock as his \\"children\\", and invites them to beam down to the planet. Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Lt. Cmdr. Ann Mulhall beam to a subterranean vault where the voice of Sargon greets them from a luminous sphere on a pedestal. Sargon explains that he and two others are the last survivors of their race; their minds, stored in these spheres, have existed here since their planet was devastated by war. Sargon then transfers his mind into Kirk's body and Kirk's mind into the sphere. Sargon explains that he and his companions will need human bodies temporarily, in order to construct android hosts for themselves, and then returns to his orb. Kirk, returned to his own body, declares his confidence in Sargon. Back onboard the Enterprise, the four meet with Chief Engineer Scott to consider Sargon's request, and Kirk convinces the others with a rousing speech about risk. The spheres of Sargon, his wife Thalassa, and his former enemy Henoch, are brought up from the planet. McCoy supervises as Sargon takes Kirk's body again, and Thalassa and Henoch take Mulhall's and Spock's bodies, respectively. When Sargon and Thalassa become exhausted by the strain of the transference, Henoch instructs Nurse Chapel in preparing a serum that will strengthen the host bodies. Chapel notices that the serum in the hypospray designated for Kirk does not contain the correct formula. Henoch confesses that he intends to kill Kirk, and Sargon with him, in order to keep Spock's body. Henoch then erases Chapel's memory of the conversation. Manufacture of the android hosts begins. Kirk's body weakens more quickly than the others, requiring additional doses of the serum. Henoch tries to tempt Thalassa into keeping their hosts' bodies, because the android forms will be incapable of sensuality. She in turn tries to convince Sargon, but he collapses. McCoy declares that Kirk's body has died and Sargon is gone. Back in sickbay, McCoy is able to revive Kirk's bodily functions, but has no way to restore Kirk's mind. Thalassa offers to restore Kirk in exchange for McCoy's help in keeping Mulhall's body. When McCoy refuses, she assaults him telepathically, but then has a change in heart and relents. The voice of Sargon commends her, and she realizes that Sargon is using the ship itself as a temporary body. She then informs McCoy that Sargon has a plan, and locks him out of the examination room, after which Chapel marches out of sickbay. McCoy reenters the examination room and finds that Kirk and Mulhall have been returned to their bodies. However, the spheres have been destroyed, including the one that held Spock's mind. Kirk says that this was \\"necessary\\", and asks McCoy to prepare a lethal hypospray for Henoch. Henoch, who has taken control of the bridge and is terrorizing the crew, reads McCoy's mind and prevents the injection. Henoch then commands Chapel to use the lethal compound on McCoy. She moves as if to comply, but then injects Henoch instead. Henoch boasts that he can transfer to another body, but finds he cannot due to interference from Sargon. Henoch pleads for mercy, but Spock's body collapses, seemingly in death. Sargon tells Kirk that he could not allow this. Spock's and Chapel's bodies glow, and Spock revives. Sargon reveals that the injection was not lethal; it was important for McCoy and Chapel to believe it was lethal so that Henoch would believe it also. Spock's mind had been temporarily placed in Chapel's body. Sargon and Thalassa announce that they will not attempt to build host bodies, but will \\"depart into oblivion\\" instead. They make a final request: to be allowed to use Kirk and Mulhall's bodies one last time to share a kiss. Reception Michelle Erica Green of Trek Today writes that the story is \\"an entertaining and engaging episode about power, loyalty and the struggle between physical and mental pleasures... and because there's an alien in his body, Spock spends a lot of time smiling\\". Of the characterizations, she adds, \\"Nimoy appears to be having a wonderful time playing a relaxed, calculating villain, and Shatner portrays Sargon in an amplified booming benevolent voice that makes a nifty contrast to his would-be-Kennedyesque speechifying, expounding on the values that sent humans to the stars\\". Green observes, \\"The skepticism of godlike beings runs very deep on this series\\", and The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen says on the same theme, \\"we're dealing with another race of god-beings, but for once, they aren't here to torment Kirk and the rest. This time they actually need help, and it's not because they're bored\\". Like Green, he enjoys the acting: \\"Nimoy gets a chance to ham it up here, and it really pays off. He has a half-smirk on his face most of the time, and he makes a great contrast to the somewhat overplayed nobility of Sargon and Thalassa and their love\\". He gives the episode a B+. Melissa N. Hayes-Gehrke of the University of Maryland found it \\"a nearly classic TOS plot, with god-like aliens, beings made only of energy, promises of advanced technology, and the realization that god-like powers are absolutely corrupting\\". She argued, though, that a \\"big and frustrating plot hole\\" is Sargon's dismissal of the idea that Starfleet might build them android bodies. \\"After all, the Enterprise recently discovered a world populated by advanced androids ('I, Mudd'). In fact, those androids would make anyone a body that they could transfer their mind into. We don't know for sure that those bodies have senses, but it's hard to imagine a human wanting to transfer into one for the purposes of immortality if they were limited in that way. These android bodies seem perfectly suited to Sargon's people, and it's annoying that the lack of series continuity kept it from being mentioned\\". Eugene Myers ranked this as a superior example of \\"several bodyswap/alien possession episodes of the series\\" in terms of acting: Shatner has a \\"nuanced performance, walking jerkily as though unaccustomed to legs after eons without a body\\", while \\"Nimoy, of course, clearly enjoyed the opportunity to stretch his acting--and facial--muscles, playing out of character ... to smirk, smile, and scheme his way through his scenes\\". He rated the episode \\"Warp 6 (on a scale of 1-6)\\".

The postcode is 2213, which it shares with adjacent suburbs East Hills and Picnic Point. Panania is bounded on the north by the M5 South Western Motorway and the suburb of Milperra. Picnic Point, to the south, features parklands along the Georges River. East Hills is the suburb to the west and Revesby is located to the east. History War memorial The name Panania was on the original list of stations proposed for the Tempe-East Hills railway line in 1929. Prior to this, Panania was part of what was generally known as the East Hills district. Panania is an Aboriginal word meaning sun rising in the east and shining on the hills. An alternative theory is that the name may be a derivation of \\"Pannonia\\", which was an ancient province of the Roman Empire southeast of the Danube River. During the construction of the railway line the name Nioka was used for the station which is an Aboriginal word meaning the green hill. Other names suggested for suburb were Linden Park and Elmswood. The arrival of the railway in 1931 stimulated the development of the East Hills district. Prior to this, the district was rural. There was a soldiers' settlement at Milperra which consisted mostly of poultry and horticultural enterprises. The only public transportation was a bus service to Bankstown railway station on the Bankstown line from various locations throughout the district, which posed a great inconvenience to people who needed to visit the Sydney CBD for work. Development began apace after World War II. The Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women sponsored the mass production of housing at Panania beginning from 1946 with the construction of 34 houses. St Christopher's Catholic Church on Tower Street was originally the Panania Star cinema. Panania North Public School, a short two block walk on the northern side of the railway line, became a demonstration school in the late 1970s so that trainee teachers from the newly-established Milperra College of Advanced Education could observe teachers at work. Commercial area Panania has a shopping area adjacent to Panania railway station. It runs along Weston Street, Anderson Avenue and Tower Street. Anderson Avenue features several local government facilities including a senior citizens centre and a public library. Panania Hotel is located on the northern side of Panania railway station. The active Business Chamber is a significant strength of Panania. \\"Panania Issues Paper – Town Centre Improvement Program\\", Bankstown Council December 2010 Transport View north from the railway station, Panania Hotel at top right Panania railway station is on the Airport & South Line of the Sydney Trains network. Parts of Panania are serviced by buses operated by Transdev NSW, generally following the routes established by McVicar's Bus Services. The East Hills railway line, which originally terminated one stop away at East Hills divided the suburb into two distinct precincts. During the 1980s, the railway line was extended with a rail bridge over the Georges River to Campbelltown. Demographics Panania had a population of 11,489 people at the . 48.6% of the population was male; 51.4% was female. 72.8% were born in Australia. 1.4% of the population were indigenous Australians. =Employment= At the 2006 census, 45.6% of Panania's population were employed. =Religious affiliation= At the , the most common religious affiliations were: Catholic (32.2%), Anglican (20.7%), No Religion (11.0%), Eastern Orthodox (8.0%), and Islam (5.1%). Churches St Christopher's Catholic Church in 2008 Panania features notable buildings such as Holy Trinity Anglican Church and St Christopher's Catholic Church. St Christopher's is housed in the building formerly known as the Panania Star Cinema. The Panania Star Cinema was built in 1952 in the Art Deco style, and was the twin of the Padstow Star Cinema in nearby Padstow. The building retains a number of original features, including a decorative ceiling. After a grant from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney and many donations from parishioners, the building underwent renovations costing $165,000 which were completed early in 2006. The Salvation Army also has a Corps in Panania. The old building was recently refurbished.

(Alonzo Rodriguez, 16th century, Museo Regionale di Messina). The kiss of peace is an ancient traditional Christian greeting, sometimes also called the \\"holy kiss\\", \\"brother kiss\\" (among men), or \\"sister kiss\\" (among women). Such greetings signify a wish and blessing that peace be with the recipient, and besides their spontaneous uses they have certain ritualized or formalized uses long established in liturgy. Many denominations use other forms of greeting (besides literal kisses) to serve equivalent purposes; they include handshakes, gestures, and hugs, any of which may be called a sign of peace. Sources It was the widespread custom in the ancient western Mediterranean for men to greet each other with a kiss.William Smith, Smith's Bible Dictionary, Kiss, UK, 1988 That was also the custom in ancient Judea and practiced also by Christians. However, the New Testament's references to a holy kiss (, en hagio philemati) and kiss of love (ἐν φιλήματι ἀγάπης) transformed the character of the act beyond a greeting. Such a kiss is mentioned five times in the concluding section of letters in the New Testament: * Romans — \\"Greet one another with a holy kiss\\" (Greek: ). * 1 Corinthians — \\"Greet one another with a holy kiss\\" (Greek: ). * 2 Corinthians — \\"Greet one another with a holy kiss\\" (Greek: ). * 1 Thessalonians — \\"Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss\\" (Greek: ). * 1 Peter — \\"Greet one another with a kiss of love\\" (Greek: ). It has been noted that these mentions of the holy kiss come at the end of these epistles. Since these epistles were addressed to Christian communities they would most probably have been read in the context of their communal worship. If the assemblies for worship already concluded in a celebration of the Eucharist the holy kiss would already have occurred in the position it would later occupy in most ancient Christian liturgical tradition (with the exception of the Roman Rite), namely after the proclamation of the Word and at the beginning of the celebration of the Eucharist. The writings of the early church fathers speak of the holy kiss, which they call \\"a sign of peace\\", which was already part of the Eucharistic liturgy, occurring after the Lord's Prayer in the Roman Rite and the rites directly derived from it. St. Augustine, for example, speaks of it in one of his Easter Sermons: Augustine's Sermon 227 is just one of several early Christian primary sources, both textual and iconographic (i.e., in works of art) providing clear evidence that the \\"kiss of peace\\" as practiced in the Christian liturgy was customarily exchanged for the first several centuries, not mouth to cheek, but mouth to mouth (note that men were separated from women during the liturgy) for, as the primary sources also show, this is how early Christians believed Christ and his followers exchanged their own kiss. For example, In his Paschale carmen (ca. 425-50), Latin priest-poet Sedulius condemns Judas and his betrayal of Christ with a kiss thus, \\"And leading that sacrilegious mob with its menacing swords and spikes, you press your mouth against his, and infuse your poison into his honey?\\"For a documented discussion of the mouth-to-mouth early Christian kiss of peace, see Franco Mormando, \\"Just as your lips approach the lips of yours brothers: Judas Iscariot and the Kiss of Betrayal,\\" in Saints and Sinners: Caravaggio and the Baroque Image, ed. F. Mormando (Chestnut Hill, MA: McMullen Museum of Boston College, 1999), pp.179-190. The kiss of peace was known in Greek from an early date as eirḗnē () (\\"peace\\", which became pax in Latin and peace in English).Catholic Encyclopedia - Kiss The source of the peace greeting is probably from the common Hebrew greeting shalom; and the greeting \\"Peace be with you\\" is similarly a translation of the Hebrew shalom aleichem. In the Gospels, both greetings were used by Jesus - e.g. ; John 20:21, John 20:26. The Latin term translated as \\"sign of peace\\" is simply pax (\\"peace\\"), not signum pacis (\\"sign of peace\\") nor osculum pacis (\\"kiss of peace\\"). So the invitation by the deacon, or in his absence by the priest, \\"Let us offer each other the sign of peace\\", is in Latin: Offerte vobis pacem (\\"Offer each other peace\\" or \\"Offer each other the peace\\"). From an early date, to guard against any abuse of this form of salutation, women and men were required to sit separately, and the kiss of peace was given only by women to women and by men to men. In the Church The practice remains a part of the worship in traditional churches, including the Episcopal Church,Book of Common Prayer, 1979; Catholic Church, Eastern Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox churches, Oriental Orthodox churches; some liturgical mainline Protestant denominations; and Spiritual Christian, where it is often called the kiss of peace, sign of peace, Holy kiss or simply peace or pax; It is practiced as a part of worship in many Anabaptist heritage groups including Old German Baptist Brethren, and Apostolic Christian. Contemporary practices = Catholic Church = In the Catholic Church, the term now used is not \\"the kiss of peace\\", but \\"the sign of peace\\" or \\"the rite of peace\\". The General Instruction of the Roman Missal states: \\"There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual charity before communicating in the Sacrament.\\"General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 82 The priest says or sings: \\"The peace of the Lord be with you always\\", to which the people respond: \\"And with your spirit.\\" Then, as stated in the Roman Missal, \\"if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds: 'Let us offer each other the sign of peace.'\\"Roman Missal, Order of Mass, 127–128 In the Roman Rite, it is placed after the Pater Noster and before the Fractio Panis. Even within the Catholic Church, there are liturgical rites (the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite) in which it is placed after the Liturgy of the Word, before the gifts for consecration are put on the altar. The latter placing is influenced by the recommendation in about seeking reconciliation with another before completing an offering at the altar. It was a practice in Rome itself at the time of Justin Martyr in the middle of the 2nd century. In the 3rd century the present placing was chosen not only in Rome but also in other parts of the West such as Roman Africa, where Saint Augustine understood it as related to the petition, \\"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\\", in the Lord's Prayer and to the link between being in communion with the body of Christ understood as the Church and receiving communion with the body of Christ in the Eucharist.Kevin W. Irwin, Responses to 101 Questions on the Mass (Paulist Press 1999) , pp. 122–123 In the Tridentine Mass form of the Roman Rite, the sign of peace is given at Solemn Masses alone and is exchanged only among the clergy (unless emperors, kings or princes were present, in which case they, too, received the greeting. If several members of a royal family were present, at least the sovereign received the greeting). It is given by extending both arms in a slight embrace with the words \\"Pax tecum\\" (Peace be with you), first by the priest celebrant to the deacon, who in turn gives it to the subdeacon, who gives the sign to any other clergy present in choir dress. During the Nuptial Solemn Mass, it is also given to the groom, who then gives the sign of peace to his bride. In the Roman-Rite revised in 1969, the sign of peace is used at most Masses but is not obligatory. It is exchanged between all present in no prescribed order, except that \\"the Priest gives the sign of peace to a Deacon or minister\\". The manner prescribed is as follows: \\"It is appropriate that each one give the sign of peace only to those who are nearest and in a sober manner. The Priest may give the sign of peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary, so as not to disturb the celebration. He does likewise if for a just reason he wishes to extend the sign of peace to some few of the faithful.\\"Redemptionis Sacramentum, 72 The following are considered abuses by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments:Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments. The Ritual Expression of the Gift of Peace at Mass, 6c *introducing a \\"song of peace\\" to accompany the rite; *the faithful moving from their places to exchange the sign of peace; *the priest leaving the altar to give the sign of peace to some of the faithful; *expressing other sentiments, e.g. expressing congratulations, best wishes or condolences among those present at a wedding, funeral or other ceremony. The gesture by which the sign of peace is exchanged is to be determined by the local episcopal conference. In some countries, such as the United States, the conference has laid down no rules, and the everyday handshake is generally used, while in other countries, such as India and Thailand, a bow is prescribed. A 2014 letter of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments recommended that conferences choose gestures more appropriate than \\"familiar and profane gestures of greeting\\". = Eastern Orthodox Church = In the Eastern Orthodox Church's Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the exchange of the peace occurs at the midpoint of the service, when the scripture readings have been completed and the Eucharistic prayers are yet to come. The priest announces, \\"Let us love one another that with one accord we may confess--\\" and the people conclude the sentence, \\"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity, one in essence and undivided.\\" At that point the Kiss of Peace is exchanged by clergy at the altar, and in some churches among the laity as well (the custom is being reintroduced, but is not universal). Immediately after the peace, the deacon cries \\"The doors! The doors!\\"; in ancient times, the catechumens and other non-members of the church would depart at this point, and the doors would be shut behind them. At that, worshippers then recite the Nicene Creed. In the Eastern Orthodox Liturgy, the Kiss of Peace is preparation for the Creed: \\"Let us love one another that we may confess...the Trinity.\\" In the early centuries the kiss of peace was exchanged between the clergy: clergy kissing the bishop, lay men kissing laymen, and women kissing the women, according to the Apostolic Constitutions. Today the kiss of love is exchanged between concelebrating priests. Such has been the case for centuries. In a few Orthodox dioceses in the world in the last few decades, the kiss of peace between laymen has attempted to be reinstituted, usually as a handshake, hugging or cheek kissing. Another example of an exchange of the peace is when, during the Divine Liturgy, the Priest declares to the people \\"Peace be with all\\", and their reply: \\"And with your Spirit\\". More examples of this practice may be found within Eastern Orthodoxy, but these are the most prominent examples. = Lutheranism = The Lutheran Church teach: Within the celebration of the Holy Communion, the sign of peace takes the form of a kiss or handshake. = Anglicanism and Methodism = In the Anglican church it is common practice at more formal services for the congregation to be invited to \\"offer one another a sign of peace\\". However, this is usually a handshake although married couples may kiss one another instead. = Reformed = The Reformed tradition (inclusive of the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Evangelical Anglican and Congregationalist Churches) has adopted the holy kiss either metaphorically (in that members extend a pure, warm welcome that is referred to as a holy kiss) or literally (in that members kiss one another). = Anabaptism = The Holy kiss is particularly important among many Anabaptist sects. These groups include the Apostolic Christian Church, the Amish, the Schwarzenau Brethren, and many conservative Mennonite Churches including the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite.

Lee Ermey and Laura Elena Harring. It is loosely based on the novel Ratman's Notebooks by Stephen Gilbert, as well as on the novel's first film adaptation, Willard (1971), and its sequel, Ben (1972). It was not billed as a remake by the producers, who chose instead to present it as a reworking of the themes from the original, with a stronger focus on suspense.Willard Official Movie Site  Plot  Willard Stiles (Crispin Glover) is a social misfit taking care of his ill and fragile but verbally abusive mother Henrietta (Jackie Burroughs) in a musty old mansion that is also home to a colony of rats. Willard finds himself constantly humiliated in front of his co-workers by his cruel boss, Frank Martin (R. Lee Ermey), a vicious man who assumed control of the company from Willard's father upon his death by suicide, and whose professional interest in Willard extends to a personal financial one. A co-worker, Cathryn (Laura Elena Harring), has sympathy for the quirky Willard. Cathryn becomes Willard's friend and love interest. Willard quickly becomes obsessed with his friendship with a white rat he names Socrates. Willard then begins to train and befriend the other rats, including an extra-large one he names Ben. Ben begins to assume a position of \\"leadership\\" among the other rats, while Socrates remains Willard's favorite. After he trains the rats sufficiently, Willard takes them to Martin's home, where he orders them to chew up the tires on Martin's Mercedes-Benz. Willard's mother panics when she overhears the rats and later dies by falling down the stairs of the basement. Now Socrates is all he has left. Willard learns soon afterward that the payments on the house have fallen far behind and that the bank will likely foreclose upon the property. In an effort to cheer up Willard, Cathryn speaks to him about the loss of her own mother, and how what got her through it was the cat she inherited, which she gives to Willard. While Willard is delighted that Cathryn is giving him a gift of friendship, and hopefully love as well, he has reservations about the cat. The cat is soon eaten by all the rats, which leaves Willard burdened with guilt. Desperately lonely, Willard begins to bring Socrates to work with him. He then finds a note at his desk declaring that he is being fired by Frank Martin. While he is arguing with Martin, begging not to be fired, Socrates is discovered by Ms. Leach in the supply room. Her screams alert Martin, who bludgeons Socrates to death. Willard, his mental state already precarious, is devastated. He turns to Ben, who is more than willing to guide the colony of rats to help Willard avenge himself upon his boss. Willard and his rats confront Martin and, at Willard's command, they swarm onto Martin and kill him. As Martin and the rat army descend the elevator shaft, Willard taunts Martin with his own words when Socrates died, manically grinning as he says, “What’s the matter, Tiger? Scared of a little blood?” While Ben seems to be loyal, there’s something about him that Willard finds suspect, so he attempts to dispose of him and the other rats by putting poison in the basement. He succeeds in killing some, but Ben remains and turns the remaining rat army against Willard. Willard manages to rescue Cathryn, who is there on a date, and gets her out of the house, but becomes trapped himself. Desperate to save Willard, Cathryn manages to waylay two police officers and immediately brings them to the house, where they are aghast and appalled at what they see. When Cathryn tries to enter the house, and one of the officers bluntly asks, “You wanna be eaten alive?”, it’s then she realizes Willard was responsible for Martin’s death, and there’s no future for them now. As Ben and Willard fight, Willard reveals his true feelings to Ben, how he loved Socrates but hated him. Willard lamely pleads, “I thought that we were friends!” Willard barely escapes with his life and kills Ben (after severing one of his legs), which is witnessed in shadow profile through the upstairs window by Cathryn and the police. Willard has retreated into a semi-catatonic state and has been placed in a mental institution. Unknown to anyone else, a white rat appears in his cell which looks like Socrates. Believing that the rat is his only friend reborn, the now-scheming Willard (revealing that his semi-catatonic state is faked) tells the rat, \\"It's not over yet, no! Our time is going to come...\\"  Cast  * Crispin Glover as Willard Stiles: An antisocial worker for Martin- Stiles Manufacturing, a business that was originally started by his father but was \\"stolen\\" by his boss Frank Martin.

When Socrates is killed by Martin, he uses his rats to get revenge, transforming into a ruthless psychopath. * R. Lee Ermey as Frank Martin: A cruel and uncaring CEO of Martin-Stiles Manufacturing. He constantly humiliates Willard for his late arrivals at work and even kills his pet rat Socrates.

CE), one of the most important representatives of Neopythagoreanism Neopythagoreanism (or Neo-Pythagoreanism) was a school of Hellenistic philosophy which revived Pythagorean doctrines. Neopythagoreanism was influenced by Middle Platonism and in turn influenced Neoplatonism. It originated in the 1st century BCE and flourished during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. The 1911 Britannica describes Neopythagoreanism as \\"a link in the chain between the old and the new\\" within Hellenistic philosophy. Central to Neopythagorean thought was the concept of a soul and its inherent desire for a unio mystica with the divine.Calvin J. Roetzel, The World That Shaped the New Testament, 2002, p. 68. The word \\"Neopythagoreanism\\" is a modern (19th century) term,Definition of Neo-pythagoreanism by Merriam- Webster coined as a parallel of \\"Neoplatonism\\". History In the 1st century BCE Cicero's friend Nigidius Figulus made an attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines, but the most important members of the school were Apollonius of Tyana and Moderatus of Gades in the 1st century CE. Other important Neopythagoreans include the mathematician Nicomachus of Gerasa (fl. 150 CE), who wrote about the mystical properties of numbers. In the 2nd century, Numenius of Apamea sought to fuse additional elements of Platonism into Neopythagoreanism, prefiguring the rise of Neoplatonism. (Iamblichus, in particular, was especially influenced by Neopythagoreanism). Neopythagoreanism was an attempt to re-introduce a mystical religious element into Hellenistic philosophy (dominated by the Stoics) in place of what had come to be regarded as an arid formalism. The founders of the school sought to invest their doctrines with the halo of tradition by ascribing them to Pythagoras and Plato. They went back to the later period of Plato's thought, the period when Plato endeavoured to combine his doctrine of Ideas with Pythagorean number theory, and identified the Good with the Monad (which would give rise to the Neoplatonic concept of the One), the source of the duality of the Infinite and the Measured with the resultant scale of realities from the One down to the objects of the material world. They emphasized the fundamental distinction between the soul and the body. God must be worshipped spiritually by prayer and the will to be good, not in outward action. The soul must be freed from its material surrounding, the \\"muddy vesture of decay,\\" by an ascetic habit of life. Bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses must be abandoned as detrimental to the spiritual purity of the soul. God is the principle of good, Matter the groundwork of Evil. In this system can be distinguished not only the asceticism of Pythagoras and the later mysticism of Plato, but also the influence of the Orphic mysteries and of Oriental philosophy. The Ideas of Plato are no longer self-subsistent entities but are the elements which constitute the content of spiritual activity. The non-material universe is regarded as the sphere of mind or spirit.

They wore no clothing during their religious services. There were later reports of similar sects in Central Europe during the Late Middle Ages.  Ancient Adamites  The obscure sect, dating probably from the 2nd century, professed to have regained Adam's primeval innocence. Various accounts are given of their origin. Some have thought them to have been an offshoot of the Carpocratian Gnostics, who professed a sensual mysticism and a complete emancipation from the moral law. Theodoret (Haer. Fab., I, 6) held this view of them, and identified them with the licentious sects whose practices are described by Clement of Alexandria. Others, on the contrary, consider them to have been misguided ascetics, who strove to extirpate carnal desires by a return to simpler manners, and by the abolition of marriage. St. Epiphanius and Augustine of Hippo mention the Adamites by name, and describe their practices. They called their church \\"Paradise\\", claiming that its members were re-established in Adam and Eve's state of original innocence. Accordingly, they practiced \\"holy nudism\\", rejected the form of marriage as foreign to Eden, saying it would never have existed but for sin, lived in absolute lawlessness, holding that, whatever they did, their actions could be neither good nor bad. Neo-Adamites Practices similar to those just described appeared in Europe several times in later ages. During the Middle Ages the doctrines of this obscure sect, which did not itself exist long, were revived: in the 13th century in the Netherlands by the Brethren of the Free Spirit and the Taborites in Bohemia, and, in the 14th century, by some German Beghards. Everywhere they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches. The Taborite movement was started in 1419 in opposition to the authority of the Holy Roman Empire. One sect of Taborites, the Bohemian Adamites, dissociated themselves from other Taborites and took up the practice of going naked through towns and villages. They preached that \\"God dwelt in the Saints of the Last Days\\" and considered exclusive marriage to be a sin. The historian Norman Cohn observed: \\"Whereas the Taborites were strictly monogamous, in this sect free love seems to have been the rule. The Adamites declared that the chaste were unworthy to enter the Messianic kingdom ... The sect was much given to ritual naked dances held around a fire. Indeed, these people seemed to have spent much of their time naked, ignoring the heat and cold and claiming to be in the state of innocence enjoined by Adam and Eve.\\" Cohn also commented that the Adamites were criticised by other Taborites for \\"never thinking of earning their own living by the work of their hands\\". The Beghards became the Picards of Bohemia, who took possession of an island in the river Nežárka, and lived communally, practicing social and religious nudity, free love and rejecting marriage and individual ownership of property. Jan Žižka, the Hussite leader, nearly exterminated the sect in 1421.Konstantin von Höfler, Geschichtsquellen Böhmens, I, 414, 431. In the following year, the sect was widely spread over Bohemia and Moravia, and especially hated by the Hussites (whom they resembled in hatred toward the hierarchy) because the Adamites rejected transubstantiation, the priesthood and the Supper. The strife between the Adamites and the Taborites is dramatized in Against All, the third part of Otakar Vávra's Hussite film trilogy (1958). The splintering of Protestantism during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 17th century saw Adamites recorded in the Catalogue of the Several Sects and Opinions in England. A revival of these doctrines took place in Bohemia in the region of Chrudim after 1781, owing to the edict of toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II. This secret group of Adamites was first mentioned in 1783, then again in 1849. However, a letter to the \\"Neues Wiener Tagblatt\\" in 1874, which claimed to be authored by Adamites in Vienna, appears to be a hoax.

It was originally released for MS-DOS in 1995 and was updated and re-released for iOS in 2011 by The Logic Factory. Ascendancy is a galactic struggle to become the dominant life form, hence the title. The game's introductory cinematic states: \\"Wildly different cultures competed for the same worlds. In the enormous upheaval that followed, one of these species would gain ascendancy.\\"Ascendancy \\"Introduction\\" cinematic. The iOS version of Ascendancy was a Universal app, meaning it was designed for both the iPad and the iPhone / iPod touch platforms. The original Ascendancy was released during a golden age of 4X space games in the mid-1990s. Several reviewers praised the game for having great graphics being entertaining, and being fun to play. The original version of the game won the Software Publisher's Association Codie award for Best Strategy Software of 1996, as voted on by games industry members. The music of the game was composed by Nenad Vugrinec. Gameplay In Ascendancy the player takes on the role of leader of an alien species, tasked with guiding their people into space to explore and colonize other worlds.Ascendancy Manual, The Logic Factory, 1995, Prologue. The player does this by building structures and space ships, researching technology and growing stronger through war or diplomacy. The System Display gives the player control of planets, spaceships, and interstellar combat. Here a Capelon player targets an enemy ship with an Orbital Whopper.Players begin with a single colony planet which must be developed. They can select several types of buildings to construct on the planet's surface and can eventually construct spaceships and leave the planet altogether. Ships travel to other solar systems along determined paths, called star lanes. Spaceships can peacefully colonize unoccupied planets or invade inhabited planets and usurp structures. They can also do battle with enemy planets or other ships. Ascendancy's primary display is a three-dimensional rotatable model of the star cluster, which details the star cluster's solar systems, starlanes, and civilizations. The player can \\"zoom in\\" to view rotatable models of solar systems (including planets and ships); view a planet's surface and use various screens to manage their fleet, planets and research. This play style is similar to the Master of Orion series. = Planets = Planets contain colored squares which can prevent construction or grant a bonus to certain types of buildings.On each planet the player must manage three areas of development: Research, Industry and Prosperity. Research points are shared among all colonies and allow the player to learn new technology, such as advanced building structures or spaceship components. Industry, meanwhile, is local to each colony and determines how quickly that planet can complete projects. Prosperity determines how quickly a planet's population will grow, providing additional workers for future construction.Ascendancy Manual, The Logic Factory, 1995, p. 6. Players begin with the ability to construct buildings for each of these areas and can discover more as the game progresses. Planet topography is expressed as various colored squares. White squares are general purpose, where any structure can be built. Green squares increase the output of Prosperity- producing buildings, while red squares improve Industry and blue squares improve Research.Ascendancy Manual, The Logic Factory, 1995, p. 18. There are also black squares, which are initially uninhabitable but can be used later in the game as the player researches technology. Planets have ten orbital squares that can be used to build shipyards, planetary defenses, space ships, and other space structures. As the player explores other planets they may occasionally find ruins from an ancient civilization. These ruins can be harvested to gain undiscovered technologies, which can significantly alter the game. =Diplomacy= The Diplomacy screen lets players forge alliances, declare war or exchange information with other species.Ascendancy contains a Diplomacy screen where players can offer alliances to other species, declare war and exchange information on star lanes, planets or research. Players can request military assistance from their allies or attempt to end declarations of war with hostile factions.Ascendancy Manual, The Logic Factory, 1995, p. 32. There is also an Intelligence display where the player can view information on the relative power of known species. =Game parameters= Players can select several parameters to change the style of game.When starting a new game players select several parameters, including their species, a star density, a political atmosphere and the number of opponents. There are 21 species to choose from in Ascendancy, each of which has a unique special ability. Some abilities can be used at regular intervals, such as the Capelon's ability to make their colonies temporarily invulnerable. Other abilities, such as the Chronomyst traveling quickly through star lanes, are continually active. All opponent species (numbering from two to six) are controlled by a computer AI and are selected randomly. The star density in each game determines how many solar systems exist in the star cluster - the higher the density the more planets that are available to colonize. Star density affects both the length of the game, as large star clusters will take longer to conquer, as well as affecting how quickly species will encounter each other and how much room they have to grow. Once a density is selected the particular type of each star system is generated randomly at the start of the game. Selecting a political atmosphere of Peaceful, Neutral or Hostile determines the attitude of computer opponents when they have a colony in the same system as another species.Ascendancy Manual, The Logic Factory, 1995, p. 12. Even though the player has control over several things, the combination of random opponent species, random planet topography and random star types leads to a large variety of games. Plot Several of the species in Ascendancy describe motivations for reaching to the stars. Some species are peaceful diplomats; some are curious explorers; and others want to kill or conquer other forms of life. However, plot in Ascendancy is thin. Players are free to imagine a detailed storyline but most plot is restricted to a single introductory screen for each species and a synopsis given at the end of each game. Development The Logic Factory said that inspiration for Ascendancy came from \\"[having] read the fantastic books or watched some of the great shows that have explored the possibility of human contact with intelligent alien life. We do believe that there is a high likelihood that among the many billions of stars and planets just in our own Milky Way, other life is out there. ...This [game] is our own way of being part of that inevitable adventure.\\"\\"Ascendancy FAQ\\".

Reception Some reviewers sang high praises for Ascendancy upon release - the game won the Codie award for Best Strategy Software in 1996, while Next Generation Magazine called Ascendancy \\"one of the best space- strategy sims\\" and said \\"the variety of species will give you hours of replay value.\\"\\"Ascendancy Review\\". Next Generation Magazine (December 1995), p. 188. In his 1995 PC Gamer review William Trotter called Ascendancy \\"simply the best game of its type yet published\\"Trotter, William R. \\"Archived Reviews - Ascendancy\\", PC Gamer Magazine (November 1995). Archived from the original on 1999-08-19. Accessed 2010-02-10. and gave it the PC Gamer Editor's Choice award. Trotter was also one of the authors of the official Ascendancy strategy guide. Bruce Geryk said \\"the graphics were excellent, and the method of ship design was quite engaging,\\" while Andy Bucher of PC Gamer UK said \\"it looks great ... everything looks slick, clean and well designed ... Ascendancy mixes just about the right level of complexity and challenge with an intuitive interface, great graphics and the odd spark of humour.\\"Andy Bucher. \\"Archived Reviews - Ascendancy\\", PC Gamer UK Magazine (June 2002). Archived from the original on 2002-05-31. Accessed 2010-12-08 Bucher even noted that Ascendancy had \\"one of the best tutorials [he'd] ever seen\\", and said the game's \\"attention to detail and ease of use is much rarer than it should be.\\" Other critics decried Ascendancy, however, for its unchallenging Artificial Intelligence as well as the excessive micromanagement required to compensate, because the AI is not only unchallenging as an opponent, but utterly unproficient at managing the player's planet and ships. In his look back at the history of space games, Geryk said \\"Ascendancy had the misfortune of being released with just about the worst AI ever in a computer game, to the extent that playing against the computer was almost pointless\\". Even Bucher said \\"the key problem lies in the artificial intelligence.\\" A patch was released under the name Antagonizer, which was specifically designed to make the AI more challenging. It did this by making the enemies far more hostile towards the player but not toward each other, giving them the significant industrial advantage of allowing them to build their first 3 structures on their new planetary colonies in one day each, having the NPC species build the right structures on the right colored squares and having attacking ships stop right outside of range of orbital missile bases the player has in orbit, if they have weapons with sufficient range to attack the planet from a safe distance. The iOS version of Ascendancy released in 2011 included the AI from this patch, as well as other modifications. Notes = Sources = *Ascendancy Game Manual, The Logic Factory, 1995.

It was the first appearance of Scrooge McDuck. The story was the inspiration for a lot of future Scrooge stories. Scrooge did not yet have his familiar characteristics in his first comic story. In Christmas on Bear Mountain, Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, reasonably wealthy old man, visibly leaning on his cane. He was living in isolation in a \\"huge mansion\\", which is said to be influenced by Xanadu from Orson Welles's Citizen Kane. Scrooge has always been a somewhat bitter character, but his misanthropic thoughts in this first story are probably less characteristic of Scrooge than those of his rival Flintheart Glomgold: \\"Here I sit in this big lonely dump, waiting for Christmas to pass! Bah! That silly season when everybody loves everybody else! A curse on it! Me—I'm different! Everybody hates me, and I hate everybody!\\" Plot As usual, Donald doesn't have enough money to celebrate Christmas with his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie. But, they are unexpectedly invited by his uncle Scrooge to his chalet on the Bear Mountain. The misanthropic rich duck wants to stifle his boredom this Christmas by testing his nephew's courage, and plans to dress up as a bear. But a bear cub sneaks in the cabin as the ducks get a Christmas tree. Eventually the mother comes looking for the cub, and scare the Ducks out of the cabin. The bears eat the food in the house and the mother bear falls asleep in front of the fireplace. The Ducks make a plan to get the bears out of the cabin, and Donald has to tie the legs of the mother bear together while Huey, Dewey and Louie catch the cub. Donald fails to tie the feet of the bear together and faints on an arm of the bear, giving an impression that he fell asleep on the bear. Meanwhile, Scrooge comes in and finds the boys chasing the cub, thinking that they are fearless. Then he finds Donald asleep with the bear, and Scrooge thinks he's purposely sleeping with the bear and thinks that Donald doesn't know the meaning of fear. Scrooge retreats unnoticed and returns the next day to spend Christmas Dinner in his mansion with his nephews. Don Rosa This story later inspired The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Part 12 by Don Rosa. In Rosa's story, which takes place on the day right after Christmas Eve, but before the dinner at Scrooge's mansion, Huey, Dewey and Louie are first officially introduced to their uncle Scrooge. Donald, however, makes references to a previous encounter between him and Scrooge. Rosa's story shows Scrooge being well known to everybody in Duckburg and it could be said Donald and the nephews hoped (with little to no enthusiasm) their stingy uncle to remember them. One detail in Rosa's story that does not fit in Christmas on Bear Mountain is Scrooge's appearance. However, this choice was intentionally made as Rosa wanted to maintain Scrooge's more well-known appearance.

As of July 2007, Pleasant Hill has a total population of 5,665.  History  Pleasant Hill was the first white settlement in Lane County when Elijah Bristow settled in 1846. He was the first of a party of four immigrants to settle, most recently from California. Also in the party was Eugene Skinner, Captain Felix Scott, and William Dodson. Dodson and Scott took up adjacent claims, Dodson to the southeast and Scott to the west of Bristow's claim. Scott later abandoned and claimed opposite the mouth of the Mohawk River, some north of his previous claim. Skinner made his claim at what is now Eugene. Pleasant Hill has survived numerous house fires and light flooding in lower areas, but the most remembered flood was in 1996. The flooding resulted in no deaths but many homes were destroyed.  Geography  Pleasant Hill is from Creswell, in the area between the Coast Fork Willamette River and the Middle Fork Willamette River.  Education  Public schools in Pleasant Hill include the OSAA class 3A Pleasant Hill High School and an Elementary School. Due to decreased enrollment and budget issues, Trent Elementary School has been closed. At this time, grades K-5 attend the Elementary and grades 6-12 attend the High School. Emerald Christian Academy, a private Seventh-Day Adventist K-10 school, is also located in Pleasant Hill. Notable person Pleasant Hill was the home of author and counter-cultural figure Ken Kesey, who died in 2001.

The museum attempts to recreate the sights, sounds and smells of a Victorian Shropshire town in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of ten museums operated by the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust. Originally Blists Hill was an industrial region consisting of a brick and tile works, blast furnaces and coal, iron and fire clay mines. The museum was opened in 1973 and has been growing ever since. The museum's buildings fall into one of three categories, buildings that were already part of the industrial site, buildings that represent a generic type and original buildings that have been relocated to the museum. The museum has three districts, a town area with Victorian era shops such as a bank, bakery, bicycle shop and post office. An industrial district that provided various employment from a blast furnace and wrought iron works and a countryside district with buildings such as a squatters cottage and tin roof church. The museum has been used as a venue for various TV and film programmes including Doctor Who and Blue Peter. History of the site The coal mine and Shropshire Canal In the 18th and 19th centuries, Blists Hill was an industrial region consisting of a brick and tile works, blast furnaces and coal, iron and fire clay mines operated by the Madeley Wood Company. A short section of the Shropshire Canal ran across the site to the Hay Inclined Plane, which transported boats up and down the tall incline from Blists Hill to Coalport. Open-air museum =Introduction= Blists Hill Victorian Town, originally called Blists Hill Open Air Museum, was opened in 1973, and has been slowly growing ever since. The museum's buildings fall into one of three categories: buildings that were already part of the industrial site (e.g. the brickworks); buildings that simply represent a generic type (e.g. the sweet shop), some adaptively reusing existing premises on site or being replicas of those still standing elsewhere; and original buildings that have been relocated to the museum (e.g. The New Inn public house, which originally stood between Green Lane and Hospital Street in Walsall). Each building is staffed by one or more costumed demonstrators, who have been trained in the skills and history of the profession they re-enact. For example, in the printshop, visitors can watch posters and newssheets being printed. The demonstrators normally talk in the third person, referring to the Victorians as \\"they\\" or \\"them\\" (rather than in the first person \\"I\\" or \\"we\\" which some similar museums employ): the museum management believes that this allows greater scope for comparing modern techniques with those re-enacted at the museum. Staff may also be seen performing such diverse tasks as operating stationary steam engines, iron founding and mucking out pigs. A Penny token as used in Blists Hill The first building visitors see in the museum is the bank (modelled on the still- standing Lloyds Bank branch in Broseley), at which they can change modern coinage into token coinage that represents the predecimal farthings, halfpennies, pennies, threepenny bits and sixpences, at an exchange rate of 40 new pence to 1 old penny. They can then use the token coins as an alternative to modern currency for buying goods whilst visiting the museum (the gift shop at the museum entrance operates only in modern currency). =Town area= The High Street area of the Upper Town has been developed around a London and North Western Railway interchange siding with a plateway which is an original feature of the site. Shops erected on the site include a chemist (with fittings from Bournemouth), butcher (from Ironbridge), grocer (replica of a building from Oakengates), and printer (with equipment from Kington, Herefordshire). Small crafts include an iron foundry, a shoeing smith, bootmaker, locksmith, decorative plasterer (with equipment from Burton upon Trent), builder, and sawmill. Premises in Quarry Bank include a tallow candle manufactory (from Madeley), a bakery (from Dawley), a physician's surgery (in a Sutherland Estate cottage from Donnington), and a Board School (from Stirchley). Recent new developments have included the addition of 'Canal Street', which was a new build closely modelled on extant and historic buildings in the Telford area. This area includes a new Fish and Chip Shop, Drapers shop and Post Office, as well as an enlarged Sweet Shop. A walkway is located at the end of Canal Street, which leads visitors to the ruins of the brick and tile works. Adjacent to the ruins, and on select days, an operational replica of a steam locomotive designed and built by Richard Trevithick in 1802 runs on a short segment of narrow gauge track.Steamlocomotive.info - Coalbrookdale Locomotive Replica The original locomotive was the world's first steam locomotive on rails and was commissioned by the Coalbrookdale Company, which was located nearby (however, no record exists of this locomotive ever being successfully run). In 2015, the Trevithick Shed was built to house the locomotive when not in use. =Ironworks area= Blowing engine house and blast furnaces at Blists Hill The original Madeley Wood Company blast furnaces produced pig iron from 1832 to 1911. Their remains have been conserved and a blowing engine from the Lilleshall Company’s Priorslee Ironworks installed in one of the houses. Nearby are displayed a pair of beam engines from the same location, alongside a wrought iron works using equipment from Thomas Walmsley's Atlas Forge in Bolton in an iron-framed building designed by Rennie for Woolwich Dockyard. =Countryside area= The more remote parts of the site demonstrate natural recolonisation of an industrial landscape. Amongst buildings re-erected in this area are a corrugated iron tin tabernacle, (St Chad's Mission Church from Lodge Bank), a squatter cottage (from Dawley), and a toll house (designed by Telford for the Holyhead Road at Shelton). =New developments= In 2009 a £12 million programme of redevelopment was completed which included the previously discussed buildings on Canal Street, a new World Heritage Visitor Centre, a narrow gaugeGeoff's Rail Diaries - Ancient and modern at Blists Hill Mine Railway, and a Inclined Lift. The mine railway is intended to represent a 1920s clay mine, although the rolling stock is modern and the mine is formed by a concrete bunker. The inclined lift is entirely modern, and enables visitors with restricted mobility to access the lower part of the site. The project did not fund the restoration of the Scheduled Ancient Monuments and associated archaeological features on the site. =Hay inclined plane= Hay Inclined Plane The Hay Inclined Plane is a canal inclined plane with a height of 207 feet that is located on a short stretch of the Shropshire Canal that linked the industrial area of Blists Hill with the River Severn. The inclined plane was in operation from 1792 to 1894 and can be visited as part of the Blists Hill Victorian Town and is also a waypoint on the South Telford Heritage Trail. In operation box-shaped tub boats 20 feet long were taken up and down the plane on twin railway tracks, an empty boat would be loaded into the river at the bottom and a full boat would be loaded into the canal at the top, a rope would connect the two so that gravity would drop the loaded boat down to the river counterbalanced by an empty boat being raised to the canal. At the bottom of the incline the rails went underwater allowing the boats to float free. Filming location Blists Hill has been used as a filming location on several occasions. In 1979, the children's television series Blue Peter included an item shot at the museum. The director of the piece subsequently chose it to be the principal filming location for the 1985 Doctor Who serial The Mark of the Rani. The 1995 film Feast of July was shot at Blists Hill. An episode of Antiques Roadshow was filmed at the location in September 2009. In 2010, Victorian Pharmacy, which was a historical documentary looking at life in the 19th century, used Blists Hill to recreate the scene at an everyday pharmacy.

English Dissenters or English Separatists were Protestant Christians who separated from the Church of England in the 17th and 18th centuries. A dissenter (from the Latin dissentire, \\"to disagree\\") is one who disagrees in opinion, belief and other matters. English Dissenters opposed state interference in religious matters, and founded their own churches, educational establishments and communities. Some emigrated to the New World, especially to the Thirteen Colonies and Canada. Brownists founded the Plymouth colony. English dissenters played a pivotal role in the spiritual development of the United States and greatly diversified the religious landscape. They originally agitated for a wide- reaching Protestant Reformation of the established Church of England, and they flourished briefly during the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell. King James VI of Scotland, I of England and Ireland, had said \\"no bishop, no king\\", emphasising the role of the clergy in justifying royal legitimacy. Cromwell capitalised on that phrase, abolishing both upon founding the Commonwealth of England. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the episcopacy was reinstalled and the rights of the Dissenters were limited: the Act of Uniformity 1662 required Anglican ordination for all clergy, and many instead withdrew from the state church. These ministers and their followers came to be known as Nonconformists, though originally this term referred to refusal to use certain vestments and ceremonies of the Church of England, rather than separation from it. Organised dissenting groups (17th century) In existence during the English Interregnum (1649–1660): =Anabaptists= Anabaptist (literally, \\"baptised again\\") was a term given to those Reformation Christians who rejected the notion of infant baptism in favour of believer's baptism. It is generally assumed that during the Interregnum, the Baptists and other dissenting groups absorbed the British Anabaptists. Despite this, evidence suggests that the early relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were quite strained. In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued an anathema against the Anabaptists. Even today there is still very little dialogue between Anabaptist organisations (such as the Mennonite World Conference) and the Baptist bodies. =Barrowists= Henry Barrowe maintained the right and duty of the Church to carry out necessary reforms without awaiting the permission of the civil power; and advocated congregational independence. He regarded the whole established church order as polluted by the relics of Roman Catholicism, and insisted on separation as essential to pure worship and discipline. =Behmenists= The Behmenists religious movement began on continental Europe and took its ideas from the writings of Jakob Böhme (Behmen being one of the adaptations of his name used in England), a German mystic and theosopher who claimed Divine Revelation.. In the 1640s, his works appeared in England and English Behmenists developed. Eventually, some of these merged with the Quakers of the time. Böhme's writings primarily concerned the nature of sin, evil and redemption. Consistent with Lutheran theology, Böhme believed that humanity had fallen from a state of divine grace into a state of sin and suffering, that the forces of evil included fallen angels who had rebelled against God, and subsequently that God's goal was to restore the world to a state of grace. However, in some ways, Behmenist belief deviated significantly from traditional Lutheran belief. For example, Böhme rejected the concepts of sola fide and sola gratia. =Brownists= By 1580, Robert Browne had become a leader in the movement for a congregational form of organisation for the Church of England and attempted to set up a separate Congregational Church in Norwich, Norfolk, England. He was arrested but released on the advice of William Cecil, his kinsman. Browne and his companions moved to Middelburg in the Netherlands in 1581. He returned to England in 1585 and to the Church of England, being employed as a schoolmaster and parish priest. =Diggers= The Diggers were an English group of Protestant agrarian communists, begun by Gerrard Winstanley as True Levellers in 1649, who became known as Diggers due to their activities. Their original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the Book of Acts. The Diggers tried (by \\"levelling\\" real property) to reform the existing social order with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small egalitarian rural communities. They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time. =Enthusiasts= Several Protestant sects of the 16th and 17th centuries were called Enthusiastic. During the years that immediately followed the Glorious Revolution, \\"enthusiasm\\" was a British pejorative term for advocacy of any political or religious cause in public. Such \\"enthusiasm\\" was seen in the time around 1700 as the cause of the previous century's civil war and its attendant atrocities, and thus it was an absolute social sin to remind others of the war by engaging in enthusiasm. During the 18th century, popular Methodists such as John Wesley or George Whitefield were accused of blind enthusiasm (i.e., fanaticism), a charge against which they defended themselves by distinguishing fanaticism from \\"religion of the heart\\". =Familists= The Familia Caritatis (\\"Family of Love\\", or the \\"Familists\\"), were a religious sect that began in continental Europe in the 16th century. Members of this religious group were devout followers of a Dutch mystic named Hendrik Niclaes. The Familists believed that Niclaes was the only person who truly knew how to achieve a state of perfection, and his texts attracted followers in Germany, France, and England. The Familists were extremely secretive and wary of outsiders. For example, they wished death upon those outside of the Family of Love, and re-marriage after the death of a spouse could only take place between men and women of the same Familist congregation. Additionally, they would not discuss their ideas and opinions with outsiders and sought to remain undetected by ordinary members of society: they tended to be members of an established church so as not to attract suspicion and showed respect for authority. The group were considered heretics in 16th-century England. Among their beliefs were that there existed a time before Adam and Eve, Heaven and Hell were both present on Earth, and that all things were ruled by nature and not directed by God. The Familists continued to exist until the middle of the 17th century, when they were absorbed into the Quaker movement. =Fifth Monarchists= The Fifth Monarchists or Fifth Monarchy Men were active from 1649 to 1661 during the Interregnum, following the English Civil Wars of the 17th century. They took their name from a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that four ancient monarchies (Babylonian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman) would precede Christ's return. They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical Number of the Beast indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings. They were one of a number of Nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time. =Grindletonians= In a sermon preached at Paul's Cross on 11 February 1627, and published under the title of The White Wolfe, 1627, Stephen Denison, minister of St. Catherine Cree, charges the 'Gringltonian (sic) familists' with holding nine points of an antinomian tendency. These nine points are repeated from Denison by Ephraim Pagitt in his Heresiography (2nd ed. 1645, p. 89), and glanced at by Alexander Ross, Πανσεβεια (2nd ed. 1655, p. 365). In 1635 John Webster, curate at Kildwick, was before a church court charged with being a Grindletonian, and simultaneously in New England John Winthrop thought that Anne Hutchinson was one. The last known Grindletonian died in the 1680s. =Levellers= The Levellers were a political movement during the English Civil War that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law and religious tolerance. Levellers tended to hold fast to a notion of \\"natural rights\\" that had been violated by the king's side in the civil wars (1642–1651). At the Putney Debates in 1647, Colonel Thomas Rainsborough defended natural rights as coming from the law of God expressed in the Bible. =Muggletonians= The Muggletonians, named after Lodowicke Muggleton, was a small Protestant Christian movement which began in 1651 when two London tailors announced they were the last prophets foretold in the biblical Book of Revelation. The group grew out of the Ranters and in opposition to the Quakers. Muggletonian beliefs include a hostility to philosophical reason, a scriptural understanding of how the universe works and a belief that God appeared directly on this earth as Christ Jesus. A consequential belief is that God takes no notice of everyday events on earth and will not generally intervene until it is meet to bring the world to an end. Muggletonians avoided all forms of worship or preaching and, in the past, met only for discussion and socialising amongst members. The movement was egalitarian, apolitical, and pacifist, and resolutely avoided evangelism. Members attained a degree of public notoriety by cursing those who reviled their faith. =Puritans= The Puritans were a significant grouping of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries. Puritanism in this sense was founded by some Marian exiles from the clergy shortly after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, as an activist movement within the Church of England. The designation \\"Puritan\\" is often incorrectly used, notably based on the assumption that hedonism and puritanism are antonyms: historically, the word was used to characterise the Protestant group as extremists similar to the Cathari of France, and according to Thomas Fuller in his Church History dated back to 1564. Archbishop Matthew Parker of that time used it and \\"precisian\\" with the sense of stickler. T. D. Bozeman therefore uses instead the term precisianist in regard to the historical groups of England and New England. =Philadelphians= The Philadelphians, or the Philadelphian Society, were a Protestant 17th-century religious group in England. They were organised around John Pordage (1607–1681), an Anglican priest from Bradfield, Berkshire, who had been ejected from his parish in 1655 because of differing views, but then reinstated in 1660 during the English Restoration. Pordage was attracted to the ideas of Jakob Böhme, a Lutheran theosophist and Christian mystic. =Quakers= The Quakers were a loosely knit group of teachers that grew out of the Seekers. George Fox's journal attributes the name \\"Quaker\\" to a judge in 1650 calling them Quakers \\"because I bid them tremble before the Lord\\". =Ranters= The Ranters were a sect in the time of the Commonwealth (1649–1660) who were regarded as heretical by the established Church of that period. Their central idea was pantheistic, that God is essentially in every creature; this led them to deny the authority of the Church, of scripture, of the current ministry and of services, instead calling on men to hearken to Jesus within them. Many Ranters seem to have rejected a belief in immortality and in a personal God, and in many ways they resemble the Brethren of the Free Spirit in the 14th century.. The Ranters revived the Brethren of the Free Spirit's beliefs of amoralism and followed the Brethren's ideals which \\"stressed the desire to surpass the human condition and become godlike\\". Further drawing from the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Ranters embraced antinomianism and believed that Christians are freed by grace from the necessity of obeying Mosaic Law. Because they believed that God was present in all living creatures, the Ranters' adherence to antinomianism allowed them to reject the very notion of obedience, thus making them a great threat to the stability of the government. =Sabbatarians= Sabbatarians were known in England from the time of Elizabeth I (1558–1603). Access to the Bible in English allowed anyone who could read English to study scripture and question Church doctrines, including challenging the Christian day of worship (sabbath) being on Sunday rather than the Judaic and early Christian Saturday. Some Dutch Anabaptists embraced Sabbatarianism, and may have helped to introduce these practices into England. Socinians and Reformed Church members were also known to hold Sabbatarian beliefs. Sabbatarian practitioners were also to be found within the Church of England in one form or another. Even the Puritans were known to harbour Sabbatarian views. English Sabbatarianism is generally associated with John Traske (1585–1636), Theophilus Brabourne (1590–1662) and Dorothy Traske (c. 1585–1645), who also played a major role in keeping the early Traskite congregations growing in numbers. =Seekers= The Seekers were not a distinct religion or sect, but instead formed a religious society. Like other Protestant dissenting groups, they believed the Roman Catholic Church to be corrupt, which subsequently applied to the Church of England as well through its common heritage. Seekers considered all churches and denominations to be in error, and believed that only a new church established by Christ upon his return could possess his grace. Their anticipation of this event was found in their practices. For example, Seekers held meetings as opposed to religious services, and as such had no clergy or hierarchy. During these gatherings they would wait in silence and speak only when felt that God had inspired them to do so. Furthermore, to this, the Seekers denied the effectiveness of external forms of religion such as the sacraments, baptism and the Scriptures as a means of salvation. =Socinians= The followers of Socinianism were Unitarian or Nontrinitarian in theology and influenced by the Polish Brethren. The Socinians of 17th century England influenced the development of the English Presbyterians, the English Unitarians and the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland. 18th century dissenters In the 18th century, one group of Dissenters became known as \\"Rational Dissenters\\". In many respects they were closer to the Anglicanism of their day than other Dissenting sects; however, they believed that state religions impinged on the freedom of conscience. They were fiercely opposed to the hierarchical structure of the Established Church and the financial ties between it and the government. Like moderate Anglicans, they desired an educated ministry and an orderly church, but they based their opinions on the Bible and on reason rather than on appeals to tradition and authority. They rejected doctrines such as the original sin or Trinity, arguing that they were irrational. Rational Dissenters believed that Christianity and faith could be dissected and evaluated using the newly emerging discipline of science, and that a stronger belief in God would be the result.Philip, 36. Another significant dissenting tradition that emerged at the end of the 18th century is the Swedenborgian church, which continues today in several branches around the world. It originated in an organized way in London in 1780. Beginning as groups reading Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), whose members were composed largely of Methodists, Baptists, and Anglicans, some of the Swedenborgian enthusiasts became disillusioned with the prospects for thorough Swedenborgian theological reform within their respective traditions. These left those churches to form the General Conference of the New Jerusalem, often called simply the New Church. Other Swedenborgian converts, such as Anglican Rev. John Clowes and Rev. Thomas Hartley, argued for remaining within existing traditions. Swedenborg himself did not call for a new organization, but for profound theological reform for the existing churches. At the end of his life, he endured a rare Swedish heresy inquiry by the Swedish Lutheran Consistory. He died before it was concluded, and the Consistory shelved the inquiry without reaching a decision. Swedenborg's primary critiques of orthodox theology centred on the tri-personal constructions of the Trinity, the idea of salvation by faith alone, and the vicarious atonement. He revived an allegorical tradition of reading scripture, which he believed was composed in correspondences. He believed in a theory of symbolic values in the literal text, which could produce an inner sense wherein the individual could ascertain the new theology.

This international standard specifies the bibliographic elements that need to be included in references to published documents, and the order in which these elements should be stated. Characteristics ISO 690 governs bibliographic references to published material in both print and non-print documents. The current version of the standard was published in 2010 and covers all kinds of information resources, including monographs, serials, contributions, patents, cartographic materials, electronic information resources (including computer software and databases), music, recorded sound, prints, photographs, graphic and audiovisual works, and moving images. ISO 690 ranks among a number of ISO standards that bear on academic publishing, such as ISO 214, which establishes rules for abstracts; ISO 2145, which deals with numbering of divisions and subdivisions of written documents; and ISO 2014 and ISO 3166, which, respectively, establish the correct use of dates and country codes. Punctuation and style are not part of the standard; largely, the standard governs content rather than presentation. ISO 690 prescribes a referencing scheme with a fixed order of bibliographic elements in which the publication date appears after the \\"production information\\" of place and publisher, but it allows an exception for the Harvard system, in which the date appears after the creator name(s). The standard allows for three citation methods: name and date (\\"Harvard system\\"), in which the creator's name and the year of publication of the resource cited are given in the text; numeric, in which numerals in the text – either in parentheses, brackets or superscript – refer to resources in the order in which they are first cited; and running notes, in which numerals in the text – either in parentheses, brackets or superscript – refer to notes, which are numbered in order of their occurrence in the text. Publication history The first edition of the ISO 690 standard was published in 1975. The second edition, published in 1987, includes elements specific to patent citations, rendering obsolete the ISO 3388:1977 standard devoted to them. In 1997, ISO published a second part, devoted to the citation of electronic documents. As a consequence, the ISO 690 standard consisted of two separate parts from 1997 to 2010: ISO 690:1987, dealing with documents in general, and ISO 690-2:1997, dealing with electronic documents in particular. In 2010, these two documents were revised and merged into a single work, constituting the third edition of the standard.

The inclined plane was in operation from 1793 to 1894. It can be visited as part of the Blists Hill Victorian Town and is also a waypoint on the South Telford Heritage Trail. History The proprietors of the Shropshire Canal held a competition in 1788 to find the best means of raising and lowering heavy weights between the canal and the river Severn. They selected a design by Henry Williams and James Loudon, which was also used at a number of other inclined planes in east Shropshire. Construction of the Hay inclined plane was completed in 1793. By 1820 it was in poor condition and substantial repairs were needed. Further repairs were also carried out in the 1940s.Ironbridge Gorge Museum information boards In 1857 the Hay inclined plane was taken over by the London and North Western Railway. The following year the LNWR closed the Shropshire canal between the Wrockwardine Wood and Windmill inclined planes, leaving only a short section of canal to serve the industrial area of Blists Hill. In 1861 they opened the Coalport branch line from Wellington to Coalport which passed underneath the Hay inclined plane near Coalport. The last recorded use of the Hay inclined plane was thought to be in 1894 and it was formally closed in 1907. It was restored in 1968 and again in 1975, including the reinstatement of rails, as part of the creation of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Operation The Shropshire Canal used box-shaped tub boats long with a load capacity of 5 tons. Twin railway tracks were laid down the incline. The tub boats ascended and descended the inclined plane on wheeled cradles which ran on the rails. At the bottom of the incline the rails went underwater allowing the cradle to become submerged and the tub boat to either float free or be floated into position. At the top of the incline the rails also started under water then climbed a short slope out of the water to the top of the incline. In operation an empty boat would be loaded into the bottom cradle and a full boat would be loaded into the top cradle. A rope would be attached to the loaded top cradle and it would be drawn out of the water to the top of the incline using a small winding drum driven by a steam engine. The main incline rope would then be attached to the cradle and the loaded boat would descend the incline, counterbalanced by an empty boat ascending on the other rail line. The speed would be controlled by a brake on the main winding drum. On reaching the summit a rope from the small winding drum would be attached to the cradle to control its descent into the upper basin. Although the loaded boats were travelling downhill, and so the plane was mostly worked by gravity, a small steam engine was also provided and drove the winding drums. This was of Adam Heslop's design, a twin-cylindered rotative beam engine, to a design patented in 1790. The remains of the brick boiler house and winding mechanism may be seen at the top of the incline. The system was worked by four men and took around four minutes to raise or lower a boat.

He has also been referred to as the \\"president of culture\\", as he pioneered the Korean Wave. Lee debuted as a singer in 1971, while he was a student at Seoul National University. He founded SM Entertainment in 1989, which became one of the largest record labels and management companies in South Korea. Biography =1952–1980: Early years and singing career= Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea on 18 June 1952, and attended Seoul National University on and off between 1971 and 1979. He debuted as a singer in 1972, and became known for hit songs such as \\"행복 (Happiness)\\" and \\"한송이 꿈 (A Piece of Dream)\\". In addition to his career as a musician and his studies in university, he also worked as a radio DJ and TV host during this time. In 1980, he formed the band 이수만과 365일 (Lee Soo-man and The 365 Days). However, media censorship policies under the Chun Doo-hwan government discouraged him from a career in the Korean music industry. =1980–1985: Studies in the United States= In the early 1980s, Lee decided to leave the entertainment world in order to pursue a career in computer engineering. He went abroad to work on a master's degree at California State University, Northridge, where he witnessed the rise of \\"superstars of the MTV generation\\" such as Michael Jackson. Inspired by the heyday of MTV in the United States, Lee set his sights on laying the foundation for the modern Korean pop music industry. In 1985, he returned to Korea \\"with a vision of what the Korean music industry could be.\\" =1985–present: Founding SM Entertainment= Following his return to Korea, Lee ventured back into the entertainment world by working as a DJ and presenter. In 1989, after four years of saving money and gaining experience in the industry, he established an entertainment company called SM Studio (named after his initials) in the Apgujeong neighborhood of Seoul, and signed singer Hyun Jin-young. During the 1990s, SM Studio developed an in-house system that looked after all aspects of its artists' careers. Lee's approach was targeted at teenage audiences, and took a holistic view of the qualities needed to become a successful entertainer.Keith Howard Korean pop music: riding the wave 2006– Page 95 \\"together in 1996 by Lee Soo Man, a graduate of Seoul National University and a product of the campus-led song movement.

In February 2010, Lee resigned from his position as a member of SM's board of directors, but maintained a role in the company's \\"management and artist development\\" divisions. On January 23, 2020, Lee Soo Man was listed by Billboard as one of the world's influential music industry leaders. On February 05, 2020, It was revealed by Jeff Benjamin writing for Forbes that Lee Soo Man worked on Korean Girl Group Loona EP [#] which was his first ever project away from namesake SM Entertainment. Personal life Lee's wife, Kim Eunjin, died from cancer on 30 September 2014. He is also the paternal uncle of Sunny, one of the members of the popular SM group Girls' Generation.

She was also the wife of celebrated Dadaist Hugo Ball. Life and work Hennings was born on 17 January 1885 in Flensburg, German Empire, describing herself later as \\"a seaman's child\\". After the end of her first marriage in 1906, Hennings was an itinerant performer, travelling over much of the European continent. She was a performer at the Cabaret Simplizissimus in Munich, when she met Ball in 1913. At the time, Hennings was already a published poet, whose works had appeared in left-wing publications called Pan and Die Aktion. In 1913 she also published a short poetry collection called Ether Poems, or Äthergedichte in German. Later, Hennings was a collaborator to the magazine Revolution, which was founded by Ball and Hans Leybold. Hennings and Ball moved to Zurich in 1915, where they took part in the founding of the Cabaret Voltaire, which marked the beginning of the Dada movement. Hennings was a regular performer at the Cabaret Voltaire. Her performances included a role in Das Leben des Menschen (the Life of a Man), in which she appeared with Ball. This was the German premiere of the play by Leonid Andreev. Hennings also performed in a piece written by Ball, called Krippenspiel. After the Cabaret Voltaire ended, Hennings and Ball toured, performing mostly in hotels. Hennings sang, did puppetry, and danced to music composed by Ball. She also recited her own poetry. In 1916 Ball and Hennings created Arabella, their own ensemble troupe, where Hennings performed under the name Dagny. Hennings married Ball on 21 February 1920. Although they had no children together, Hennings had a daughter, Annemarie, from a previous relationship. Hennings, who outlived Ball by two decades, lived in Magliaso, Switzerland from 1942 to 1948.

Early life Deniehy was born in Sydney, the son of Henry and Mary Deniehy, former convicts of Irish birth who had prospered in the colony after their term had expired. Deniehy was educated at the best schools Sydney then had to offer, including Sydney College, and completed his education in England at his father's expense. He travelled in Europe and visited Ireland, where he met leaders of the Young Ireland party. He was influenced by both English Chartism and Irish nationalism. Returning to Sydney in 1844, he studied law and became a solicitor in 1851. Career Meanwhile, Deniehy became a leading figure in Sydney's small but lively literary world and in radical politics; artist Adelaide Ironside was an associate. Deniehy was a follower of the radical leader John Dunmore Lang (despite Lang's violent dislike of the Irish and of Roman Catholicism), and a member of Lang's organisation, the Australian League. He practised law in Goulburn 1854–58, in Sydney 1858–62, in Melbourne 1862–64 and in Bathurst 1865. In all these places he was active in local politics and journalism. Like Lang, Deniehy was an advocate of extended democracy in the emerging political systems of the Australian colonies. He joined the opposition to the 1853 New South Wales Constitution Bill, which would have created a powerful unelected upper house and limited the franchise for the lower house to those owning substantial property. He was active in the New South Wales Electoral Reform League, which advocated manhood suffrage for the lower house and reduced powers for the upper house. Deniehy argued that the real issue was control of the vast grazing lands of inland New South Wales, which the squatter class of early settlers had seized for themselves. He accused the conservatives, led by the veteran Sydney politician William Wentworth and what Deniehy called \\"some dozen of his friends,\\" of wanting to \\"confiscate for their own uses the finest portions of the public lands, to stereotype themselves into a standing government, so that they may retain, watch over, and protect the booty they wrest.\\" When Wentworth proposed creating a hereditary peerage in New South Wales, Deniehy savagely satirised it: \\"Here,\\" he said, \\"we all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a \\"bunyip aristocracy.\\" (The bunyip is a mythical beast of Aboriginal legend.) His ridicule caused the idea to be dropped. Deniehy was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1857, representing Argyle (the Goulburn region). In 1859 he stood for West Sydney, but was defeated. However he was successful in 1860 representing East Macquarie (the Bathurst region). As a radical democrat, he should have been an effective supporter of the liberal parliamentary leaders Charles Cowper and John Robertson. But he disliked both these leaders, and was temperamentally unable to work in a parliamentary team. He soon became an isolated loner, and began to drink heavily. With the introduction of manhood suffrage in New South Wales in 1858 his campaign for democracy was fulfilled, and he was out of sympathy with the more advanced radicals. Members of Parliament were not paid at this time, and Deniehy always earned his living as a barrister and as a journalist. He founded and edited Southern Cross, a radical newspaper, in 1859. Deniehy had opposed the appointment of Lyttleton Bayley as Attorney General and produced a satire How I Became Attorney-General of New Barataria (Sydney, 1860) which was published in the Southern Cross. In Melbourne in 1862 he edited The Victorian for its owner, the Irish-Australian politician Charles Gavan Duffy. In Sydney he became a notable literary critic, and lectured on modern literature at the newly founded Sydney University. He was a regular contributor to the Irish- Australian newspaper The Freeman's Journal and other papers. Late life Only 150 cm (five feet) tall and in poor health throughout his life, Deniehy possessed enormous energy and was a gifted orator. The Australian historian Manning Clark writes of him: \\"His heart was a battlefield between the cherub and the insect of sensual lust.\\" (He married Adelaide Hoals in 1852 and had seven children in nine years). \\"At times his face caught a fire and beauty that looked like phases of actual transfiguration. At other times his face was coarsened by days of drunken debauchery.\\" He died of alcoholism in Bathurst, aged only 37. In 1895 his remains were exhumed and reburied in Sydney's Waverley Cemetery, where a monument was erected over the grave. An inscription on it reads: :The vehement voice of the South :Is loud where the journalist lies :But calm hath encompassed his mouth, :And sweet is the peace in his eyes. Further reading *E.A.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 21, 2011 river in the U.S. state of Georgia. Its origin is in Hall County and it terminates where it joins the Ocmulgee River to form the Altamaha River near Lumber City at the borders of Montgomery County, Wheeler County, and Jeff Davis County. South of Athens, two forks, known as the Middle Oconee River and North Oconee River, which flow for upstream respectively before converging to form the Oconee River. Milledgeville, the former capital city of Georgia, lies on the Oconee River. The Oconee River Greenway trail along the Oconee River in Milledgeville opened in 2008Oconee River Greenway and the North Oconee River Greenway section of the trail is in Athens, Georgia. J.W. McMillan's brick factory was located along the river. Course The Oconee River passes through the Oconee National Forest into Lake Oconee, a man made lake, near the towns of Madison and Greensboro off Interstate 20. From Lake Oconee, the river travels to Lake Sinclair, another manmade lake in Milledgeville, the town founded on Georgia's Fall Line and former state capital. South of Milledgeville, the river flows unobstructed and later merges with the Ocmulgee River to form the Altamaha River. Along the river there are many sandbars and oxbow lakes while the forest bottomland swamp surrounding the Oconee extends for miles, creating a very remote setting. Name origin The river's name derives from the Oconee, a Muskogean people of central Georgia. The Oconee lived in present-day Baldwin County, Georgia at a settlement known as Oconee Old Town, later moving to the Chattahoochee River in the early 18th century. The name exists in several variations, including Ocone, Oconi, Ocony, and Ekwoni. River pollution One of the main sources of pollution comes from fecal coliform bacteria, several species of bacteria found in human and animal feces. Fecal coliform bacteria enter the river through a number of sources; storm-water runoff leaving farmlands, storm-water runoff carrying pet waste, leaking septic and sewer lines contaminating surface or groundwater, and sewer spills throughout the watershed. Fecal coliform bacteria can be deadly to humans if ingested or acquired through an open wound. Fish caught in the Oconee Basin may be eaten if cooked thoroughly.Georgia Environmental Protective Division; Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Fish Consumption Guidelines http://gaepd.org/Documents/fish_guide.html The second biggest form of pollution in the river is fertilizer. Nitrogen in fertilizer in the form of nitrates or ammonia, measured in parts per million, is found in regularly collected samples. These forms of nitrogen stimulate abundant growth of algae in the water. The third largest source of pollution (?) is sedimentation, typically caused by construction and urbanization.

The ancestors on his father's side came from the town of Mariapfarr in the mountainous Lungau region south of Salzburg, while his mother's family was from the salt-mining city of Hallein. At his baptism shortly after birth, the godfather was recorded as Joseph Wohlmuth, the last official executioner of Salzburg, who did not personally attend but had himself represented by one Franziska Zachin. As the parents were unmarried, Joseph received the name of his father, according to custom. Johann Nepomuk Hiernle, vicar and leader of music at Salzburg Cathedral, enabled Mohr to have an education and encouraged him in music. As a boy, Mohr would serve simultaneously as a singer and violinist in the choirs of the University Church and at the Benedictine monastery church of St. Peter. From 1808 to 1810, Mohr studied at the Benedictine monastery of Kremsmünster in the province of Upper Austria. He then returned to Salzburg to attend the Lyceum school, and in 1811, he entered the seminary. Since he was of illegitimate birth, a special dispensation was required in those days for him to attend seminary. On 21 August 1815, Mohr graduated and was ordained as a priest. Father Mohr In the fall of 1815, Mohr was asked to provide temporary help in the village of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden. Mohr then served as assistant priest in Mariapfarr (1815–1817). It was during this time, in 1816, that he penned the words to \\"Silent Night\\" in Mariapfarr. Poor health forced him to return to Salzburg in the summer of 1817. After a short recuperation he began serving as an assistant priest at St. Nicholas in Oberndorf, where he made the acquaintance of Franz Gruber, schoolteacher in neighbouring Arnsdorf. =Stille Nacht= Stille Nacht by Joseph Mohr On a cold Christmas Eve in 1818, Mohr walked the three kilometres from his home in Oberndorf bei Salzburg to visit his friend Franz Xaver Gruber in the neighbouring town of Arnsdorf bei Laufen. Mohr brought with him a poem he had written some two years earlier. He needed a carol for the Christmas Eve midnight Mass that was only a few hours away, and hoped his friend, a school teacher who also served as the church's choir master and organist, could set his poem to music. Gruber composed the melody for Mohr's \\"Stille Nacht\\" in just a few hours.\\"Austria’s 'Stille Nacht’”, The German Way The song was sung at Midnight Mass in a simple arrangement for guitar and choir. Various legends have sprung up over the years concerning the genesis of \\"Silent Night\\", but the simplest and likeliest explanation seems to have been that Mohr simply wanted an original song that he could play on his favourite instrument, the guitar.Huey, Steve. \\"Joseph Mohr: Artist biography\\", All Music Within a few years, arrangements of the carol appeared in churches in the Salzburg Archdiocese and folk singers from the Ziller Valley were taking the composition on tours around Europe. Later life Mohr, a generous man who donated most of his salary to charity, was moved from place to place, and remained in Oberndorf only until 1819. After Oberndorf he was sent to Kuchl, followed by stays in Golling an der Salzach, Bad Vigaun, Adnet and Anthering. In 1827 he was made pastor of Hintersee, and in 1837 of the Alpine village of Wagrain.\\"Silent Night composer and writer\\", StilleNacht.info Here he created a fund to allow children from poor families to attend school and set up a system for the care of the elderly. Mohr died of respiratory disease on 4 December 1848, at the age of 55. Legacy Mohr's final resting place is in the tiny Alpine ski resort of Wagrain, where he died in 1848. The Joseph Mohr School stands as a fitting memorial, and close to the grave of the man who wrote the words heard around the world. The village school is named after him and his grave has been kept in a place of honour in the nearby churchyard cemetery. An outdoor exhibit detailing the life of Joseph Mohr is situated on the walkway between the church and the parish house where he once lived. In 2006, the town's Waggerl Museum set up a permanent exhibit – Joseph Mohr – Vicar of Wagrain. In Austria, Stille Nacht is considered a national treasure. Traditionally, the song may not be played publicly before Christmas Eve. Until 2006, it was thought that Mohr and Gruber had collaborated on just one composition, but another was located in the Wagrain parish archive by the Salzburg Archdiocesan authorities. The \\"Te Deum\\" with text by Joseph Mohr and melody by Franz Xaver Gruber can be heard in an audio exhibit at the Waggerl Museum in Wagrain.

According to Billboard magazine, he had thirty-eight Hot 100 chart hits, ten of which reached the Top 20. He had six gold singles in his career. Biography =Career= Vee was born in Fargo, North Dakota, to Sydney Ronald Velline (a chef, pianist and fiddle player) and Saima Cecelia Tapanila, in a family of Norwegian and Finnish heritage. His first single, \\"Suzie Baby,\\" was written by Vee with a nod to Buddy Holly's \\"Peggy Sue\\" and recorded for the Soma label, based in Minneapolis, in 1959; it was a hit in Minnesota and drew enough national attention to be purchased by Liberty Records, which signed him later that year. His follow-up single, a cover of Adam Faith's UK number-one \\"What Do You Want?\\", charted in the lower reaches of the Billboard pop chart in early 1960. His fourth release, a revival of the Clovers' doo-wop ballad \\"Devil or Angel\\" (U.S. number six), brought him into the big time with U.S. buyers. His next single, \\"Rubber Ball\\" (1961, U.S. number six, Australia number one), made him an international star. He has cited as influences, producer Snuff Garrett and his personal manager, Arnold Mills. Vee's recording of \\"Take Good Care of My Baby\\" in the summer of 1961 went to number one on Billboard magazine's U.S. pop chart and number three in the UK Singles Chart. Known primarily as a performer of Brill Building pop material, he went on to record a string of international hits in the 1960s, including \\"More Than I Can Say\\" (1961, UK number 4), \\"Run to Him\\" (1961, US number 2; UK number 6), \\"The Night Has A Thousand Eyes\\" (1963, US number 3; UK number 3) and \\"Come Back When You Grow Up\\" (1967, US number 3). On the recording of \\"Come Back When You Grow Up\\" Bobby Vee and The Strangers are credited. However, that was merely the record label giving a name to the studio musicians working that day. Bobby's original band, The Shadows, backed him on the road, but changed their name to The Strangers upon learning of the UK band The Shadows who backed Cliff Richard. They had not backed him since 1963. He also recorded, in 1961, a version of the song \\"Lollipop\\", originally by Ronald & Ruby, which also became a success. Vee had a total of ten hit singles in the UK, ending with \\"Bobby Tomorrow\\" (UK number 21) in 1963. In 1963, American Bandstand signed Vee to headline Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars national U.S. tour which was scheduled to perform its 15th show on the night of November 22, 1963 at the Memorial Auditorium in Dallas, Texas until suddenly the Friday evening event had to be cancelled moments after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated that afternoon while touring Dallas in an open car caravan. Vee was also a pioneer in the music video genre, appearing in several musical films and in the Scopitone series of early film-and-music jukebox recordings. Awards and Honors He received the North Dakota Roughrider Award in 1999. He is mentioned in the film No Direction Home regarding his brief musical association with Bob Dylan and Dylan's suggestion that he was \\"Bobby Vee\\" after Vee's regional hit. The Very Best of Bobby Vee, released by EMI/UK on May 12, 2008, charted in the UK top five. On January 17, 2011, EMI/UK released Rarities, a double-CD package with 61 tracks, many of which were previously unreleased. Others included were alternate takes and first-time stereo releases as well as tracks from the album Bobby Vee Live on Tour, without the \\"canned\\" audience. On March 28, 2011, he became the 235th inductee into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. An active live performer into 2011, Vee was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at which time he completed his scheduled tour obligations and recorded his final CD, which was released three years later. In 2014 he was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame. =The Day the Music Died= Vee's career began in the midst of tragedy. On February 3, 1959, \\"The Day the Music Died,\\" three of the four headline acts in the lineup of the traveling Winter Dance Party—Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper--were killed in the crash of a V-tailed 1947 Beechcraft Bonanza airplane, along with the 21-year-old pilot, Roger Peterson. (Dion DiMucci, the fourth headliner, had opted not to travel on the plane.) It crashed near Clear Lake, Iowa, en route to the next show on the tour itinerary, in Moorhead, Minnesota. Velline, then 15 years old, and a hastily assembled band of Fargo schoolboys (including his older brother Bill) calling themselves the Shadows volunteered for and were given the unenviable job of filling in for Holly and his band at the Moorhead engagement. Their performance there was a success, and started Vee's career as a popular singer. In 1963, Vee released a tribute album on Liberty Records called I Remember Buddy Holly. In the liner notes, he recalled Holly's influence on him and the events surrounding Holly's death, describing how he had looked forward to attending the concert, how the local radio station put out a call for local talent to fill after the disaster, and how Vee's recently organized group, modeled on Holly's style, had to make up a name (the Shadows) on the spot. Vee became a star, and he performed regularly at Winter Dance Party memorial concerts in Clear Lake. His three sons, all musicians, performed with him there. =Connection with Bob Dylan= Early in Vee's career, a musician calling himself Elston Gunn briefly toured with the band. This was Robert Allen Zimmerman, who later went on to fame as Bob Dylan. Dylan's autobiography mentions Vee and provides complimentary details about their friendship, both professional and personal. In a concert at Midway Stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota, on July 10, 2013, Dylan said he had been on the stage with many stars, but that none of them were as meaningful as Vee. He said Vee was in the audience and then played Vee's hit \\"Suzie Baby\\" with emotion. Dylan said (in a video recording of the concert): Dylan also recalled that Vee \\"had a metallic, edgy tone to his voice and it was as musical as a silver bell.\\" Vee remembered that the musician he knew as Gunn (Bob Dylan) \\"played pretty good in the key of C.\\" =Personal life= Vee in 1998 Vee and Karen Bergen married December 28, 1963. In the early 1980s, Vee moved his family from Los Angeles to near St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he and Karen organized annual fundraising concerts to provide music and arts facilities for local children. They had four children, including sons Jeffrey, Thomas, and Robert, who performed with Vee in his later career, and daughter Jennifer. Karen died of kidney failure on August 3, 2015. Bobby and his sons opened and operated Rockhouse Productions in an old bank building in St. Joseph, Minnesota, which continues in operation. The Vees helped organize and performed for a number of years in the annual July 3 St. Joseph \\"Joetown Rocks\\" festival drawing many thousands of fans and area residents. =Last years and death= Vee continued performing live until 2011 when diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 2011, friends and family contributed to his final new recordings which were eventually released as The Adobe Sessions on February 3, 2014. On April 29, 2012, Vee announced publicly that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and consequently would withdraw from the music business. He had been in memory care (long-term care to meet the needs of those with Alzheimer's disease, dementia or other types of memory problems) for 13 months in a long-term care facility in Rogers, Minnesota, just outside of Minneapolis, and eventually received hospice care in the weeks prior to his death. On October 24, 2016, Vee died from complications of the disease at the age of 73. Discography Over the course of his career Vee achieved six gold singles and one gold album. =Gold singles= * \\"Devil or Angel\\" (1960) * \\"Rubber Ball\\" (1961) * \\"Take Good Care of My Baby\\" (1961) * \\"Run to Him\\" (1961) * \\"The Night Has a Thousand Eyes\\" (1962) * \\"Come Back When You Grow Up\\" (1967) (Bobby Vee and The Strangers) =Gold albums= *The Bobby Vee Singles Album (1980) certified gold in the UK.

It is situated at an altitude of in the Garhwal Himalayas and located approximately North of Uttarkashi, the headquarters of the Uttarkashi district in the Garhwal Division of Uttarakhand, India. It is one of the four sites in India's Chhota Char Dham pilgrimage. The sacred shrine of Yamunotri, source of the river Yamuna, is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, perched atop a flank of Bandar Poonch Parvat. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to the Goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Janki Chatti (7 km. Away).Janki Chatti The actual source, a frozen lake of ice and glacier (Champasar Glacier) located on the Kalind Mountain at a height of 4,421 m above sea level, about 1 km further up, is not frequented generally as it is not accessible; hence the shrine has been located on the foot of the hill. The approach is extremely difficult and pilgrims therefore offer puja at the temple itself. Yamunotri temple was built by Maharani Guleria of Jaipur in the 19th century.Yamunotri temple The temple of Yamuna, on the left bank of the Yamuna, was constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal. The deity is made of black marble. The Yamuna, like the Ganges, has been elevated to the status of a divine mother for the Hindus and has been held responsible for nurturing and developing the Indian civilization. Close to the temple are hot water springs gushing out from the mountain cavities. Surya Kund is the most important kund. Near the Surya Kund there is a shila called Divya Shila, which is worshipped before puja is offered to the deity. Devotees prepare rice and potatoes, tied in muslin cloth, to offer at the shrine by dipping them in these hot water springs. Rice so cooked is taken back home as prasadam. The pujaris of Yamunotri come from the village of Kharsali near Janki Chatti. They are the administrators of the sacred place and perform religious rites. They are well-versed in the Shastras. Janki Chatti hot water spring, Surya Kund. History and legends Yamunotri as depicted by James Baillie Fraser (1820) According to the ancient legend, sage Asit Muni had his hermitage here. All his life, he bathed daily both in the Ganges and the Yamuna. Unable to go to Gangotri during his old age, a stream of the Ganges appeared opposite Yamunotri for him. The temple and the place opens every year on the auspicious day of the Akshaya Tritiya,Yamunotri Dham which generally falls during the last week of April, or the first week of May. The temple always closes on the sacred day of Diwali in mid-October - first week of November, with a brief ceremony. The temple staff return to their villages and for the rest of the time the valley is gripped in no-man silence and covered with a white sheet of snow. With the melting of the snow next summer, the temple re-opens. Sangya is the birthplace of the Yamuna in the Champasar Glacier (4,421 m) just below the Banderpoonch Mountain. The mountain adjacent to the river source is dedicated to her father, and is called Kalind Parvat, (Kalind being another name for the sun deity - Surya). Yamuna is known for her frivolousness, a trait that she developed because, according to a common story, Yamuna's mother could never make eye contact with her dazzling husband. Geography Yamunotri is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Yamunotri It has an average elevation of . Yamuna River The actual source of Yamuna River lies in the Yamunotri Glacier, at a height , near the Bandarpunch peaks in the Lower Himalayas and is dedicated to goddess Yamuna. It crosses the states of Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and later Delhi before merging with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj. Yamunotri Temple Yamunotri Temple is situated in the western region of Garhwal Himalayas at an altitude of near the river source. The original temple was built by Maharani Guleria of Jaipur in the 19th century. The current temple is of recent origin as earlier constructions have been destroyed by weather and the elements. There seems to be a confusion as to who built the temple of Yamunotri. However, according to sources, the temple was originally constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal.

The main shareholder is Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière's FIMALAC Group. History The Revue des deux Mondes was founded by Prosper Mauroy and Pierre de Ségur-Dupeyron, first appearing on 1 August 1829. The anodyne periodical with the subtitle Journal des voyages was purchased by a young printer, Auguste-Jean Auffray, who convinced his college roommate François Buloz to edit it: its original emphasis on travel and foreign affairs soon shifted; according to its website, it was created in order to \\"establish a cultural, economic and political bridge between France and the United States\\", the Old World and the New. It was purchased in 1831 by Charles Buloz, who was its editor until 1877. Another influential editor in its history was Ferdinand Brunetière (after 1893). Among the early regular contributors who established the review's reputation as an elite liberal vehicle of haute culture were Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, François Guizot, Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry, Ludovic Vitet, , the literary critics Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Gustave Planche, and Jean-Jacques Ampère.

Its name continues as a brand owned by Hornby Railways. History Manufacturer Georges Huard founded Jouef in 1944 toward the end of World War II. The traditional home of the company was in Champagnole, France. In the early 1950s, as with many manufacturers, the company abandoned the use of lithographed tinplate for trains in favour of plastic injection moulding. The first Jouef electric train in HO scale, 1955. In 1979, Jouef opened a factory in Limerick, Ireland, but the ill-fated venture closed in 1981. In 2001, Jouef was subsumed by the Italian Lima. After Lima shut down in January 2004, the Jouef brand was acquired a few months later by Hornby Railways (Tran 2004). Trains The company's first offering was a rather toy-like tinplate 'Trans Saharan Express - Algiers to Tombouctou' (Gurney 2003, 28). Other notable offerings were the French BB9200 which hauled the famous 'Le capitole' express. The locomotive had features like the overhead, diamond-shaped, pantograph completely detailed on the model (Gurney 2003, 322). Even today, as a part of Hornby, a main offering has been the French TGV high-speed express. Also during the 1960s, Jouef marketed a limited range of British outline model railways under the brand name 'Playcraft'. Cars Around 1960, Jouef made a series of plastic 1:87 (HO) scale cars, trucks and buses mainly for display with its train kits. These were mainly French vehicles including a Peugeot 203 and 403, Simca Chambord, Citroen DS 19, and a few Renaults including the 16 hatchback. These were basic one-piece mouldings with simple plastic wheels. Jouef made electric slot cars for many years with production starting in their Champagnole factory in 1963. The system was called \\"Record 64\\" in France. Between 1964 and 1968 these sets were marketed in England by Mettoy / Playcraft, the makers of Corgi Toys. The range was also made under license in Germany and known as Egger Silberpfeil. Jouef slot cars were also manufactured in Spain during the 1960s. Early releases were the E Type Jag sports and hardtop, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL sports and hardtop, BRM F1, BRM F1 chrome, Ferrari F1, Ferrari F1 gold, Lotus F1, Ferrari 250 GTO, Porsche 904 and Ford GT40. A 'Formulae Bleue' car was illustrated in the 1964 French catalogue, but was never released. After Jouefs' partnership with Playcraft and Egger ended in 1968, they continued to produce some very nice cars. Toward the end of production, however, cost saving measures became apparent. From 1968 until 1980 Jouef produced variants of the following cars; Renault Alpine 3000, Matra Djet, Chaparral 2F, Mini Cooper, Renault 8 Gordini, Lotus F1 'Looping', Matra F1 'Looping', Lotus F1 front wing, Lotus F1 front & rear wing, Matra F1 front wing, Matra F1 front & rear wing, BRM F1 'Baby' (winged), Ferrari F1 'Baby' (winged), Drag Car, Go-Kart, Ford Capri, Renault 5, Porsche 917, Matra 650, 'Niki Lauda' Ferrari, Ligier JS1, Renault F1, Ligier JS11, Carabo Bertone, Alfetta GTV2000, Porsche Carrera Turbo, BMW 3.0 csl, Renault Alpine 1600, Fiat 131 Abarth, Alpine A442, Porsche 936, Matra Simca Bagheera, Renault Alpine A310, Porsche 911S and Lancia Stratos. Jouef ceased producing their own cars in 1980. A Renault 5 Turbo with flared arches and a 'Batwing' BMW were featured in the 1980 catalogue, but neither entered production. Thereafter, Artin would sell their own budget range of slot cars under the Jouef brand name right up until the mid 1990s. Jouef slot cars and accessories made in the French factories between 1963 and 1980 are now much sought after by collectors, some of the rarer liveries command very high prices. During the 1990s, Jouef also made die cast cars in 1:18, 1:24, and 1:43 scales under the name JouefEvolution. The car models were most often made in China, though train production continued in France. The 1:43 scale series was called 'Legende' and cars included a 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera, Ferrari 330 P4 Prototype racer, a Ferrari NART 412P Prototype racer, 250 Ferraris, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta in Le Mans and Tour de France liveries, a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO, a Ferrari 288 GTO Evoluzione, a Ford GT, a 1965 Mustang, a 1994 Ford Mustang, an MGB ragtop, a Triumph TR3 and a 1978 Volkswagen Beetle. Proportions on these 1990s cars were spot-on (pun partially intended) and detail was exquisite. Engine features were realistic, wheels with their precise metal shades and textures often looked just like they had been taken off the real car and put into a 'miniaturizing' machine. Even on opening doors, window frames were made of thin metal, precision not often seen in 1:43 scale. Most of these castings, like the 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2,7 litre or the many variations of the Ford GT race car, were later acquired by Universal Hobbies of Kowloon, Hong Kong and marketed during the late 1990s as the Eagle's Race line, which featured a silver chrome-like Eagle on the company logo. They were almost identical to the Jouef offerings (Doty 2000, p. 87). References Doty, Dennis. 2000. Ford GTs of Every (Racing) Stripe. Collectible Automobile, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 87–90.

Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) commands the team sent to rescue U.S. citizen Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) before the approaching rebels reach her jungle hospital. The film was directed by Antoine Fuqua. Willis produced Tears of the Sun through Cheyenne Enterprises, his production company, and took the title from an early sub-title for Live Free or Die Hard, the fourth film in the Die Hard series . The cast of Tears of the Sun includes actual African refugees living in the United States. Plot Turmoil erupts in Nigeria following a military coup d'etat, which involves the brutal murders of the president and his family. As foreign nationals are evacuated from the country, Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) and his U.S. Navy SEAL detachment comprising Zee (Eamonn Walker), Slo (Nick Chinlund), Red (Cole Hauser), Lake (Johnny Messner), Silk (Charles Ingram), Doc (Paul Francis), and Flea (Chad Smith), aboard the aircraft carrier , are dispatched by Captain Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) to extract a \\"critical persona\\", one Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (Monica Bellucci), a U.S. citizen by marriage and the widowed daughter-in-law of a U.S. Senator. Their secondary mission is to extract the mission priest (Pierrino Mascarino) and two nuns (Fionnula Flanagan and Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy), should they choose to come. The mission begins as planned. Waters tells Dr. Kendricks of the company of rebel soldiers closing in on her hospital and the mission, and that the team's orders are to extract U.S. personnel; however, Kendricks refuses to leave without the patients. Waters calls Captain Rhodes for options; after their short and heated conversation, he concedes to Dr. Kendricks' wishes and agrees to take those refugees able to walk. Kendricks begins assembling the able-bodied for the hike; the priest and the nuns stay behind to take care of the injured. Irritated and behind the schedule, the team and the refugees leave the hospital mission after daybreak. At nightfall they take a short break. Guerrilla rebels rapidly approach their position, and Waters stealthily kills a straggling rebel. Dr. Kendricks warns Waters that the rebels are going to the mission, but he is determined to carry out his orders, and they continue to the extraction point. Back at the mission, the staff and refugees are detained by rebel forces. Despite the priest's pleas for mercy, the rebel forces execute him and the remaining occupants. When the team arrives at the extraction point, Waters' initial plan becomes clear: the SEALs suddenly turn away the refugees from the waiting helicopter. Waters forces Dr. Kendricks into the helicopter, Dr. Kendricks slaps, spits, and pushes Lt Waters. Lt Waters puts her on the helicopter to leave the refugees stranded in the jungle, unprotected against the rebels. En route to the aircraft carrier, they fly over the original mission compound, seeing it destroyed and all its occupants murdered, as Dr. Kendricks had feared. Remorseful, Waters orders the pilot to return to the refugees. He then loads as many refugees as he can into the helicopter and decides to escort the remaining refugees to the Cameroon border. During the hike to the border, using satellite scans, the SEALs discover the rebels are somehow tracking them. As they escape and evade the rebels, the team enters a village whose inhabitants are being raped, tortured, and massacred by rebel soldiers. Aware of having the opportunity to stop it, Waters orders the team to take down the rebels. The team is visibly shaken by the atrocities they see the rebels have committed against the villagers. Again en route, Slo determines that a refugee is transmitting a signal allowing the rebels to locate them. The search for the transmitter reveals the presence of Arthur Azuka (Sammi Rotibi), the surviving son of late President Samuel Azuka, which they realize is the reason the rebels are hunting them: Samuel Azuka was not only the president of the country, but also the tribal king of the Igbo. As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline, Arthur is the only person left with a legitimate claim to the leadership of Nigeria. Waters is angry at Dr. Kendricks, who knew of Arthur's identity, yet never informed the SEAL team. A newer refugee (Jimmy Jean-Louis) picked up during the trek is discovered with the transmitter on his person. He attempts to run but is shot. The team decides to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon, regardless of the cost. A firefight ensues when the rebels finally catch up with the SEALs, who decide to stay behind as rearguard to buy the refugees enough time to reach the border safely. Zee radios the Truman for air support; two F/A-18A Hornets take off and head for the firefight. The rebels kill Slo, Lake, Flea, and Silk. Waters, Red, Doc, and Zee are wounded, but direct the fighter pilots on where to attack. Arthur and Dr. Kendricks are scrambling to the Cameroon border gate when they hear the fighter jets approach and bomb the entire rebel force. Waters, Zee, Doc, and Red rise from the grass as U.S. Navy helicopters land in Cameroon, opposite the Nigerian border fence gate. Captain Rhodes arrives and orders the gate open, letting in the SEALs and the refugees. A detail of U.S. Marines then escorts the SEALs to the helicopters. Captain Rhodes promises Waters that he will recover the bodies of Waters' men. Dr. Kendricks bids tearful farewells to her Nigerian friends and flies away in a helicopter while comforting Waters, watching as Arthur is surrounded by his people proclaiming their freedom.

PbO occurs in two polymorphs: litharge having a tetragonal crystal structure, and massicot having an orthorhombic crystal structure. Modern applications for PbO are mostly in lead-based industrial glass and industrial ceramics, including computer components. It is an amphoteric oxide. Preparation PbO may be prepared by heating lead metal in air at approximately . At this temperature it is also the end product of oxidation of other oxides of lead in air: : PbO Thermal decomposition of lead(II) nitrate or lead(II) carbonate also results in the formation of PbO: :2 → 2 PbO + 4 \\\\+ : → PbO + PbO is produced on a large scale as an intermediate product in refining raw lead ores into metallic lead. The usual lead ore is galena (lead(II) sulfide). At a temperature of around the sulfide is converted to the oxide: :2 PbS + 3 → 2 PbO + 2 Metallic lead is obtained by reducing PbO with carbon monoxide at around :Lead Processing @ Universalium.academic.ru. Alt address: Lead processing @ Enwiki.net. :PbO + CO → Pb + Structure As determined by X-ray crystallography, both polymorphs, tetragonal and orthorhombic feature a pyramidal four-coordinate lead center. In the tetragonal form the four lead–oxygen bonds have the same length, but in the orthorhombic two are shorter and two longer. The pyramidal nature indicates the presence of a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons. When PbO occurs in tetragonal lattice structure it is called litharge; and when the PbO has orthorhombic lattice structure it is called massicot. The PbO can be changed from massicot to litharge or vice versa by controlled heating and cooling.A simple example is given in A more complex example is in The tetragonal form is usually red or orange color, while the orthorhombic is usually yellow or orange, but the color is not a very reliable indicator of the structure. The tetragonal and orthorhombic forms of PbO occur naturally as rare minerals. Reactions The red and yellow forms of this material are related by a small change in enthalpy: :PbO(red) → PbO(yellow) ΔH = 1.6 kJ/mol PbO is amphoteric, which means that it reacts with both acids and with bases. With acids, it forms salts of via the intermediacy of oxo clusters such as . With strong bases, PbO dissolves to form plumbite (also called plumbate(II)) salts: :PbO + + → Applications The kind of lead in lead glass is normally PbO, and PbO is used extensively in making glass. Depending on the glass, the benefit of using PbO in glass can be one or more of increasing the refractive index of the glass, decreasing the viscosity of the glass, increasing the electrical resistivity of the glass, and increasing the ability of the glass to absorb X-rays. Adding PbO to industrial ceramics (as well as glass) makes the materials more magnetically and electrically inert (by raising their Curie temperature) and it is often used for this purpose.Chapter 9, \\"Lead Compounds\\", in the book Ceramic and Glass Materials: Structure, Properties and Processing, published by Springer, year 2008. Historically PbO was also used extensively in ceramic glazes for household ceramics, and it is still used, but not extensively any more. Other less dominant applications include the vulcanization of rubber and the production of certain pigments and paints. PbO is used in cathode ray tube glass to block X-ray emission, but mainly in the neck and funnel because it can cause discoloration when used in the faceplate. Strontium oxide is preferred for the faceplate. The consumption of lead, and hence the processing of PbO, correlates with the number of automobiles, because it remains the key component of automotive lead-acid batteries. =Niche or declining uses= A mixture of PbO with glycerine sets to a hard, waterproof cement that has been used to join the flat glass sides and bottoms of aquariums, and was also once used to seal glass panels in window frames. It is a component of lead paints. PbO was used to speed up the process to turn more profit for less time and artificially increase the quality of century eggs, a type of Chinese preserved egg. It was an unscrupulous practice in some small factories but it became rampant in China and forced many honest manufacturers to label their boxes \\"lead-free\\" after the scandal went mainstream in 2013. In powdered tetragonal litharge form, it can be mixed with linseed oil and then boiled to create a weather-resistant sizing used in gilding. The litharge would give the sizing a dark red color that made the gold leaf appear warm and lustrous, while the linseed oil would impart adhesion and a flat durable binding surface. PbO is used in certain condensation reactions in organic synthesis. PbO is the input photoconductor in a video camera tube called the Plumbicon. Health issues left Lead oxide may be fatal if swallowed or inhaled. It causes irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. It affects gum tissue, central nervous system, kidneys, blood, and reproductive system. It can bioaccumulate in plants and in mammals.

Pigment White 5, is a mixture of inorganic compounds, widely used as a white pigment powder. It is composed of a mixture of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide. These insoluble compounds blend well with organic compounds and confer opacity. It was made popular by the cheap production costs, greater coverage. Related white pigments include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (\\"zinc white\\"), and zinc sulfide.  History  Lithopone was discovered in the 1870s by DuPont. It was manufactured by Krebs Pigments and Chemical Company and other companies. The material came in different \\"seals\\", which varied in the content of zinc sulfide. Gold seal and Bronze seals contain 40-50% zinc sulfide, offering more hiding power and strength. Although its popularity peaked around 1920, approximately 223,352 tons were produced in 1990. It is mainly used in paints, putty, and in plastics. =Stability and darkening= Although barium sulfate is almost completely inert, zinc sulfide degrades upon exposure to UV light, leading to darkening of the pigment. The severity of this UV reaction is dependent on a combination of two factors; how much zinc sulfide makes up the pigments formulation, and its total accumulated UV exposure. Depending on these factors the pigment itself can vary in shade over time, ranging from pure white all the way to grey or even black. To suppress this effect, a dopant may be used, such as a small amount of cobalt salts, which would be added to the formulation. This process creates cobalt-doped zinc sulfide. The cobalt salts help to stabilize zinc sulfide so it will not have as severe a reaction to UV exposure.  Production  Lithopone is produced by coprecipitation of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide. Most commonly coprecipitation is effected by combining equimolar amounts of zinc sulfate and barium sulfide: : BaS + ZnSO4→ ZnS · BaSO4 This route affords a product that is 29.4 wt % ZnS and 70.6 wt % BaSO4. Variations exist, for example, more ZnS- rich materials are produced when zinc chloride is added to the mixture of zinc sulfate and barium sulfide.Völz, Hans G. et al. \\"Pigments, Inorganic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . Barium sulfide is produced by carbothermic reduction of barium sulfate. Zinc sulfate is obtained from a variety of zinc products, often waste, by treatment with sulfuric acid.  Safety  Lithopone is rather nontoxic, due to the insolubility of its components. It has been used in medicine as a radiocontrast agent. Lithopone is allowed to be in contact with foodstuffs in the US and Europe. See also * List of inorganic pigments References Historical references *. *. . *.

For a property R that changes when the temperature changes by dT, the temperature coefficient α is defined by the following equation: :\\\\frac{dR}{R} = \\\\alpha\\\\,dT Here α has the dimension of an inverse temperature and can be expressed e.g. in 1/K or K−1. If the temperature coefficient itself does not vary too much with temperature and \\\\alpha\\\\Delta T \\\\ll 1, a linear approximation will be useful in estimating the value R of a property at a temperature T, given its value R0 at a reference temperature T0: :R(T) = R(T_0)(1 + \\\\alpha\\\\Delta T), where ΔT is the difference between T and T0. For strongly temperature-dependent α, this approximation is only useful for small temperature differences ΔT. Temperature coefficients are specified for various applications, including electric and magnetic properties of materials as well as reactivity. The temperature coefficient of most of the reactions lies between −2 and 3. Negative temperature coefficient Most ceramics exhibit negative temperature dependence of resistance behaviour. This effect is governed by an Arrhenius equation over a wide range of temperatures: :R = Ae^{\\\\frac{B}{T}} where R is resistance, A and B are constants, and T is absolute temperature (K). The constant B is related to the energies required to form and move the charge carriers responsible for electrical conduction hence, as the value of B increases, the material becomes insulating. Practical and commercial NTC resistors aim to combine modest resistance with a value of B that provides good sensitivity to temperature. Such is the importance of the B constant value, that it is possible to characterize NTC thermistors using the B parameter equation: :R = r^{\\\\infty}e^{\\\\frac{B}{T}} = R_{0}e^{-\\\\frac{B}{T_{0}}}e^{\\\\frac{B}{T}} where R_{0} is resistance at temperature T_{0}. Therefore, many materials that produce acceptable values of R_{0} include materials that have been alloyed or possess variable negative temperature coefficient (NTC), which occurs when a physical property (such as thermal conductivity or electrical resistivity) of a material lowers with increasing temperature, typically in a defined temperature range. For most materials, electrical resistivity will decrease with increasing temperature. Materials with a negative temperature coefficient have been used in floor heating since 1971. The negative temperature coefficient avoids excessive local heating beneath carpets, bean bag chairs, mattresses, etc., which can damage wooden floors, and may infrequently cause fires. Reversible temperature coefficient Residual magnetic flux density or B changes with temperature and it is one of the important characteristics of magnet performance. Some applications, such as inertial gyroscopes and traveling-wave tubes (TWTs), need to have constant field over a wide temperature range. The reversible temperature coefficient (RTC) of B is defined as: :\\\\text{RTC} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\mathbf{B}_r}{\\\\mathbf{B}_r\\\\Delta T} \\\\times 100% To address these requirements, temperature compensated magnets were developed in the late 1970s. For conventional SmCo magnets, B decreases as temperature increases. Conversely, for GdCo magnets, B increases as temperature increases within certain temperature ranges. By combining samarium and gadolinium in the alloy, the temperature coefficient can be reduced to nearly zero. Electrical resistance The temperature dependence of electrical resistance and thus of electronic devices (wires, resistors) has to be taken into account when constructing devices and circuits. The temperature dependence of conductors is to a great degree linear and can be described by the approximation below. :\\\\operatorname{\\\\rho}(T) = \\\\rho_{0}\\\\left[1 + \\\\alpha_{0}\\\\left(T - T_{0}\\\\right)\\\\right] where :\\\\alpha_{0} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_{0}}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\delta \\\\rho}{\\\\delta T} \\\\right]_{T=T_{0}} \\\\rho_{0} just corresponds to the specific resistance temperature coefficient at a specified reference value (normally T = 0 °C) That of a semiconductor is however exponential: :\\\\operatorname{\\\\rho}(T) = S \\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{B}{T}} where S is defined as the cross sectional area and \\\\alpha and b are coefficients determining the shape of the function and the value of resistivity at a given temperature. For both, \\\\alpha is referred to as the resistance temperature coefficient. This property is used in devices such as thermistors. =Positive temperature coefficient of resistance= A positive temperature coefficient (PTC) refers to materials that experience an increase in electrical resistance when their temperature is raised. Materials which have useful engineering applications usually show a relatively rapid increase with temperature, i.e. a higher coefficient. The higher the coefficient, the greater an increase in electrical resistance for a given temperature increase. A PTC material can be designed to reach a maximum temperature for a given input voltage, since at some point any further increase in temperature would be met with greater electrical resistance. Unlike linear resistance heating or NTC materials, PTC materials are inherently self-limiting. Some materials even have exponentially increasing temperature coefficient. Example of such a material is PTC rubber. =Negative temperature coefficient of resistance= A negative temperature coefficient (NTC) refers to materials that experience a decrease in electrical resistance when their temperature is raised. Materials which have useful engineering applications usually show a relatively rapid decrease with temperature, i.e. a lower coefficient. The lower the coefficient, the greater a decrease in electrical resistance for a given temperature increase. NTC materials are used to create inrush current limiters (because they present higher initial resistance until the current limiter reaches quiescent temperature), temperature sensors and thermistors. =Negative temperature coefficient of resistance of a semiconductor= An increase in the temperature of a semiconducting material results in an increase in charge-carrier concentration. This results in a higher number of charge carriers available for recombination, increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. The increasing conductivity causes the resistivity of the semiconductor material to decrease with the rise in temperature, resulting in a negative temperature coefficient of resistance. Temperature coefficient of elasticity The elastic modulus of elastic materials varies with temperature, typically decreasing with higher temperature. Temperature coefficient of reactivity In nuclear engineering, the temperature coefficient of reactivity is a measure of the change in reactivity (resulting in a change in power), brought about by a change in temperature of the reactor components or the reactor coolant. This may be defined as :\\\\alpha_{T} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial T} Where \\\\rho is reactivity and T is temperature. The relationship shows that \\\\alpha_{T} is the value of the partial differential of reactivity with respect to temperature and is referred to as the \\"temperature coefficient of reactivity\\". As a result, the temperature feedback provided by \\\\alpha_{T} has an intuitive application to passive nuclear safety. A negative \\\\alpha_{T} is broadly cited as important for reactor safety, but wide temperature variations across real reactors (as opposed to a theoretical homogeneous reactor) limit the usability of a single metric as a marker of reactor safety.Duderstadt & Hamilton 1976, pp. 259–261 In water moderated nuclear reactors, the bulk of reactivity changes with respect to temperature are brought about by changes in the temperature of the water. However each element of the core has a specific temperature coefficient of reactivity (e.g. the fuel or cladding). The mechanisms which drive fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity are different than water temperature coefficients. While water expands as temperature increases, causing longer neutron travel times during moderation, fuel material will not expand appreciably. Changes in reactivity in fuel due to temperature stem from a phenomenon known as doppler broadening, where resonance absorption of fast neutrons in fuel filler material prevents those neutrons from thermalizing (slowing down).Duderstadt & Hamilton 1976, pp. 556–559 Mathematical derivation of temperature coefficient approximation In its more general form, the temperature coefficient differential law is: :\\\\frac{dR}{dT} = \\\\alpha\\\\,R Where is defined: :R_0 = R(T_0) And \\\\alpha is independent of T. Integrating the temperature coefficient differential law: : \\\\int_{R_0}^{R(T)}\\\\frac{dR}{R} = \\\\int_{T_0}^{T} \\\\alpha\\\\,dT ~\\\\Rightarrow~ \\\\ln(R)\\\\Bigg\\\\vert_{R_0}^{R(T)} = \\\\alpha(T - T_0) ~\\\\Rightarrow~ \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{R(T)}{R_0} \\\\right) = \\\\alpha(T - T_0) ~\\\\Rightarrow~ R(T) = R_0 e^{\\\\alpha(T-T_0)} Applying the Taylor series approximation at the first order, in the proximity of T_0, leads to: :R(T) = R_0(1 + \\\\alpha(T - T_0)) Units The thermal coefficient of electrical circuit parts is sometimes specified as ppm/°C, or ppm/K. This specifies the fraction (expressed in parts per million) that its electrical characteristics will deviate when taken to a temperature above or below the operating temperature.

Early life Emett was born in New Southgate, London, the son of a businessman and amateur inventor, and the grandson of Queen Victoria's engraver. He was educated at Waverley Grammar School in Birmingham, where he excelled in drawing, caricaturing his teachers and vehicles and machinery. When he was only 14 he took out a patent on a gramophone volume control. He studied at Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts and one of his landscapes, Cornish Harbour, was exhibited at the Royal Academy; it is now in the Tate collection. Later work Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator, the Victoria Centre, Nottingham An otherwise undistinguished career was interrupted by World War II, when he worked as a draughtsman for the Air Ministry while perfecting his gift for drawing cartoons. From 1939 until the 1950s, and less frequently in the 1960s, he published regularly in PunchThe Emett Catalogue (in preparation) and for many years when his work was published elsewhere it was credited to \\"Emett of Punch\\". His cartoons were seldom political, except when he caricatured bureaucratic absurdities, and his early subjects typically found humour in the difficulties of life in Great Britain during the second World War. His drawings soon started to include railway scenes and he gradually developed a unique concept of strange, bumbling trains with excessively tall chimneys and silly names. On 12 April 1941 he married Elsie May Evans (who was always known as MaryBirth certificate and Rowland Emett's last will), the daughter of a Birmingham silversmith. She managed his business interests. They had one daughter, Claire. In 1947 his cartoons came to life on the stage of the Globe Theatre, London, in \\"Between the Lines\\", a scene for Laurier Lister's revue Tuppence Coloured, with Max Adrian as an eccentric signalman at Friars Fidgeting Signal Box. In 1951, at the Festival of Britain, his most famous steam locomotive, Nellie, was made into a copper and mahogany kinetic sculpture and with two other locomotives, Neptune and Wild Goose, was one of the festival's most popular attractions, operating the Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Branch Railway. There was a fatality when two trains collided. At this time he was living in Cornwall and working in a studio in a boat-loft at Polperro; later he returned to West Cornwall before settling for the rest of his life at Ditchling, in Sussex. In 1953 Malcolm Muggeridge became editor of Punch and began systematic changes, but Emett continued to publish his work there, albeit less frequently. After a spread in Life magazine on 5 July 1954, his work was much in demand in the United States. He turned more and more to designing and supervising the building of what he called his \\"things\\"always with silly names such as The Featherstone-Kite Openwork Basketweave Mark Two Gentleman’s Flying Machine, two copies of which exist, one of which was displayed in a glass case in the Merrion Centre, Leeds, the other on permanent display at the Mid-America Science Museum in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In the mid-1960s he was commissioned by Honeywell to create a mechanical computer, which he named The Forget-Me-Not Computer. In 1968 he designed the elaborate inventions of Caractacus Potts (played by Dick Van Dyke) for the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In 1973 his water-powered musical clock, The Aqua Horological Tintinnabulator, was installed on the lower floor of the Victoria Centre, Nottingham, until 2010. In 2015 it was reinstalled, refurbished and in full working order, to a new location on the upper mall. When commissioned, it played Rameau's Gigue en rondeau II from the E-minor suite of his Pièces de Clavecin when striking the hour and half hour. Later modification enabled it to perform every fifteen minutes (the playback system was changed from tape to compact disc). Whimsical map of Hemel Hempstead and its neighbours, erected in 1960 on the side of what is claimed to be the first multi-storey car park in the UK A 30-foot-square mosaic by Emett, installed around 1960, can be seen on the side of the NCP car park in The Marlowes, Hemel Hempstead. The Cats Cradle Pussiewillow III clock was commissioned by Basildon New Town and inaugurated by Michael Bentine on 7 August 1981. It is on display at Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon. His larger works, such as Emettland, went on extended tours, ending up in prestigious venues such as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The Ontario Science Centre in Toronto has a collection of about ten Emett creations and every December displays the restored working pieces, usually under the title \\"Dream Machines\\". The Mid-America Science Museum has had four of his inventions on permanent display for most of the museum's existence. When asked how he came up with his strange designs, Emett remarked, \\"It is a well known fact that all inventors get their first ideas on the back of an envelope. I take slight exception to this, I use the front so that I can incorporate the stamp and then the design is already half done.\\"How designers think: the design process demystified. By Bryan Lawson Honours Blue plaque for Emett in Birmingham In the 1978 New Year Honours, described as \\"Artist and Inventor\\", he was awarded an OBE. Later life and death He died on 13 November 1990 in a Sussex nursing home. Legacy =Exhibitions= There is a permanent exhibition of representative examples of Emett's work at Stoneywish Nature reserve in Ditchling, East Sussex.http://www.stoneywish.co.uk An exhibition of Emett's work was held at the Chris Beetles Gallery in London, and an accompanying fully illustrated catalogue written by Jacqui Grossart, entitled Rowland Emett from \\"Punch\\" to \\"Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang\\" and Beyond (), was published by Chris Beetles Ltd. in 1988.Chris Beetles Gallery.

Ice sculpture is a form of sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. Sculptures from ice can be abstract or realistic and can be functional or purely decorative. Ice sculptures are generally associated with special or extravagant events because of their limited lifetime. The lifetime of a sculpture is determined primarily by the temperature of its environment, thus a sculpture can last from mere minutes to possibly months. There are several ice festivals held around the world, hosting competitions of ice sculpture carving. Raw material Mexican sculptor Abel Ramírez Águilar and a Chac Mool ice sculpture Sculpting ice presents a number of difficulties due to the variability and volatility of the material. Ice may be sculpted in a wide range of temperatures and the characteristics of the ice will change according to its temperature as well as the surrounding temperatures. Sculptures are generally carved from blocks of ice and these blocks must be carefully selected to be suitable for the sculptor's purposes and should be free of undesired impurities. Typically, ideal carving ice is made from pure, clean water. However, clear, transparent ice is a result of the freezing process and not necessarily related to the purity of the water. Clouded ice is often the result of finely trapped air molecules that tend to bind to the impurities while naturally freezing. Mechanically clear ice is usually made as the result of controlling the freezing process by the circulation of the water in the freezing chamber. This process hopes to eliminate any trapped air from binding to the impurities in the freezing process. Certain machines and processes allow for slow freezing and the removal of impurities and therefore are able to produce the clear blocks of ice that are favored by ice carvers. However, not all blocks that are carved are clear ice. White ice blocks look like snow and are sometimes carved. Colored ice blocks are produced by adding dyes to the ice and can be carved as well. In some instances, clear ice and colored ice are combined to create a desired effect. There are various sizes of ice blocks that are produced artificially. Naturally made blocks can be cut to almost any size from frozen rivers or from \\"ice quarries,\\" which are essentially lakes or ponds that have frozen over. Large ice blocks must be moved by heavy machinery and are used for large ice sculpting events or as part of an ice hotel. Techniques The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting; if the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment, then the sculptor must work quickly to finish the piece. Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if the carver is using power tools such as chainsaws and specialty bits fitted to a die grinder. Ice sculptors also use razor-sharp chisels and hand saws that are specifically designed for cutting ice. As various technologies are adapted for use with ice carving, many sculptures are now created largely by machine. CNC machines and molding systems are now commonly used to create ice sculptures and complicated logos from ice. Color effects are also possible by a number of techniques, including the addition of colored gels or sand to the ice. This art form is traditionally taught in culinary schools using text books such as Ice Sculpting the Modern Way, Joseph Amendola's Ice Carving Made Easy and Mac Winker's Ice Sculpture: The Art of Ice Carving in 12 Systematic Steps. There are also small schools that teach ice carving. The ice may be turned clear after carving by applying heat from a Propane or Mapp Gas cylinder. This alters the opaque effect that is obtained when carving. The ice turns clear after the outside is melted. Caution is to be used as the ice melts very quickly and could soften edges and contours. Sometimes distilled water is used for enhanced clarity.Hamilton Ice Sculptors  Case Study with ReAgent Uses Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines and may be used to enhance the presentation of foods, especially cold foods such as seafood or sorbets. The story of the creation of the dish Peach Melba recounts that Chef Auguste Escoffier used an ice swan to present the dish. At holiday buffets and Sunday brunches some large restaurants and hotels will use ice sculptures to decorate the buffet tables. Cruise ship buffets are also famous for their use of ice sculptures. Ice sculptures are often used at wedding receptions, usually as some form of decoration. Popular subjects for ice sculptures at weddings are hearts, doves, and swans. Swans have a reputation for monogamy, partly accounting for their popularity. Ice sculptures may be used at a bar, in the form of an ice luge, or even the entire bar may be made of ice. Ice sculptures with high surface area like in a radiator can be used to cool air to blow on people during heat wave events when air conditioning is not available. Ice sculptures, ice walls for fire fighting, property protection and cooling stations may be cast by a process in which ice water (one part), crushed ice or ice cubes (three parts) and tiny, floating, dry ice pellets (one part) are placed in a cement mixer. The tiny dry ice pellets super cool the ice water so that the ice water acts like glue to cement or freeze the crushed ice or ice cubes together within several seconds once the mixture stops moving within the mold. The ice water component of the mixture will expand 9% on freezing, so rubber, foam or foam lined casting materials work best to combat the water to ice expansion problem not encountered with wax, cement, casting plaster or metal casting materials. Ice sculpture or ice walls may be stopped from melting by placing and keeping vertical voids in the ice sculpture or ice wall filled with the same type of tiny dry ice pellets used to make ice walls by the Icecrete process previously called Cryocrete in a 2014 U.S. provisional patent. Around the world There are a number of international ice and snow sculpting events around the world. The largest events are, understandably, held in countries with cold winters. Due to land distribution and population densities in the higher latitudes, large ice sculpture events are almost exclusively held in the Northern Hemisphere. A number of countries, some listed below, have established traditions of ice sculpting and have made contributions to the art. Ice artists from these countries regularly appear at international ice sculpture events. =Belgium= Ice sculptures were displayed at the Ice Sculpture Festival on November 28, 2010 in Brugge, Belgium. More than 300,000 kilograms of ice are shipped in for sculptors to work on in the special tents and it runs until January 16, 2011. =Canada= The Ice Castle at the International Ice Sculpture Competition and Exhibition 2005, Lake Louise, Alberta In Canada, Quebec City, Quebec holds an ice sculpture festival each year during the Quebec City Winter Carnival. The sculpture festival lasts about three weeks. For the sheer variety of ice sculptures and the number of visitors, the Quebec festival is regarded by some as the best in the world. Each year, about twenty teams are chosen to participate in the competition. Half of these teams come from Canada and the others come from other countries. Ice sculpting started to become important in Quebec in the 1880s, as traditional sculptors, like Louis Jobin, turned their skills on this less permanent medium. Each year Lake Louise, located in Banff National Park, holds a three-day event called Ice Magic in the 3rd weekend of January. Sanctioned by the National Ice Carving Association, Professional carvers are invited to compete in this event staged in the shadow of the glacier-clad Mt. Victoria. Twelve teams of three carvers are given 15 blocks of ice, weighing 300 lb each, which they must transform into ice sculptures in three days. Weather permitting; the sculptures will remain on display through March. The annual Deep Freeze Festival in Edmonton, Alberta hosts a chisel-and-chainsaw ice carving competition the second weekend of January. Sculptures are created by professionals and amateurs using three blocks of ice. Every year a theme is chosen, in 2013 the theme was \\"The Wild West\\". In the National Capital Region of Canada the Crystal Garden international invitational ice-carving competition starts every February, as part of the Winterlude winter festival of Ottawa. The competition site has been located in Confederation Park in Ottawa and also on the shores of Leamy lake in Gatineau, across the Ottawa River. There is a solo category, a pairs category and a one-bloc challenge. In addition to the sculptures done in the competition many ice sculptures are made to decorate the many Winterlude sites. In Kingston, Ontario, the annual FebFest snow sculpture competition in Confederation Park in features snow forts by Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University. The snow fort must not only be pleasing to look at but also safe for children to play on. In 2008, Royal Military College of Canada's snow fort was modelled after the MacKenzie Building in the Second Empire style with a Mansard roof and a central tower incorporating a working clock, flanked by projecting end towers and a slide. Both teams worked through the night, filling rectangular recycling bins with snow. In addition, ice sculptures of hockey players were made in memory of the first hockey game between Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University. About 10 km East of Quebec city, near Montmorency Falls and within the grounds of the Duchesnay winter resort the first Ice hotel in North America is erected each January. Small and medium-sized ice sculptures are used to decorate the interiors. =China= Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival In China, Heilongjiang Province is the most significant region for ice sculpture. The most famous event is the increasingly popular International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival held annually in Harbin. The festival has consistently increased in size over the years, with more talented artists involved and more impressive techniques and pieces on show. Ice sculpture decoration ranges from the modern technology of lasers to traditional ice lanterns. The climate of Heilongjiang is very cold and ice is plentiful. Objects of all sizes appear, up to and including building-sized pieces. =France= French Chef Auguste Escoffier was responsible for one of the most famous early ice sculptures and French sculptors are regular participants at the World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, Alaska. =Ireland= Not traditionally known for Ice sculpture, Ireland has produced some well respected sculptors, winning The International Ice Sculpture Festival in Jelgava, Latvia, in years past. See also Duthain Dealbh. =Japan= The Japanese city of Sapporo on the island of Hokkaidō is famous for its winter carnival, in which teams compete to create ice sculptures. Some of these creations are the size of multiple-story buildings. A winter carnival is also held annually in Asahikawa, also on the island of Hokkaidō. Japanese sculptors have made many contributions to the art. Notable Japanese ice sculptors include Yukio Matsuo, author of \\"Ice Sculpture: Secrets of a Japanese Master,\\" Mitsuo Shimizu, author of several Japanese books on ice sculpture, and Junichi Nakamura, winner of multiple world ice sculpting titles. Ice sculpture has been popular in Japan since the 1930s and an early advocate and teacher in the country was Shuko Kobayashi, the first chairman of the Japan Ice Sculpture Association. =Philippines= Most of the Filipino ice sculptors working abroad (Hotel & Luxury Cruises) came from Paete, Laguna, a small town approximately 100 km. east of Manila. The name Paete came from the word \\"paet\\", which means \\"chisel\\". Paete was declared by Philippine President Arroyo as \\"The Carving Capital of the Philippines\\" as their speciality and main source of income is woodcarving. Paetenians hold an Ice Carving Competition every year on the last week of July as a way to celebrate their town Fiesta. About 50 young natives of this town have been participating each year. =Russia= An annual competition is held at Moscow's Gorky Park, Perm Gorky Park, in Salekhard and other cities. Several Russian ice sculptors have won events at the World Ice Art Championships, including Vladimir Zhikhartsev, Sergei Loginov, and Vitaliy Lednev. =Sweden= Each winter since 1991, an ice hotel has been reconstructed in the village of Jukkasjärvi. ICEHOTEL, as it is known, is the oldest and most popular of a number of ice hotels that have since been constructed in a number of countries. ICEHOTEL is constructed almost entirely of ice and snow and each of the guest rooms feature different themes and elaborate ice and snow carving. In 2009 an ice sculpture festival named ISSTJÄRNAN started in Sikfors, Hällefors, on the lake Sörälgen. The event takes place every year in February. =United States= \\"Mysterious Pearl\\" 2006 in Fairbanks, AK at the World Ice Art Championships Since 1989, Alaska has hosted the annual World Ice Art Championships. Nearly 100 sculptors come from around the world each year to sculpt large blocks of pristine natural ice sometimes referred to as \\"Arctic Diamonds.\\" The event is run almost exclusively by volunteers. In a typical year, more than 45,000 spectators pass through the gates of the Ice Park home of the World Ice Art Championships. The competition is broken down into two main categories: Single Block and Multi-Block and each competition is further separated into Abstract and Realistic sculptures. One of the most popular attractions is the Kids Park where children of all ages can glide down ice slides or spin in ice twirly tops. Typically held the last week of February and the first week of March, spectators may view the sculptors at work during the championship competitions. In the Single Block Classic, teams of up to two persons work on a 3'×5'×8' (90 cm × 150 cm × 200 cm) block of naturally formed Alaskan ice, weighing roughly 7,800 pounds (3,500 kg). In the Multi-Block Classic, teams of up to four persons each receive ten blocks of approximately 6'×4'×3' (180 cm × 100 cm × 90 cm) each weighing about 4,400 pounds (2,000 kg). to create their crystal masterpieces. Teams that compete in both the Single Block and Multi- Block events must handle a total of 50,000 pounds (23 t) of ice. Power tools and scaffolding can be used in both events: assistance from heavy equipment is only permitted in the Multi-Block Classic Competition. Thus, participation in the event requires strength, endurance, and engineering skill as well as mastery of basic ice sculpture techniques and artistic vision. The NICA shield The National Ice Carving Association (NICA), based in Oak Brook, Illinois (in the Chicago metro area) is an organization of ice carvers and those interested in ice carving. NICA sanctions and supports various ice sculpture competitions around the United States and in Canada and has held a yearly National Championship since 1991. The association has developed a point system for judging the quality of ice sculptures created in timed competitions and certifies competition judges. NICA also was responsible for managing the ice carving competition held in conjunction with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and provided support for the 2006 event in Italy. In 2007, NICA started a \\"Tour of Champions\\" that rewards high scores over several competitions, usually including the National Championships. =Argentina= In the city of Rio Cuarto, Cordoba since 2015 there is an Ice Festival call \\"Roca minus zero\\". =United Kingdom= Ice sculpting classes at 2011 London Ice Sculpting Festival The largest display of ice sculpting in the United Kingdom is the London Ice Sculpting Festival. The festival was organized in 2009 by Carol Cordrey and the Icebox. The competition is now held at Canary Wharf. The London Ice Sculpting Festival chooses different themes every year, and for the 2012 competition chose the themes Team Spirit and Winter Sports. The 2012 winners were Jonathan Lloyd in the singles competition and Pedro Mira & Niall Magee for the doubles competition. Jonathon Lloyd also won the Public Choice Award. The festival also provides visitors with a chance to try ice sculpting themselves with classes by the Icebox. The 2012 London Ice Sculpting Festival featured classes focused on how to sculpt a husky dog.

It was founded on 23 July 1979 by Thomas Barnes in protest of alleged incompetence by the Government of Victoria and others in regards to the flooding of his and others' properties.  Background  It was founded as a result of a long-running compensation dispute between a group of Victorian farmers in the town of Cowwarr, and an agency of the Victorian state government, the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (SRWSC), . A road bridge built over the Thomson River at Cowwarr in the late 1930s proved to be sited too close to the annual flood high-water mark, so when that structure proved an impediment to the flow of debris during a particularly violent flood in 1952, the river simply carved a new course for itself around the edge of the bridge. This \\"breakaway\\" - later named Rainbow Creek - passed through a number of privately owned farming properties. Remedial action proved ineffective, and the creek was enlarged by subsequent flooding to the size of several football fields - at the expense of the affected farmers’ lands. Deciding to make the best of a bad situation the farmers began using water from the creek to irrigate their properties, however, local and state authorities responded by serving them with levies for water use. Those affected had to pay one set of levies to the local council for land which was now underwater, because their title deeds did not show the existence of the creek, a second levy to the SRWSC for using creek waters for irrigation purposes, and a third levy to the Thomson River Improvement Trust which was supposed to prevent further erosion by the creek - which nonetheless continued to grow inexorably with each new flood. The SRWSC then constructed a weir across the river downstream of the bridge in 1954, which had the effect of funnelling even higher volumes of floodwater directly into Rainbow Creek. By the late 1970s, the creek was 8 metres (26 feet) deep and over 50 metres (164 feet) wide, and farmers had to privately fund the construction of bridges to cross from one part of their properties to the other. These were all washed away, along with crops, stock, and equipment by particularly severe flooding in 1978. The farmers of Cowwarr had long blamed government incompetence over nearly three decades for their woes, but when they were denied the right to claim compensation for loss of land, productivity and private infrastructure in 1978 they decided to take further action. One of the worst affected properties was Yammacoona, located directly below the weir, and owned by Thomas Barnes since 1970. Barnes was a retired UK and Victorian police officer who had settled in the town some time before. He was known as a man of feisty temperament with little patience for the slow-turning wheels of government bureaucracy, and a flair for publicity.  Secession  In an attempt to gain public sympathy Barnes and around thirty other farmers decided to declare war on the state of Victoria. Signed on 19 December 1978, the Declaration was served with due pomp to a bemused Governor in Melbourne on 16 January 1979, before banks of television cameras. Some legal scuffling between Barnes and the SRWSC followed in the Victorian court system, during which minor points were won and lost on both sides, after which a government offer of loans - but not the desired compensation - was rejected by the farmer group. alt= Barnes meanwhile had become aware of the Hutt River Province and seeking to emulate \\"Prince Leonard\\" took legal advice and then declared the unilateral secession of his property from the State of Victoria on 23 July 1979. He appointed himself \\"Governor\\" of the newly created Independent State of Rainbow Creek, and together with \\"Minister for Information\\" George Downing, swore allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as his Head of State. His secession document was lodged with the Victorian Governor, the Governor- General of Australia, Buckingham Palace and the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Public attention was again focused on Cowwarr, and the existence of the State of Rainbow Creek ensured that Barnes remained a thorn in the side of the SRWSC and the Victorian Government for a number of years, as he issued passports, stamps, banknotes and other printed material to promote the cause of his farming community. Ill health eventually forced Barnes to retire to Queensland in the mid-1980s, from where he has since published several books of local history and poetry, whilst the issues that led to the Rainbow Creek secession remained unresolved.

Children often make this toy. The ultop consists of two pieces. The first is a small bamboo with a diameter around 2–5 cm, the inside of which is shaped like a funnel. Two edges of the bamboo are cut until both edges can be seen through the funnel. The second piece is a rod with an outside diameter slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the funnel. Grain or fruit, slightly larger than the diameter of the funnel, is placed in the funnel and the rod is pressed against it as hard as the child can. The fruit or grain will be forced out with great speed and the sound like a small explosion. This makes it the local equivalent of a pop gun.

They are currently based in Bergen, Norway. Though the band's lineup has changed many times over the years, Bjørnson and Kjellson have been the sole constant members, and the lineup remained the same from 2004 to 2016. Following their 25th anniversary world tour, keyboardist/guitarist/vocalist Herbrand Larsen departed from the band after 12 years and six albums. He has since been replaced by Håkon Vinje. To date, they have released fifteen full-length studio albums; the most recent of which, Utgard, was released in October 2020 on Nuclear Blast Records. The band's music draws heavily on the Viking cultural and religious heritage of their home country of Norway for inspiration, and most of the band's lyrics relate to Norse mythology. Though they began as a traditional black metal band their sound has undergone significant changes over time resulting in a more progressive sound. In 2014, Ivar Bjørnson and Einar Selvik (of Wardruna) were commissioned by the Norwegian government to create a musical piece in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Norwegian constitution. This was later released as a studio album called Skuggsjá in 2016, which also featured Kjellson on vocals. Singer Grutle Kjellson at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen 2016 in Germany History Enslaved performing live in Oslo in October 2012 Enslaved was formed in July 1991 by Ivar Bjørnson and Grutle Kjellson (also known as Kjetil Grutle) when they were 13 and 17 years old, respectively. The band name was inspired by an Immortal demo track, \\"Enslaved in Rot.\\" After many line-up changes throughout their career, Bjørnson and Kjellson are the only remaining original members. By 2004 the line-up solidified with guitarist Arve \\"Ice Dale\\" Isdal, drummer Cato Bekkevold, and keyboardist/vocalist Herbrand Larsen. Prior to forming Enslaved, Bjørnson and Kjellson had been playing in a death metal band called Phobia, but like many in the burgeoning extreme metal movement, they were looking for new sources of inspiration and expression. Though Enslaved began as a prototypical Norwegian black metal band in 1991, by 1993 they were incorporating song structures unusual for the genre; several of their earlier songs reach the ten-minute mark (their debut album, Vikingligr Veldi, has only one song that is under ten minutes). As such, the band has rejected the black metal label and prefers the term \\"extreme metal\\". Mardraum (2000) contained several multi-part epics such as \\"Større enn tid - Tyngre enn natt\\" and \\"Entrance – Escape\\". Several of the band's tracks (most prominently, \\"As Fire Swept Clean the Earth\\" from Below the Lights) have used mellotron. Isa (2004) and Ruun (2006) show a marked departure from previous sounds, most notably with the inclusion of sharp dynamic shifts, and Bjørnson considers the former a turning point for the band. Following Ruun, in 2007–2008, Bjørnson, Kjellson, and Isdal collaborated with the Norwegian noise duo Fe-Mail under the name Trinacria. Enslaved released the album Vertebrae in September 2008, their tenth studio album and their first on Nuclear Blast. Terrorizer Magazine named it the album of the year in 2008, notably above other metal releases such as Meshuggah's obZen and Opeth's Watershed. After touring Europe extensively, Enslaved embarked on a North American tour with the progressive death metal band Opeth in May 2009. The album is noted for its shift in its approach and its diverse sounds; Sammy O'Hagar from MetalSucks.net even says that \\"to call [Vertebrae] black metal would be quite a stretch\\" because \\"there’s an impressive depth to [it] that surpasses the sour misanthropy so often (and rightfully) associated with the genre\\", and furthermore describing their sound as \\"heavy and surprisingly soft, focused and curious, true to their roots and longing to forget them\\". The album's sound has been said to be akin to Pink Floyd's sound on a few occasions, as well as other black metal releases in a similar vein. Enslaved released their eleventh studio album, Axioma Ethica Odini, on 27 September 2010 in Europe and the following day in North America. In 2011 Enslaved released two new EPs. The first EP, entitled The Sleeping Gods, which was produced in partnership with Scion Audio/Visual, was released on 10 May 2011 and made available as a free download consisting of 5 original tracks. The second EP, entitled Thorn, was released on 27 August 2011 in partnership with Soulseller Records in fulfillment of a decade-old agreement. The Thorn EP, released on seven-inch vinyl, was strictly limited to 1,000 copies and featured a more atmospheric sound than the band is currently known for. Enslaved started their 20th anniversary tour \\"Circling Above and Within North America Tour Part IV\\" in September 2011 with Alcest and Junius in the United States and Canada. An official tribute album called Önd – A Tribute was released on Pictonian Records in July 2012. It contains twenty covers from twenty bands (including Dordeduh, Fen, Kraków, Vreid and Wodensthrone) to celebrate the two first decades of Enslaved's career. After having signed to Nuclear Blast in Europe, too, Enslaved released their 12th studio album, RIITIIR, on 28 September 2012 in Europe and 9 October in North America. The album received positive reviews from music critics. In 2013 they contributed to the book \\"Think like a rockstar\\" Tenk som en rockestjerne, written by Ståle Økland. Enslaved released their 13th full-length studio album, In Times, on 10 March 2015 through Nuclear Blast. The album received positive reviews from music critics, with AllMusic's Thom Jurek noting that the band are \\"still pushing at the boundaries of the music that inspired them back in 1991 when guitarist Ivar Bjørnson and vocalist/bassist Grutle Kjellson (13 and 17 years old at the time) first formed the band.\\" In 2016 the band celebrated their 25th anniversary with a series of exclusive shows and merchandise designs. Their Spinning Wheel Ritual tour across Europe with Ne Obliviscaris and Oceans of Slumber will take place from late September to early November. They also announced their plans to release a new compilation album on 11 November 2016, titled The Sleeping Gods – Thorn. The album compiles rare and experimental material from 2010-2011 which were previously available as two separate EPs released in 2011, The Sleeping Gods, and Thorn. In December 2016, keyboardist Herbrand Larsen left the band amicably after 12 years. The band then recruited Håkon Vinje of Seven Impale, a Norwegian band that opened for them at a concert in Bergen. Enslaved's 14th studio album E was released on 13 October 2017. In June 2018, drummer Cato Bekkevold retired from the band amicably, and was replaced by Iver Sandøy, who had previously played in the side project Trinacria and co-produced several recent Enslaved albums. The band's 15th album Utgard was initially announced for Spring 2020, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic; it was finally released on 2 October 2020.  Musical style and influence  The band's early music was rooted in traditional black metal and Viking metal, however the band moved away from this sound with 2001's Monumension and 2003's Below the Lights. It was at this point that the band was reduced to its two founding members, Bjørnson and Kjellson. They began to incorporate elements of progressive rock, jazz, and other distinct influences into their sound, and over time have continued this progression. Kjellson has named Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Rush, Genesis, Darkthrone, early Mayhem, and Bathory as important influences on the band's sound.

After Lou's birth, his father, or perhaps Lou himself, changed his family name to \\"Little\\", translating the Italian family name. He served as the head coach at Georgetown College, now Georgetown University, from 1924 to 1929 and at Columbia University from 1930 to 1956, compiling a career college football record of 151–128–13. Little played college football as a tackle at the University of Pennsylvania for the 1916 and 1919 seasons and then with the professional football team the Frankford Yellow Jackets from 1920 to 1923. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1960. He appeared as Lu Libble in Jack Kerouac's novel Maggie Cassidy, a fictionalized account of Kerouac's early life. Playing career and military service Little, who graduated from Worcester Academy, played college football at the University of Pennsylvania. Little gained national attention as a varsity tackle during 1916 season and was named All-American, and again in the 1919 season. Between those years, he served with distinction during World War I with the American Expeditionary Forces in France. Commissioned as a lieutenant, he was promoted to a captain in the 6th Infantry Division. He saw action in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Coaching career In 1924, Little accepted the post of head football coach at Georgetown and held the position until 1930, when he resigned to become head football coach at Columbia University. Little was the head coach at Columbia from 1930 to 1956. He was probably best known for two wins: the 1934 Rose Bowl when Columbia beat Stanford, 7–0, and a 21–20 win over Army in 1947 in which the Columbia Lions handed the Cadets their first loss since the 1943 season finale, snapping a 23-game undefeated streak. At Columbia, Little coached future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Sid Luckman and writer Jack Kerouac, who broke his leg playing in 1940. Other players he coached include Paul Governali, Lou Kusserow, Cliff Montgomery and Bill Swiacki. Personal life Little was married to Loretta Donohue for 50 years. Following his 1956 retirement they lived in Barnstable, Massachusetts and Delray Beach, Florida until her death in 1977. Little died at a nursing home in Delray Beach, Florida on May 28, 1979 at the age of 85.

She was ordered in 1853 from the Netherlands, the only Western country with which Japan had diplomatic relations throughout its period of sakoku (seclusion), by the shōguns government, the Bakufu. She was delivered on September 21, 1857 (with the name Japan), by Lt. Willem Huyssen van Kattendijke of the Dutch navy. The ship was used at the newly established Naval School of Nagasaki in order to build up knowledge of Western warship technology. Kanrin Maru, as a screw-driven steam warship, represented a new technological advance in warship design which had been introduced in the West only ten years earlier with . The ship was built by the shipyard of Fop Smit at Kinderdijk in the Netherlands, where the virtually identical screw-steamship with schooner-rig Bali of the Dutch navy was also built in 1856. She allowed Japan to get its first experience with some of the newest advances in ship design.Hendrik Caspar Romberg's account of the Sangoku-maru is a scant record of the brief attempt by the Tokugawa shogunate to create a sea-going vessel in the 1780s. The ship sank; and the tentative project was abandoned when the political climate in Edo shifted. See Timon Screech. (2006). Japanese embassy to the US Three years later, the Bakufu sent Kanrin Maru on a mission to the United States, clearly wanting to make a point to the world that Japan had now mastered western navigation techniques and western ship technologies. On 9 February 1860 (18 January in the Japanese calendar), the Kanrin Maru, captained by Katsu Kaishū together with John Manjiro, Fukuzawa Yukichi, and a total of 96 Japanese sailors, and the American officer John M. Brooke, left Uraga for San Francisco. This became the second official Japanese embassy to cross the Pacific Ocean, around 250 years after the embassy of Hasekura Tsunenaga to Mexico and then Europe in 1614, aboard the Japanese-built galleon . Kanrin Maru was accompanied by a United States Navy ship, the . The official objective of the mission was to send the first ever Japanese embassy to the US, and to ratify the new treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the United States and Japan. Reclamation of the Bonin Islands In January 1861, \\"Kanrin Maru\\" was dispatched to the Bonin Islands, also known as Ogasawara Islands in Japanese. A navigator aboard the diplomatic mission, Bankichi Matsuoka was sent to survey the islands. The shogunate of Japan first claimed the Pacific islands and its multi-ethnical settler community in the face of competing Western empires. The islands had previously been claimed by Britain, and the United States had considered making them a navy base. The flagship \\"Kanrin Maru\\" was put to use in a display of military power reminiscent of the arrival of Commodore Perry's black ships in Japan just a few years earlier. Boshin war Members of the Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860), who sailed on the Kanrin Maru and the USS Powhatan. Fukuzawa Yukichi sits on the right. By the end of 1867, the Bakufu was attacked by pro-imperial forces, initiating the Boshin War which led to the Meiji Restoration. Towards the end of the conflict, in September 1868, after several defeats by the Bakufu, Kanrin Maru was one of the eight modern ships led by Enomoto Takeaki towards the northern part of Japan, in his final attempt to wage a counter-attack against pro-imperial forces. The fleet encountered a typhoon on its way northward, and Kanrin Maru, having suffered damage, was forced to take refuge in Shimizu harbour, where she was captured by Imperial forces, who bombarded and boarded the ship notwithstanding a white flag of surrender, and put the skeleton crew aboard to the sword.Oliver Statlet, Japanese Inn, Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1982, p. 274. Enomoto Takeaki finally surrendered in May 1869, and after the end of the conflict, Kanrin Maru was used by the new Imperial government for the development of the northern island of Hokkaido. She was lost there in a typhoon in 1871, at Esashi. Kanrin Maru today In 1990, a ship replica twice the size of the original was ordered for manufacture in the Netherlands, according to the original plans. The ship was visible in the theme park of Huis Ten Bosch in Kyūshū, in southern Japan. It is now used as a sightseeing ship to the Naruto whirlpools from Minami Awaji harbour. Notes References *H.

The amino group attaches not to the α carbon but to the β carbon, which in this case is a methylene group. β-peptides consist of β amino acids, which have their amino group bonded to the β carbon rather than the α carbon as in the 20 standard biological amino acids. The only common naturally occurring β amino acid is β-alanine; although it is used as a component of larger bioactive molecules, β-peptides in general do not appear in nature. For this reason β-peptide-based antibiotics are being explored as ways of evading antibiotic resistance. Early studies in this field were published in 1996 by the group of Dieter Seebach and that of Samuel Gellman. Chemical structure and synthesis In α amino acids (molecule at left), both the carboxylic acid group (red) and the amino group (blue) are bonded to the same carbon center, termed the α carbon (\\\\mathrm{C}^{\\\\alpha}) because it is one atom away from the carboxylate group. In β amino acids, the amino group is bonded to the β carbon (\\\\mathrm{C}^{\\\\beta}), which is found in most of the 20 standard amino acids. Only glycine lacks a β carbon, which means that β-glycine is not possible. The chemical synthesis of β amino acids can be challenging, especially given the diversity of functional groups bonded to the β carbon and the necessity of maintaining chirality. In the alanine molecule shown, the β carbon is achiral; however, most larger amino acids have a chiral \\\\mathrm{C}^{\\\\beta} atom. A number of synthesis mechanisms have been introduced to efficiently form β amino acids and their derivatives notably those based on the Arndt-Eistert synthesis. Two main types of β-peptides exist: those with the organic residue (R) next to the amine are called β3-peptides and those with position next to the carbonyl group are called β2-peptides. :Beta peptides Secondary structure Because the backbones of β-peptides are longer than those of peptides that consist of α-amino acids, β-peptides form different secondary structures. The alkyl substituents at both the α and β positions in a β amino acid favor a gauche conformation about the bond between the α-carbon and β-carbon. This also affects the thermodynamic stability of the structure. Many types of helix structures consisting of β-peptides have been reported. These conformation types are distinguished by the number of atoms in the hydrogen-bonded ring that is formed in solution; 8-helix, 10-helix, 12-helix, 14-helix, and 10/12-helix have been reported. Generally speaking, β-peptides form a more stable helix than α-peptides. Clinical potential β-peptides are stable against proteolytic degradation in vitro and in vivo, an important advantage over natural peptides in the preparation of peptide-based drugs. β-Peptides have been used to mimic natural peptide-based antibiotics such as magainins, which are highly potent but difficult to use as drugs because they are degraded by proteolytic enzymes in the body. List 8 beta forms exist: alanine, leucine, lysine, arginine, glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine, tyrosine forms.Enantioselective Synthesis of Beta-Amino Acids Sec 2.2, Eusebio Juaristi, Vadim A.

Iron Palm or Iron Hand (Chinese: 铁掌功) is a body of training techniques in various Chinese martial arts. It is originally one of the 72 arts of the Shaolin temple. These conditioning techniques are typically meant to condition the hands to allow a practitioner to deliver very powerful blows without injury to his or her hands. Overview Iron Palm is the vernacular for the results of serious training centered mainly on the palm of the hand, although other parts of the hand may also be targeted, and covers many different conditioning methods. Most Iron Palm systems are considered internal, utilizing qigong exercises to train other aspects of development in addition to the external conditioning which ultimately alters the internal structures of the hand, such as the bones and sinews. However, martial artists who practice Iron Palm are not unified in their training and techniques. Some teachers treat their Iron Palm methodology as a valuable secret, and only share their specific techniques, training methods, and herbal remedies with a select fewreference needed. Not all Iron Palm methods are a martial arts style unto itself, but rather form a special feature of specialized conditioning that appears in many schools of Chinese martial arts. Some non-Chinese martial arts styles, such as Muay Thai and many schools of Karate, also feature hand conditioning, but the term Iron Palm is not typically used to describe these types of training, as they tend not to focus on developing internal power when conditioning the hands for the bone- crushing forces encountered with the striking maneuvers evident in breaking normally \\"unbreakable\\" objects. General principles Iron Palm training often involves three primary components: # Strengthening of the striking limbs by developing the tendons and ligaments from the shoulders to the fingertips, then striking or slapping relatively hard objects enclosed in canvas/leather bags. Following a conditioning session, the striking area is usually treated with a medicinal aid created from plant derivatives, usually a traditional Chinese liniment called Dit Da Jow. A common belief among practitioners is that failing to apply Dit Da Jow after Iron Palm training sessions can have negative effects on long-term health, such as movement limitation, arthritis, and other nerve damage to the hands. It is also believed that small blood clots can also occur if good Dit Da Jow is not used causing eye blindness through clots in small capillaries (blood vessels). Soaking and thorough massaging of hands after training is imperative. # Using proper technique to strike with greater force: As in other martial arts, students learn specific body mechanics with the intent to produce a more powerful strike. Students train to relax the body and release residual tension in order to move faster. This is usually done with standing meditation routines designed to release the residual tension in the body and develop \\"linking\\" power. # Engaging in Qigong exercises in order to develop \\"qi\\" (also chi or ch'i, or Japanese ki). This Qigong training coordinates breathing to improve mental focus, resulting in a more powerful strike. Direct and indirect methods Schools of Iron Palm training are often divided into \\"direct\\" or \\"indirect.\\" Both methods usually consist of striking progressively harder surfaces. Some practitioners also refer to their training as Nei Jing (\\"internal\\") or Li (\\"external\\"), this deals with the Qi energy or type of force (jin) used. In the \\"direct\\" method the hands are thrust into buckets or containers of the medium; the hands come into direct contact with the substance. In the \\"indirect\\" method, the practitioner strikes bags or other containers filled with various materials. As training progresses, the bags or buckets filled with increasingly resistant substances starting with beans then sand, progressing onto gravel or rocks, then finally lead and iron shot. Practitioners can measure their progress based upon the number of strikes performed in a particular training session or by the amount of clock time spent training. Relaxation while training strikes and use of good Dit Da Jow medicine is imperative to proper success. Proper breathing is also essential for maximum effect/success. Uses The Chinese martial arts can utilize a wide variety of open and closed hand strikes. Hardening the hands is also considered by some to supplement speed and strength lost through aging. Iron palm practitioners often demonstrate their abilities by breaking hard objects such as bricks, coconuts, stones and boards with their bare hands or in some cases forcefully hitting a steel object rapidly without sustaining significant injury. Techniques Iron Palm—also called Tie Zhang in Chinese—utilizes five different striking techniques, they are as follows. # Slapping - utilizes the whole palm # Throwing - utilizes the back of the hand # Cutting - utilizes the side of the palm # Dotting - utilizes the fingertips # Stamping - utilizes the base of the palm These techniques are used when striking the Iron Palm bag which is filled with a variety of materials like, rice, mung beans, pea gravel or steel shot depending on one's level of expertise. Before and after each training session, an Iron Palm liniment is applied to the hands to prevent injury and condition the hands. Tie Ba Zhang Yao is a popular liniment used for Iron Palm training and conditioning.

History Originally named Carla-le-Comte, the commune became a center of Protestant activity in the 16th century before the government suppressed it. Pierre Bayle, the important Protestant philosopher and writer was born here, and taught in his early years by his father, a Protestant minister. He briefly converted to Catholicism, before reverting to the Protestant Reform faith. His rejection of Catholicism led to his need to leave France. Later the government Protestant institutions and oppressed Protestants, however the majority of Carla remained Protestant. A Protestant strong point it was besieged by the royal army and its walls and chateau demolished. During the revolution the commune was renamed Carla le peuple. Difficult to keep that name when the monarchy was restored, happily it had a distinguished son and the commune was renamed Carla-Bayle in honor of Bayle.

The coordinates are approximate. Little America I The first base in the series was established in January 1929 by Richard Byrd, and was abandoned in 1930. This was where the film With Byrd at the South Pole (1930) was filmed, about Byrd's trip to the South Pole. Little America II Byrd Antarctic Expedition II cover, Jan. 30, 1935 Little America II was established in 1934, some 30 feet (10 m) above the site of the original base, with some of the original base accessed via tunnel. This base was briefly set adrift in 1934, but the iceberg fused to the main glacier. During the 1934–1935 expedition, many souvenir letters were sent from Little America, using a commemorative postage stamp issued by the U.S. government. The souvenir cancellation operations were conducted under extremely difficult conditions.A Philatelic Introduction to B.A.E. II: The Postal History Little America established the first successful radio broadcasting from Antarctica, making regular broadcasts that could be picked up by household radio sets in the United States, more than 11,000 miles away around the Earth's curvature. In a later expedition to Antarctica, Byrd's expedition spotted Little America's towers still standing, including the Jacobs Wind plant installed in 1933.Robert Righter, Wind Energy in America, p.95 Little America III Little America III was established for the 1940–1941 season some 6 miles (10 km) to the north. In 1940 a huge, extraordinary, exploration vehicle, the Antarctic Snow Cruiser, was brought to Little America III. Unfortunately, the vehicle was found to have a number of design and technical weaknesses and was little used. Abandoned, it became buried in the snow. It was last rediscovered in 1958, but has subsequently been lost once again, either under the snow, or under the waters of the Southern Ocean. The site of Little America III was carried to sea in 1963. Little America IV Little America IV was established in 1946–1947 as the primary camp for Operation Highjump. On 2 and 5 December 1946, 166 Seabees sailed from Port Hueneme on the USS Yancey and USS Merrick assigned to Operation Highjump. Little America V Little America V was established on January 3, 1956, at Kainan Bay, some 30 miles to the east of Little America IV, as part of Operation Deep Freeze. Little America V served as the American base in the South Polar program in the International Geophysical Year, from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958. Little America V was constructed by United States Navy Seabees in the three- month window before the Antarctic winter makes construction nearly impossible. All of Little America V was constructed below the snow line in the ice, with individual living quarters, generator room, cafeteria, and with ramps leading out at one end for tracked vehicles. This type of construction meant that none of those staying in Little America V had to go outdoors in the harsh winter when going from one section to another of the Antarctic town. \\"Seabees Build A Town.\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1956, pp. 89-94.

Similar in premise to that of the Thunderbirds television series, it was created by writer Pat Mills and was drawn by Carlos Pino and Ian Kennedy initially, before Starlord's merger with 2000 AD. After the merger, Dave Gibbons, Kevin O'Neill and Mike McMahon were regular artists on the series, along with occasional contributions from Mike Dorey. Along with Strontium Dog, Ro-Busters survived Starlord's merger with 2000 AD, its sister comic at IPC Magazines Ltd. The series introduced the decommissioned war robot Hammerstein and the sewer robot Ro-Jaws, and gave rise to the popular ABC Warriors series. Mandate Robots are going to take over Man's dirtiest jobs . . . clearing his garbage, tending his sick, even fighting his wars! By the year 2078 people will change their robots as today they change their cars. So step now through the slick plasto-glass doors of \\"Flash\\" Harry Lowder's robo- mart in the year 2078 . . .Quoted from Ro-Busters \\"Day of the Robot\\", Starlord Starzine 1. Publication history The story was one of those aimed at being the core of the new title Starlord, a sister-comic to 2000 AD. The concept was based on a suggestion from managing editor John Sanders and, according to writer Pat Mills \\"I did this really as a favour and as a way of pissing off the managing editor who pitched an idea to me about ex-servicemen with super powers who deal with disasters. It was a dreadful idea and I bypassed it by doing Ro-Busters, which he hated – so I knew my story would be a hit\\"Bishop (2007) page 40 Although he had stayed with 2000 AD, and would go on to be the art editor there, Kevin O'Neill provided the initial designs for Ro- BusterBishop (2007) page 41 but would only draw the series later after its move to 2000 AD. The stories were drawn by a number of artists and Dave Gibbons has fond memories of his work on Ro-Busters: Hammerstein, Ro-Jaws and Mek-Quake would go on to be members of the ABC Warriors, first introduced in Hammerstein's flashbacks to his time in the Volgan War. After the launch of ABC Warriors Pat Mills did not write another Ro-Busters story for thirty-five years, but there were a number of one-offs published in the 2000 AD Annual during the early eighties, most notable three stories by Alan Moore which were the last Ro-Busters tales. Overview Ro-Busters depicts a world where artificially intelligent robots are so ubiquitous they are treated with contempt by humans and there is a class hierarchy among the robots themselves. Ro-Busters is a commercial rescue organisation run by Howard Quartz, known as \\"Mr. 10 Per Cent\\" because 90% of him is robotic (a 'person' must have at least 10% organic matter to qualify as human). Quartz uses robots to carry out his perilous rescue missions because no-one cares if they live or die. Any insubordination in the ranks is dealt with by his enforcer, the psychotic and stupid \\"kill-dozer\\" Mek-Quake. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein, the two main characters, are hugely courageous but after each successful mission they are usually greeted with indifference by the authorities. When the owner of Ro- Busters decides to destroy the robots in an 'accident' as a tax evasion measure, Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein lead an escape plot. Once free they learn that a robot underground exists and that a safe haven for free robots has been established on the Saturn's moon Titan. The Ro-Busters by this stage are being pursued by a ruthless police unit charged with suppressing robot liberation. A transport is arranged to take the robots to Titan but at the last moment the police close in so Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein with a few volunteers lead a seeming suicide mission to fight off the authorities and buy time for their comrades to escape. The mission is a success and Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein are seen dancing into the sunset. The series has a high degree of satiric comment on contemporary life as Pat Mills had shown on other series. The corrupt and malicious police squad sent to capture the robots is a parody of the Special Patrol Group. Some claim the wilful destruction of a productive and loyal workforce reflects the effects of Thatcherism – though the storyline was already well underway before the first Thatcher government had been elected. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein's names are a word play on the musical writing pairing of Rodgers and Hammerstein and the story also features a number of song and dance routines. Ro-Busters would turn up in Savage Book Five, set in an alternate 2009; a human Howard Quartz and his Ro-Busters company designed the first ABC Warriors to liberate Volgan-occupied territories. Quartz was revealed to be the brother of the US Vice-President Dick Quartz and a leading arms manufacturer; when the U.S. was neutral towards the Volgans, Quartz had secretly sold weapons to them via murky legal means.

Andromeda I is part of the local group of galaxies and a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is roughly 3.5 degrees south and slightly east of M31. As of 2005, it is the closest known dSph companion to M31 at an estimated projected distance of ~40 kpc or ~150,000 light-years. Andromeda I was discovered by Sidney van den Bergh in 1970 with the Mount Palomar Observatory 48-inch telescope. Further study of Andromeda I was done by the WFPC2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope. This found that the horizontal branch stars, like other dwarf spheroidal galaxies were predominantly red.

He was the husband of Aung San Suu Kyi, the current State Counsellor of Myanmar. Life Aris was born in Havana, Cuba. His mother, Josette Aris (née Vaillancourt), was the Canadian Ambassador's daughter, and his English father, John Aris, was an officer with the British Council.Gutchow, Kim. 'Michael Aris: In memoriam'. Ladakh Studies 12 (Autumn 1999), pp. 18–20. After being educated at Worth School in Sussex and upon completing his degree in modern history at St Cuthbert's Society, Durham University in 1967, Aris spent six years as the private tutor of the children of the royal family of the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan. Aris was an academic and lecturer in Asian history at St John's College and later at St Antony's College, Oxford. In the last years before his death, he helped to establish a specialist Tibetan and Himalayan Studies centre at Oxford. Michael Aris's identical twin brother, Anthony Aris, similarly became a scholar of Tibetan studies, and founded Serindia Publications to focus on bringing Tibetan history and culture to modern audiences. Aung San Suu Kyi In 1972, Aris married Aung San Suu Kyi, whom he had met while at the university. They married in a Buddhist ceremony. After spending a year in Bhutan, they settled in North Oxford, where they raised their two sons, Alexander Aris and Kim Aris. During this time, he did postgraduate studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London and obtained a PhD in Tibetan literature in 1978. In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma at first to care for her mother but later to lead the country's pro-democracy movement. St John's College provided Aris with an extended leave of absence as a fellow on full stipend so that he could lobby for his wife's cause. In 1997, Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer which was later found to be terminal. Several countries, prominent individuals and organisations, including the United States government, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II, made appeals to the Burmese authorities to allow Dr Aris a visa. The Burmese government would not grant him a visa to visit Burma, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from house arrest but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the junta's assurance that she could return. Aris died of prostate cancer on his 53rd birthday in 1999, in Oxford. After 1989, when his wife was first placed under house arrest, he had seen her only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995, after Suu Kyi had been released for the first time.

The force broke his neck, severing his spinal cord at the C6 level and instantly rendered him a quadriplegic. Billauer was told by doctors that he would never surf again. However, Billauer eventually did return to surfing, adapting his surfing technique and equipment to the situation of his current condition. He has become a role model guide to many other surfers, both professional and amateur, on how to live a life to the fullest, despite a life changing injury.National Spinal Cord Injury Association Through these efforts Jesse has gained sponsorships from companies including Hurley, Channel Islands Surfboards (who developed a \\"Jesse Billauer\\" model), LoFric, Wavejet and Shoe City. After graduating from Malibu High School, Billauer eventually enrolled at San Diego State University, with an emphasis in Communications. He graduated in 2002.

It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG). It is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains the use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a recent large study concludes \\"acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes.\\" A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high carbohydrate Eastern diet. It is a starch blocker, and inhibits alpha glucosidase, an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates. It is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus. Mechanism of action Acarbose inhibits enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) needed to digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha- glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane- bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level.Drug Therapy in Nursing, 2nd Edition. This reduction averages an absolute decrease of 0.7%, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies. Combination therapy The combination of acarbose with metformin results in greater reductions of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and post- prandial glucose than either agent alone. Dosing Since acarbose prevents the digestion of complex carbohydrates, the drug should be taken at the start of main meals (taken with first bite of meal). Moreover, the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal will determine the effectiveness of acarbose in decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia. Adults may take doses of 25 mg 3 times daily, increasing to 100 mg 3 times a day. However the maximum dose per day is 600 mg. Side-effects Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose- related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing. If a patient using acarbose suffers from a bout of hypoglycemia, the patient must eat something containing monosaccharides, such as glucose tablets or gel (GlucoBurst, Insta-Glucose, Glutose, Level One) and a doctor should be called. Because acarbose blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars, fruit juice or starchy foods will not effectively reverse a hypoglycemic episode in a patient taking acarbose. Hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine.  Life extension  In studies conducted by three independent laboratories by the US National Institute on Aging's intervention testing programme, acarbose was shown to extend the lifespan of female mice by 5% and of male mice by 22%.

The band has sold over 45 million records worldwide and has sold 15 million records in the United States alone. The group has also charted ten singles to the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, including six Top 10 singles and the Hot 100 number-one, \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\". Dall had ambitions of studying law, but ultimately turned to music instead. He began playing guitar but switched to bass at the age of 15. Dall later moved to Los Angeles with Bret Michaels, Rikki Rockett, and Matt Smith to play with the band Paris, which later became known as Poison.  Personal life Dall is the youngest of three children. He lived in Palm Bay, Florida with his family from the age of 9 to age 17, but relocated to Harrisburg when he was still young. Dall has two children: Zachary Brandon (born December 16, 1990) and Zoe Brianne (born January 9, 1997). Band incident During a Poison show in Atlanta on August 25, 2006, Dall and Bret Michaels had to be separated by members of the road crew and the rest of the band after the two came to blows right before the encore, with Michaels throwing his mic at Dall, and Dall retaliating by slamming his bass into Michaels, injuring his knee. Michaels apologized later and stated, \\"You may have just seen the last concert by Poison in its current formation.\\" The altercation happened before the band's set ended with \\"Talk Dirty To Me.\\" After some tense moments and Michaels' apology to the crowd including his explanation that \\"like brothers, sometimes you have to air things out,\\" the band did finish the set. Dall left the stage immediately. There have been many physical conflicts within the band over the years, but this altercation was the first onstage incident since the fistfight between Michaels and Poison guitarist C.C. Deville at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1991, although that took place after the performance, not during. The band took time out while Michaels continued with his solo tour.

It developed out of the Liberal Christianity of the modern era, which was rooted in enlightenment thinking. As such, Progressive Christianity is a \\"post-liberal movement\\" within Christianity \\"that seeks to reform the faith via the insights of post- modernism and a reclaiming of the truth beyond the verifiable historicity and factuality of the passages in the Bible by affirming the truths within the stories that may not have actually happened.\\" Progressive Christianity is characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, a strong emphasis on social justice and care for the poor and the oppressed, and environmental stewardship of the earth. Progressive Christians have a deep belief in the centrality of the instruction to \\"love one another\\" (John 15:17) within the teachings of Jesus Christ. This leads to a focus on promoting values such as compassion, justice, mercy, and tolerance, often through political activism. Though prominent, the movement is by no means the only significant movement of progressive thought among Christians. Progressive Christianity draws on the insights of multiple theological streams including evangelicalism, liberalism, neo-orthodoxy, pragmatism, postmodernism, Progressive Reconstructionism, and liberation theology.Witness Articles - Progressive Christian Witness The concerns of feminism are also a major influence on the movement, as expressed in feminist and womanist theologies.Cobb, John, Jr., ed. Progressive Christians Speak: A Different Voice on Faith and Politics, Progressive Christians Uniting, Westminster John Knox Press, 2003. p. 72. Flunder, Yvette, Where the Edge Gathers: Building a Community of Radical Inclusion, Pilgrim Press, 2005. Heyward, Carter, Saving Jesus From Those Who Are Right: Rethinking what it means to be Christian, Fortress Press, 1999. Although the terms Progressive Christianity and Liberal Christianity are often used synonymously, the two movements are distinct, despite much overlap. Origins A priority of justice and care for the down- trodden are a recurrent theme in the Hebrew prophetic tradition inherited by Christianity. This has been reflected in many later Christian traditions of service and ministry, and more recently in the United States of America through Christian involvement in political trends such as the Progressive Movement and the Social Gospel. Throughout the 20th century, a strand of progressive or liberal Christian thought outlined the values of a 'good society'. It stresses fairness, justice, responsibility, and compassion, and condemns the forms of governance that wage unjust war, rely on corruption for continued power, deprive the poor of facilities, or exclude particular racial or sexual groups from fair participation in national liberties. It was influential in the US mainline churches, and reflected global trends in student activism. It contributed to the ecumenical movement, as represented internationally by the World Student Christian Federation and the World Council of Churches internationally, and at the national level through groups such as the National Council of Churches in the US and Australian Student Christian Movement. The contemporary movement The ascendancy of evangelicalism in the US, particularly in its more socially conservative forms, challenged many people in mainline churches. Recently, a focus for those who wish to challenge this ascendancy has been provided by Jim Wallis of Sojourners, who described himself as a progressive evangelical Christian, although Sojourners has rejected advertisements urging mainline churches to welcome gay members. This has enabled many Christians who are uncomfortable with conservative evangelicalism to identify themselves explicitly as \\"Progressive Christians\\". At the onset of this new movement to organize Progressive Christians, the single largest force holding together was a webring, The Progressive Christian Bloggers Network, and supporters frequently find and contact each other through dozens of online chat-rooms. Notable initiatives within the movement for progressive Christianity include the Center for Progressive Christianity (TCPC) in Cambridge, Massechusettes, The Beatitudes Society, the campaigning organization CrossLeft, the technology working group Social Redemption and The Progressive Episcopal Church (TPEC). CrossLeft joined with Every Voice Network and Claiming the Blessing in October 2005 to stage a major conference, Path to Action, at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. Among the speakers were E. J. Dionne, Richard Parker, Jim Wallis, Senator Danforth, and David Hollinger. In the United Kingdom, the movement is represented by the Progressive Christianity Network Britain. Notable related UK organisations include the Center for Radical Christianity at St Marks, Sheffield, and the UK-based Sea of Faith network. Examples of statements of contemporary Progressive Christian beliefs include: * the Eight Points produced by TCPC: a statement of agreement about Christianity as a basis for tolerance and human rights; * the Phoenix Affirmations produced by Crosswalk (Phoenix, AZ) - include twelve points defining Christian love of God, Christian love of neighbor, and Christian love of self. * the article, \\"Grassroots Progressive Christianity: A Quiet Revolution\\" by Hal Taussig published in The Fourth R, May–June 2006.https://web.archive.org/web/20111008175803/http://www.sdc.unitingchurch.org.au/WestarProgressiveArticle.pdf * the working definition utilized in Roger Wolsey's book Kissing Fish: Christianity for People Who Don't Like Christianity: As Wolsey mentions, Progressive Christianity \\"leans toward panentheism rather than supernatural theism...\\" The role of panentheism in Progressive Christianity shifts the emphasis from belief to contemplative practice and experiential faith. So Progressive Christianity is often characterized by contemplative or meditative forms of worship. This finds perhaps its most poignant expression in Finding God in the Body: A Spiritual Path for the Modern West by Benjamin Riggs: =Differences between Progressive Christianity and Conservative Christianity= According to Archbishop Wynn Wagner of the former North American Old Catholic Church, holding to the ideals of progressive Christianity sets the movement apart from traditional Christianity. Inclusiveness and acceptance is the basic posture of progressive Christianity.:*Abp. Wynn Wagner III, A Pilgrim's Guide to the Old Catholic Church, Mystic Ways,2009, =Seventh-day Adventism= Within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the liberal wing describe themselves as \\"progressive Adventists\\". They disagree with some of the traditional teachings of the church. While most are still of evangelical persuasion, a minority are liberal Christians. Environmental ministries As Bruce Sanguin writes, \\"It's time for the Christian church to get with a cosmological program (...). We now know, for instance, that we live in an evolving or evolutionary universe. Evolution is the way that the Holy creates in space and in time, in every sphere: material, biological, social, cultural, psychological, and spiritual. This new cosmology simply cannot be contained by old models and images of God, or by old ways of being the church.\\"Bruce Sanguin - Darwin, Divinity, and the Dance of the Cosmos, Copperhouse and Woodlake Publishing , 2007 Central to this recovery of awe in the cosmos is the epic of evolution, the 14-billion- year history of the universe. Scientists (Edward O. Wilson, Brian Swimme, Eric Chaisson, Ursula Goodenough and others) initiated this story which has been perpetuated with a religion component by some liberal theologians (Gordon D. Kaufman, Jerome A. Stone, Michael Dowd, etc.).:*Edward O. Wilson, On Human Nature, Harvard University Press,1979, :*The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era: A Celebration of the Unfolding of the Cosmos; Brian Swimme, Harper, 1992 (1994, ) :*Ursula Goodenough - Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (15 June 2000), :*Eric Chaisson - Epic of Evolution, Columbia University Press (2 March 2007), :*Jerome A.

His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a form of religious naturalism). He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe and a new approach to religion. Evolution is viewed as a religious spiritual process that is not meaningless blind chance. Criticism Geoff Thompson argues that the rhetoric of Progressive Christianity, as represented by Gretta Vosper and John Shelby Spong, \\"often over-reaches its arguments.\\" In particular, he concludes that \\"[i]t is very difficult to see how what [Vosper] proposes needs any church or even the minimalist, idiosyncratic definition of Christianity which she offers.

Livadiya (; ; ; ) is an urban-type settlement in Yalta Municipality of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea; a territory recognized by a majority of countries as part of Ukraine but incorporated by Russia as the Republic of Crimea. It is located west of Yalta. Population: History A minor Crimean Tatar settlement in the Middle Ages, Livadiya was named thus by Lambros Katsonis, a Greek revolutionary and Imperial Russian Army officer, after Livadeia, Greece, the town he was born in, then part of the Ottoman Empire. Katsonis had been granted an estate there by Empress Catherine II, which he named thus. See also the Lambros Katsonis articles in the Russian and Ukrainian language Wikipedia, respectively. The estate later passed to the possession of the Potocki family and then, in 1861, it became a summer residence of the Russian tsars. Emperor Alexander III of Russia died there in 1894. The Livadia Palace, built in 1910–11, architect Nikolai Krasnov, is now a museum. It was formerly a summer palace of the last Russian Imperial family. In 1945, it served as the meeting place of the Yalta Conference and residence of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Conference.

Bolle (June 23, 1924 – May 12, 2020) was an American comic-strip artist, comic book artist and illustrator, best known as the longtime artist of the newspaper strips Winnie Winkle and The Heart of Juliet Jones; for stints on the comic books Tim Holt and Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom; and as an illustrator for the Boy Scouts of America magazine Boys' Life for 18 years. With an unknown writer, he co-created the masked, Old West comic-book heroine the Black Phantom. Bolle sometimes used the pen name FWB and, at least once, F. L. Blake. Early life Frank Bolle was born in Italy and immigrated to the United States at age 5 to join his mother in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, although Bolle in adulthood said he was born in Brooklyn. He grew up in that borough with mother Mary and stepfather Egidio \\"Louie\\" Covacich. Bolle attended Manhattan's High School of Music & Art, though one standard reference source, attributing its information to Bolle via an intermediary, lists the School of Industrial Art high school. Note: Information \\"by Frank Bolle via Jim Amash March 2006\\". From 1943 to 1946, Bolle served in the United States Army Air Force, and after his return from World War II attended Pratt Institute on the G.I. Bill, graduating in three years. Career =1940s and 1950s= Bolle broke into comics in 1943, drawing backgrounds for Funnies Inc., one of a handful of \\"packagers\\" that supplied content to publishers entering the fledgling medium of comic books.

His comics output became regular soon afterward with a \\"Freddy Freshman\\" story in Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel Jr. #46 (Feb. 1947) and work in Crown Comics from the publisher McCombs from 1947 to 1948. He did additional work for Fawcett, and signed some of his Lev Gleason Publications comics work FWB.

With an unknown writer, Bolle co-created the masked Old West heroine the Black Phantom in Magazine Enterprises' Western comic Tim Holt #25 (Sept. 1951).Tim Holt #25 at the Grand Comics Database. Through 1954, he also drew the title feature as well as the backup feature \\"Redmask\\", then took over the art for the spinoff series Red Mask, drawing issues #42–53 to (July 1954 – May 1956). Additionally, for DC Comics, Bolle drew the cyborg-superhero feature \\"Robotman\\" in Detective Comics #167–179 (Jan. 1951 – Jan. 1952). From 1955 to 1957, Bolle drew Robin Hood stories in ME's Robin Hood and the subsequent, TV series-based The Adventures of Robin Hood. For Marvel Comics' 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics, he drew supernatural fantasy stories in the anthologies Mystic, Marvel Tales, Strange Tales, Journey into Mystery and other titles in 1956 and 1957. As well by the mid-1950s, Bolle was illustrating juvenile fiction books, including Gene Autry & Champion (1956), and books starring Lassie and the Lone Ranger. He would later draw for the Choose Your Own Adventure children's book series. From 1957 to 1961, Bolle began his long career in newspaper comic strips, starting as an art assistant, drawing backgrounds, on the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate's daily and Sunday On Stage from 1957 to 1961. =1960s= This briefly overlapped his own Sunday comic strip, the McNaught Syndicate's Children's Tales, which he wrote and drew from 1960 to 1969. He recalled it as \\"a Sunday page where I illustrated some classics like 'Cinderella' and 'Rumplestilskin' and I did them in three parts so they would appear in three Sundays. And in-between that I would also write original stories, so I wrote about 12 to 15 original stories, then I would switch back and forth from classics to originals.\\" For the same syndicate, he drew the daily and Sunday strip Debbie Deere, \\"a lonely hearts writer [who] would get involved in some of the letters she got. I did that for about 4 years,\\" from 1966 to 1969. For the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate, he wrote and drew the strip Quick Quiz from 1964 to 1965. By this time he was also illustrating for magazines, beginning with the men's adventure title Stag from 1961 to 1962. He used the pseudonym F. L. Blake for the dust jacket of the 1963 book Picture Parade of Jewish History. Keeping a hand in comic books, Bolle drew the superhero series Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom #6–19 (Nov. 1963 – April 1967) for Western Publishing's Gold Key Comics imprint, and did a small amount of work for DC Comics, Dell Comics, and Tower Comics. In 1966, Bolle began a long association with the magazine Boys' Life, drawing numerous comic strips for the glossy monthly publication of the Boy Scouts of America. Through 1981, he drew at different times the strips Bible Stories, Green Bar Bill, Pedro Patrol, Pee Wee Harris, Pool of Fire, Scouts in America, Space Adventures, The Tracy Twins and White Mountains. He did other art as well for the magazine, from 1977 to 1984, and drew an adaptation of John Christopher's \\"The Tripods\\" as well as an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's \\"Between Planets.\\" From 1965 to 1975, Bolle drew covers for nonfiction paperback books including Baton Twirling, Invitation to Skin and Scuba Diving, Scuba, Spear & Snorkel, Soccer, and Boxing. =1970s–2000s= Two stories he penciled and inked, and one that he inked over penciler Russ Jones, from the paperback anthology Christopher Lee's Treasury of Terror (Pyramid Books, 1966), were reprinted in three 1968 issues of Warren Publications' black-and-white horror comics magazine Eerie. Bolle went on to draw new stories published in that magazine and in its sister publication Vampirella in 1970 and 1971, and in 1973 inked roughly a dozen stories for Marvel Comics, including in issues of The Avengers, The Defenders, Sub-Mariner, Marvel Premiere and Marvel Team-Up. Throughout the 1970s he also continued to do work for longtime clients Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics (in Flash Gordon, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, The Twilight Zone and other titles, including a short return to Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom). Additionally, sometimes under his FWB pseudonym, he also contributed to Charlton Comics. His comic-strip work in the 1970s included drawing the daily and Sunday Alexander Gates (1970–1971); the title character, Bolle said, \\"was an astrologist, I did that for a couple of years\\", For Universal Press Syndicate, he drew the trip Best Seller Showcase daily (1977) and Sunday (1977–1978), which included Raise the Titanic, based on the Clive Cussler novel; for the same syndicate, he drew Encyclopedia Brown daily and Sunday (1978–1980). He was the uncredited ghost artist on the daily Rip Kirby for King Features Syndicate from 1977 to 1994, and, for one month in 1982, the Sunday Tarzan for United Feature Syndicate. In an undated interview conducted no earlier than 1992, he said, \\"Today, I work on the Prince Valiant strip — I do some of them. It's funny — I grew up reading, admiring and copying Prince Valiant and today I'm the one penciling them!\\" Bolle's last known mainstream penciling and inking for comic books is the cover of Gold Key Comics' Shroud of Mystery #1 (June 1982). He later drew a page for the one-shot benefit comic Strip AIDS U.S.A. (1988) from Last Gasp. He returned to ink the last 31 pages of a 42-page story in Marvel's Captain Marvel vol. 2, #1 (Nov. 1989), over penciler Mark Bright. In the 1980s and 1990s, Bolle drew and lettered the Sunday and daily Tribune Media Services strip Winnie Winkle, either from 1982–1996 or, he has said, \\"for 20 years\\". He performed those same functions on King Features' The Heart of Juliet Jones from 1989–2000, either for both dailies and Sundays or \\"just dailies\\". He lettered Tribune's venerable Annie daily and Sunday strips in the 1980s through 1999, contributing, as well, a small amount of art as a ghost artist. Finally, he did ghost art on Tribune Media's Gil Thorp in 1995, 1996 and 2008.

From 1996 through at least 2009, Bolle did pet illustrations for the Westport Pet Company, as well as commissioned pet portraits, including one that was scheduled to appear in the Walt Disney Pictures movie Old Dogs. He illustrated the 2008 children's book My Cat Merigold by Angelica Joy. As late as 2004, he was a guest and panelist at Comic-Con International: San Diego. Awards Bolle was one of 10 recipients of the 2003 Inkpot Award. Personal life As an adult, Bolle lived in Weston, Connecticut, with his wife, Lori. He had two children, daughter Laura and son Frank.

The BAN is also the official name used in some countries across the world, because starting in 1953, proposed new names were evaluated by a panel of experts from WHO in conjunction with the BP commission to ensure naming consistency worldwide (an effort leading to the International Nonproprietary Name system). There is also a British Approved Name (Modified) (BANM). Combination preparations BANs are unique in that names are assigned for combination preparations as well as single-drug preparations. For example, the BAN Co-amoxiclav is assigned to preparations containing amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Most other pharmacopoeias simply refer to combination products by both ingredients in the preparation, in this example \\"amoxicillin with clavulanic acid\\". The prefix of \\"co-\\" is used for many combination drugs, including opioid with paracetamol or aspirin analgesics (e.g., Co-codamol, Co- codaprin, Co-dydramol, Co-proxamol). The other commonly encountered opioid combination is the anti-diarrhoeal, non-analgesic mixture of diphenoxylate and atropine, Co-phenotrope (a.k.a. Lomotil). Also antibiotics (e.g., Co- fluampicil and Co-trimoxazole), drugs to lower blood pressure (e.g., Co- tenidone), diuretics (e.g., Co-amilofruse and Co-amilozide), gastrointestinal drugs (e.g., Co-danthrusate), and anti-Parkinsonism agents such as Co- careldopa, Co-beneldopa, and others (e.g., Co-cyprindiol). BAN harmonisation European Union legislation from 2001 required harmonisation of the BP with the European Pharmacopoeia (EP), as well as the adoption of International Nonproprietary Names through directives (2001/82/EC\\"2001/82/EC\\" and 2001/83/EC,\\"2001/83/EC\\" as amended, and 2003/63/EC\\"2003/63/EC\\"). Across the EU has meant that, with the notable exception of adrenaline/epinephrine, BANs are now the same as the INNs. For example, the old BAN methicillin was replaced with the current BAN meticillin, matching the INN. This has resulted in an interesting situation in other countries that use BANs. While the British Pharmacopoeia and BANs are the official pharmacopoeia/names defined by legislation in many of these countries, the former BANs often continue to be used, purportedly because of the difficulty of changeover. Despite the importance of the BP, there appears to be little or no movement in the direction of changing these names. In Australia, the Australian Approved Names are generally the same as BANs, but a few exceptions remain.

The federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 guarantees that, in most states, the voter can cast a provisional ballot if the voter states that he or she is entitled to vote. Some of the most common reasons to cast a provisional ballot include: *The voter's name does not appear on the electoral roll for the given precinct (polling place), because the voter is not registered to vote or is registered to vote elsewhere *The voter's eligibility cannot be established or has been challenged *The voter lacks a photo identification document (in jurisdictions that require one) *The voter requested to vote by absentee ballot but claims to have not received, or not cast, the absentee ballot *The voter's registration contains inaccurate or outdated information such as the wrong address or a misspelled name *In a closed primary (limited to members of a political party), the voter's party registration is listed incorrectly Whether a provisional ballot is counted is contingent upon the verification of that voter's eligibility, which may involve local election officials reviewing government records or asking the voter for more information, such as a photo identification not presented at the polling place or proof of residence. Each state may set its own timing rules for when these issues must be resolved. Provisional ballots therefore cannot usually be counted until after the day of the election. History The right of political parties to have observers at polling places is long-standing.Title XIV, Chapter 5, Sec. 4922, The Election Laws of the State of Ohio, Ohio Secretary of State, 1920. One of the established roles for such observers is to act as challengers, in the event that someone attempts to vote at the polling place who is not eligible to vote.Election Day \\"Challengers\\" , Minnesota Secretary of State, June 2008. Before the implementation of provisional ballots, some state laws allowed a voter whose eligibility was challenged to cast a challenged ballot. After the polls closed, the canvassing board was then charged with examining the challenged ballots and determining whether the challenge was to be upheld or not. The Help America Vote Act brings a degree of uniformity to the array of various challenged ballot rules enacted by various states. For example, each state must provide a means for the voter to find out whether his or her ballot was counted, though the states may use different ways of doing so (such as a website or a phone number). Though the Act mandates the use of provisional ballots nationwide, it exempted the six states that had been exempted from the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 because those states had and continue to have either \\"same-day\\" voter registration or no registration requirement at all: Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. However, those states may choose to use provisional ballots. , North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming used them for some purposes, while the other three did not have provisional ballots at all. Potential problems In the 2018 midterm elections, both valid and invalid provisional ballots were mixed together in Florida after the initial vote count, which provided no way to be separated for the recount. Computer scientist and election official Douglas W. Jones has criticized the offer of a provisional ballot as \\"a way to brush off troublesome voters by letting them think they have voted.\\"Douglas W. Jones, Reliability of US Voting Systems, Prepared Remarks for the Congressional Black Caucus Hearing on election preparedness October 7, 2004. He expressed the concern that, under some states' laws, casting a provisional ballot at the wrong precinct would disenfranchise voters who could have cast valid ballots had they been redirected to the proper precinct. Academic research has suggested that provisional ballots tend to lean more toward the Democratic Party than the electorate as a whole, and that this contributes to a phenomenon, first identified by Edward Foley (lawyer) known as \\"blue shift,\\" under which Democrats increase their share of the vote as more ballots are counted. This can potentially result in a different outcome from the one indicated by the initial count on the night of the election. Some experts on voting have suggested that this shift could be misunderstood and lead to erroneous claims of electoral fraud or corruption. Rates of acceptance According to the Election Assistance Commission thousands of provisional ballots are not counted each election. The 2004 US Presidential Election was the first presidential election conducted under the Help America Vote Act's provisions. Nationwide, at least 1.9 million provisional ballots were cast, and 676,000 were never counted due to various states' rules on counting provisional ballots.Let The Recounts Begin (National Journal) Studies of the use of provisional ballots in the 2006 general election in the United States show that around 21% of provisional ballots were rejected. About 44% of these were cast by voters who were not registered, but many other rejections were for reasons that were \\"preventable,\\" such as an incorrect precinct or missing signature.Provisional Voting: Fail-Safe Voting or Trapdoor to Disenfranchisement , Advancement Project, Sept. 16, 2008 The rates of rejection vary widely across the states, with some states counting all or nearly all provisional ballots while others reject more than half.

When an action potential reaches the axon terminal of a motor neuron, vesicles carrying neurotransmitters (mostly acetylcholine) are exocytosed and the contents are released into the neuromuscular junction. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and lead to its depolarization. In the absence of an action potential, acetylcholine vesicles spontaneously leak into the neuromuscular junction and cause very small depolarizations in the postsynaptic membrane. This small response (~0.4mV) is called a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) and is generated by one acetylcholine-containing vesicle. It represents the smallest possible depolarization which can be induced in a muscle.  Neuromuscular junction  Signal transmission from nerve to muscle at the motor end plate. The neuromuscular junction is the synapse that is formed between an alpha motor neuron (α-MN) and the skeletal muscle fiber. In order for a muscle to contract, an action potential is first propagated down a nerve until it reaches the axon terminal of the motor neuron. The motor neuron then innervates the muscle fibers to contraction by causing an action potential on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. =Acetylcholine= End plate potentials are produced almost entirely by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine is the second most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the body following glutamate. It controls the somatosensory system which includes the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. It was the first neurotransmitter to be identified in 1914 by Henry Dale. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the neuron from choline and acetyl-CoA. Choline acyltransferase is the enzyme that synthesizes acetylcholine and is often used as a marker in research relating to acetylcholine production. Neurons that utilize acetylcholine are called cholinergic neurons and they are very important in muscle contraction, memory, and learning. = Ion channels= The polarization of membranes is controlled by sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride ion channels. There are two types of ion channels involved in the neuromuscular junction and end plate potentials: voltage-gated ion channel and ligand-gated ion channel. Voltage gated ion channels are responsive to changes in membrane voltage which cause the voltage gated ion channel to open and allows certain ions to pass through. Ligand gated ion channels are responsive to certain molecules such as neurotransmitters. The binding of a ligand to the receptor on the ion channel protein causes a conformational change which allows the passing of certain ions. = Presynaptic membrane = Normally the resting membrane potential of a motor neuron is kept at -70mV to -50 with a higher concentration of sodium outside and a higher concentration of potassium inside. When an action potential propagates down a nerve and reaches the axon terminal of the motor neuron, the change in membrane voltage causes the calcium voltage gated ion channels to open allowing for an influx of calcium ions. These calcium ions cause the acetylcholine vesicles attached to the presynaptic membrane to release acetylcholine via exocytosis into the synaptic cleft. = Postsynaptic membrane = EPP are caused mostly by the binding of acetylcholine to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. There are two different kinds of acetylcholine receptors: nicotinic and muscarinic. Nicotinic receptors are ligand gated ion channels for fast transmission. All acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction are nicotinic. Muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that use a second messenger. These receptors are slow and therefore are unable to measure a miniature end plate potential (MEPP). They are located in the parasympathetic nervous system such as in the vagus nerve and the gastrointestinal tract. During fetal development acetylcholine receptors are concentrated on the postsynaptic membrane and the entire surface of the nerve terminal in the growing embryo is covered even before a signal is fired. Five subunits consisting of four different proteins from four different genes comprise the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors therefore their packaging and assembly is a very complicated process with many different factors. The enzyme muscle- specific kinase (MuSK) initiates signaling processes in the developing postsynaptic muscle cell. It stabilizes the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor clusters, facilitates the transcription of synaptic genes by muscle fiber nuclei, and triggers differentiation of the axon growth cone to form a differentiated nerve terminal. Substrate laminin induces advanced maturation of the acetylcholine receptor clusters on the surfaces of myotubes.  Initiation =Synaptic vesicles= All neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis from synaptic vesicles. Two kinds of neurotransmitter vesicles exist: large dense core vesicles and small clear core vesicles. Large dense core vesicles contain neuropeptides and large neurotransmitters that are created in the cell body of the neuron and then transported via fast axonal transport down to the axon terminal. Small clear core vesicles transport small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized locally in the presynaptic terminals. Finalized neurotransmitter vesicles are bound to the presynaptic membrane. When an action potential propagates down the motor neuron axon and arrives at the axon terminal, it causes a depolarization of the axon terminal and opens calcium channels. This causes the release of the neurotransmitters via vesicle exocytosis. After exocytosis, vesicles are recycled during a process known as the synaptic vesicle cycle. The retrieved vesicular membranes are passed through several intracellular compartments where they are modified to make new synaptic vesicles. They are then stored in a reserve pool until they are needed again for transport and release of neurotransmitters. Unlike the reserve pool, the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles is ready to be activated. Vesicle depletion from the readily releasable pool occurs during high frequency stimulation of long duration and the size of the evoked EPP reduces. This neuromuscular depression is due to less neurotransmitter release during stimulation. In order for depletion not to occur, there must be a balance between repletion and depletion which can happen at low stimulation frequencies of less than 30 Hz. When a vesicle releases its neurotransmitters via exocytosis, it empties its entire contents into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter release from vesicles is therefore stated to be quantal because only whole numbers of vesicles can be released. In 1970, Bernard Katz from the University of London won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for statistically determining the quantal size of acetylcholine vesicles based on noise analysis in the neuromuscular junction. Using a book on mechanical statistics, he was able to infer the size of individual events going on at the same time. The synaptic vesicles of acetylcholine are clear core synaptic vesicles with a diameter of 30 nm. Each acetylcholine vesicle contains approximately 5000 acetylcholine molecules. The vesicles release their entire quantity of acetylcholine and this causes miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs) to occur which are less than 1mV in amplitude and not enough to reach threshold. =Miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs)= Miniature end plate potentials are the small (~0.4mV) depolarizations of the postsynaptic terminal caused by the release of a single vesicle into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitter vesicles containing acetylcholine collide spontaneously with the nerve terminal and release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction even without a signal from the axon. These small depolarizations are not enough to reach threshold and so an action potential in the postsynaptic membrane does not occur. During experimentation with MEPPs, it was noticed that often spontaneous action potentials would occur, called end plate spikes in normal striated muscle without any stimulus. It was believed that these end plate spikes occurred as a result of injury or irritation of the muscles fibers due to the electrodes. Recent experiments have shown that these end plate spikes are actually caused by muscle spindles and have two distinct patterns: small and large. Small end plate spikes have a negative onset without signal propagation and large end plate spikes resemble motor unit potentials (MUPs). Muscle spindles are sensory receptors that measure muscle elongation or stretch and relay the information to the spinal cord or brain for the appropriate response. =Threshold potential (\\"All or None\\") = When an action potential causes the release of many acetylcholine vesicles, acetylcholine diffuses across the neuromuscular junction and binds to ligand-gated nicotinic receptors (non- selective cation channels) on the muscle fiber. This allows for increased flow of sodium and potassium ions, causing depolarization of the sarcolemma (muscle cell membrane). The small depolarization associated with the release of acetylcholine from an individual synaptic vesicle is called a miniature end- plate potential (MEPP), and has a magnitude of about +0.4mV. MEPPs are additive, eventually increasing the end-plate potential (EPPs) from about -100mV up to the threshold potential of -60mV, at which level the voltage- gated ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane open, allowing a sudden flow of sodium ions from the synapse and a sharp spike in depolarization. This depolarization voltage spike triggers an action potential which propagates down the postsynaptic membrane leading to muscle contraction. It is important to note that EPPs are not action potentials, but that they trigger action potentials. In a normal muscular contraction, approximately 100-200 acetylcholine vesicles are released causing a depolarization that is 100 times greater in magnitude than a MEPP. This causes the membrane potential to depolarize +40mV (100 x 0.4mV = 40mV) from -100mV to -60mV where it reaches threshold. Action potential phases Once the membrane potential reaches threshold, an action potential occurs and causes a sharp spike in membrane polarity. There are five phases of an action potential: threshold, depolarization, peak, repolarization, and hyperpolarization. Threshold is when the summation of MEPPs reaches a certain potential and induces the opening of the voltage-gated ion channels. The rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane potential to reach a positive charge. The potassium ion channels are slower-acting than the sodium ion channels and so as the membrane potential starts to peak, the potassium ion channels open and causes an outflux of potassium to counteract the influx of sodium. At the peak, the outflux of potassium equals the influx of sodium, and the membrane does not change polarity. During repolarization, the sodium channels begin to become inactivated, causing a net efflux of potassium ions. This causes the membrane potential to drop down to its resting membrane potential of -100mV. Hyperpolarization occurs because the slow-acting potassium channels take longer to deactivate, so the membrane overshoots the resting potential. It gradually returns to resting potential and is ready for another action potential to occur. During the action potential before the hyperpolarization phase, the membrane is unresponsive to any stimulation. This inability to induce another action potential is known as the absolute refractory period. During the hyperpolarization period, the membrane is again responsive to stimulations but it requires a much higher input to induce an action potential. This phase is known as the relative refractory period. Once the action potential has finished in the neuromuscular junction, the used acetylcholine is cleared out of the synaptic cleft by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Several diseases and problems can be caused by the inability of enzymes to clear away the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft leading to continued action potential propagation.Purves D, Augustine G, et al. \\"Electrical Signals of Nerve Cells.\\" Neuroscience. Sinauer Associates, Inc: Sunderland, Massachusetts, 2008. 25-39. Clinical applications  Patient with myasthenia gravis showing typical symptom of eyelid droop Current research is attempting to learn more about end plate potentials and their effect on muscle activity. Many current diseases involve disrupted end plate potential activity. In Alzheimer patients, beta amyloid attaches to the acetylcholine receptors and inhibits acetylcholine binding. This causes less signal propagation and small EPPs that do not reach threshold. By analyzing brain processes with acetylcholine, doctors can measure how much beta amyloid is around and use it to judge its effects on Alzheimer's.Prives J, Professor of Pharmacology, State University of New York at Stony Brook. Interviewed by Pierre Watson. 2008-11-18. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, where the body produces antibodies targeted against the acetylcholine receptor on the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. Muscle fatigue and weakness, worsened with use and improved by rest, is the hallmark of the disease. Because of the limited amount of acetylcholine receptors that are available for binding, symptomatic treatment consists of using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to reduce the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, so that enough acetylcholine will be present for the small number of unblocked receptors. A congenital abnormality caused by a deficiency in end-plate acetylcholine esterase (AChE) might be a pathophysiologic mechanism for myasthenic gravis. In a study on a patient with AChE deficiency, doctors noted that he had developed severe proximal and truncal muscle weakness with jittering in other muscles. It was found that a combination of the jitter and blocking rate of the acetylcholine receptors caused a reduced end-plate potential similar to what is seen in cases of myasthenia gravis. Research of motor unit potentials (MUPs) has led to possible clinical applications in the evaluation of the progression of pathological diseases to myogenic or neurogenic origins by measuring the irregularity constant related. Motor unit potentials are the electrical signals produced by motor units that can be characterized by amplitude, duration, phase, and peak, and the irregularity coefficient (IR) is calculated based on the peak numbers and amplitudes. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a disorder where presynaptic calcium channels are subjected to autoimmune destruction which causes fewer neurotransmitter vesicles to be exocytosed. This causes smaller EPPs due to less vesicles being released. Often the smaller EPPs do not reach threshold which causes muscle weakness and fatigue in patients. Many animals use neurotoxins to defend themselves and kill prey. Tetrodotoxin is a poison found in the certain poisonous fishes such as pufferfish and triggerfish which blocks the sodium ion channels and prevents an action potential on the postsynaptic membrane. Tetraethylammonium found in insects blocks potassium channels. Alpha neurotoxin found in snakes binds to acetylcholine receptors and prevents acetylcholine from binding. Alpha- latrotoxin found in black widow spiders causes a massive influx of calcium at the axon terminal and leads to an overflow of neurotransmitter release. Botulinum toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum is the most powerful toxic protein. It prevents release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting docking of the neurotransmitter vesicles.

It is the second largest town in the district Feldkirch and the eighth largest town in Vorarlberg. Geography Rankweil is located in the southern Rhine Valley. Its largest river is the Frutz, from which the Mühlbach was channeled off through the town for utilization by ten hydroelectric plants. The two precincts of Rankweil are Brederis and Rankweil. The town adjoins Koblach, Röthis, Sulz, Zwischenwasser, Laterns, Übersaxen, Satteins, Göfis, Feldkirch and Meiningen. History At the time of the Roman Empire, today's Rankweil was known as \\"Vinomna\\". Vinomna was a transport hub where stone-paved Roman roads converged, including the main road from Chur to Augsburg. Rankweil itself was first mentioned in 842. In 1375 the Counts of Montfort sold the dominion of Feldkirch, including Rankweil, to the Habsburgs. In 1618 Rankweil was granted market rights. Since its founding in 1918, Rankweil has belonged to the Austrian state of Vorarlberg. Politics Rankweil's current mayor is Katharina Wöß-Krall, of the People's Party Rankweil. She has been in office since 2019. The local council of Rankweil consists of 33 members. Demographics Rankweil has been awarded a “family plus”-community – an award from the state of Vorarlberg for family-friendly communities. Notability and landmarks Rankweil is a place of pilgrimage, known for its Basilica. Other sites include: Pilgrimage church Unsere Liebe Frau Mariä Heimsuchung (Our Dear Lady Mary Visitation): The pilgrimage church, also called the Basilica Rankweil, had its beginnings around 700 as a fortress church. It has been at the center of a large parish since the 9th century. The church was badly damaged by a fire in the Old Zürich War in 1445. From 1470 onwards, the church was renovated and expanded. The central image of pilgrimage, a linden wood sculpture of Mary with her child, was created by the sculptor Johannes Rueland in 1470. Since 1757, the sculpture has been embedded in a gold-plated, Rococo-style altar. The church received the title of a Minor Basilica in 1985 and is located on an Austrian stretch of the Camino de Santiago. The church is also depicted on Rankweil's coat of arms. St. Peter's Church: St. Peter's Church, first mentioned in 817, is located in the old center of Rankweil. It was converted to Baroque-style in 1627. Open-Air Museum “Villa Rustica”: The Villa Rustica is an agricultural estate, consisting of several buildings; it was built by Roman settlers in the first century AD. In 1954, the remains of a building with an apse and a floor heating were discovered. Between 2002 and 2007, the former main building of the complex and a Roman bathhouse were excavated. Sigmund Nachbauer Memorial: This monument was inaugurated in 1910. It commemorates Josef Sigmund Nachbauer, who commanded the Rankweiler Schützen at the time of the Napoleonic wars; he was their leader in the uprising against Bavaria in 1809, was imprisoned in 1813, and died at Fortress Ingolstadt in the same year. Town Hall: Today's town hall still features the preserved cellar vaults of the original building from before 1500. It has been in the possession of the community of Rankweil since 1822. It has been used as a court house, a town hall, an archive, a school, a poorhouse, a bank, teachers' quarters, community physicians housing, and gendarmerie officers quarters. Since its renovation in 1998, the building has served as the town hall again. Wine production at the Liebfrauenberg: The first mention of wine production at the Liebfrauenberg was made in the Raetian Reichsurbar, in the year 842. There was an especially prosperous period of wine production in the 14th and 15th centuries. Decades of failed crops, vine diseases, and the construction of the Arlberg railway, which allowed for a cheap supply of wines from Italy, stopped the wine production. The production started again in 1983. Museum of Printmaking: The Museum of Printmaking opened in 2004. It features a fully functional print shop. The main task of the museum is to document and preserve techniques of printmaking. Natalie Beer Museum: The museum is dedicated to the poet and writer Natalie Beer, who lived in Rankweil for several decades until her death in 1987. It features personal belongings and most of the publications from the estate of Natalie Beer. Culture There are 125 clubs in Rankweil. They are active in the fields of sports, culture, music, religion and family life. In the field of music, the club Altes Kino has organized concerts with national and international musicians like Zucchero, Bryan Adams, Gianna Nannini, Amy Macdonald, Dave Brubeck and Hubert von Goisern. Events in Rankweil include the autumn market, the annual fair, and the Rankweil Sommer, a holiday program during the summer months, with more than 40 different events. In addition, every other year a carnival parade takes place in Rankweil. Sports The sports infrastructure in Rankweil consists of soccer pitches, tennis and golf courts, a skate park, a sports shooters court, an ice rink and a fitness trail. Sports clubs in Rankweil: *FC Rot-Weiß Rankweil (soccer) *HC Rankweil (ice hockey) *Team Vorarlberg (cycling) Economy Rankweil has a high density of taverns, stemming in large part from its long history as a place of pilgrimage. The share of agricultural land is about 47 percent of the total area.

Marconi and the first radio messages across open sea  Guglielmo Marconi Following overland tests at Salisbury Plain during March 1897, on 13 May 1897, the Italian born and recently British based inventor, best known for his development of a radiotelegraph system, Guglielmo Marconi, assisted by George Kemp (who was a Cardiff based Post Office engineer) transmitted and received the first wireless signals over open sea between Lavernock Point and Flat Holm island. The very first message transmitted in morse code was \\"ARE YOU READY\\". This was immediately followed by \\"CAN YOU HEAR ME\\" to which the reply was \\"YES LOUD AND CLEAR\\". The morse recording slip for the first message is on display in the National Museum of Wales. Following the initial opening exchange there followed detailed technical messages in both directions indicating each end's equipment settings and receiving sound levels. Marconi indicated that he was using a spark on his equipment. Post office engineers with Marconi's equipment The successful test followed several days of trials and failure while adjustments were made to aerial length. Extensive trials were carried out over the remainder of the week in various weather conditions and with different settings on the equipment at each end. Marconi benefitted from the active encouragement of then Mr. William Preece (later Sir William Preece) who was Engineer-in-Chief of the Post Office and had himself transmitted radio telegraph morse signals across Coniston Water eight years earlier. Preece had been previously acted as a consultant to the Bristol Corporation's Electricity Department between 1883 and 1893. The Post Office engineers, including George Kemp who kept a detailed diary of these events, had been experimenting for some months at Lavernock Point. Kemp recorded the following in his diary of the experiments: :\\"Mr Marconi's apparatus was set up on the cliff at Lavernock Point, which is about twenty yards above sea-level. Here we erected a pole, high, on the top of which was a cylindrical cap of zinc, long and diameter. :Connected with this cap was an insulated copper wire leading to one side of the detector, the other side of which was connected to a wire led down the cliff and dipping into the sea. At Flat Holm Mr Preece's apparatus was arranged, the Ruhmkorff coil also giving sparks from an eight- cell battery. :On the 10th May experiments on Mr Preece's electro-magnetic transmission method were repeated, and with perfect success. :The next few days were eventful ones in the history of Mr Marconi. On the 11th and 12th his experiments were unsatisfactory — worse still, they were failures — and the fate of his new system trembled in the balance. :An inspiration saved it. On the 13th May the apparatus was carried down to the beach at the foot of the cliff, and connected by another of wire to the pole above, thus making an aerial height of in all. Result, The instruments which for two days failed to record anything intelligible, now rang out the signals clear and unmistakable, and all by the addition of a few yards of wire!\\" Marconi's new equipment was therefore used in conjunction with that already adopted by the Post Office. The initial tests were so successful over the stretch of water that it was quickly decided to relocate the telegraph equipment from Flat Holm to Brean Down Fort, near Weston Super Mare increasing the distance to nearly from the Lavernock Point transmitter. Following these successful trials, Marconi subsequently vested his new patent rights in his 'Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company', which unfortunately prevented any further co-operation with the Post Office engineers. However, George Kemp immediately resigned from his Post Office position and joined Marconi's new company as head of engineering development. In 1948, to mark the 50th anniversary of the experiments, a bronze plaque was unveiled by the Cardiff Rotary Club inside the courtyard of the recently closed church of St.Lawrence, Lavernock, commemorating the historic radio transmissions over of open sea. The small stone hut that Marconi used to contain his experimental radio telegraph equipment still stands on the cliff edge at the end of the lane near Lower Cosmeston farmhouse.  The Bays of Lavernock  From the late 1890s until 1968 Lavernock and the nearby bays of St Mary's Well and Swanbridge (with its low tide walk out to Sully Island) were popular and busy holiday locations for regular day trippers from the South Wales Valleys, Newport, Cardiff, Penarth and Barry and the beaches were packed with visitors on most weekends and Bank Holidays throughout the summer. The hundreds and sometimes thousands of holidaymakers were served refreshments by an ice cream parlour, two busy cafes, the Golden Hind public house and the three star Lavernock Bay Hotel. Very few visitors arrived by car until the 1960s with the majority travelling by the half-hourly steam trains that stopped at Lavernock and Swanbridge Halts on the busy Taff Vale Railway Line en route to Barry Island. Lavernock started settling back to quiet seclusion in the late 1960s when the railway line closed down under the Beeching Axe. Some modern day trippers arrived by car, to the degree that the lanes and the Swanbridge car park were often jammed, but visitor numbers had dropped off to such a degree that falling profit margins meant all the food outlets, the Golden Hind pub and eventually even the Bay Hotel closed down and the decline was accelerated even further.  Lavernock Point  Lavernock Point is a headland on the South Wales coast, overlooking the Bristol Channel with views across to the Somerset Coast. A line drawn between Lavernock Point and Sand Point, Somerset marks the lower limit of the Severn estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel. Because of the extreme tidal range there are very strong currents or rips close inshore to the point with speeds that exceed 7 knots (13 km/h) for several hours at each tide. Various proposals have been put forward to construct a Severn Barrage for tidal electricity production from Lavernock Point to Brean Down in Somerset and the provision remains under discussion by the various agencies. = Geology = In June 2015 it was announced that the fossil remains of a new species of dinosaur had been discovered on the beach by brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan who were searching for ancient marine reptiles called ichthyosaurs. The fossilised skeleton belonged to a dog-sized creature, a theropod dinosaur, and was described as a \\"cousin of the giant tyrannosaurus rex\\". Now named Dracoraptor hanigan meaning \\"dragon robber\\". It is believed to be the earliest specimen of a Jurassic period dinosaur to have walked the earth. = Lavernock Fort = On the point in the late 1860s Lavernock Fort gun battery was built by the Royal Commission. It was completed in 1870, with three 7\\" muzzle loading cannons to protect the channel approaches to Cardiff and Bristol shipyards. Sometime before 1895 the gun battery was reinforced with a fourth cannon, only for all four guns then to be replaced eight years later by two rapid fire six inch (152 mm) former naval guns in 1903. A two unit searchlight battery was added during the Second World War. The World War II gun emplacements formed part of the Fixed Defences, Severn Scheme and protected the Atlantic shipping convoy de-grouping zone between Cardiff, Barry and Flat Holm.Atlantic convoy regrouping area Today the remaining main section of the gun battery has been listed as an Ancient Monument, which includes the gun emplacements, director-rangefinder observation position, crew and officers quarters. The structure is still commemorated through Lavernock Point's main access road being named 'Fort Road'. = Royal Observer Corps = A few yards away from the historic Marconi hut Penarth's only World War II Royal Observer Corps (ROC) Searchlight post stood on the cliff edge with its clear views over the Bristol Channel and the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The Observer Corps site was established by the Air Ministry on part of the original War Department land connected to the Lavernock Gun Battery. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many Nazi German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the town. In early 1962 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed at Penarth Clifftop for the ROC (OS Grid Ref: ST 1858 6903), who by the 1960s had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to underground operations with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war. The post members were mobilised later that year and volunteers spent nearly ten days underground during the Cuban Missile Crisis as the government prepared the country for potential outbreak of war. The Penarth cliff top nuclear bunker was closed down and abandoned by the ROC in 1975 after repeated destructive break-ins by local vandals, but the concrete entrance hatch and ventilator tower can still be observed next to the cliff walk near Lower Cosmeston farmhouse. The Royal Observer Corps itself was disbanded in December 1995 after the end of the Cold War and as a result of recommendations in the governments Options for Change review of UK defence. = Nature reserve = Lavernock Point is established as a particularly fine nature reserve where wildlife interest is combined with historical interests in a dramatic and picturesque coastal reserve. The unimproved limestone grassland supports varied and colourful plants such as dyer's greenweed, devil's-bit scabious, common spotted orchid and fleabane. Butterflies have been observed and recorded by the reserve's warden for over twenty years and more than twenty five species have been identified. Lavernock and the nearby Cosmeston Lakes continue to be an important landing point for migrating birds. Many bird migration routes across the Bristol Channel cross the reserve, and Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands act as staging posts. Bird sightings vary through the year, with visiting summer migrants, seabirds off the coast and resident breeding birds. The reserve is managed by the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales who state that their aims are \\"To create and maintain the ideal balance between grassland, scrubland and woodland at Lavernock Point Reserve.\\" Monkstone Lighthouse Monkstone Lighthouse is located in the Bristol Channel about east of Lavernock Point. A lighthouse here was established in 1839, but the original iron structure was replaced in 1993. The current lighthouse, which is solar powered and operated by Trinity House, comprises a masonry tower strengthened by vertical and horizontal wrought iron bands, with a red glass reinforced plastic tower on top.  Lavernock today  The geology-rich strata of Lavernock cliffs Lavernock railway station was sold off but long sections of the old railway track bed are still open, from the Fort Road bridge as far as Lower Penarth. It is essentially now a rural greenway and cyclepath. However the track bed in the direction of Sully is either overgrown and impassable and some of it has been sold into private ownership. Lavernock, St Mary's Well Bay and Swanbridge (Sully Island) can still be reached along the clifftop path from Penarth. The old cafe car park at Swanbridge was developed as part of the newly opened Captain's Wife public house in the mid-1970s. The Marconi Holiday Village near Lavernock Point, is run by the Lavernock Point Holiday Park and consists of chalets, fixed caravans and touring berths. The licensed Marconi Club at the holiday village is open to non-residents.

Geography The town belongs to the Bregenz Forest, part of the district of Bregenz, and lies in the Hintere Bregenzerwald. Forty percent of its 45 km² area is covered with forest, 34.4% of the area is used as alpine pasture (Almwirtschaft) and for other forms of alpine agriculture. The town itself is unlike most others in the area, as it has no real center. Au is an example of a \\"scattered village\\" (German: Streudorf). It consists of several districts: Am Stein, Argenau, Argenstein, Argenzipfel, Jaghausen, Kreuzgasse, Lebernau, Lugen, Lisse, Rehmen, Schrecken, and Wieden. The town hall is located in Argenau, but the parish church is located in Jaghausen. The district of Rehmen also has its own church. The river Bregenzer Ach, the largest river in the region, flows through Au and divides it into two parts: The one part is called Schattseite (meaning “shady side”), and consists of the districts of Argenau, Argenzipfel and Wieden; the other part is called Sonnseite (meaning “sunny side”) and consists (mainly) of Rehmen and Schrecken. Alongside the river runs the L200 road, which is the main route through the Bregenz Forest. History The Vorarlberger Münsterschema, a type of Baroque cathedral, was developed by the Beer and Thumb families. Examples of such cathedrals can be found along Lake Constance and in other parts of southern Germany. Michael Beer also founded the Auer Zunft, one of the oldest craftsmen’s guilds in Austria. It still exists today. From 1805 to 1814 Au belonged to the Kingdom of Bavaria, but was then returned to Austria. Au has belonged to the province of Vorarlberg since the latter’s foundation in 1861. After World War II Au was included within the French Occupation Zone of Austria. The occupation lasted from 1945 until the Austrian State Treaty was signed in 1955. The occupation force also included many Moroccan soldiers serving in the French army. Population Politics The town council of Au, called Gemeinderat, consists of 18 members, all of them members of the Auer Liste. The current mayor is Pius Natter. Economics and infrastructure A main economic factor in Au is tourism. Many private households rent out rooms or flats. There are several hotels, many of them providing special venues or events, e.g. wellness, sports, and motorbiking. Agriculture was formerly the main income source for the village, until the rise of tourism. Transportation Au is situated on the L200, the Bregenzerwald Bundesstrasse. Here it connects to the L193, the Faschina Bundesstrasse, which is the main route to the skiing resort of Damüls. Public transportion consists of the Postbus Line 40, running from Dornbirn to Schoppernau. In winter there is also a free bus service running through the town for skiers and locals. Education There is a kindergarten, a Volksschule (primary school), and a Hauptschule (lower secondary school), all located in a building in the district Schrecken. The secondary school also serves the towns of Schnepfau, Schoppernau, Damüls and Schröcken.

Born in Philadelphia, and a descendant of Welsh Quakers who had emigrated in 1698, William Parker Foulke was an abolitionist, prison reformer, pamphleteer, philanthropist, lawyer, historian and geologist, the last of which directly led to the discovery, which was partially named for him by Joseph Leidy and for which he is now best-known. Foulke was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1841, though the law could hardly be said to be his life's work. Four years later he began an association with the two reforms that would occupy so much time and energy in his short life. Sensitized to the problems of incarceration through his legal training, Foulke joined the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries in Public Prisons in July 1845. Foulke spent several years comparing alternative disciplinary models and writing on correctional issues in the Journal on Prison Discipline and Philanthropy. Following a tour of mid-Atlantic correctional institutions in 1847 and 1848, Foulke was instrumental in erecting the new Lancaster County Prison, and contributed materially to later penitentiaries in several other counties in Pennsylvania. He was associated with the American Association for Improvement of Prison Discipline and the Convention of State Prison Wardens. Foulke also supported the Pennsylvania Colonization Society, an antislavery organization that resettled as many as 1,000 freed slaves per year in West Africa (Liberia). Despite mounting opposition from different sides, Foulke never wavered in his support for resettlement until his own death in 1865, by which time he was Vice-President of the Society. Foulke financially supported the American Academy of Music, and was a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences (Philadelphia), the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and, like his grandfather John Foulke (1757–1796), the American Philosophical Society. He was an avid natural historian and geologist, supportive of the first arctic explorations. Family In 1855, Foulke married Julia DeVeaux Powel (died 1884), daughter of Col. John Hare Powel, with whom he had seven children. He died on June 18, 1865.

Bezau is a popular tourist destination around the year, due to its vicinity to ski resorts and hiking trails. Its picturesque church was built in 1906 and has as its patron saint St. Jodok. Another attraction is the museum of local history (Heimatmuseum), which is housed in a traditional Bregenz Forest wooden home.  Geography  Bezau has a surface area of 34.42 km² and is one of the largest municipalities in the central Bregenz Forest. Population  History  Bezau was first documented as \\"Baezenowe\\" in 1249. After the construction of its own church in 1497, Bezau became an autonomous parish. In 1656, a Capuchin monastery was founded there. Since 1806, Bezau has served as a district court for the Bregenzerwald region. In 1902, the Bregenzerwaldbahn, a 35.32 km narrow-gauge railway, was inaugurated. This railway linked Bregenz with Bezau until 1983. = Heraldry = The coat of arms is red with a silver horizontal band through it, depicting a green uprooted spruce tree surrounded by a bronze frame.

The 29 highest mountains in Norway are all in Jotunheimen, including the very highest – Galdhøpiggen (2469 m). Jotunheimen straddles the border between the counties of Innlandet and Vestland (formerly Oppland and Sogn og Fjordane). View from Knutshøi towards central Jotunheimen Jotunheimen is very popular with hikers and climbers, and the Norwegian Mountain Touring Association maintains a number of mountain lodges in the area, as well as marked trails that run between the lodges and others that run up to some of the peaks. The image from Gjende shows a cliff trailing down into the lake. At its base there is a popular guest house called Memurubu. The picture is taken from Gjendesheim, a starting point for hiking into the mountain range. There is a very popular trail along Besseggen that follows the edge of the mountainous range to the right, which it is named after. There is a National Tourist Route, the Sognefjell Road, from Skjolden to Lom and another road, the RV 51, from Gol to Vågå through the special area of Valdresflya. Etymology Originally there was no common name for this large mountainous area. However, in 1820, the Norwegian geologist and mountaineer, Baltazar Mathias Keilhau proposed the name Jotunfjeldene \\"the mountains of the Jotnar\\" (inspired by the German name Riesengebirge). This was later changed to Jotunheimen by the poet Aasmund Olavsson Vinje in 1862 - this name/form was directly inspired by the name Jötunheimr in Norse mythology. Geology Jotunheimen is a residual mountain, which is a mass of rock that has remained in place as the surrounding relief has been eroded. The tops of Dovrefjell and Jotunheimen and other parts of southern Norway are the few remnants of a formerly flat surface that existed in Norway prior to uplift. This surface is now largely eroded and warped. The said erosion formed a series of steps and it is from the highest of these steps that Jotunheimen rise. At Memurubu, looking over Lake Gjende towards Gjendebu  Jotunheimen National Park  Jotunheimen contains Jotunheimen National Park, which was established in 1980 and covers an area of 1,151 km².http://www.dirnat.no/attachment.ap?id=7074 The Hurrungane mountain range is also inside the national park with the sharpest peaks in Jotunheimen. Adjacent to the national park border is Utladalen Nature Reserve which covers the Utladalen valley and the mountain Falketind, amongst others. According to the anthropologist Shoshi Parks, “Three national parks converge in this region of Norway, but Jotunheimen is by far the most spectacular, with 250 peaks over 1,900 meters high, including two of the highest in northern Europe – (Galdhøpiggen and Glittertind),”Urdadalen Human presence The Jotunheimen shoe was discovered in August 2006.

It was discovered along with several arrows and a wooden spade, leading archaeologists to conclude that they had unearthed an important hunting ground. In February 2020, Secrets of the Ice Program researchers discovered a 1,500-year-old Viking arrowhead dating back to the Germanic Iron age and locked in a glacier in southern Norway caused by the climate change in the Jotunheimen Mountains. The arrowhead made of iron was revealed with its cracked wooden shaft and a feather, is 17 cm long and weighs just 28 grams. Traffic Despite the large area of Jotunheimen, there are few roads for car traffic. Between Jotunheimen and Breheimen, the plateau is crossed by the Norwegian County Road 55. To the west, the road continues further from Skjolden via Sogndalsfjøra, Balestrand and Høyanger to the European route E39. In the east, the road leads to Lom. A few small dirt roads lead to different parts of the edge of Jotunheimen National Park, although the area of the national park itself is practically roadless. A small exception, however, is a blind road in the Veodalen to Glitterheim, whose head is inside the national park area near the Glittertind.

He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation in 1831 (i.e. resulting from positive natural selection, in contrast to its already, widely known, negative role in removal of individuals in the Struggle for Survival), but did not further develop or publicize his ideas. Consequently, when Charles Darwin later published On the Origin of Species in 1859, he and Alfred Russel Wallace were regarded by their scientific peers as having originated (independently of each other) the theory of evolution by natural selection; it has been suggested that Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew's earlier work, but there is no hard evidence of this. After the publication of On the Origin of Species, Matthew contacted Darwin, who in subsequent editions of the book acknowledged that the principle of natural selection had been anticipated by Matthew's brief statement, mostly contained in the appendices and addendum of his 1831 book, On Naval Timber and Arboriculture.  Life  Patrick Matthew was born 20 October 1790 at Rome, on a farm held by his father John Matthew near Scone Palace, in Perthshire. His mother was Agnes Duncan, a relative of Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan. He was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate, as on his father's death and while only seventeen, he had to take over the responsibilities of managing and running the affairs of a property estate at Gourdiehill in the Carse of Gowrie, between Perth and Dundee. Over the years he successfully nurtured, cultivated, and transformed much of the estate's farmland and pastures into several large orchards of apple and pear trees, numbering over 10,000. He became an avid proponent as well as interested researcher of both silviculture and horticulture, both of which influenced his growing awareness of the forces of nature. This awareness, along with his own experiences acquired from years of working his own modest estate would later frame a strong base of reference to form his own opinions and theories.Calman, WT (1912) \\"Patrick Matthew of Gourdiehill, Naturalist\\", Handbook and Guide to Dundee and District, AW Paton and AH Millar (Eds), the British Association for the Advancement of Science, pp. 451-7 (see The Patrick Matthew Project » More On Matthew Between 1807 and 1831 (when On Naval Timber and Arboriculture was published) he periodically travelled to Europe, sometimes on business, sometimes seeking scientific enlightenment or agricultural or economic advice: a trip to Paris in 1815 had to be cut short when Napoleon returned from Elba. Between 1840 and 1850, Matthew travelled extensively in what is now northern Germany; recognising the commercial potential of Hamburg he bought two farms in Schleswig-Holstein. Matthew married his maternal first cousin, Christian Nicol in 1817, and they had eight children: John (born 1818), Robert (1820), Alexander (1821), Charles (1824), Euphemia (1826), Agnes (1828), James Edward (1830), and Helen Amelia (1833). Robert farmed Gourdiehill in Patrick's old age, Alexander took over the German interests; the other three sons emigrated, initially to America. Matthew became interested in the colonisation of New Zealand and was instrumental in setting up a \\"Scottish New Zealand Land Company\\". At his urging, James and Charles Matthew emigrated to New Zealand, where they set up one of the earliest commercial orchards in Australasia using seed and seedlings from Gourdiehill.Dempster W.J. 1983. Patrick Matthew and natural selection: nineteenth century gentleman-farmer, naturalist and writer. Harris. Edinburgh. with corrections/additions from review of Dempster By G J Tee in John Matthew remained in America, sending botanical tree specimens back to his father; these included (in 1853) the first seedlings known to have been planted in Europe of both the Giant Redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) and the Coastal Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). A group of trees of these species still thriving near Inchture in Perthshire comes from these seedlings. Matthew gave many more seedlings to friends, relatives and neighbours, and redwoods can be found throughout the Carse of Gowrie; these as well as some elsewhere in Scotland (e.g. at Gillies Hill near Stirling Castle) are thought to have been grown from the 1853 seedlings. His reputation as a local celebrity faded in the twentieth century, when he was remembered as a \\"character\\" who at the end of his life became convinced that \\"someone very dear to his heart\\" had become a bird, and therefore forbad his garden staff from controlling the blackbirds that were destroying the fruit.Melville L. (1939) The fair land of Gowrie, William Culross & Son, Coupar Angus. Matthew's house, Gourdiehill, fell into disrepair in the 1970s and '80s, and was demolished in 1990 when the grounds became a small housing estate; some of the salvaged stone was incorporated in a rock garden.Sommerville C. (2020) Stone from home. The Garden (RHS) [May 2020], volume 145 part 5, pp.97-100.  Work  In managing his orchards, Patrick Matthew became familiar with the problems related to the principles of husbandry in horticulture for food production (and hence, by extension silviculture). Charles Darwin and natural selection In 1860, Matthew read in the Gardeners' Chronicle for 3 March a review (by Huxley[T. H. Huxley] (26 December 1859) Darwin on the origin of species, The Times, pp. 8–9), republished from The Times, of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, which said Darwin \\"professes to have discovered the existence and the modus operandi of natural selection, and described its principles\\". A letter by Matthew, published in the Gardeners' Chronicle on 7 April, said that this was what he had \\"published very fully and brought to apply practically to forestry\\" in Naval Timber and Arboriculture in 1831, as publicised in reviews. He quoted extracts from his book, firstly the opening words of Note B from pages 364–365 of the Appendix, stopping before his discussion of hereditary nobility and entail.Matthew, P. 1860. Nature's law of selection. Gardeners' Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette (7 April): 312-13 He then quoted in its entirety a section from pages 381 to 388 of the Appendix. This lacked a heading, but in the Contents appeared as \\"Accommodation of organized life to circumstance, by diverging ramifications\\". In it, he commented on the difficulty of distinguishing \\"between species and variety\\". The change of the fossil record between geological eras implied living organisms having \\"a power of change, under a change of circumstances\\", in the same way as the \\"derangements and changes in organised existence, induced by a change of circumstance from the interference of man\\" gave \\"proof of the plastic quality of superior life\\" which he called \\"a circumstance-suiting power\\". Following past deluges, \\"an unoccupied field would be formed for new diverging ramifications of life\\" in \\"the course of time, moulding and accommodating their being anew to the change of circumstances\\". He proposed that \\"the progeny of the same parents, under great difference of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become distinct species, incapable of co- reproduction.\\" He described this as a \\"circumstance-adaptive law, operating upon the slight but continued natural disposition to sport in the progeny\\". Matthew then quoted the opening three paragraphs from Part III of his book, Miscellaneous Matter Connected with Naval Timber: Nurseries, pages 106 to 108, on \\"the luxuriance and size of timber depending upon the particular variety of the species\\" and the need to select seed from the best individuals when growing trees. On reading this, Darwin commented in a letter to Charles Lyell: Darwin then wrote a letter of his own to the Gardener's Chronicle, stating, As promised, Darwin included a statement about Matthew having anticipated \\"precisely the same view on the origin of species\\" in the third and subsequent editions of On the Origin of Species, referring to the correspondence, and quoting from a response by Matthew published in the Gardener's Chronicle. Darwin wrote that. Matthew, Darwin and Wallace are the only three people considered to have independently discovered the principle of natural selection as a mechanism for speciation (macroevolution). Others prior to Matthew had proposed natural selection as a mechanism for the generation of varieties or races within a species: James Hutton suggested the mechanism in 1794 as leading to improvement of varieties, and an 1813 paper by William Charles Wells proposed that it would form new varieties. In 1835, after Matthew's book, Edward Blyth published a description of the process as a mechanism preserving the unchanging essence of stable species., Matthew's legacy in evolutionary studies Misconceived claims are made on behalf of Victorian evolutionists, with all the tedious inevitability that was predicted by Stephen Jay Gould in his piece on Natural Selection as a Creative Force,Stephen Jay Gould (2002) The Structure of Evolutionary Theory. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. pp. 137-141. Available: https://web.archive.org/web/20161025064416/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_selection.html Accessed: 31-05-17 The equally inevitable rebuttal of these claims, tends to require an inordinately disproportionate investment of effort (see Earp 2016 for an explanation), sometimes only concluding after years of counterarguments (e.g., Roy Davies' The Darwin Conspiracy: Origins of a Scientific Crime). Unfortunately, the media coverage that accompanies these revisionist campaigns, is the version most likely to be seen and remembered by the public, not the peer-reviewed paper appearing in the scientific literature a year later. The damage is therefore multifarious and insidious, from time lost to the individual, to misinforming the public en masse. Contrary to the stated intention, the unfortunate outcome of the latest claims made in Matthew's name might very well do more damage than good. =Modern claims for Matthew's priority= Although Darwin insisted he had been unaware of Matthew's work, some modern commentators have held that he and Wallace were likely to have known of it, or could have been influenced indirectly by other naturalists who read and cited Matthew's book. * Ronald W. Clark, in his 1984 biography of Darwin, commented that Only the transparent honesty of Darwin's character... makes it possible to believe that by the 1850s he had no recollection of Matthew's work.Clark, Ronald W. 1984. The survival of Charles Darwin. p130-131 This begs the question, for it assumes he did read Matthew's book. Clark continues by suggesting: If Darwin had any previous knowledge of Arboriculture, it had slipped down into the unconscious.Clark, Survival of Charles Darwin, p131If Darwin had read the book, it might have been an example of cryptomnesia. * In 2014, Nottingham Trent University criminologist Mike Sutton published in a non-peer-reviewed (i.e. not reviewed by experts in the field)e.g., Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Council Ethical guidelines for peer reviewers, September 2017.

In addition to his papers and e-book, Sutton disseminates his claims against Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace via several blog sites and Twitter accounts, and public lectures: to the Ethical Society, at the Conway Hall, on 27 July 2014; to the Teesside Skeptics in the Pub, at O'Connells Pub in Middlehaven, a ward of Middlesbrough, on 2 October 2014; and to the Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group, at the James Hutton Institute, at Craigiebuckler, Aberdeen, on 17 March 2016. During this visit to Scotland, Sutton also presented his claims to The Junior Carsonians, \\"the junior division of The Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group who represent the 6 Carse Primary Schools, some 1000 pupils, who work collectively on various climate change, heritage and sustainability project\\", who, \\"got to hear about Dr Sutton's work and the evidence he has uncovered about Patrick Matthew and Charles Darwin\\".Bell, Coral (2016) The Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group Junior Carsonians. http://www.carsesus.org/junior- carsonians.html However, there is no direct evidence that Darwin had read the book, and his letter to Charles Lyell stating that he had ordered the book clearly indicates that he did not have a copy in his extensive library or access to it elsewhere. The particular claim that Robert Chambers had read and transmitted Matthew's ideas that are relevant to natural selection is also not supported by the facts. The article in the Chambers's Edinburgh Journal (1832, vol. 1, no. 8, 24 March, p. 63) is not a review but only an abridged excerpt from pp. 8–14 of On Naval Timber that amounts to no more than a recipe for pruning and contains nothing of relevance to natural selection. It is headed \\"ON THE TRAINING OF PLANK TIMBER\\" and ends with \\".— Matthew on Naval Timber.\\" Even if it had been penned by Robert Chambers, this does not mean that he had read or understood, leave alone transmitted, the other passages of Matthew's book that do contain anything relevant to natural selection. Further, The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation contain nothing of relevance about natural selection. Combining these facts, Robert Chambers had probably not read or received the message about natural selection in Matthew's book, but has surely not promulgated it in the Vestiges, and probably neither in conversations. In subsequent editions of The Origin of Species, Darwin acknowledged Matthew's earlier work, stating that Matthew \\"clearly saw...the full force of the principle of natural selection\\". It is an urban myth that, from 1860 onward, Matthew would claim credit for natural selection and even had calling cards printed with Discoverer of the Principle of Natural Selection. This probably started with Loren Eiseley (1958. Darwin's Century), who apparently misunderstood a comment made by Darwin in a letter to Hooker (22 and 28 October 1865).Darwin, C. R. to J. D. Hooker 22 and 28 [October 1865] Darwin Correspondence Project, \\"Letter no. 4921,\\" accessed on 2017-05-29, http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/DCP-LETT-4921 Concerning the finding that William Charles Wells had published the idea of evolutionary change through natural selection before Matthew, Darwin wrote to Hooker: \\"So poor old Patrick Matthew, is not the first, & he cannot or ought not any longer put on his Title pages \\"Discoverer of the principle of Natural Selection\\"!\\" However, this was already inaccurate on Darwin's part. What the title page of Matthew's pamphlet Schleswig-Holstein really said was: BY = Rebuttal of claims = Challenges to Matthew's claim to priority, or those made since he died, have essentially made reference to the same issues, that his description of natural selection was not accessible and it lacked lengthier development. Other criticisms have focussed on the differences between Darwin's and Matthew's versions of natural selection, and sometimes Wallace's too (e.g., Weale 2015). If Matthew's ideas had made the impact on subsequent evolutionary thinking, as claimed, the signals ought to be there, either during Matthew's lifetime, or Darwin's. Yet, modern claims for Matthew's priority have been unable to provide evidence for this, that has withstood fact checking. Accessibility and development  Historian of science, Peter Bowler succinctly summarised some of those main reasons given for why Matthew does not deserve priority for natural selection over Darwin and Wallace, Ernst Mayr's opinion was even more clear-cut: Richard Dawkins also grants that Matthew had grasped the general concept of natural selection, but failed to appreciate the significance, nor develop it further, In response to Sutton's e-book, Darwin biographer James Moore said many people came towards a similar perception during the 19th century, but Darwin was the only one who fully developed the idea: In response to Sutton (2015) Darwin and Wallace scholar, John van Wyhe commented, To coincide with Sutton's presentation to the Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group, Darwin author, Julian F. Derry sent an open letter, saying,  Biological concepts  The History of Science website Natural Histories has compiled a comprehensive series of blog posts on Patrick Matthewblog posts on Patrick Matthew that have made a close study of his writings, while importantly ensuring an appropriate historical context. The resulting pieces of evidence largely contradict Sutton's claims. This is especially so from a biological context, one that compares and evaluates core differences between Matthew's and Darwin's concepts,Natural Histories: Comparing Matthew's and Darwin's theories https://historiesofecology.blogspot.co.uk/2017/04/comparing-matthews-and- darwins-theories.html especially that relating to relative adaptation (Matthew's power of occupancy), and diversification as an adaptive process (Darwin's principle of divergence), { cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 30px auto; text-align: left; width: 600px;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align: top; padding: 5px;\\"  style=\\"line-height: 1.5; padding-right: 20px; width: 50%;\\"  DARWIN → environmental change renders a species ill-adapted → this leads to increased variation → this allows species transformation by natural selection  style=\\"line-height: 1.5; padding-left: 0; width: 50%;\\"  MATTHEW → adaptation is always relative → competition keeps species fixed in their natural place → catastrophe removes competition → species spreads and natural selection transforms it to new conditions } This exculpates Darwin for the time from his return from the Beagle voyage till 1844. Hence, the period for which there is no evidence that Matthew's ideas are present in Darwin's work, the records of his development of ideas, and expression of those concepts in his writing can be shown to extend from the time he was leaving for the Beagle voyage, up until the coalescence of his ideas into his cohesive system of evolution by natural selection in 1858. Niles Eldredge, points out the very valid point that seeing Matthew's descriptions at any point during that extended period, would likely have resulted in an integral, preformed model being described by Darwin from the outset, whereas what we actually have in his notes is realisation of the full picture from development of incremental sketches,  Analysis of comparative speciation concepts  Sutton's claim that Darwin and Wallace plagiarised evolution by natural selection from Matthew also has been refuted by Joachim Dagg, [Wallace's] concept of lineage-adaptation as a sequence of extinctions of less fit and survival of fitter varieties and his gradualism put him closer to Darwin than to Matthew. But he emphasized environmental changes for differential extinction and some form of isolation for lineage-splitting and speciation, whereas Darwin's mature theory saw competition as a sufficient cause of divergence, differential extinction, lineage-adaptation and lineage- splitting. This is not to say that Darwin was right in this view and Wallace wrong. By current standards, they were both right and wrong in different respects (competitive vs. environmental selection, sympatric vs. allopatric speciation). The perspective emerging from this comparison shows at least four unique theories (Matthew, early Darwin, mature Darwin and Wallace), each interesting in its own right. Each theory integrated change in conditions, variability, competition and natural selection in ways that allowed for species transformation somehow. Apart from this similarity, the theories differ significantly from each other in the mechanisms underlying transformation. However, this difference does not lie in the struggle for survival and survival of the fittest, but in the way in which natural selection is integrated with variability, competition and environmental conditions. Transmutation is a convergent result of structurally different mechanisms. The similarity of Matthew's scheme to the theory of punctuated equilibria is equally superficial. Eldredge & Gould (1972) took Mayr's model of allopatric speciation and combined it with Wright's model of genetic drift in order to explain gaps in the fossil record as results of relatively swift evolutionary change in small and isolated populations. Although catastrophes can produce such populations they are not required, and the mechanism underlying the punctuated record is the drift within small and isolated populations, not the absence of competing species that would prevent species transmutation. Therefore, viewing Matthew (1831) as an anticipator of the theory of punctuated equilibria (e.g. Rampino, 2011) is as wrong as claiming his scheme identical to Darwin's or Wallace's. Matthew's contemporaries Accepting these irreconcilable differences in theory, a remaining route has been proposed, by which Darwin may have got to gain knowledge of Matthew's evolutionary ideas, that is, by knowledge being passed along a network of associates, by word of mouth, or an equally indirect pathway, such as via the influence of an editor. Evidence that such a network existed could be found if there was documentation of anyone having discussed Matthew's ideas on evolution. However, there is no single contemporary record of anyone having even recognised any value in Matthew's concept.

Natural theology  Writing to Darwin in 1871, Matthew enclosed an article he had written for The Scotsman and, as well as wishing that he had time to write a critique of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, expressed the belief that there is evidence of design and benevolence in nature, and that beauty cannot be accounted for by natural selection. Such a belief is mainstream natural theology, and reveals how far Matthew was from Darwin in realising the potential of evolutionary explanations: for him as well as others, man was the sticking-point. There is little or no evidence that Matthew held these views as a younger man: there is no discussion of a religious nature in Arboriculture.  Socio-political views  Matthew's idea on society were radical for their times. Although he was a landowner, he was involved with the Chartist movement, and argued that institutions of hereditary nobility were detrimental to society. It has been suggested that these views worked against acceptance of his theory of natural selection, being politically incorrect at the time (see Barker, 2001). The more likely reason is that the obscurity of the location hid the ideas from many who would have been interested. Only after Darwin's Origin did Matthew come forward in a popular journal, the Gardeners' Chronicle. Matthew also published a book in 1839, Emigration Fields (Black, Edinburgh), suggesting that overpopulation, as predicted by Malthus, could be solved by mass migration to North America and the Dominions. Matthew supported the invasion of Schleswig-Holstein by Bismarck in 1864: his pamphlet on the event was denounced by the Dundee Advertiser. He also supported the Germans against the French in the Franco- Prussian War (1870–71), a war which marked the final unification of the German Empire and the end of the Second French Empire. In 1870 Matthew became aware of the terrible housing conditions of the workers in Dundee. In a letter to the Dundee Advertiser he told readers that the death rate of children under five in the town was 40%, and outlined a blueprint for the redevelopment of the city.  The Tay bridge  When the Edinburgh and Northern Railway (E&N;) and the Dundee and Perth Railway (D&P;) were seeking Parliamentary approval in 1845, it was proposed by their engineers that from Perth both should share a line running along the south bank of the Tay as far as Newburgh, where the D&P; would cross to the north bank, and the E&N; leave the Tay and head south to a ferry crossing of the Forth. Matthew had been in a very small minority supporting this, and the D&P; as built crossed the Tay at Perth. In 1864, when a bridge crossing the Tay at Dundee was proposed, Matthew urged that a bridge at Newburgh was preferable to a bridge at Dundee, a Newburgh bridge giving much the same reduction in the rail distance between Dundee and the Forth ferry-ports from which passengers could cross to Edinburgh as a bridge at Dundee but doing so by a shorter (and therefore cheaper) crossing of the Tay. He argued the costs of a Dundee bridge were being grossly under-estimated: \\"To erect a substantial bridge, not a flimsy spectral thing, which might or not vanish as a phantom the first storm, or break down under the vibration caused by a heavy, rapid, moving train, would, in my opinion cost nearly double, and probably much more than double, the sum the Engineer states; upon this I stake my judgement against that of the Engineer\\", noting in passing, \\"from the geological indices, I would expect the foundation to be more regular at Newburgh than at Dundee, consequently better\\". The financial crisis of 1866 put an end to the 1864 Tay Bridge proposal, but it was revived in 1869. Matthew responded with a series of letters to the Dundee papers arguing for a Newburgh bridge, and advancing all manner of additional arguments against a Dundee bridge; it would have a deleterious effect on silting and tidal scour in the Firth; it would prevent navigation upstream of it; it would be torn apart by the centrifugal force from heavy trains rapidly descending the curve at its northern end; it was vulnerable to earthquake, a ship colliding with a pier, or to high wind.Matthew's objections are summarised (and mocked) by one of Bouch's subordinates in . A more sympathetic summary (apparently following closely an account in Dempster (1983)) can be found in Matthew's objections were not heeded,The Dundee-Perth line had fallen into the hands of the Caledonian Railway in 1865; after that the wish of Dundee and the North British Railway for an NBR line into Dundee not at the mercy of the Caledonian could only be met by crossing the Tay at Dundee and were not persisted in once Parliament had passed the Bill authorising construction of the Tay Bridge. During construction of the bridge some of Matthew's criticisms were borne out: it became apparent that bedrock could not be found at a depth allowing the use of brick piers; the design had to be modified to use lattice-work iron piers of reduced width, and there was considerable cost overrun. The bridge opened in June 1878 and was destroyed in a storm in December 1879: the lattice work piers supporting the centre section of the bridge (the high girders) failed catastrophically as a train was crossing the bridge. The high girders and the train fell into the Tay and about seventy-five lives were lost. Whilst it was recalled in the immediate aftermath of the disaster that Matthew had predicted collapse in a high wind as one of the horrible ends to which a bridge at Dundee could come, repeating an article with the same title in the Newcastle Chronicle the disaster is generally ascribed to defects in the design and manufacture of the lattice work piers introduced into the design well after Matthew's campaign against the bridge.

MAPKs are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis. MAP kinases are found in eukaryotes only, but they are fairly diverse and encountered in all animals, fungi and plants, and even in an array of unicellular eukaryotes. MAPKs belong to the CMGC (CDK/MAPK/GSK3/CLK) kinase group. The closest relatives of MAPKs are the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).  Discovery  The first mitogen-activated protein kinase to be discovered was ERK1 (MAPK3) in mammals. Since ERK1 and its close relative ERK2 (MAPK1) are both involved in growth factor signaling, the family was termed \\"mitogen-activated\\". With the discovery of other members, even from distant organisms (e.g. plants), it has become increasingly clear that the name is a misnomer, since most MAPKs are actually involved in the response to potentially harmful, abiotic stress stimuli (hyperosmosis, oxidative stress, DNA damage, low osmolarity, infection, etc.). Because plants cannot \\"flee\\" from stress, terrestrial plants have the highest number of MAPK genes per organism ever found. Thus the role of mammalian ERK1/2 kinases as regulators of cell proliferation is not a generic, but a highly specialized function.  Types  Most MAPKs have a number of shared characteristics, such as the activation dependent on two phosphorylation events, a three-tiered pathway architecture and similar substrate recognition sites. These are the \\"classical\\" MAP kinases. But there are also some ancient outliers from the group as sketched above, that do not have dual phosphorylation sites, only form two-tiered pathways, and lack the features required by other MAPKs for substrate binding. These are usually referred to as \\"atypical\\" MAPKs. It is yet unclear if the atypical MAPKs form a single group as opposed to the classical ones.  Activation  X-ray structure of the ERK2 MAP kinase in its active form. Phosphorylated residues are displayed in red. Rendering based on pdb entry 2ERK. Mitogen-activated protein kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to become active, they require (potentially multiple) phosphorylation events in their activation loops. This is conducted by specialized enzymes of the STE protein kinase group. In this way protein dynamics can induce a conformational change in the structure of the protein via long-range allostery. In the case of classical MAP kinases, the activation loop contains a characteristic TxY (threonine-x-tyrosine) motif (TEY in mammalian ERK1 and ERK2, TDY in ERK5, TPY in JNKs, TGY in p38 kinases) that needs to be phosphorylated on both the threonine and the tyrosine residues in order to lock the kinase domain in a catalytically competent conformation. In vivo and in vitro, phosphorylation of tyrosine oftentimes precedes phosphorylation of threonine, although phosphorylation of either residue can occur in the absence of the other. This tandem activation loop phosphorylation (that was proposed to be either distributive or processive, dependent on cellular environment) is performed by members of the Ste7 protein kinase family, also known as MAP2 kinases. MAP2 kinases in turn, are also activated by phosphorylation, by a number of different upstream serine-threonine kinases (MAP3 kinases). Because MAP2 kinases display very little activity on substrates other than their cognate MAPK, classical MAPK pathways form multi- tiered, but relatively linear pathways. These pathways can effectively convey stimuli from the cell membrane (where many MAP3Ks are activated) to the nucleus (where only MAPKs may enter) or to many other subcellular targets. In comparison to the three-tiered classical MAPK pathways, some atypical MAP kinases appear to have a more ancient, two-tiered system. ERK3 (MAPK6) and ERK4 (MAPK4) were recently shown to be directly phosphorylated and thus activated by PAK kinases (related to other MAP3 kinases). In contrast to the classical MAP kinases, these atypical MAPKs require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated. The details of NLK and ERK7 (MAPK15) activation remain unknown. Inactivation of MAPKs is performed by a number of phosphatases. A very conserved family of dedicated phosphatases is the so-called MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), a subgroup of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). As their name implies, these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing the phosphate from both phosphotyrosine and the phosphothreonine residues. Since removal of either phosphate groups will greatly reduce MAPK activity, essentially abolishing signaling, some tyrosine phosphatases are also involved in inactivating MAP kinases (e.g. the phosphatases HePTP, STEP and PTPRR in mammals).  Signaling cascades  Example for the inner workings of a MAP3 kinase: the activation cycle of mammalian Raf proteins (greatly simplified overview). As mentioned above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input several levels above the actual MAP kinase. In contrast to the relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tightly locked into an inactive state by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consist of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to prenylation). That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this dimerisation event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their MAP kinase substrates. = In animals = A simplified overview of MAPK pathways in mammals, organised into three main signaling modules (ERK1/2, JNK/p38 and ERK5). The ERK1/2 pathway of mammals is probably the best- characterized MAPK system. The most important upstream activators of this pathway are the Raf proteins (A-Raf, B-Raf or c-Raf), the key mediators of response to growth factors (EGF, FGF, PDGF, etc.); but other MAP3Ks such as c-Mos and Tpl2/Cot can also play the same role. All these enzymes phosphorylate and thus activate the MKK1 and/or MKK2 kinases, that are highly specific activators for ERK1 and ERK2. The latter phosphorylate a number of substrates important for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell division and differentiation (RSK kinases, Elk-1 transcription factor, etc.) In contrast to the relatively well-insulated ERK1/2 pathway, mammalian p38 and JNK kinases have most of their activators shared at the MAP3K level (MEKK1, MEKK4, ASK1, TAK1, MLK3, TAOK1, etc.). In addition, some MAP2K enzymes may activate both p38 and JNK (MKK4), while others are more specific for either JNK (MKK7) or p38 (MKK3 and MKK6). Due to these interlocks, there are very few if any stimuli that can elicit JNK activation without simultaneously activating p38 or reversed. Both JNK and p38 signaling pathways are responsive to stress stimuli, such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic shock, and are involved in adaptation to stress, apoptosis or cell differentiation. JNKs have a number of dedicated substrates that only they can phosphorylate (c-Jun, NFAT4, etc.), while p38s also have some unique targets (e.g. the MAPKAP kinases MK2 and MK3), ensuring the need for both in order to respond to stressful stimuli. ERK5 is part of a fairly well-separated pathway in mammals. Its sole specific upstream activator MKK5 is turned on in response to the MAP3 kinases MEKK2 and MEKK3. The specificity of these interactions are provided by the unique architecture of MKK5 and MEKK2/3, both containing N-terminal PB1 domains, enabling direct heterodimerisation with each other. The PB1 domain of MKK5 also contributes to the ERK5-MKK5 interaction: it provides a special interface (in addition to the D-motif found in MKK5) through which MKK5 can specifically recognize its substrate ERK5. Although the molecular-level details are poorly known, MEKK2 and MEKK3 respond to certain developmental cues to direct endothel formation and cardiac morphogenesis. While also implicated in brain development, the embryonic lethality of ERK5 inactivation due to cardiac abnormalities underlines its central role in mammalian vasculogenesis. It is notable, that conditional knockout of ERK5 in adult animals is also lethal, due to the widespread disruption of endothelial barriers. Mutations in the upstream components of the ERK5 pathway (the CCM complex) are thought to underlie cerebral cavernous malformations in humans. = In fungi = Overview of MAPK pathways in yeast. Non-canonical components of the five known modules (mating, filamentation, hyperosmosis, cell wall integrity, sporulation pathways) are colored in blue. MAPK pathways of fungi are also well studied. In yeast, the Fus3 MAPK is responsible for cell cycle arrest and mating in response to pheromone stimulation. The pheromone alpha- factor is sensed by a seven transmembrane receptor. The recruitment and activation of Fus3 pathway components are strictly dependent on heterotrimeric G-protein activation. The mating MAPK pathway consist of three tiers (Ste11-Ste7-Fus3), but the MAP2 and MAP3 kinases are shared with another pathway, the Kss1 or filamentous growth pathway. While Fus3 and Kss1 are closely related ERK-type kinases, yeast cells can still activate them separately, with the help of a scaffold protein Ste5 that is selectively recruited by the G-proteins of the mating pathway. The trick is that Ste5 can associate with and \\"unlock\\" Fus3 for Ste7 as a substrate in a tertiary complex, while it does not do the same for Kss1, leaving the filamentous growth pathway to be activated only in the absence of Ste5 recruitment. Fungi also have a pathway reminiscent of mammalian JNK/p38 signaling. This is the Hog1 pathway: activated by high osmolarity (in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or a number of other abiotic stresses (in Schizosaccharomyces pombe). The MAP2 kinase of this pathway is called Pbs2 (related to mammalian MKK3/4/6/7), the dedicated MAP3 kinases involved in activation are Ssk2 and SSk22. The system in S. cerevisiae is activated by a sophisticated osmosensing module consisting of the Sho1 and Sln1 proteins, but it is yet unclear how other stimuli can elicit activation of Hog1. Yeast also displays a number of other MAPK pathways without close homologs in animals, such as the cell wall integrity pathway (Mpk1/Slt2) or the sporulation pathway (Smk1). = In plants = Despite the high number of MAPK genes, MAPK pathways of higher plants were studied less than animal or fungal ones. Although their signaling appears very complex, the MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana are key mediators of responses to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, response to cold and involved in anti-pathogen responses. In addition, they are also involved in morphogenesis, since MPK4 mutants display severe dwarfism.  Evolutionary relationships  The evolutionary origins of human mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Members of the MAPK family can be found in every eukaryotic organism examined so far. In particular, both classical and atypical MAP kinases can be traced back to the root of the radiation of major eukaryotic groups. Terrestrial plants contain four groups of classical MAPKs (MAPK-A, MAPK-B, MAPK-C and MAPK-D) that are involved in response to myriads of abiotic stresses. However, none of these groups can be directly equated to the clusters of classical MAPKs found in opisthokonts (fungi and animals). In the latter, the major subgroups of classical MAPKs form the ERK/Fus3-like branch (that is further sub-divided in metazoans into ERK1/2 and ERK5 subgroups), and the p38/Hog1-like kinases (that has also split into the p38 and the JNK subgroups in multicellular animals). In addition, there are several MAPKs in both fungi and animals, whose origins are less clear, either due to high divergence (e.g. NLK), or due to possibly being an early offshoot to the entire MAPK family (ERK3, ERK4, ERK7). In vertebrates, due to the twin whole genome duplications after the cephalochordate/vertebrate split, there are several paralogs in every group. Thus ERK1 and ERK2 both correspond to the Drosophila kinase rolled, JNK1, JNK2 and JNK3 are all orthologous to the gene basket in Drosophila. Although among the p38 group, p38 alpha and beta are clearly paralogous pairs, and so are p38 gamma and delta in vertebrates, the timing of the base split is less clear, given that many metazoans already possess multiple p38 homologs (there are three p38-type kinases in Drosophila, Mpk2(p38a), p38b and p38c). The single ERK5 protein appears to fill a very specialized role (essential for vascular development in vertebrates) wherever it is present. This lineage has been deleted in protostomes, together with its upstream pathway components (MEKK2/3, MKK5), although they are clearly present in cnidarians, sponges and even in certain unicellular organisms (e.g. the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis) closely related to the origins of multicellular animals. The split between classical and some atypical MAP kinases happened quite early. This is suggested not just by the high divergence between extant genes, but also recent discoveries of atypical MAPKs in primitive, basal eukaryotes. The genome sequencing of Giardia lamblia revealed the presence of two MAPK genes, one of them similar to the already- well-known mammalian MAPKs (ERKs, p38s, etc.), the other one showing similarities to the mammalian ERK7 protein. The situation is similar in the multicellular amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, where the ddERK1 protein appears to be a classical MAPK, while ddERK2 more closely resembles our ERK7 and ERK3/4 proteins. Atypical MAPKs can also be found in higher plants, although they are poorly known. Similar to the situation in mammals, most aspects of atypical MAPKs are uncharacterized due to the lack of research focus on this area.  Substrate and partner recognition  The overview of the D-motif dependent MAPK interactions and substrate recognition. All cited examples refer to the interactions of the mammalian ERK2 protein. As typical for the CMGC kinase group, the catalytic site of MAP kinases has a very loose consensus sequence for substrates. Like all their relatives, they only require the target serine / threonine amino acids to be followed by a small amino acid, preferably proline (\\"proline-directed kinases\\"). But as SP/TP sites are extremely common in all proteins, additional substrate-recognition mechanisms have evolved to ensure signaling fidelity. Unlike their closest relatives, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), where substrates are recognized by the cyclin subunit, MAPKs associate with their substrates via auxiliary binding regions on their kinase domains. The most important such region consists of the hydrophobic docking groove and the negatively charged CD-region. Together they recognize the so-called MAPK docking or D-motifs (also called kinase interaction motif / KIM). D-motifs essentially consist of one or two positively charged amino acids, followed by alternating hydrophobic residues (mostly leucines), typically upstream of the phosphorylation site by 10–50 amino acids. Many of the known MAPK substrates contain such D-motifs that can not only bind to, but also provide specific recognition by certain MAPKs. D-motifs are not restricted to substrates: MAP2 kinases also contain such motifs on their N-termini that are absolutely required for MAP2K-MAPK interaction and MAPK activation. Similarly, both dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases and MAP-specific tyrosine phosphatases bind to MAP kinases through the same docking site. D-motifs can even be found in certain MAPK pathway regulators and scaffolds (e.g. in the mammalian JIP proteins). Other, less well characterised substrate-binding sites also exist. One such site (the DEF site) is formed by the activation loop (when in the active conformation) and the MAP kinase-specific insert below it. This site can accommodate peptides with an FxFP consensus sequence, typically downstream of the phosphorylation site. Note that the latter site can only be found in proteins that need to selectively recognize the active MAP kinases, thus they are almost exclusively found in substrates. Different motifs may cooperate with each other, as in the Elk family of transcription factors, that possess both a D-motif and an FxFP motif. The presence of an FxFP motif in the KSR1 scaffold protein also serves to make it an ERK1/2 substrate, providing a negative feedback mechanism to set the correct strength of ERK1/2 activation.  Scaffold proteins  Since the discovery of Ste5 in yeast, scientists were on the hunt to discover similar non-enzymatic scaffolding pathway elements in mammals. There are indeed a number of proteins involved in ERK signaling, that can bind to multiple elements of the pathway: MP1 binds both MKK1/2 and ERK1/2, KSR1 and KSR2 can bind B-Raf or c-Raf, MKK1/2 and ERK1/2. Analogous proteins were also discovered for the JNK pathway: the JIP1/JIP2 and the JIP3/JIP4 families of proteins were all shown to bind MLKs, MKK7 and any JNK kinase. Unfortunately, unlike the yeast Ste5, the mechanisms by which they regulate MAPK activation are considerably less understood. While Ste5 actually forms a ternary complex with Ste7 and Fus3 to promote phosphorylation of the latter, known mammalian scaffold proteins appear to work by very different mechanisms. For example, KSR1 and KSR2 are actually MAP3 kinases and related to the Raf proteins. Although KSRs alone display negligible MAP3 kinase activity, KSR proteins can still participate in the activation of Raf kinases by forming side-to-side heterodimers with them, providing an allosteric pair to turn on each enzymes. JIPs on the other hand, are apparently transport proteins, responsible for enrichment of MAPK signaling components in certain compartments of polarized cells. In this context, JNK-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1 (and possibly JIP2) provides a signal for JIPs to release the JIP-bound and inactive upstream pathway components, thus driving a strong local positive feedback loop. This sophisticated mechanism couples kinesin-dependent transport to local JNK activation, not only in mammals, but also in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster.  As therapeutic targets  Since the ERK signaling pathway is involved in both physiological and pathological cell proliferation, it is natural that ERK1/2 inhibitors would represent a desirable class of antineoplastic agents. Indeed, many of the proto-oncogenic \\"driver\\" mutations are tied to ERK1/2 signaling, such as constitutively active (mutant) receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras or Raf proteins. Although no MKK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors were developed for clinical use, kinase inhibitors that also inhibit Raf kinases (e.g. Sorafenib) are successful antineoplastic agents against various types of cancer. MEK inhibitor Cobimetinib has been investigated in pre-clinical lung cancer models in combination with inhibition of the PI3K pathway, where the two drugs lead to a synergistic response. JNK kinases are implicated in the development of insulin resistance in obese individuals as well as neurotransmitter excitotoxicity after ischaemic conditions. Inhibition of JNK1 ameliorates insulin resistance in certain animal models. Mice that were genetically engineered to lack a functional JNK3 gene - the major isoform in brain – display enhanced ischemic tolerance and stroke recovery. Although small- molecule JNK inhibitors are under development, none of them proved to be effective in human tests yet. A peptide-based JNK inhibitor (AM-111, a retro- inverse D-motif peptide from JIP1, formerly known as XG-102) is also under clinical development for sensorineural hearing loss. p38 was once believed to be a perfect target for anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet the failure of more than a dozen chemically different compounds in the clinical phase suggests that p38 kinases might be poor therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases. Many of these compounds were found to be hepatotoxic to various degree and tolerance to the anti-inflammatory effect developed within weeks. An alternative approach is to evaluate the potential for targeting upstream MAPKs, such as ASK1. Studies in animal models of inflammatory arthritis have yielded promising results, and ASK1 has recently been found to be unique amongst the MAPKs in that it is inducible by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.

Biography =Early years= Portrait of a young Maurepas He was born at Versailles, of a family of administrative nobility, the son of Jérôme Phélypeaux, secretary of state for the marine and the royal household. Under the guidance of his father, his grandfather and his cousin Louis Phélypeaux, marquis de La Vrillière, Jean- Frederic was trained from childhood to be secretary of state to the king of France. Jean-Frederic had right en survivance to the position of secretary of state, under Philippe II, as his father Jerome had purchased the office with the right of inheritance.Rule, John C., “Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain et Maurepas: Reflections on His Life and His Papers”, The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association Vol 6: 1965, p 365-377 In 1718 at the age of 17, Jean became the minister of the royal household and Comte de Maurepas under the guardianship of his cousin La Vrillière. Shortly after he married the daughter of his cousin, Marie-Jeanne. Five years later on the 16th of August he began his duties as ministre de la marine to Louis XV administering the navy, colonies and seaborne trade. In 1738 he was promoted to the council of state, and in time aided the king, alongside several other ministers in making significant political decisions.McLynn, F. \\"An Eighteenth- Century Scots Republic? An Unlikely Project from Absolutist France\\", Scottish Historical Review Vol 59, Edinburgh University Press:1980, p 177 Jean continued his administrative career after the death of his guardian, and was ministre de la marine until April 23, 1749, when he was removed in a coup. =Political rising= Naval parade organised by Maurepas Skilled in military and naval strategy, Maurepas enabled the French navy to regain previously lost prestige and France was once again recognized as a maritime power. One way that he improved the French reputation was by focusing on the defense of France's sprawling empire in the New World, especially in the 1730s and 1740s.Rule, John C.\\"The Maurepas Papers: Portrait of a Minister\\", French Historical Studies Vol. 4, Duke University Press, 1965, p. 104. His defense plans were aided by information on British naval manoeuvres, lists of what ships were coming to North America and detailed memoirs of ship construction. Jean-Frederic obtained this information through maintaining an intelligence service that was considered one of the most efficient in Europe.Rule, John C.\\"The Maurepas Papers: Portrait of a Minister\\", French Historical Studies Vol. 4, Duke University Press, 1965, p. 105. This was only made possible due to the drastic funding increases he managed to obtain for the Troupes de la Marine. The typical budget appropriated to the marine from the mid-1720s to mid-1730s was 9 million livres; in 1739, however, Jean-Frederic managed to obtain a budget of 19.2 million livres. In the following years he acquired budgets of 20 million livres in 1740, 26 million in 1741 and 27 million in 1742. Over his career as administrator he held the positions of chamberlain of the royal household, minister of the marine, and director of the secret service, fulfilling his duties with efficiency and precision. =Political decline= In 1749, Maurepas was removed by a coup led by Duke of Richelieu, putting an end to his period of immense success. He was exiled from Paris for an epigram against Madame de Pompadour, and went to Bourges and then onto Pontchartrain. In 1774, he was appointed to minister of state to Louis XVI, as well as chief adviser, holding both positions until 1781. He gave Turgot the direction of finance, placed Lamoignon-Malesherbes over the royal household and made Vergennes minister for foreign affairs. At the outset of his new career he showed his weakness by recalling to their functions, in deference to popular clamour, the members of the old Parlement ousted by Maupeou, thus reconstituting the most dangerous enemy of the royal power. This step, and his intervention on behalf of the American states, helped to pave the way for the French Revolution. Jealous of his personal ascendancy over Louis XVI, he intrigued against Turgot, whose disgrace in 1776 was followed after six months of disorder by the appointment of Jacques Necker. In 1781 Maurepas deserted Necker as he had done Turgot, and he died at Versailles on 21 November 1781. Legacy Maurepas is credited with contributions to the collection of facetiae known as the Etrennes de la Saint Jean (2nd ed., 1742). Four volumes of Memoires de Maurepas, purporting to be collected by his secretary and edited by J.L.G. Soulavie in 1792, included information on the North American colonies, the fall of Louisbourg, trade in the Caribbean, the censorship of books and administration. He also recorded extensive information on all naval matters including naval construction, navigation sailing instructions and fighting at sea. The collection of memoirs is now in the possession of Cornell University. Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, USA was named for him, showing his surviving influence on the New World.

In 2018, Torres was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bon Jovi.  Childhood  Hector Juan Samuel Torres was born on October 7, 1953, in New York, and brought up in the Colonia section of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. His parents, Emma and Héctor, emigrated from Cuba in 1948. Torres attended John F. Kennedy Memorial High School in Iselin.  Music career  Torres live with Bon Jovi on November 14, 2007 in Montreal. Torres was a jazz fan as a youth and studied music with Joe Morello. In 1969, he played drums for the psychedelic rock band Six Feet Under. Before joining Bon Jovi in 1983, Torres had already played live with Joe Cerisano's R-Band aka Silver Condor in the New Jersey Rock circuit, and in the studio with Franke and the Knockouts, Pat Benatar, Chuck Berry, Cher, Alice Cooper and Stevie Nicks, recording a total of 26 albums with these artists. Torres was also one of the drummers auditioned by Kiss in 1980 after original drummer Peter Criss left the band. Torres was the original drummer for the glam rock band T. Roth and Another Pretty Face and played on their 1980 album Face Facts. =Bon Jovi= Torres met Alec John Such while playing with a band called Phantom's Opera and it was this friendship which led to him joining Bon Jovi. When Jon Bon Jovi, the lead singer of the band, approached Torres, he was put off by the fact that Jon was 9 years younger than himself. He said it was Jon's charismatic appearance and watching him perform that attracted him to join the band. Torres is primarily a drummer and percussionist, but he sang lead vocals on a song on the box set 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong, as well as backing vocals on a couple of the early Bon Jovi tracks, notably \\"Born to Be My Baby\\" and \\"Love for Sale\\". =Endorsements= After a long endorsement deal with Pearl drums and hardware since 1984, after Richie Sambora's last show with Bon Jovi in April 2013, Torres changed from Pearl drums to DW, after DW made a custom kit out of cherry wood to Torres' specifications. Along with DW, Torres also endorses Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads, his signature Easton Ahead drumsticks and their griptape and gloves, LP percussion and Beato drum bags.

He has exhibited his art since 1994. The successful first show was at the Ambassador Galleries in Soho, New York. Torres is a self-taught painter, who paints expressive pictures which show scenes from everyday life and his life with the band. His painting talent was shown in one of the three videos made for the single \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home.\\" There is a scene in one of the videos showing Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and David Bryan painting a wall of a house a solid color, while Tico is at the other end of the room, painting an extravagant picture of a house surrounded by a multi-colored heart on the same wall. His art can be found at http://www.walnutst.com/. Torres also owns a fashion line for babies called Rock Star Baby (selling baby clothing, strollers, soft toys, jewelry and furniture, etc.), which is viewable at http://www.rockstarbaby.com  Personal life  Torres and his first wife divorced soon after the formation of Bon Jovi in 1983. In 1996, Torres married Czech-born model Eva Herzigová in Sea Bright, New Jersey. The ceremony was attended by their closest friends and family including Donald Trump and the members of Bon Jovi. The band serenaded Eva and her husband with the hit single \\"Always\\" during the dance. Their marriage ended two years later. Torres married Maria Alejandra in September 2001, his third marriage. They have a son, Hector Alexander, born on January 9, 2004. Torres is an avid golfer who frequently participates in the Alfred Dunhill Links Pro-Am in St. Andrews, UK, often playing in a foursome with fellow musician and good friend Huey Lewis. In 2013 Torres was rushed to the hospital for a second time with severe pain in his abdomen. The 59-year old drummer underwent emergency gall bladder surgery, according to the band's website.

How it works is not completely clear but is believed to involve increasing the amount of sodium and water lost by the kidneys. Chlortalidone was patented in 1957 and came into medical use in 1960. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 173rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical use =High blood pressure= Chlortalidone is considered a first-line medication for treatment high blood pressure. Some recommend chlortalidone over hydrochlorothiazide. A meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials found that chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for lowering blood pressure, while the two drugs have similar toxicity. Trials of chlortalidone for high blood pressure found that lower doses of chlortalidone (e.g., 12.5 mg daily in ALLHAT study) had maximal blood pressure lowering effect and that higher doses did not lower it more. Chlortalidone, like other thiazides, appears effective in people with kidney disease. Chlortalidone and other thiazide diuretics are effective for lowering high blood pressure in persons with chronic kidney disease, although the risk of adverse effects is higher in these persons. =Left ventricular hypertrophy= Chlortalidone is used to treat left ventricular hypertrophy in the heart; it works chiefly by lowering blood pressure, and thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance. There is evidence that chlortalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for reducing the mass of the left ventricle of the heart in persons with enlargement of the left ventricle of the heart. Chlortalidone is superior to angiotensin converting enzyme Inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for inducing regression of enlargement of the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart. =Swelling= Chlortalidone may improve edema (swelling) by increasing urinary salt and water excretion, lowering intravascular hydrostatic pressure and thereby lowering transcapillary pressure (see Starling Equation). Edema may be caused by either increased hydrostatic pressure or reduced oncotic pressure in the blood vessels. Edema due to increased hydrostatic pressure may be a result of serious cardiopulmonary disease (which reduces glomerular perfusion in the kidney) or to kidney injury or disease (which may reduce glomerular excretion of salt and water by the kidney) or due to relatively benign conditions such as menstrual-related fluid retention, or as an adverse effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which commonly cause swelling of the feet and lower legs. Edema due to decreased oncotic pressure may be a result of leaking of blood proteins through the glomeruli of an injured kidney or a result of decreased synthesis of blood proteins by the liver. Regardless of cause, chlortalidone may sometimes improve the severity of edema by reducing intravascular volume and thereby reducing intravascular hydrostatic pressure. =Bone fracture prevention= Chlortalidone decreases mineral bone loss by promoting calcium retention by the kidney, and by directly stimulating osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral formation. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that thiazide exposure was associated with a reduced risk of hip fracture. A secondary analysis of data from the ALLHAT study found that chlortalidone reduced risk of hip and pelvis fracture. =Kidney stone prevention= Chlortalidone reduces the amount of calcium excreted in urine, reducing the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stones. In people who have had multiple episodes of calcium oxalate kidney stones, chlortalidone lowers the risk of having another episode of kidney stones. Chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for lowering urine calcium levels and is therefore probably more effective. =Ménière's disease= Chlortalidone reduces the volume and thereby reduces the pressure in the inner ear chambers; elevated endolymph pressure in the inner ear is thought to be the cause of Ménière's disease or ’Endolymphatic hydrops.’ Synthesis of evidence from multiple small, low-quality studies indicates that chlortalidone or other thiazide diuretics are effective for Ménière's Disease. =Diabetes insipidus= Chlortalidone (or other thiazide medication) is a key component of treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney is unable to produce concentrated urine because it has an inadequate response to vasopressin-dependent removal of free water from the renal tubular filtrate. By blocking sodium ion resorption in the distal convoluted tubule, chlortalidone induces an increase in excretion of sodium ion in urine (natriuresis). Giving chlortalidone while simultaneously restricting dietary sodium intake causes mild hypovolemia (low intravascular volume), which induces isotonic reabsorption of solute from the proximal renal tubule, reducing solute delivery in the renal collecting tubule and renal medullary collecting duct. This reduced delivery of solute to the collecting tubule and medullary collecting duct allows increased water resorption and higher concentration of urine, which leads to reversal of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by a means that is independent of vasopressin. Adverse effects Some reviews have found a similar risk as hydrochlorothiazide, while other reviews found a higher risk of side effects. * Hypokalemia (low blood potassium) occurs occasionally; the risk of hypokalemia is higher in persons who are magnesium deficient * Hypomagnesemia (low blood magnesium) a review of four clinical trials found that low blood magnesium occurred in 20% of persons within a few weeks of beginning treatment with 50 mg of chlortalidone daily. The risk of chlortalidone-associated hypomagnesemia is higher in persons with diabetes mellitus who have low dietary magnesium intake. * Hyponatremia (low blood sodium) occurred in 4.1% of subjects randomized to chlortalidone in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Trial, compared to 1.3% of control subjects. The risk of hyponatremia varies from 5 per 100,000 person-years for those younger than 40 years of age to 730 per 100,000 person-years in those older than 80 years of age. Hyponatremia is more likely in persons with certain genetic variants of the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1 associated with elevated urinary PGE2 and inappropriately low plasma ADH levels in the setting of low plasma osmolality. Thiazide-associated hyponatremia is often more severe than loop diuretic-associated hyponatremia because the predominant action of thiazides occurs late in the tubular flow, reducing opportunity to apply additional corrective action further along the tubule. * Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium level) can occur in normal persons exposed to chlortalidone but is more likely to occur when persons with sub-clinical hyperparathyroidism are exposed to chlortalidone. * Hyperuricemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood * Hyperglycemia, high blood sugar is more common in persons who are magnesium deficient * Hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol and triglycerides * Headache * Nausea/vomiting * Photosensitivity increased susceptibility to sunburn of skin with sun exposure * Photoonycholysis detachment of nails from nailbed with sun exposure * Weight gain * Gout; approximately doubles the risk * Pancreatitis The frequency and severity of these adverse effects is much reduced when chlortalidone is used at lower doses (e.g., 12.5 mg per day). Mechanism of action Chlortalidone reduces reabsorption of sodium and chloride primarily through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. Although chlortalidone is often referred to as a \\"thiazide-like\\" diuretic, it is unlike thiazide diuretics in that, in addition to its inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter, it also strongly inhibits multiple isoforms of carbonic anhydrase. Some of chlortalidone's diuretic effect is also due to this inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubule. Chronic exposure to chlortalidone decreases the glomerular filtration rate. Chlortalidone's diuretic effect is diminished in persons with kidney impairment. By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, chlortalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium- potassium exchange mechanism (i.e. apical ROMK/Na channels coupled with basolateral Na+/K ATPases). This can result in a low blood concentration of potassium and chloride as well as a mild metabolic alkalosis; however, the diuretic effect of chlortalidone is not affected by the acid-base balance of the person being treated. There is uncertainty about the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering effect that occurs during chronic exposure to chlortalidone. Initially, diuretics lower blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output and reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume. Eventually, cardiac output returns to normal, and plasma and extracellular fluid volume return to slightly less than normal, but a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is maintained, thus resulting in an overall lower blood pressure. The reduction in intravascular volume induces an elevation in plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion, further contributing to the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. Pharmacokinetics Chlortalidone is slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral ingestion. It has a long half-life and therefore a prolonged diuretic action, which results in continued diuretic effects despite a skipped dose. This prolonged action of chlortalidone despite missing doses may account for the higher efficacy of chlortalidone compared to the shorter half-life medication, hydrochlorothiazide. Chlortalidone is eliminated from the body mostly by the kidney, as unchanged drug. Thus, in persons with diminished kidney function, the clearance of chlortalidone is reduced and the elimination half-life is increased.Singer, Jeff M., Michael J. O'Hare, Carl R. Rehm, and John E. Zarembo. \\"Chlorthalidone.\\" In Analytical Profiles of Drug Substances, vol. 14, pp. 1-36. Academic Press, 1985. As with other thiazide diuretics, chlortalidone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Chlortalidone may suppress lactation, and has been used for this indication. Due to its long half-life, chlortalidone may accumulate in newborns via breast milk, despite receiving only about 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. Chemistry Chlortalidone is in the sulfamoylbenzamide class. As it lacks the benzothiadiazine structure of the thiazide-type diuretics, it is called a thiazide-like diuretic.National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubChem Compound Database; CID=2732, Chlortalidone is freely soluble in dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and methanol; it is also soluble in warm ethanol. Chlortalidone is the official name of the medication according to the (INN/BAN), which is the medication naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization. Chlorthalidone is the official name of the medication according to the (USAN), which is the medication naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, which is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). Society and culture Chlortalidone is banned for some sports (including cricket) because it is a diuretic, and can be used to reduce body weight or to mask the concomitant use of performance-enhancing drugs. Sports such as wrestling or boxing categorize athletes according to body weight; taking a diuretic such as chlortalidone may lower body weight, and thereby permit an athlete to compete in a lighter weight class, which would provide an advantage. Diuretics such as chlortalidone also reduce the urine concentration of concomitantly-taken performance-enhancing drugs or of their metabolites, thus making it more difficult to detect these drugs using urine testing.

It flows through the western and central part of the Kuma–Manych Depression. In ancient times, it was known as the Lik. A tributary of the Don, it is long, with its current source at the mouth of the Kalaus in the southwestern part of the Republic of Kalmykia. It flows through the town of Proletarsk and joins the Don in Manychskaya, east of the city of Rostov-on-Don.West Manych (Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences) Along the Manych, going downstream, there are: *Dam at at the mouth of the Kalaus River blocking flow eastward to East Manych *Lysyy Liman Reservoir (Dam at ) in between these two dams *A section that is almost dry *Lake Manych-Gudilo *Proletarsk (Proletarskoye) Reservoir (Пролетарское водохранилище) (Dam at , near the town of Proletarsk) *Vesyolovskoye Reservoir (Весёловское водохранилище) (Dam at , near Vesyoly). *Ust-Manych Reservoir near the river mouth (Усть-Манычское водохранилище) (Dam at ) The Proletarsk Dam is sufficiently high to raise the water level in Lake Manych-Gudilo upstream from it, so in fact the lake has become part of the Proletarsk Reservoir. The three reservoirs (and Lake Manych-Gudilo) form an almost continuous chain, the original course of the river being almost entirely flooded by them. According to the calculations of the Russian geographer Alexander Bazelyuk, between Manych-Gudilo and the river mouth, merely of the length of the West Manych river remains in its original \\"river\\" (rather than reservoir) form: from the Vesyolovsk Dam to the upper reaches of the Ust-Manych Reservoir, and from the Ust-Manych Dam to where the river joins the Don.Alexander A. Bazelyuk (А. А. Базелюк), \\"Changes in the hydrographic network of river basins. The West and East Manych in the 19–20th centuries\\". In: Proceedings of the International Scientific and Practical Conference on the Preservation of the Wetlands Biodiversity and Sustainable Use of the Biological Resources of the Steppe Zone, Rostov-on-Don, 2007. Unusual drainage system Formerly, at least in periods of high water, the Manych River would flow in two directions. The river Kalaus, when reaching the Kuma–Manych Depression at , would split. About 30% of the water would become the West Manych and flow northwest to, or toward, the Don River. The remaining water became the East Manych and flowed roughly southeast and dried up on the steppe before reaching the Caspian Sea. Sometime around 1970 a low dam was built which prevented any water from flowing into the East Manych. The East Manych is now fed by irrigation canals coming from the Kuma and Terek Rivers.Alexander Anatolievich Bazelyuk (Базелюк Александр Анатольевич), \\"АНТРОПОГЕННОЕ ИЗМЕНЕНИЕ ГИДРОГРАФИЧЕСКОЙ СЕТИ КУМО-МАНЫЧСКОЙ ВПАДИНЫ\\" (Anthropogenic changes in the Hydrographic Network of the Kuma-Manych Depression), summary of the Cand. Sci. dissertation. Rostov-na-Donu, 2007. ?not available 01feb16? Canals Historically (prior to the construction of the dams and irrigation channels, i.e. until 1932–1940 for the West Manych, and until 1969 for the East Manych), both rivers were intermittent. During dry years, and even during the drier parts of normal years, both Manych Rivers would consist merely of a chain of small lakes or ponds with brackish or salty water. The system usually would be fully filled with fresh water only during the spring freshet. Since the mid-20th century both Manych Rivers receive significant amounts of fresh water via a network of irrigation canals. Since 1948–1953, the West Manych has been receiving water from the Kuban River (via the Nevinnomyssk Canal and the Yegorlyk, a left tributary of the West Manych) and from the Tsimlyansk Reservoir on the Don (via the Don Canal). Since the late 1960s, the East Manych has been receiving water from the Terek River and the Kuma River via the Kuma–Manych Canal. According to A. Bazelyuk's calculations, the annual water flow in the West Manych (measured at the Vesyoly township) is 8.3 times as high as it was previous to the canal and dam constructions, while that in the East Manych (measured at the Chogray Dam) is 4.3 times as high as before. If the plans for the proposed Eurasia Canal, linking the Caspian Sea with the Black Sea, are ever implemented, it will likely follow the Manych valley in its central and western section.

History =Early days (1990–1996)= Helme began singing and performing at the age of 19, and began playing in pubs and folk clubs in his native York with his first band Daisy Space/Genuine Moon Material before forming folk-jazz band Chutzpah in 1993. The band regularly gigged at the White Swan Pub and Fibbers, where Helme worked behind the bar. In 1995 the band busked across rural France before splitting up (the band went on to reform in 2007 for a one-off gig at The White Swan). =The Seahorses (1996–1999)= A friend of John Squire's long-time guitar technician Martin Herbet discovered Helme busking outside Woolworths department store in York's Coney Street. Impressed by Helme's version of The Rolling Stones song, \\"No Expectations\\", he requested a demo tape and passed it on to Squire. Squire went to see Helme perform at Fibbers on 26 May and 16 June 1996. Another gig was then arranged at the Roadhouse venue in Manchester, where Squire invited Helme to join his new band, for which he had already recruited bassist Stuart Fletcher. Geffen Records, to whom Squire was still under contract following his departure from The Stone Roses, signed the band. The Seahorses released their debut album Do It Yourself in 1997. The album was produced by Tony Visconti and spawned three hit singles. \\"Love is the Law\\" reached no. 2 in the UK Singles Chart; \\"Blinded by the Sun\\" got to no. 7 and \\"Love Me and Leave Me\\" at no. 15. The stand-alone single \\"You Can Talk to Me\\", co-written by Squire and Helme peaked at no. 15. In January 1999, after two years of intensive touring, including support slots to The Rolling Stones, U2 and Oasis, a press release sent to the NME announced the split of the Seahorses \\"due to John Squire's and lead singer Chris Helme's irreconcilable differences over the musical direction the band should take\\". Both Helme and Squire later gave conflicting reasons for the split. Helme claimed that \\"there was a personality clash during rehearsals. When he (Squire) came up with new stuff I didn't like his lyrics or tunes. I could have gone with it and made quite a lot of money, but I wasn't interested.\\" Squire later commented on his reasons for ending the band that \\"I thought, 'This sounds shit, we don't deserve to be in this place.' The band sounded complacent. I don't suppose it was anyone's fault. Maybe it got far too much attention for very little effort in the early stages, because of what I'd done in the past.\\" =Solo and The Yards (1999–2009)= Following The Seahorses' early demise, Helme undertook a short solo tour across England which culminated with a gig at the Improv Theatre in London. Backed by a newly formed band featuring members of York band, 'The Lo Beams', Fraser Smith of Shed Seven and fellow ex-Seahorse, Stuart Fletcher performing material written whilst in The Seahorses. The gigs were confirmed just 11 days following the official announcement of the Seahorses' split. Following these initial gigs, which the NME described as \\"fairly unambitious rock music\\", Helme abandoned the band format and returned to his native York where he performed sporadic low-key solo acoustic shows. In 2000 Helme started working with session guitarist James Nisbet and began playing showcase gigs in London backed by a revolving cast of session musicians, which at one point featured drummer Toby Drummond, who temporarily replaced Andy Watts in The Seahorses. With a full band, Helme headlined his biggest gig to date as a solo artist, at the Theatre Royal in York in May 2000. In 2001 a permanent backing band was assembled with Nisbet, drummer John Miller and Stuart Fletcher back on bass. With new management and PR, an official website was launched and a 3 track demo CD was serviced to the media. With the new band, Helme performed numerous London showcase gigs at Ritz and undertook a short UK tour in November of that year. Helme then went on to form The Yards from the ashes of his solo backing band. Initially named Super Zero, the band originally featured former Shed Seven guitarist Paul Banks who left before the release of their debut EP The Devil Is Alive and Well in D.C. in April 2003. The band released their self-titled debut album in 2005 and second album Imperial Measures in 2009 via their own label Industrial Erotica. The band split in November 2009 with members pursuing their own projects. =Solo (2009 – present)= Helme set up an independent record label, promo company and booking agency \\"Little Num Num Music\\" with fellow York musician Andy Gaines. It was on this label that Helme released his debut solo album, Ashes, in May 2008. He toured the UK extensively to coincide with the release and followed up with a single, Pleased, in 2010 which was taken from his second album. In August 2012 Helme released second album The Rookery to positive reviews. Recorded in 11 days the album was produced by Chris Helme with Sam Forrest (of Nine Black Alps). Helme continues to tour as a solo artist and with a full band and a third album is slated for release in 2015.

Before joining Bon Jovi, he was the bass guitarist for the David Bromberg Band, touring extensively worldwide and playing on many Bromberg albums. He has played with many other artists, both live and in the studio, and has recorded with Willie Nelson, Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Steve Goodman, Ringo Starr, Lita Ford, Michael Bolton, Cher, Alice Cooper, Ricky Martin, Gavin Whittaker, Michael Bublé, Bret Michaels, others and did a few dates during Shania Twain's the Woman in Me TV tour. He has worked with Bon Jovi in the studio since its inception and has been their bass guitarist since original bass guitarist Alec John Such's departure after Cross Road which was released in 1994, but was still regarded as an 'unofficial' member of Bon Jovi. At this time, McDonald was left out of most publicity shoots and album covers but did appear in some of the band's promo videos. The band members said they never agreed to officially replace Such.

Lucas Edward Verrall Lucas, CH (11/12 June 1868 – 26 June 1938) was an English humorist, essayist, playwright, biographer, publisher, poet, novelist, short story writer and editor. Born to a Quaker family in Eltham, on the fringes of London, Lucas began work at the age of sixteen, apprenticed to a bookseller. After that he turned to journalism, and worked on a local paper in Brighton and then on a London evening paper. He was commissioned to write a biography of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet. This led to further commissions, including the editing of the works of Charles Lamb. Lucas joined the staff of the humorous magazine Punch in 1904, and remained there for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer, most celebrated for his short essays, but he also produced verses, novels and plays. From 1908 to 1924 Lucas combined his work as a writer with that of publisher's reader for Methuen and Co. In 1924 he was appointed chairman of the company. Life and career =Early years= Lucas was born in Eltham, Kent, the second son of the four sons and three daughters of Alfred Lucas and his wife, Jane née Drewett. The Lucases were a Quaker family, and the young Lucas was educated at Friends School in Saffron Walden. His father's financial incompetence prevented Lucas from going to a university, and at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to a Brighton bookseller.Knox, E V, revised by Katharine Chubbuck. \\"Lucas, Edward Verrall (1868–1938)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 13 March 2013 In 1889 Lucas joined the staff of the Sussex Daily News. The following year he published, anonymously, his first volume of poems, Sparks from a Flint.\\"Mr E V Lucas\\". The Times, 27 June 1938, p. 16 With financial help from an uncle he moved to London to attend lectures at University College, after which he joined the staff of The Globe, one of London's evening papers. His duties there allowed him a great deal of spare time, and he read extensively in the Reading Room of the British Museum. In 1897 he married (Florence) Elizabeth Gertrude, daughter of Colonel James Theodore Griffin, of the United States army; there was one child, Audrey, of the marriage. Elizabeth Lucas was a writer, and husband and wife collaborated on several children's books. Elizabeth may also have acted as a translator, as a Mrs E.V. Lucas is listed as translator on multiple books. =Writer= Lucas's Quaker background led to a commission from the Society of Friends for a biography of Bernard Barton, the Quaker poet and friend of Charles Lamb. The success of the book was followed by further commissions from leading publishers; the most important of these commissions was a new edition of Lamb's works, which eventually amounted to seven volumes, with an associated biography, all published between 1903 and 1905. His biographer Katharine Chubbuck writes, \\"These works established him as a critic, and his Life of Charles Lamb (1905) is considered seminal.\\" In 1904, while in the middle of his work on Lamb, he joined the staff of Punch, remaining there for more than thirty years. Lucas introduced his Punch colleague A A Milne to the illustrator E H Shepard with whom Milne collaborated on two collections of verse and the two Winnie-the-Pooh books.Nickerson and Wootton, p. 199 Lucas's output was prolific; by Max Beerbohm's estimation he spoke fewer words than he wrote.\\"E(dward) V(errall) Lucas\\", Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2003 Lucas's Punch colleague E V Knox commented, \\"Lucas's publications include many anthologies and about thirty collections of light essays, on almost any subject that took his fancy, and some of the titles which he gave to them, Listener's Lure (1905), One Day and Another (1909), Old Lamps for New (1911), Loiterer's Harvest (1913), Cloud and Silver (1916), A Rover I Would Be (1928), indicate sufficiently the lightness, gaiety, and variety of their contents.\\"Knox, E V. \\"Lucas, Edward Verrall\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1949, online edition accessed 13 March 2013 He wrote travel books, parodies, and books about painters. Of the last he said, \\"I know very little about pictures, but I like to write about them for the benefit of those who know less.\\" Frank Swinnerton wrote of him: Lucas's fluency was thought by some to dilute his skill. Although Swinnerton declared Lucas's essays \\"among the most agreeable of our age\\", Agnes Irene Smith wrote in The Sewanee Review of Lucas that despite his huge output \\"he seems to have left no finger prints. Eminently readable, he is read without being remembered; unusually quotable, he was never quoted much and seems never to be quoted any more.\\"Smith, Agnes Irene. \\"E V Lucas\\", The Sewanee Review, Volume 48 (1940), p. 222 In 1910 Lucas authored the short article on Jane Austen in the 11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Before the First World War Lucas was for a while interested in the theatre; his play The Visit of the King was produced at the Palace Theatre in 1912, but was not well received.\\"The Palace Theatre\\", The Times, 3 December 1912, p. 9 A more enduring interest was cricket. Lucas was a member of J. M. Barrie's team the \\"Allahakbarries\\", along with Henry Herbert La Thangue and Arthur Conan Doyle. Rupert Hart-Davis collected and published a collection of Lucas's essays, Cricket All His Life, which John Arlott called \\"the best written of all books on cricket\\".Arlott, p. 188 His study of Highways and Byways in Sussex continues to influence postmodern explorations of the local; while his 1932 memoirs Reading, Writing and Remembering retained their interest longer than most of his other essays.D. Daiches, ed. The Penguin Companion to Literature 1 (1971) p. 324 =Later years= Lucas had a long association with the publishing house Methuen and Co, which published his edition of Lamb. From 1908 to 1924 he was a reader for the firm; in 1924 he was appointed its chairman, a post he occupied with considerable success. Lucas received honorary degrees from the Universities of St Andrews and Oxford, and was appointed Companion of Honour in 1932. He was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1928, and from 1933 until his death he was a member of the Crown Lands Advisory Committee.\\"Lucas, Edward Verrall\\", Who Was Who, A. & C. Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 13 March 2013 In his later years Lucas cut his domestic ties and lived alone, spending his evenings in restaurants and clubs, and developing a wide collection of pornography. He was a member of the Athenæum, Beefsteak, Buck's and the Garrick. When he was stricken with his final illness he steadfastly refused to allow his friends into his sickroom.\\"E. V.

She is usually depicted as a supporting character to the superheroes the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, she first appeared in The Fantastic Four #8 (Nov 1962). Alicia is a blind sculptor who is able to create incredibly lifelike representations of real people by touch and memory alone; her sculptures of the Fantastic Four and other superheroes are frequently depicted. A caring, sensitive character, she has been a romantic interest and confidante of The Thing, a member of the Fantastic Four who is frequently ashamed of his monstrous appearance. She has also helped explain human life and emotion to the alien Silver Surfer. Actress Kat Green played her in the unreleased The Fantastic Four film from 1994, and then Kerry Washington portrayed her in the 2005 film Fantastic Four and the 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Fictional character biography Alicia is introduced in Fantastic Four #8, along with her stepfather, the supervillain known as the Puppet Master. She initially aids him out of obedience in his first scheme against the Fantastic Four, though she immediately senses the \\"gentle\\" and \\"sensitive\\" spirit of the Thing when she first feels his palpably monstrous face. Alicia turns on her stepfather when she realizes that he is mad and power-hungry, and accidentally causes him to fall to his apparent death out of a window. A subsequently published story explains that the Puppet Master had been responsible for her permanent blindness, which was caused by an explosion of radioactive clay during his fight with a rival.Marvel Team-Up Vol. 1 #6 (January 1973) Alicia Masters pleads with the Silver Surfer for the survival of humanity in Fantastic Four #49 (April 1966).

The character plays an integral role in one of the most acclaimed comic book stories of the Silver Age, \\"The Coming of Galactus,\\" in Fantastic Four #48–50 (March – May 1966). In that story arc, the Silver Surfer first comes to Earth as a herald to the powerful, world-destroying being Galactus, and crashes into Alicia's apartment after fighting the Fantastic Four. Her passionate pleading with him about the value of life convinces him to reject his master and defend the Earth from destruction.

He was also a key member of Nigeria's military governments between 1966 and 1979, serving as a military administrator of Borno State under General Olusegun Obasanjo's military government. Early life Idiagbon was born into the family of his father Hassan Dogo and mother Ayisatu Iyabeji Hassan Idiagbon on 14 September 1943 in Ilorin, Kwara State. He attended United Primary School, Ilorin from 1950 to 1952 and Okesuna Senior Primary School, Ilorin, 1953–57. He received his secondary education at the Nigeria Military School, Zaria between 1958 and 62. Military career In 1962, Idiagbon joined the Nigerian Army by enrolling in the Nigerian Military Training College (NMTC). In February 1964, the college was renamed the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). From 1962 to 1965, Idiagbon attended the Pakistan Military Academy, Kakul (PMA Kakul), Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in economics. Upon arrival to Nigeria from Pakistan he was commissioned second lieutenant in April 1965. He was company commander, 4th Battalion from August 1965 to February 1966. In 1966 he studied for the junior commander course at the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna. From 1966 to 1967 he also served as an intelligence officer, 4th Battalion and General Staff Officer, 3rd Intelligence, 1st Sector. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1966. He fought in the Nigerian Civil War and was made commanding officer, 20 Battalion from October 1967 to February 1968. In 1968, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He was the commanding officer, 125 Battalion, from 1968 to 1970 - a dreaded fighting unit. In 1970, he was promoted to the rank of major. He was made brigade major and deputy commander, 33 Brigade from March 1970 to March 1971 and the commander, 29 Brigade from March 1971 to December 1972. In January 1973 he served as the general staff officer, Grade 1 and later, principal staff officer (PSO), Supreme Military Headquarters. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1974. He was made brigade commander, 31 and 15 Brigades from August 1975 to August 1978. In 1976, Idiagbon proceeded to the Command and Staff College in Quetta, Pakistan, for further military training. In July 1978 he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He was appointed as the director of manpower (manning) and planning, Army Headquarters in October 1979. In May 1980 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. In 1981, he attended the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos, Plateau state, Nigeria and in 1982 he attended the International Defence Management Course, Naval Postgraduate School, US. He was the military secretary of the Nigerian Army from 1981 to 1983. Military administrator of Borno State From August 1978 to October 1979, the military Head of State, General Obasanjo appointed Idiagbon as the military administrator (position now called governor) of Borno State, Nigeria. Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters General Muhammadu Buhari made Idiagbon his second-in-command as Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters from 31 December 1983 to 27 August 1985. Described as a thorough military man, he played a key role as the hallmark of Buhari's military government. Idiagbon was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1985. He controlled all visible instruments of national, political, governmental and administrative powers. Idiagbon was responsible for introducing, announcing and implementing many of the government's major policies, they include: War Against Indiscipline The five phases of the War Against Indiscipline which Idiagbon announced and implemented were: * Phase One - Queuing, launched on 20 March 1984 * Phase Two - Work Ethics, launched on 1 May 1984 * Phase Three - Nationalism and Patriotism, launched on 21 August 1984 * Phase Four - Anti-Corruption and Economic Sabotage, launched on 14 May 1985 * Phase Five - Environmental Sanitation, launched on 29 July 1985 Currency change and currency exchange rate policy In April 1984, Idiagbon announced the introduction of a new currency for Nigeria. He said the new currency would keep the same name, but the colors of bills would be different. He also announced limits to currency exchange for corporations and individuals. The individual limit was $7,000. He said any corporation or individual exchanging in excess of the limit had to explain where the money came from and needed government clearance. According to Idiagbon the major cause of the nation's economic problems 'is the deliberate sabotage of the Nigerian currency through large-scale illegal trafficking of the currency'. Import substitution industrialisation policy In 1984, Idiagbon implemented the military government's import substitution industrialisation policy based on the use of local materials. Importation was tightened. The aim was to ensure the growth of local industries through the policy. Go Back to Land Programme Also in 1984, Idiagbon spearheaded and implemented the Go Back to Land Programme which was part of the government's farming policy that encouraged massive agricultural food production and was also part of the military government's poverty alleviation strategy. Foreign policy From January 1984 to August 1985, Idiagbon took control of all foreign policy matters that involved security. He was in control of the border closure, expulsion of illegal immigrants, and damage control after the Umaru Dikko Affair in Britain. He also participated in diplomatic activities. On behalf of Nigeria's military government, he signed credit line and educational cooperation agreements with a visiting Bulgarian delegation led by Prime Minister Grisha Filipov in 1984. He led a delegation in 1984 to the Soviet Union to meet Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko. 1985 military coup d'état After 20 months in power, the military government of Buhari was overthrown by Ibrahim Babangida on 27 August 1985. Idiagbon was removed from his position as chief of staff, Supreme Headquarters, and he was placed under house arrest for three years, after his release he retired to his hometown Ilorin and lived in relative obscurity . Personal life On 6 March 1970, Idiagbon married Biodun Idiagbon (née Gamra). They had two sons and three daughters together: Adekunle, Junior, Ronke, Mope and Bola. On 24 March 1999, Idiagbon died under very suspicious circumstances. Awards Major-General Idiagbon (Rtd.) received several awards and medals.

Schwarzenberg has an area of 25.76 km². It lies south of Lake Constance. The village center is heritage-protected for its traditional rustic wooden houses. Population According to the last count in September 2011, the municipality has 1810 inhabitants.  Economy  The main sources of income in Schwarzenberg are crafts, tourism and agriculture. In addition to a dozen larger companies, there are also around 100 small and micro companies. Every year, about 50,000 guests spend the night in Schwarzenberg, around 55% of them during the summer months. The municipality of Schwarzenberg offers many opportunities for recreation in nature, offering the Schwarzenberg-Bödele ski area, cross- country trails, and around 40 km of winter and summer hiking trails. Women’s World Cup downhill competitions were also held in Schwarzenberg. Livestock farming is of great importance. A farmers’ livestock association was founded back in 1894, and today there are around 45 farms, with a total of 700 cows; sheep and goats are also kept. The Alpine Transhumance (mountain meadow culture) is still very well preserved there: About 650 cows are \\"alped\\" annually, which means they are sent to the higher mountain pastures in the spring/summer and brought back down into the lower regions in the autumn/winter months. Personalities *The famous artist Angelica Kauffman (1741-1807) grew up in Schwarzenberg. Culture = Points of interest = The Angelika Kauffmann Museum displays oil paintings, porcelain, souvenirs and letters from Angelika Kauffmann's father in Schwarzenberg. This local museum also offers a broad overview of Bregenzerwälder living culture in the 18th century. Almabtrieb in Schwarzenberg The Schwarzenberg parish church is considered to be one of the most beautiful Baroque buildings in Vorarlberg. The church has paintings by Angelika Kauffmann and her father. Schwarzenberg is part of the Bregenzerwald Umgang (literally \\"Bregenzerwald Walking Tour\\"). This walking tour offers insights into the architecture and community planning of 12 traditional villages in the Bregenzerwald. While walking over various landscapes, visiting public buildings, homes and everyday objects, walkers gain a comprehensive overview of typical Bregenzerwald architectural styles as they developed throughout the ages. The Angelika Kauffmann Hall in Schwarzenberg is of particular importance. The hall was rebuilt in 2001 and has been used for musical events ever since. Because of its excellent acoustics, the auditorium was even named one of the three best chamber music venues in the world. The Käsestraße Bregenzerwald is a joint venture between farmers, milk farmers, artisans, gastronomers, and various companies in the Bregenz Forest. The members and partners contribute to the maintenance of small-scale agriculture and mountain pasture culture, the diversity of local products, and the cheese culture in Vorarlberg. Farmers in Schwarzenberg also take part in this initiative and sell cheese in farm shops, many offering tourists tours of their cheese production facilities. = Events = alt=The Schubertiade Schwarzenberg takes place every year in the summer. It is a world-famous lied- and chamber-music festival, which focuses on compositions that are usually not played at larger concerts, and which mostly have been composed by Austrian composer Franz Schubert. Performances in the past have included artists like Alfred Brendel, Emerson String Quartet, Michael Schade, Robert Holl, Angelika Kirchschlager, and Thomas Quasthoff. The Schwarzenberger Markt takes place in mid-September each year. The market has grown over time, evolving from a simple village food market into a traditional social highlight in the Bregenz Forest. The Schwarzenberger Alptag takes place annually in the week before the Schwarzenberg Markt. Around 700 festively decorated cows and sheep are returned to the valley after the summer on the mountain pastures (see Alpine Transhumance). This so-called \\"Almabtrieb\\" is a 400-year-old tradition in Schwarzenberg.

As part of a food safety testing process, substantial equivalence is the initial step, establishing toxicological and nutritional differences in the new food compared to a conventional counterpart—differences are analyzed and evaluated, and further testing may be conducted, leading to a final safety assessment. Substantial equivalence is the underlying principle in GM food safety assessment for a number of national and international agencies, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization. () (Page archive) Origin The concept of comparing genetically modified foods to traditional foods as a basis for safety assessment was first introduced as a recommendation during the 1990 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on biotechnology and food safety (a scientific conference of officials and industry), although the term substantial equivalence was not used. \\"Joint FAO/WHO Consultation on the Assessment of Biotechnology in Food Production and Processing as Related to Food Safety\\" (1990) \\"When molecular, microbial, genetic and chemical data establish that the food or food ingredient is sufficiently similar to its conventional counterpart, only minimal toxicological testing will generally be required.\\" - Section 6.3.1, \\"Strategies for Assessing the Safety of Foods Produced by Biotechnology\\", report of a Joint FAO/WHO Consultation, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1991 Adopting the term, substantial equivalence was formulated as a food safety policy by the OECD, first described in their 1993 report, \\"Safety Evaluation of Foods Derived by Modern Biotechnology: Concepts and Principles. The term was borrowed from the FDA's 1976 substantial equivalence definition for new medical devices—under Premarket Notification 510(k), a new Class II device that is essentially similar to an existing device can be cleared for release without further testing. \\"A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device ... that is not subject to PMS [Premarket Approval]. Submitters must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalency claims.\\" The underlying approach of comparing a new product or technique to an existing one has long been used in various fields of science and technology. Description The OECD bases the substantial equivalence principle on a definition of food safety where we can assume that a food is safe for consumption if it has been eaten over time without evident harm. It recognizes that traditional foods may naturally contain toxic components (usually called antinutrients)—such as the glycoalkaloids solanine in potatoes and alpha-tomatine in tomatoes—which do not affect their safety when prepared and eaten in traditional ways.Substantial equivalence of antinutrients and inherent plant toxins in genetically modified novel foods, Novak, W. K.; Haslberger, A. G.,Food and Chemical Toxicology Volume 38 (6) p.473-483, 2000Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Report of the Task Force for the Safety of Novel Foods and Feeds C(2000)86/ADD1. May 17, 2000 () The report proposes that, while biotechnology broadens the scope of food modification, it does not inherently introduce additional risk, and therefore, GM products may be assessed in the same way as conventionally bred products. Further, the relative precision of biotech methods should allow assessment to be focused on the most likely problem areas. The concept of substantial equivalence is then described as a comparison between a GM food and a similar conventional food, taking into account food processing, and how the food is normally consumed, including quantity, dietary patterns, and the characteristics of the consumer population. Assessment process Substantial equivalence is the starting point for GM food safety assessment. It can be applied at different points in the food chain, from unprocessed harvested crop to final ingredient or product, depending on the nature of the product and its intended use. For a GM plant, the overall evaluation process may be viewed in four phases: () #Substantial equivalence analysis Considering introduced genes, newly expressed proteins, and new secondary metabolites #Toxicological and nutritional analysis of detected differences Gene transfer, allergenicity, degradation characteristics, bioavailability, toxicity, and estimated intake levels #Toxicological and nutritional evaluation If necessary, additional toxicity testing, possibly including whole foods (return to Phase 2). #Final safety assessment of GM plant Technological developments There has been discussion about applying new biochemical concepts and methods in evaluating substantial equivalence, such as metabolic profiling and protein profiling. These concepts refer, respectively, to the complete measured biochemical spectrum (total fingerprint) of compounds (metabolites) or of proteins present in a food or crop. The goal would be to compare overall the biochemical profile of a new food to an existing food to see if the new food's profile falls within the range of natural variation already exhibited by the profile of existing foods or crops. However, these techniques are not considered sufficiently evaluated, and standards have not yet been developed, to apply them. Adoption Approaches to GM food regulation vary by country, while substantial equivalence is generally the underlying principle of GM food safety assessment. This is the case for national and international agencies that include the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization. In 1997, the European Union established a novel food assessment procedure whereby, once the producer has confirmed substantial equivalence with an existing food, government notification, with accompanying scientific evidence, is the only requirement for commercial release, however, foods containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are excluded and require mandatory authorization. To establish substantial equivalence, the modified product is tested by the manufacturer for unexpected changes to a targeted set of components such as toxins, nutrients, or allergens, that are present in a similar unmodified food. The manufacturer's data is then assessed by a regulatory agency. If regulators determine that there is no significant difference between the modified and unmodified products, then there will generally be no further requirement for food safety testing. However, if the product has no natural equivalent, or shows significant differences from the unmodified food, or for other reasons that regulators may have (for instance, if a gene produces a protein that has not been a food component before), further safety testing may be required. Issues There have been criticisms of the effectiveness of substantial equivalence.

P. Lovecraft's Re-Animator) is a 1985 American horror comedy film loosely based on the 1922 H. P. Lovecraft serial novelette \\"Herbert West–Reanimator\\".Stephen Jones. The Essential Monster Movie Guide. Billboard Books. 2000. Pg. 313 Directed by Stuart Gordon and produced by Brian Yuzna, the film stars Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, a medical student who has invented a reagent which can re-animate deceased bodies. He and his classmate Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) begin to test the serum on dead human bodies, and conflict with Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale), who is infatuated with Cain's fiancée (Barbara Crampton) and wants to claim the invention as his own. Originally devised by Gordon as a theatrical stage production and later a half-hour television pilot, the television script was revised to become a feature film. Filmed in Hollywood on an estimated budget of $900,000, the film originally received an X rating, and was later edited to obtain an R rating for video rental stores. It is the first film in the Re-Animator film series, having been followed by Bride of Re-Animator in 1990 and Beyond Re-Animator in 2003. Released to mostly positive reviews, Re-Animator has since been considered a cult film. Plot At the University of Zurich Institute of Medicine in Switzerland, Herbert West brings his dead professor, Dr. Hans Gruber, back to life. There are horrific side-effects, however; as West explains, the dosage was too large. When accused of killing Gruber, West counters: \\"I gave him life!\\" West arrives at Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts in order to further his studies as a medical student. He rents a room from fellow medical student Dan Cain and converts the house's basement into his own personal laboratory. West demonstrates his reanimating reagent to Dan by reanimating Dan's dead cat Rufus. Dan's fiancée Megan Halsey, daughter of the medical school's dean, walks in on this experiment and is horrified. Dan tries to tell the dean about West's success in reanimating the dead cat, but the dean does not believe him. When Dan insists, the dean implies that Dan and West have gone mad. Barred from the school, West and Dan sneak into the morgue to test the reagent on a human subject in an attempt to prove that the reagent works, and thereby salvage their medical careers. The corpse they inject comes back to life, but in a frenetic and violent zombie-like state. Dr. Halsey stumbles upon the scene and is killed by the reanimated corpse, which West then kills with a bone-saw. Excited at the prospect of working with a freshly dead specimen, West injects Dr. Halsey's body with his reanimating reagent. Dr. Halsey returns to life, also in a zombie-like state. Megan chances upon the scene, and is hysterical. Dan collapses in shock. Dr. Halsey's colleague Dr. Carl Hill, a professor and researcher at the hospital, takes charge of Dr. Halsey, whom he puts in a padded observation cell adjacent to his office. He carries out a surgical operation on him, lobotomizing him. During the course of this operation, he discovers that Dr. Halsey is not sick, but dead and reanimated. Dr. Hill goes to West's basement lab and attempts to blackmail him into surrendering his reagent and notes, hoping to take credit for West's discovery. West offers to demonstrate the reagent and puts a few drops of it onto a microscope slide with dead cat tissue. As Dr. Hill peers through the microscope at this slide, West clobbers him from behind with a shovel, and then decapitates him with it. West then reanimates Dr. Hill's head and body separately. While West is questioning Dr. Hill's head and taking notes, Dr. Hill's body sneaks up behind him and knocks him unconscious. The body carries the head back to Dr. Hill's office, with West's reagent and notes. In his re-animated state, Dr. Hill acquires the ability to control other re-animated corpses telepathically, after conducting brain surgery on them. He then directs Dr. Halsey to snatch Megan away from Dan. While being carried to the morgue by her reanimated father, Megan faints. When she arrives, Dr. Hill strips her naked and straps her unconscious body to a table. She regains consciousness as Hill's body and bloody, severed head begin to sexually assault her. Hill's body starts to place his head between Megan's legs, but is interrupted by the arrival of West and Dan. West distracts Dr. Hill while Dan frees Megan. Dr. Hill reveals that he has reanimated and lobotomized several corpses from the morgue, rendering them susceptible to mind control as Halsey is. However, Megan's voice reawakens a protectiveness in her father, who fights off the other corpses as Dan and Megan escape. In the ensuing chaos, West injects Dr. Hill's body with a lethal overdose of the reagent. Dr. Hill's body mutates rapidly and attacks West, who screams out to Dan to save his work before being pulled away by Dr. Hill's monstrous entrails. Dan retrieves the satchel containing West's reagent and notes. As Dan and Megan flee the morgue, one of the reanimated corpses attacks and strangles Megan. Dan takes her to the hospital emergency room and tries to revive her, but she is dead. In despair, he injects her with West's reagent. After the scene fades to black, Megan, apparently revived, can be heard screaming.

He felt that there were too many Dracula films and expressed a desire to see a Frankenstein film. Someone asked if he had read \\"Herbert West–Reanimator\\" by H. P. Lovecraft. Gordon had read most of the author's works, but not that story, which was long out of print. He went to the Chicago Public Library and read their copy. Originally, Gordon was going to adapt Lovecraft's story for the stage, but eventually decided along with writers Dennis Paoli and William Norris to make it as a half-hour television pilot. The story was set around the turn of the century, and they soon realized that it would be too expensive to recreate. They updated it to the present day in Chicago with the intention of using actors from the Organic Theater company. They were told that the half hour format was not salable and so they made it an hour, writing 13 episodes. Special effects technician Bob Greenberg, who had worked on John Carpenter's Dark Star, repeatedly told Gordon that the only market for horror was in feature films, and introduced him to producer Brian Yuzna. Gordon showed Yuzna the script for the pilot and the 12 additional episodes. The producer liked what he read and convinced Gordon to shoot the film in Hollywood, because of all the special effects involved. Yuzna made a distribution deal with Charles Band's Empire Pictures in return for post- production services. Yuzna described the film as having the \\"sort of shock sensibility of an Evil Dead with the production values of, hopefully, The Howling.\\" John Naulin worked on the film's gruesome makeup effects, using what he described as \\"disgusting shots brought out from the Cook County morgue of all kinds of different lividities and different corpses.\\"Fischer 1985, p. 45. He and Gordon also used a book of forensic pathology in order to present how a corpse looks once the blood settles in the body, creating a variety of odd skin tones. Naulin said that Re-Animator was the bloodiest film he had ever worked on. In the past, he had never used more than two gallons of blood on a film; on Re-Animator, he used 24 gallons. The biggest makeup challenge in the film was the headless Dr. Hill zombie. Tony Doublin designed the mechanical effects and was faced with the problem of proportion once the 9-10 inches of the head were removed from the body. Each scene forced him to use a different technique. For example, one technique involved building an upper torso that actor David Gale could bend over and stick his head through so that it appeared to be the one that the walking corpse was carrying around. Soundtrack The score for the film was composed by Richard Band, and has been noted for its similarities to Bernard Herrmann's score for Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. The score took about three and a half weeks to complete, and was recorded in Italy with the Rome Philharmonic. In regards to the influence of Herrmann's Psycho score, Band has noted that the similarities were intentional, and that he \\"used that as a base and modified the theme but kept that Herrmannesque feeling.\\" The film soundtrack was released by Waxwork Records on vinyl and includes liner notes by composer Richard Band and director Stuart Gordon, with album artwork by Gary Pullin. Release Re- Animator was released on October 18, 1985, in 129 theaters, and grossed $543,728 during its opening weekend. It went on to make $2,023,414 in North America, above its estimated $900,000 budget. The film was re-released with a premiere on May 21, 2010, as part of Creation Entertainment's Weekends of Horror. =Home video= The film was originally released on VHS, LaserDisc and Betamax by Vestron Video, and was later released on DVD by Elite Entertainment on April 30, 2002 in two versions: a standard DVD edition, and a \\"Millennium Edition\\" featuring a remastered picture and two commentary tracks, one by writer/director Stuart Gordon and the other by the entire main cast except for David Gale, who died in 1991. =R-rated version= When Re- Animator was originally released on videotape, two versions were available: the unrated theatrical cut and an edited R-rated version, for those video stores whose rental policies would not allow them to rent unrated films that would be considered films with an MPAA rating of X. In the R-rated version, much of the gore was edited out and replaced with various scenes which had been deleted for pacing purposes, including a subplot involving Dr. Hill hypnotizing several of the characters to make them more suggestible to his will (in this version, Dean Halsey is hypnotized early on to turn him against West, and then later is hypnotized again after he has been re-animated; in the theatrical film, the re-animated Halsey's submission is merely a result of the lobotomy). In addition, a short scene was added showing Herbert West injecting himself with small amounts of the reagent to stay awake and energized; this may have affected his thinking over the course of the film. Director Stuart Gordon has expressed his preference for the unrated version over the R-rated version. =Integral cut= A 2013 German Blu-ray release of Re-Animator also included a new \\"Integral cut,\\" wherein the extra material from the R-rated version was incorporated into the unrated version, expanding the film from 86 minutes to just under 105 minutes. This extended cut has also been included with other non-US releases. Reception The film was well received by critics, earning mostly positive reviews. Pauline Kael enjoyed the film's \\"indigenous American junkiness\\" and called it \\"pop Buñuel; the jokes hit you in a subterranean comic zone that the surrealists' pranks sometimes reached, but without the surrealists' self-consciousness (and art-consciousness).\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \\"I walked out somewhat surprised and reinvigorated (if not re-animated) by a movie that had the audience emitting taxi whistles and wild goat cries.\\" In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, \\"Re-Animator has a fast pace and a good deal of grisly vitality. It even has a sense of humor, albeit one that would be lost on 99.9 percent of any ordinary moviegoing crowd\\". Paul Attanasio, in his review for The Washington Post, praised Jeffrey Combs' performance: \\"Beady-eyed, his face hard, almost lacquered, Combs makes West into a brittle, slightly fey psychotic in the Anthony Perkins mold. West is a figure of fun, but Combs doesn't spoof him.\\" In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas wrote, \\"The big noise is Combs, a small, compact man of terrific intensity and concentration.\\" David Edelstein, writing for Village Voice, placed the film in his year-end Top Ten Movies list. In their book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: \\"Re-Animator took First Prize at the Paris Festival of Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Horror, a Special Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and even spawned a short-lived series of comic books. Even though it was a hit with audiences, the film generated a huge amount of controversy among Lovecraft readers. Fans thought the film a desecration of Lovecraft; their literary hero would never write such obvious exploitation! But the final criticism of the film might have been a bit more muted if these fans had actually read the \\"West\\" stories, which are pure exploitation. Lovecraft himself acknowledged as much, and female love interest and black sex humor aside, Re-Animator really is one of the more faithful and effective adaptations.\\" Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 59 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 93%, with an average rating of 7.81/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Perfectly mixing humor and horror, the only thing more effective than Re-Animators gory scares are its dry, deadpan jokes.\\" Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #32 on their list of \\"The Top 50 Cult Films,\\" and #14 on their \\"The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83\\" list. Legacy Re-Animator was followed by Bride of Re- Animator in 1990 and Beyond Re-Animator in 2003. Re-Animator director Stuart Gordon directed another film based on an H. P. Lovecraft story, From Beyond (1986); though it featured a story unrelated to Re-Animator, it also starred both Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. In the book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, producer-director Brian Yuzna mentions an idea that he had for a fourth Re-Animator. This version would have been titled Island of Re-Animator, and would have been strongly influenced by the H. G. Wells novel The Island of Doctor Moreau. In the 1999 film American Beauty, Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley's characters Lester Burnham and Ricky Fitts make mention of the film. While both are high on marijuana, Lester asks Ricky, \\"Did you ever see that movie where the body is walking around carrying its own head and then the head goes down on that babe?\\" They both laugh and Ricky replies, \\"Re-Animator.\\" In 2011, a musical adaptation opened in New York, which director Gordon participated in. The character of Herbert West starred in a number of comic book adaptations by different companies, such as Adventure Comics (Re-Animator in Full Color and Re-Animator: Dawn of the Re- Animator), Zenescope Entertainment (The Chronicles of Dr. Herbert West), and Dynamite Entertainment (Re-Animator). West also appeared in Devil's Due Publishing's Hack/Slash series as a side character, and in three crossover comics by Dynamite Entertainment: Army of Darkness vs. Re-Animator, Army of Darkness/Re-Animator, in which Ash Williams of the Evil Dead series confronts West of the Re-Animator series. and Vampirella vs. Re-Animator.

P. Lovecraft for his short story \\"Herbert West--Reanimator\\", first published in 1922. There have been several film adaptations of the story including Herbert West as played by Jeffrey Combs in the Re-Animator (film series) which include the 1985 Re- Animator film and its two sequels, Bride of Re-Animator and Beyond Re- Animator. Herbert West is the inventor of a special solution that when injected into a main artery of a recently deceased person causes the body's mechanical, living functions to return. However, most subjects that have undergone the \\"re-animation\\" process have turned violent and, after failed attempts to return to their own graves, have terrorized the communities into which they were reanimated. In Lovecraft's tale, Herbert West was ostracized by his fellow medical students because he believed he could overcome death and had only one friend: the unnamed narrator of the story. Re-Animator films Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West in Bride of Re-Animator. The character of Herbert West returned to popular media in the Stuart Gordon film Re-Animator and its sequels, starring Jeffrey Combs as Dr. West. These films transplant the character into the modern day (1980s-2000s) rather than the Prohibition era and changes his hair from Lovecraft's specified blond to brown, but otherwise the character remains unchanged. The film is also set over a fairly short period of time where West and Cain are still medical students, whereas the short story played out over the span of decades from the years of medical students, practising doctors, war-time physicians and eventually retirement. In the first two films the equivalent of West's nameless companion is Dr. Daniel Cain, played by Bruce Abbott, who finds himself embroiled in West's experiments. Other appearances =Comics= * Adventure Comics, an imprint of Malibu Comics, published two series related to the films starting in 1991. First was a three-issue comic-book adaptation of the first film, scripted by Steven Philip Jones and drawn by Christopher Jones. It was followed by an original four-issue prequel titled Re-Animator: Dawn of the Re-Animator, written by Bill Spangler. In 2017 Arrow Video included reprints of these comics in their Blu-ray DVD collections of the two films. * Dynamite Entertainment first featured West in the 2005 four-issue series Army of Darkness vs. Re-Animator, where he faces off against Ash Williams, hero of the Evil Dead film series. There was also a Re-Animator #0 prequel. In 2013, West again joined Williams in the one-shot Army of Darkness/Re-Animator. West was then featured in his own 2014 four-issue series, simply called Reanimator, that picked up after the one-shot left off. * Herbert West is the doctor that Mayor Harvey Dent sees in the Batman Elseworlds comic book miniseries, The Doom That Came To Gotham. * Herbert West makes a guest appearance in the Devil's Due Publishing series Hack/Slash (#15-17) in a crossover called \\"Hack/Slash vs. Re-Animator\\" where the father of the main heroine, Cassie Hack, is an assistant to Herbert. During one of his experiments, he reanimates her mother, the Lunch Lady, who almost starts a killing spree. However, with Cassie's help, he destroys and eventually disappears from Cassie and Vlad's sight. It is hinted that the government is now interested in his work. * West is a main character in the Zenescope Entertainment comic Chronicles of Doctor Herbert West, essentially a modern retelling of the Lovecraftian novel in which the hidden narrator is now Megan, who is his lover and girlfriend while in his college years, and his obsession with death is now explained as the byproduct of a childhood trauma: while going to church with his devout family, he saw his mother and sister run over by a bus. He renounces the idea of an immortal soul reaching a heavenly afterlife, swearing that he will find a way to bring back his loved ones.

The strip was created by writer Pat Mills and illustrator Enio. It debuted in the first issue of 2000 AD, which was published in February 1977, and ran nearly continuously until issue 64, dated 13 May 1978. Development Pat Mills has said the idea was a deliberate ripoff of The Six Million Dollar Man after kids said they wanted to see that in a comic, and the concept of a computer brain as a partner was taken by John Wagner from Marvel Comics' Deathlok.Thrill-Powered Overload! page 13 The name came from Doug Church while Mills, according to Church, came up with the acronym on the spot.Thrill- Powered Overload! page 14 Premise Initially, M.A.C.H. 1 (\\"M.A.C.H.\\" stands for \\"Man Activated by Compu-puncture Hyperpower\\") thematically resembled the Six Million Dollar Man, but with more graphic violence. As the strip continued the tone became increasingly dark. This contrasted directly with The Six Million Dollar Man, who began as a killer, but was progressively softened by the TV networks until it fitted into family entertainment. =Plot= John Probe is a British Secret Service agent at first engaging in missions against Communists, terrorists and organised crime. He has been given extreme physical enhancement by a method known as \\"compu-puncture\\" to give him \\"hyperpower\\" equivalent to the strength of fifty men, and computer circuitry imprinted onto his skull to control and advise on use of the hyperpower. The computer also grants him occasional mental skills, such as how to pilot aeroplanes, drive an armoured car, or specific scientific and military knowledge he would not normally possess. Probe eventually discovers that his superior, Denis Sharpe, had engineered the compu-puncture treatment which had given him his abilities so as to erase Probe's pre-augmented memory and to cause his death if he did not receive frequent treatments. As a result, Probe was forced to work for Sharpe. Probe attempted to leave Sharpe and the service several times, but was forced to return for controlling hyperpower injections to prevent his energy flow from falling below survival level - although one story suggests that he has left Sharpe for an unspecified but considerable length of time. Probe's computer would often attempt to overrule or counter his human emotions, but as the story wore on Probe became more and more resentful to both the computer and Sharpe's orders, often disobeying the computer's advice completely. Eventually, M.A.C.H. 1 killed Sharpe and then sacrificed himself to enable aliens, provoked into attacking Earth by Sharpe, to return home. Probe's life before his compu-puncture treatment was never clarified or explained, and it was stated several times that the only person who knew anything about his prior life was Sharpe himself. Characters * John Probe: A British Secret Service agent who volunteered for a special procedure whereby his physical strength, speed and agility would be enhanced using 'compu-puncture', a computerized form of acupuncture using multiple 'electro-needles'. His metabolism was controlled by a computer implanted in his skull, which also fed him tactical information such as the amount of strength or the exact throwing angle required for a given task. * M.A.C.H. Zero: M.A.C.H. 1 later met M.A.C.H. Zero, a prototype agent who had not been equipped with a computer implant and had consequently been driven insane by the uncontrolled hyperpower. M.A.C.H. Zero later appeared in his own strip, involving a search for his son Tommy, based on a case of mistaken identity * Tanya Maski, an East European M.A.C.H. agent created after Sharpe sold the compu-puncture techniques to the Soviets. Maski had been created using inferior technology and although she possessed similar hyperpower to M.A.C.H. 1 would burn out much sooner. Aware of this, she sacrificed herself to allow M.A.C.H. 1 to escape and confront Sharpe over his involvement. * M.A.C.H. 2 a robot successor to M.A.C.H. 1, created by Sharpe in order to remove the human element and perceived limitations from the M.A.C.H. project. M.A.C.H. 1 fought M.A.C.H. 2, and was beaten, but managed to severely damage M.A.C.H. 2 during the fight. Sharpe prevented M.A.C.H. 2 from killing M.A.C.H. 1, recognising that the human element - which was what enabled M.A.C.H. 1 to damage M.A.C.H. 2 - may still have use. Publications Both M.A.C.H. 1 and M.A.C.H. Zero appeared in their own eponymous series.
