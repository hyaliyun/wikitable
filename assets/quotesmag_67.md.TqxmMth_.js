The symptoms were wilting and dying flax plants during the growing season. The site is located near Centennial Avenue and 18th Street North. Flax was first planted at the site in 1894 by Professor Henry L. Bolley, a noted researcher in flax botany. By 1900, the flax plants were dead or dying. Bolley identified flax pathogens introduced by the plants themselves as the cause, and further identified resistant plants.

Its stated mission is to \\"protect and promote human dignity based on the anthropological truth that man is born in the image and likeness of God.\\"  History  The institute was founded by British Benjamin Harnwell while working as an aide to Conservative Party MEP Nirj Deva, who would also become involved with the group. According to Harnwell, the motivation behind the establishment of the DHI came about when Italian politician Rocco Buttiglione was vetoed for the position of the European Commission's Vice-President and Commissioner for Justice, Freedom, and Security. Buttiglione, who was nominated to the European Commission by then-Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, described homosexuality as a sin and said the principal role of women was to have children.\\" The Institute operated from Rome between 2011 to 2019. In 2019, the DHI moved from Rome to the Abbey of Trisulti, a former monastery in Collepardo, Frosinone. From July 2010 to January 2019, Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino, former President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, held the position of Honorary President. In 2019, Cardinal Martino was succeeded by Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who had been on the DHI Board of Advisors since 2013. Burke is known as a sharp critic of Pope Francis, criticizing him for being too lenient towards homosexuality and abortion. DHI founder Benjamin Harnwell was the first Chairman of the Institute. In 2013, he was succeeded by Luca Volontè. The group has ties to some of the most conservative factions inside the Catholic Church. In 2014, the Institute invited Steve Bannon as one of its key note speakers at a conference to discuss poverty, during which he praised European far-right parties. In 2019, Reuters reported that Bannon had helped the institute to craft curricula. Cardinal Raymond Burke, president of the Institute’s board of advisers, said that Bannon would play a leading role in the institute. Bannon said that he hoped to spur a populist movement in Europe. A plan was backed by Bannon to turn the Abbey of Trisulti into an academy for training future European nationalists and populist politicians. The rights to use the facility were revoked by the Italian government at the end of May 2019 as bills were not paid. On 26 May 2020, an Italian regional court ruled in favor of the institute's plan. In a letter sent on Cardinal Burke's Twitter account on 25 June 2019 he announced his \\"termination of any relationship with the Dignitas Humanae Institute.\\"  References   External links  * * Universal Declaration of Human Dignity * H.E.

Towards the start of the Napoleonic Wars several towers received additional reinforcement in the form of batteries at their bases. Today, 12 towers still survive, three having been destroyed at different times. Two of the survivors, Petit Bôt and Rousse, contain interpretive exhibits that the public may examine. Petit Bôt tower seen from above History In 1778, General Henry Seymour Conway, Governor of Jersey, recommended that 30 towers (see Jersey Round Tower) be built there to impede a possible French incursion. As it happened, almost all the towers were built after the Battle of Jersey in 1781. However, in July 1778, the British government also authorized the building of 15 towers on Guernsey. These towers were designed to accommodate only muskets (i.e., there was no provision for artillery); though there was discussion of giving each tower a Coehorn mortar for the roof platform nothing came of this. Although most of the towers were built on the Commons, or on public land above the high-water mark, three towers were to be built on private land. The States were of the opinion that the project was of such importance that if necessary they would exercise eminent domain, \\"...notwithstanding any Clameur de haro or any opposition whatsoever...\\". Manning the towers was the responsibility of the Royal Guernsey Militia. This force of 4-5,000 men consisted of a field artillery regiment and four infantry regiments. Service in the militia was compulsory and unpaid. The men took turns manning the towers and other fortifications assigned to each regiment. A report of 1787 pointed out the towers' limitations. As a result, at the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, and during General Sir John Doyle's tenure as Lieutenant Governor (1803-1816), a number of the towers received supporting batteries, either at their base, or nearby. Also, in 1803, the towers had their roofs strengthened and they received 12-pounder carronades as additional armament. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II, the Germans modified some towers to their purposes, generally by replacing some of the loopholes with machine-gun slits. The Petit Bôt Tower provided one example; however, its recent restoration returned it to its pre-World War II form. Design and construction L'Ancresse Loophole Tower no. 6 The towers were all built to one design. They all had three floors, the two above the ground floor having loopholes that would permit musket fire to cover all approaches to the tower. Captain Frederick Bassett, RE, the Commanding Engineer in the Channel Islands, oversaw the towers' construction. They were to be built to the design of the Jersey round towers, but in fact deviated in a number of ways. They had a batter (slope) at the base, and were slenderer than the Jersey towers. The Jersey towers also later received machicolations, which are absent from the Guernsey loophole towers. =Dimensions= The towers are 30 ft (9m) feet tall, and have an external diameter of 20 ft (6m) and an internal diameter of just over 12 ft (3.7m). They have a batter to the walls to the first floor, and then rise straight up from there. =Material= The towers were built of Guernsey granites. Tower #1, at Houge à la Perre Battery, on Belle Greve Bay, St Peter Port, was built of St Peter Port gabbro. All the others were built of local granites, with Vazon being built of Cobo Granite (Adamellite). The towers The battery at Rousse tower The towers are numbered sequentially, in a counter-clockwise direction from St Peter Port. # - Hougue à la Perre Tower and battery, St Sampson. Destroyed 2 July 1905 for a tram shed and road widening. A German bunker now occupies the site. # - Hougue à la Perre Tower (Belle Greve), Saint Sampson. Destroyed in 1958 for States flats. # - Mont Crevelt Tower and battery, St Sampson. # - By Fort Le Marchant, Vale. # - L’Ancresse Bay, Nid de l'Herbe, Vale. # - L’Ancresse Common, Vale. The Common now holds a golf course, on which the tower stands. # - L'Ancresse Common, Vale, on the golf course. # - L'Ancresse Common, Vale, on the golf course. Destroyed by the Germans during World War II. # - Bay de la Jaonneuse, Vale. The tower now has a slight lean. # - Chouet, Vale. The Chouet and Rousse towers stand on the headlands that cover the entrance to Grand Havre Bay. Up until the early 19th Century, the bay led to the Braye du Valle, a saltwater channel that extended to St Sampson's Harbour, and that made the northern extremity of Guernsey, Le Clos du Valle, a tidal island. # - Rousse Tower and battery, Vale. The battery, of three 24-pounder and two 9-pounder guns, was added in 1804. The tower has three levels and one can climb to the top, which provides a good view along the coast. In the tower, life-size models show how members of the Guernsey militia, and their families, manned the defenses. The nearby magazine has additional displays. # - Vazon Road, Castel. There is a magazine and battery located nearby. The battery would have mounted four 24-pounder guns in 1816. # - Petit Bôt Tower, Forest - The tower was placed at Petit Bot because Petit Bot has a sandy beach, making it one of the few potential landing places on the south coast of the island. The tower was renovated between 2011 and 2012 and the information centre on the ground floor opened in June 2012. # - Saints Bay, St Martin # - Fermain Tower (the \\"Pepper Pot\\") and battery, St Martin. Fermain North Battery and its magazine stand near the tower.

It is her first album to be released in the UK. The album was recorded at Pooka Studio and Kikitépe Tearoom Studio. Three singles were released from the album, \\"White Foxes\\", \\"The Silicone Veil\\" and \\"Among Us\\". The video for \\"Among Us\\" was directed by Evan McNary and was premiered on Vices Noisey. Sundfør chose the video as part of a competition by Genero.tv for fans to make a video for the single. Composition Characterized primarily as electro-folk, The Silicone Veil has also been classified as a mixture of baroque pop, electronic, and art pop. The Daily Telegraph said the album is \\"a flawless distillation of dreamy synth-pop, imposing Scandinavian electronica and showy baroque classicism.\\" The Ontarion wrote, \\"Sundfør displays an extensive vocal range – from high warbling pitches to quietly provocative tones – but it is the presence of a deeply entrancing and eclectic array of unique electronic and orchestra generated sounds which makes this sensory experience truly worthwhile.\\" Sundfør described the songs on The Silicone Veil as being a reflection of \\"apocalypse, death, love and snow.\\" Critical reception The album received critical acclaim from music critics. In his rave review of the album, Daniel Paton of MusicOMH praised Sundfør for not being afraid to explore \\"both her lyrical and musical preoccupations to challenging and sometimes uncomfortable depths,\\" stating that \\"The Silicone Veil is every bit as magisterial and conceptually loaded as her previous album of songs. [...] Selecting examples and highlights can hardly begin to offer an impression of the boldness and confidence of this wonderful album. Sundfør's combination of careful, detailed arrangement and unrepentant magic realism is visionary and enriching.\\" Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler said \\"while her voice feels like the album's main strength on first listen, it doesn't take long to appreciate how good the music is here. The mood is consistent, wistful and pretty, but the sound touches on all sorts of bases,\\" while later hailing the album for being \\"carefully orchestrated, beautiful sung, and imaginatively written.\\" The Line of Best Fit critic Michael James Hall wrote, \\"this is an album of spectral, elemental romance and intrigue, playfully but precisely woven into a tremulous tapestry of seemingly ever-oscillating sound.\\" In 2015, The Ontarion awarded the album their \\"Album of the Week\\" accolade, stating: \\"While the 29 year old Norwegian artist released her fifth studio album Ten Love Songs earlier this year, The Silicone Veil is one album that definitely calls for (repeated) revisiting.\\" The Daily Telegraph included the album in their \\"50 amazing albums you've never heard\\" list in August 2017, calling it Sundfør's finest work to date.

Maya Brush consist of bits and bytes; her name is a composition which refers to the tools with which she was put together: a combination of the software Maya and the ZBrush programme. Maya Brush is the first virtual beauty, an artificial body, oriented at the human beauty ideal, without being created after a personal physical example. As a model she has become the reality of the dream of medial beauty imaginations. Maya Brush represents all the global prefab-girls, the standardized and technically created beauties as propagated by advertising industry and media.

He is one of the national heroes of Namibia. Biography Iipumbu Ya Tshilongo was born in 1873 in Onatshiku, a settlement near Elim, today in the Omusati Region of northern Namibia. An accident as adolescent earned him the nickname Ndilimani (Oshiwambo: dynamite) when an explosion blew three fingers off his left hand. He became the eighteenth king of the Uukwambi in 1907, succeeding king Negumbo lya Kandenge. During his reign he became known to jealously protect the tribal area of the Uukwambi from encroaching white settlers, going as far as having the roads guarded that led into Uukwambi territory. Ya Tshilongo also resisted European cultural influence exercised via the establishment of mission stations and administrative outposts. Having rebuked the Finnish Missionary Society and the South West African Administration for years, he only allowed the Catholic Church to establish a station at Oshikuku in 1924. He ignored the Administration's request to send contract labourers, refused to pay taxes, and was generally uncooperative towards the authorities. Oral history and archival records characterise Ya Tshilongo as a despotic tyrant who ruled with an iron fist. He had many of his subjects flee his influence, including his own daughter, Neekulu ya Shivute. Both his stubbornness towards the authorities and his questionable way to rule led to a decision to topple him. In 1932, troops under Resident Commissioner Hahn attacked the Uukwambi during his absence and had his homestead at Onashiku bombed with military aircraft. Iipumpu Ya Tshilongo was later arrested and forced into exile to Kavango. He returned in 1938 to Amupolo due to illness. Ya Tshilongo died in Oshikuku on 9 September 1959. Recognition Iipumbu Ya Tshilongo is one of nine national heroes of Namibia that were identified at the inauguration of the country's Heroes' Acre near Windhoek. Founding president Sam Nujoma remarked in his inauguration speech on 26 August 2002 that: > Chief Iipumbu ya Tshilongo was a true Namibian nationalist ruler who > rejected the idea to pay taxes to the South Africa colonial authorities and > who refused to cooperate with them. He also did not allow the missionaries > to gain any influence over him or his people. [...] His resistance and > strong nationalistic character inspired many people, even in his absence, to > continue with the anti-colonial struggle. [...] To his revolutionary spirit > and his visionary memory we humbly offer our honor and respect. Ya Tshilongo is honoured in form of a granite tombstone with his name engraved and his portrait plastered onto the slab. His homestead in Onashiku was proclaimed a national monument in 2014. The site has been deproclaimed a few month later.275/2014 – Deproclaimed, NHC, 15 August 2014.

In the Netherlands it is often used for One-Design sailing races. Developed in the 1960s it was made especially for sailing on the so-called randmeren; narrow shallow lakes that surround the newly created Flevopolders. This makes the boat perfect for rough but shallow waters.  Size  The Randmeer is 6.50 meters long and 2.10 meters wide. The hull weighs 500 kilograms. The draft can vary, depending on whether it has a centreboard, between 0.55 and 1.15 meters. The mainsail has a surface area of 11.4 m², the jib has a surface area of 7.7 m². The 'Touring' type has a jib of 5.6 m². In addition it can be sailed with a spinnaker of 19.5 m². All boats are produced at the shipyard in Heeg, Friesland, The Netherlands.  Types  Within the Randmeer class there are three types: the Classic; the Advance; and the Touring. The Classic, as can inferred from the name, is the original design that dates back to 1964. The Classic has a kielmidzwaard, a combination of a not-too-long keel with a retractable centreboard inside it. This means that its draft can vary between 0.55 and 1.15 meters. The most obvious difference between the Classic and the Advance is that the Advance cabin floor is higher. Due to this shallower cabin the Advance is completely self-baling. Moreover, except for the rudder, all wood has disappeared from the design. Similar to the Classic the Advance has a kielmidzwaard. The Touring type is made for recreational use only. The hull is almost the same as the Advance, but it has a fixed keel, with a total draft of 0.75 meters. In addition, this ship has a pierced rudder; i.e. it goes through the hull instead of being hung behind it. This means that the Touring type does not comply with the One-Class design. Van de Stadt also designed a version with a cabin: the Trotter. This has later been developed into the Trotter Pandora, often built in England.

A number of well-known Guyanese artists were taught at the WPAC. Foundation Burrowes started to lead Working People's Free Art Classes in 1945 and formally founded the WPAC organization in 1948. The name drew the attention of the British authorities, who were concerned that the classes might be a front for a communist organization. They sent two detectives to join the class and see what was going on. One of them, Inspector John Campbell, became interested in drawing and painting and continued with the WPAC, later participating in exhibitions. By 1947, there were 86 students enrolled in the free WPAC, which had started in Georgetown in April that year. Operation The WPAC was an institution in which common working people could develop their artistic skills. As well as teaching the people art history and appreciation, the WPAC contributed to developing a national consciousness, an awareness of the country and its peoples. It was funded by businesses and institutions. Burrowes was the only teacher, and gave classes on traditional Western artistic methods to anyone who chose to attend in whatever space he could find. The British Council became interested in the WPAC, and provided help in the form of £50 worth of art materials annually, materials that could not otherwise be obtained in British Guiana, as it was then. The WPAC put on annual shows. In 1954 its exhibition of paintings and sculpture had contributions from the WPAC and from the Guianese Art Group, the Friday Art Club and the Young Contemporaries' Art Club, as well as from one or two individual artists. The WPAC continued until 1956. Influence The WPAC helped a number of Guyanese artists at the start of their career. In 1947 Donald Locke attended a Working People's Art Class taught in Georgetown by Burrowes, which inspired him to take up painting. Locke later contributed regularly to WPAC exhibitions, and became a secretary or assistant to Burrowes in the early 1950s. Stanley Greaves was another Guyanese artist who attended the WPAC as a teenager and later became well known. Emerson Samuels was another artist who studied at the WPAC. The painter Aubrey Williams studied with E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class after returning from a two-year term with the Agriculture department in which he had lived with indigenous people in the jungle.

The lines were a group of mineral and other railways in Fife, Scotland, mainly on the land of the Wemyss family. They were built to connect coal pits to harbours and the railway network, for the use of tenants of the Estate. The Wemyss and Buckhaven Railway was built at the expense of the Wemyss Estate and carried passengers; it was later sold to the North British Railway. When numerous collieries needed a railway connection the Wemyss Estate built a connecting line to Methil Harbour and improved the harbour itself. The local network became known as The Wemyss Private Railway and the Estate's interest was transferred to the Wemyss Coal Company. These terms have been used interchangeably by authors. The collieries were nationalised in 1947 and the sidings connections at the pits followed; the main line railways of Great Britain were nationalised in 1948, but the central section, now known as the Wemyss Private Railway remained in private hands. However the mineral activity in East Fife declined and in 1970 the Wemyss Private Railway closed down. History =The Wemyss Family= The family of Wemyss was \\"unquestionably the oldest on the County\\", tracing its line back to Michael Wemyss, who died in 1165. In 1633 the title of Earl of Wemyss was bestowed, but the heir to the title, David Lord Elcho engaged in the Rebellion of 1745, and was later attainted, and was unable to succeed to the title.John M Leighton, History of the County of Fife, volume 3, Joseph Swan, Glasgow, 1840 A junior branch of the family succeeded, and in 1820 James Erskine Wemyss became the head of the family. He died in 1854, and was succeeded by James Hay Erskine Wemyss. On his death in 1864 his eldest son Randolph Gordon Erskine Wemyss (1858 - 1908) was heir to the lairdship at the age of six. It was in trust until his majority; the Trustees managed the affairs of the Estate, led by his Mother. The Estate comprised very extensive lands in the County of Fife, and coal was mined on estate lands from at the latest the eighteenth century. Randolph Wemyss was possessed of an exceptionally dynamic business mind and developed the mineral extraction; as he did so it emerged that huge quantities of winnable coal lay under the lands of the estate.A W Brotchie, The Wemyss Private Railway, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 1998, =Before railways= Coal had been worked in Fife for many centuries, probably since the thirteenth century. As well as its household use it was extensively used for salt panning; sea water was evaporated by heating to produce salt, an essential commodity, and in the sixteenth century the area around Methil and Wemyss had the most extensive group of salt pans in Fife, all belonging to the Wemyss Estate. Coal and salt were exported, and several primitive waggonways were established to bring the coal to the shore. There many several places on the coast where boats could take on cargo, but it was only in the nineteenth century that harbours were developed. Tubs were hauled on rails within the pits, although they can not be considered railways; notable among these was the inclined plane in the Wemyss no. 7 pit which ran out under the Firth of Forth from West Wemyss, from 1824. It was a single track operated by steam engine and haulage cable; as workings at various levels were served, branches were made at those levels. Because of the gradient of the incline, 29 degrees, ordinary turnout connections were not possible as the trams would tip sideways on the turnout; a form of drawbridge was used to make the connections.D Landale, Description of an Under-dip Coal Working in Prize-Essays and Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, Volume X, William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh, 1835 Before 1856 the Victoria Pit and Barcraig Pit, respectively west and east of the little harbour of West Wemyss, were connected to it by short tramways. It is likely that these were hutch roads, along which the tubs used underground were conveyed, propelled by manpower or horses; they were almost certainly narrow gauge. =First railways= 0-6-0 locomotive No 16 taking water near East Wemyss in 1970.The mineral workings had long been established using shipping when the first railways came to the area, and the railways did not immediately serve the coal workings, concentrating instead on agricultural and industrial centres. The Edinburgh and Northern Railway was authorised in 1845 to build from Burntisland to Perth and Dundee (reached by ferry), and after a name change to the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway (EP&DR;), it opened its line in the years 1847 to 1848, running broadly south to north through Thornton. A line ran westward from Thornton to Dunfermline, also a rich coalfield area, in 1848 - 1849.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, The Leven Railway opened in 1854 connecting Leven with the EP&DR; at Thornton; the Leven Railway saw the long term future as extending to Anstruther and serving the fishing communities. The objective was achieved in 1863 after amalgamation with the East of Fife Railway, the two companies together forming the Leven and East of Fife Railway in 1861. They were absorbed by the North British Railway (NBR) in 1877. The region east of Anstruther remained unconnected for some years until the Anstruther and St Andrews Railway opened its line in 1883 - 1887; together these lines formed the Fife Coast Railway.Andrew Hajducki, Michael Jodeluk and Alan Simpson, The Leven and East of Fife Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2013, The first direct railway connection to serve a colliery was opened at the end of 1868 when the Muiredge branch opened by the Leven and East of Fife Railway; it left the main line at Cameron Bridge and ran south for a little over a mile. The Muiredge Colliery was immediately north of Buckhaven; it was revived by Bowman and Cairns, having earlier been worked by the Wemyss Estate, but the earlier activity had not been profitable and had lapsed. There was a public goods station at Muiredge in addition to the colliery connection. The branch opened shortly before 20 December 1868. The Act of Parliament authorising the branch had included a branch to Methil Harbour, but this was not carried out. It is likely that a mineral siding connection was made to the Pirnie Pit at this time; Pirnie is on the east side of the branch a short distance away. (The pit became called Leven no 3 in November 1877 and North British Railway engines came to the pit and extended sidings there.) Muiredge coal was moved by rail northwards to Cameron Bridge, and there was no satisfactory rail connection to any nearby harbour at the time. There was much demand for transfer to shipping, and Bowman and Cairns decided to construct a direct mineral railway to Methil; they built it from May 1869, running down Muiredge Den and along the foreshore to Methil West Pier. Horse traction on the single line was used at first but a locomotive was employed by 1870. The line was 1 1/4 miles long. In 1872 - 1873 the Hugo pit became productive; it was in high land above West Wemyss, and an inclined tunnel was dug, down which hutches of coal were lowered on a double track rope worked inclined plane, of 25 inches gauge. At the lower end of the tunnel the plane reached the small harbour of West Wemyss, already reached by the Victoria and Barncraig hutch tramways. An enlargement of West Wemyss Harbour was made at this time too, starting in 1872 and completed in September 1873. =Leven Harbour developments= The improvement at West Wemyss was welcome, but it remained a small and inconvenient harbour, and the absence of any modern facility in the area led eventually to the formation of the Leven Harbour Dock and Railway Company by Act of Parliament on 24 July 1876. As well as construction of a wet dock at Leven, the company was to build a five furlong railway from the Leven and East of Fife Railway at Leven station. The construction cost £40,000 and was completed in November 1879. The branch railway was worked by the North British Railway, which by this time had taken over the Leven and East of Fife Railway company. From the outset Leven Harbour suffered from silting and continuous dredging was required, and it was not profitable. =The Wemyss and Buckhaven Railway= The Wemyss Estate Railways in 1881If this move was intended to free the Wemyss Estate coal masters from their constraints it failed, for the North British Railway continued to be the sole haulier for coal from any distance, and Leven Harbour was unsatisfactory, and not easily reached by rail from many of the East Fife pits. Several other small harbours were developed, but this too failed to resolve the problem, and in any case numerous new pits had been opened remote from the existing railway. In May 1874 a Committee of coalmasters discussed building their own line to the developing Methil Dock, a little west of Leven. Nothing came of this discussion at first, but in 1878 a definite scheme was produced to connect Buckhaven with Thornton. Thornton was chosen as the junction because of the convenience of bringing coal from Dunfermline. Matters progressed and on 17 October 1879 a Certificate for the construction of the railway was issued by the Board of Trade; a Parliamentary Act was not required because no compulsory land acquisition was needed and there were no objections to the scheme; nor was a new joint stock company to be established.This arrangement had been enacted by the Railway Construction Facilities Act, 1864. It was to be financed by the Wemyss Estate. The line was a little over four miles long; by the end of 1880 a demonstration goods train was run, but the line was not properly finished, and the Board of Trade inspection took place on 30 July 1881, by Major General Hutchinson. With some qualifications, the line was passed as fit for passenger operation, and it opened formally on 1 August 1881. It was worked by the North British Railway.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, There were intermediate stations at West Wemyss (at the present-day Standing Stane Road) and Wemyys Castle, close to the town of East Wemyss. It had private accommodation for Wemyss and his family. A short branch was made at the end of 1880 or early in 1881 to join the NBR Muiredge branch, and a connection from the new Rosie pit, which ran as a high level siding parallel to, and above, the W&B; line. In 1882 the Duncan pit started operation, near West Wemyss station, and a short branch was built to serve it, opening in 1882. It was built by the NBR at Wemyss' expense, and the output was conveyed to Burntisland. Lady Lilian pit resumed operation (on the site of an earlier unsuccessful scheme) in 1891 - 1893 and the Duncan sidings were extended eastwards to serve it, and at the same time the line was extended south to reach the Hugo pit, which previously had only been able to access West Wemyss through the hutch tunnel.William Scott Bruce, Railways of Fife, Melven Press, Perth, 1980, Archive Committee of the Kingdom of Fife Railway Preservation Society, The Methil Branch Line Railway, Kingdom of Fife Railway Preservation Society and Lower Methil Heritage Centre, 1996, James K Corstorphine, East of Thornton Junction: The Story of the Fife Coast Line, self published by Corstorphine, Leven, 1995, =Improving Methil harbour= 0-6-0 locomotive No 16 near Methil docks in 1970.The North British Railway had developed Burntisland as its main harbour in Fife, and much of the rail- connected coal traffic went there; this was a considerable mileage, and income to the NBR, and local coalmasters resented the expense when there were several small harbours locally that were not used. The dock accommodation at Methil was very limited, being only capable of handling ships up to 150 tons. As the rate of coal extraction increased, the lack of useful local harbour facilities became of increasing significance, and in 1879 Wemyss and his tenant coalmasters agreed on the construction of a proper dock at Methil. To avoid opposition from the Leven Harbour Company, Wemyys approached them to purchase their business. They were receptive, as all their initial capital had been expended and further construction was needed, which they were unable to fund. Struggling with heavy indebtedness, the Company sold out to the Wemyss Estate (Randolph Wemyss, his tenant colliers and certain other business interests) in 1883 for £12,000. By this purchase the Wemyss Estate acquired the branch railway to Leven Harbour. Wemyss needed to extend the Buckhaven line to Leven Harbour, and strong opposition might be expected from the North British Railway, who would lose mileage by it. Wemyss forged an agreement with them, finalised on 21 April 1883, by agreeing to the Burntisland carriage rates applying to coal traffic from outside the immediate area to Methil and Leven. Wemyss also agreed not to allow competing railways access to the area over his lands; the North British anticipated an incursion by the rival Caledonian Railway and this may have been significant in securing their consent to Wemyss' line. The line to extend the Buckhaven line to Leven Harbour, which became known as the Leven Connection Railway, two miles long, opened on 17 September 1884. Parliamentary authorisation was not required. The line was inspected by Major General Hutchinson on 3 March 1887 and opened to passenger traffic on 5 May 1887, operating as an extension of the Wemyss and Buckhaven line; passenger trains ran between Thornton, Buckhaven and Methil; only mineral traffic continued to Leven Harbour, but the new, well-equipped Methil Dock opened on 5 May 1887 also. The cost of the dock and railway extension had been £227,000.Bruce says that the dock cost £100,000, a remarkably small figure. In eight months of 1887 Methil shipped 220,000 tons, rising to 409,000 in the full year 1888; Burntisland throughput fell substantially in the same period. Meanwhile, by 1890 Leven was not shipping anything. A link line was built from the Leven nos 1 and 2 pits branch to join the new line near Methil. There was a significant difference in levels and the link line descended at 1 in 19; a runaway trap siding was provided to protect the main line. =Thornton avoiding line= The mineral traffic built up rapidly, and included heavy flows from Dunfermline. The routing for those trains involved a reversal at Thornton, on the NBR main line, and this caused significant delay; a direct line passing under the main line was built in 1886 - 1887; it had steep gradients, falling from the Dunfermline direction at 1 in 52 and rising again at 1 in 74. Wemyss contributed £1,000 to the cost of construction. =Wellsgreen pit= The Wemyss Estate Railways in 1887Shortly after October 1887 a lease was agreed between Wemyss and the Fife Coal Company for the exploitation of a pit at Wellsgreen; this too would need a railway connection. Wemyss required that to join his lines at Wemyss Castle station, by agreement with the NBR; the branch ran south from the colliery. =Randolph pit= After September 1888 production at the Randolph pit started; there was consideration of making a mineral railway eastward from it to join the Duncan connection on the W&BR;, but this would have been a lengthy line and in fact a direct connection was made with the NBR main line adjacent. =Transfer to the North British Railway= The new Methil dock was entirely successful, and mechanical handling equipment and other modern aids ensured rapid loading of shipping. Nonetheless Wemyss did not wish to be a long term operator of harbour facilities, particularly because he foresaw that considerable development would be needed in later years to keep abreast of the expansion of trade. Discussions took place with the North British Railway in 1888 which resulted in the sale of the facilities to that company. This became effective on 1 February 1889 and included the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and the Methil extension, the Methil and Leven docks, and the railways serving them. Wemyss undertook never to construct or allow a railway or dock on his lands that would compete with the transferred lines and harbours. This was a most significant concession, as he was handing monopoly control to the NBR; at the time he had an excellent relationship with the Chairman of the NBR, John Walker, and this may have influenced him. The purchase cost £225,000; the Wemyss Castle station was to be maintained by the NBR for the private use of Wemyss, and Wemyss was given a seat on the NBR board. =Methil dock expansion= No 3 dock at Methil in 2007.Wemyss had an understanding with Walker and the NBR that they would develop Methil Dock and the railway facilities in line with the growth of exported minerals, and a second dock basin at Methil was planned. However Walker died suddenly on 24 April 1891, and his successor John Conacher was considerably less amenable to Wemyss' intentions. The NBR had been spending money on developing Burntisland harbour, and Conacher saw the attraction in avoiding duplication and taking the profit in the longer haul from Wemyss' estates to Burntisland. Accordingly, the NBR failed to carry out any significant improvement at Methil. Wemyss and his tenants found that the limitations of the harbour were unreasonably constraining their businesses: ships suffering 14 days waiting in the roads for a berth and five days to load were recorded as typical. The NBR harbour at Burntisland was unattractive to the East Fife coalmasters, but for some time Wemyss was unable to persuade the NBR to attend to the issue, although he pressed Conacher to agree to build the new works at Methil, in a series of meetings and increasingly urgent letters in 1893. In the face of this pressure the NBR started work on the No 2 Dock at Methil in 1894; it took until January 1900 to get it ready. =The Wemyss Coal Company Ltd= Until this time Wemyss had been financing his businesses in a personal capacity, but on 17 March 1894 the Wemyss Coal Company Ltd (WCC) was formed. Wemyss transferred much of his business interest to the Company; other shareholders were chiefly local Coalmasters. Naturally Wemyss was a dominant shareholder and a driving force; his later correspondence with the NBR often put forward his views personally as well as on behalf of the WCC. (The Wemyss Colliery Trust was established on 28 October 1897, taking possession of all the colliery interests in the estate by perpetual feu.) =New pits and railways= In 1894 considerable further development of the pits took place, and in particular a pit later named Michael Colliery on the foreshore west of East Wemyss town was established, intended to win undersea coal. A new railway was planned, climbing from the new pit to form a triangular junction with a new line running between West Wemyss and Wemyss Castle, and broadly parallel to the existing Buckhaven line. The new railway was over a mile long, with a zigzag to gain height and gradients of 1 in 69 against loaded trains to reach the high level line. Construction of the line started in February 1895, and was complete in October 1895. =The Burntisland thirling agreement= From 1894 difficult discussions took place between the NBR and the Wemyss Estate and its coalmaster tenants. The NBR was continuing to advance the benefits of developing Burntisland, and Wemyss as a Director of the NBR was heartily opposed to that as being wasteful for the NBR. His position was anomalous as his interests in the WCC were also contrary to any development of harbours elsewhere than at Methil. Conacher and a section of the NBR directors favoured Burntisland and were reluctant to expend money on developing Methil. The negotiations ended on 20 February 1896 with a thirling agreement (that is, a mutually binding limitation agreement) in which the coalmasters and Wemyss himself undertook for 21 years to ship all their coal from NBR harbours, and not to condone the construction of any rival railway wholly or partly in Fife. Short private colliery railway connections were allowed under the agreement.The NBR undertook not to raise the haulage rates to Methil above those to Burntisland, but Brotchie is vague about what the Wemyss Estate got in return for their agreement; the schedule refers to the development of Burntisland, contrary to their interests. In May 1897 Wemyss indicated to the NBR that he planned to build a new connecting railway from Muiredge Den to Methil; at six miles in length it was to connect numerous collieries in the district. The NBR immediately took the view that this was prohibited under the thirling agreement, and lengthy and antagonistic correspondence followed. The NBR argued that the licence to build new colliery connections was personal to Wemyss (not the WCC) and did not allow him to carry the minerals of others on the line. The matter went to arbitration, and the arbitrator gave his decision on 10 March 1899: he found in favour of Wemyss. The NBR complied with the obligations of the NBR's finding, but continued to try to dissuade Wemyss from building the line by proposing concessions on the continued use of the NBR lines. This involved an attempt to make an agreement with Wemyss that would pay him £3,000 annually as a form of compensation, but Wemyss declined the agreement. Although the matter only affected a six-mile mineral railway, it proved extremely contentious for the North British Railway board, and at a turbulent shareholders' meeting on 23 March 1899, a critical vote resulted in the resignation of the Chairman. Wemyss' own position as a NBR board member was becoming impossible and he resigned from the Board on 16 May 1899. Conacher too, the General Manager of the NBR, was accused of dishonest management, and he resigned as from 1 July 1899. =Wemyss' remarriage= In July 1898 Wemyss was divorced by his wife, having had intimate relations in London with an actress. He married Lady Eva Cecilia Wellesley on 28 November 1899 and sailed to Egypt and South Africa on honeymoon. The Second Boer War had just started, and Wemyss became involved as an army officer and was absent while matters developed at home. =The new Muiredge line= The contentious new railway between Muiredge Den and Methil was started in October 1899; it was completed and opened in January 1901. It was six miles in length, and single track, starting in the west at Duncan siding, linking Lochhead and Hugo pits, with a new east-facing connection to Michael. It then crossed the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and turned north up Wemyss Den, running close to the 1887 Wellsgreen line, then crossing it by a diamond crossing; the earlier restrictive agreements required Wellsgreen traffic to be worked to Wemyss Castle. It then ran north and east, joining the Bowman branch to Isabella pit, and then crossing the route of the NBR Muiredge branch. Running north-south this had become dormant when more direct routes for Muiredge coal had been built, and the NBR had agreed that it might be severed to allow the new line to pass through west to east. Spur connections north and south were made to the stubs of that line; the junction area was known as Muiredge Plunks. The line continued east through Starkey's Wood, turning tightly to the south-west and crossing over the Methil extension railway, to terminate at Denbeath pit on the shore. The line had cost £17,186; it was formally opened on 9 January 1901. Wemyss returned from South Africa in July 1901 and proposed an arrangement to carry the Wellsgreen traffic on the new line. Until that time it had been routed to Wemyss Castle and carried by the NBR. A new eastward spur from the Wellsgreen branch was provided, shortening the transit to Methil considerably. However the NBR reminded Wemyss of the earlier agreement that Wellsgreen traffic would travel via Wemyss Castle, and after some prevarication Wemyss was obliged to concede that obligation in August 1903. =Pits at Earlseat= Wemyss now set about connecting pits at Earlseat, where a considerable coal resource lay. A new branch was built from the Muiredge line running north parallel to the FCC Wellsgreen line, passing round the east and north sides of Wellsgreen and then striking west to Earlseat. The line was 2 1/2 miles long, and starting in July 1903, it was completed in four months. The location of the new pit was remote, and Wemyss established a free workers' passenger train service, erecting platforms at Earlseat and at Cowley Road, Methil, and at Denbeath. On 12 August 1907 a serious accident took place at Spence's Box at the Summer Road crossing; the workers' train was waiting at the junction signal for a clear road, and a descending loaded mineral train got out of control and ran through the signals, destroying the pug engine and carriages of the workers' train. The approach of the out-of-control train was given warning and most of the passengers and crew had left the train. =Consolidation of the WCC business= The Wemyss Estate Railways in 1906From 1894 the possible absorption by the WCC of the activity of the coalmaster Bowman was discussed, but Bowman's price was considered too much. In 1905 most of Bowman's leases expired and the WCC took over the work directly at that time. The Estate Railway then consisted of 8 miles of running line and 18 miles of sidings. Although now entirely mineral lines, modern signalling systems were in use for the intensive traffic. =Methil harbour extension, again= In 1895 Methil harbour had shipped 727,564 tons, overtaking Burntisland, and abstracting some business from smaller ports which could not accept the larger vessels coming into use. From 1904 a further increase in shipments from Methil was expected, and the no 2 dock was already smaller than many of the vessels currently in use. W F Jackson had succeeded Conacher as General Manager of the North British Railway, owner of the docks, and he too seems to have been antagonistic to Wemyss. Widening and deepening the shipping access to Methil was, he said, impractical, and Wemyss replied in a letter stating that he had prepared a scheme that could be implemented, but that if the NBR would not act on the matter, Wemyss would build a new dock himself. His original undertaking not to do so had been, he said, contingent on the NBR extending and enlarging the dock themselves as might be necessary. Further acrimonious correspondence followed, the result of which was that the NBR declined to improve the Methil docks, while Wemyss threatened, for the time being in vain, to build an additional dock facility himself. However, in the 1905 Parliamentary session he deposited a Bill for a Wemyss Dock at Buckhaven. The Lords Committee refused the preamble, on the grounds of his undertaking to the NBR, and that no one else was precluded from taking the necessary steps. In the following year the NBR, stung into action by the finding, presented a proposal themselves but it ran out of time for the 1906 session and was deposited in April 1907. At the same time, Wemyss, possibly suspecting tactical play, submitted a modified version of his own scheme, while stating that he had no wish to proceed with it if the NBR would itself improve Methil. So it was that on 2 August 1907 the Act was passed, empowering the North British Railway to construct Methil no 3 Dock and associated railway connections; the NBR was required to complete it as soon as possible. Wemyss withdrew his Bill, and in 1908 the NBR let a contract to Robert McAlpine for the no 3 Dock. It was to be located east of the earlier docks and was undoubtedly very large. The single track crossing of the River Leven was to be widened to four tracks, and considerable additional sidings accommodation was to be provided. The railway facilities alone were to cost £50,000. As part of the scheme, Leven Harbour, already badly silted up, was closed. In 1913 coal exports reached a total of 3,224,000 tons, of which two-thirds was handled by the Wemyss Estate Railway. =The Wemyss and District Tramways Company= The huge and concentrated mining activity obviously required a considerable manpower. The WCC had early on provided miners' houses, but now travel from outside the immediate area was a necessity. Wemyss decided to install an electric passenger tramway, linked to the existing Kirkcaldy municipal system, for the use of employees. It opened in August 1906; it was 3 ft 6in gauge and cost Wemyss personally £52,000; he formed the Wemyss and District Tramways Company Ltd to operate it. It ran 7 1/2 miles from Gallatown to Leven via Coaltown, East Wemyss, Roisie, Muiredge, Denbeath and Methil. Electricity generated for the Wellesley mines was used on the system. The trams ran into the Kirkcaldy system and were integrated with it, but there were four high-capacity cars reserved for the times of shift changes The original alignment passed through the centre of Coaltown, but following a serious accident there, the line was diverted round the northern margin of the community. In 1912 the tramway company passed into the ownership of the Balfour Beatty group, but for a while the four high capacity cars remained with the WCC; however in March 1913 those vehicles were also sold to Balfour Beatty's concern, for £350 each, and the tramway business ceased to be a concern of the Wemyss Estate. The electric tramway later ceased operating in January 1932 due to competition from motor buses; in fact Balfour Beatty themselves had become one of the largest bus operators in the district. =Death of Randolph Wemyss= For some time Wemyss had been suffering indifferent health, and on 17 July 1908 he died in London, at the age of 50. He was succeeded by his only son, Michael John Erskine Wemyss; he came of age eight months after his father's death. =Completion of Methil no 3 Dock= The prodigious no 3 dock experienced many setbacks from the weather and sea action during construction. Robert McAlpine had 18 contractors' locomotives in use on the scheme. On 22 January 1913 the new Dock was declared open by the Countess of Dalkeith; it had cost £750,000, and it was actually opened to shipping on 24 March 1913. Even then there was continual difficulty with the operation of the dock gates, probably due to mining subsidence under their supports. Attempts to rectify this problem dragged on, and the onset of World War I in 1914 overtook events, as the export coal trade collapsed during hostilities. In 1915 it was stated to be necessary to close the dock temporarily to rectify the problem with the gates, but the NBR directed instead that the closure should be semi-permanent, as the available business could now easily be handled at the nos 1 and 2 docks. This closure took place on 18 March 1915; the whole construction had been abortive. Reconstruction of the gates was attempted from June 1916 and was completed in June 1919. =After the First World War= Production from the WCC pits had doubled by 1920, but the export markets formerly served had much diminished. Industrial unrest, Government controls of home sale prices, and other social factors made the profitability of the pits greatly reduced. The railway was still in intensive activity, although not all the pits continued in use; the Hugo pit closed at this time; Isabella (renamed Cameron) closed on 17 March 1925, and Leven no 4 (Klondyke) closed on 24 January 1925. In 1923 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) was formed from the North British Railway and other constituents (under the Railways Act 1921). In 1926 worker dissatisfaction with wages and hours led to the General Strike; in fact the Fife miners struck on 1 May 1926, just before the nationwide stoppage. The strike ceased in November but irreparable damage had been done to some underground machinery by water ingress, and the Earlseat colliery never reopened productively. The Earlseat workers' train never resumed after this. The state of the industry remained very difficult for some years, and in 1930 Government regulation was introduced which removed many freedoms of the Company; an 85% quota was imposed (that is, the Company was required to reduce output by 15%). Some of the pits were closed in this period, partly to meet the quota, and although the railway branches continued in use to move colliery waste, some closures took place. The line from Cameron Bridge to Plunks was closed in 1936. =The Second World War and afterwards= World War II started in 1939, and once again the pattern of coal output changed; export was almost completely stopped by London power stations required a considerable supply form the Fife coalfields. Open cast extraction was started west of Earlseat and the Ministry of Fuel and Power arranged an extension there in 1944 to serve it. After the end of the war Government control was continued, and the collieries were nationalised from 1 January 1947. The railways immediately serving pits were allocated to those pits, but the main line and the rolling stock remained for the time being with the Wemyss Estate Railway, renamed the Wemyss Private Railway. The dispute over the valuation of the colliery siding assets dragged on until 1955: the WCC received a little under £2 million for them. =The Michael Colliery disaster= In the meantime the divided responsibility between the new National Coal Board (NCB), operating the collieries and the colliery sidings, the Wemyss Private Railway, and British Railways, led to lack of co-ordination and some railway safety shortcomings. The NCB also engaged in road haulage of pit output in some cases, and already some of the marginal sections of route closed. The mineral output of the area declined in the 1950s, and the decline of the least productive pits accelerated. Production was to be concentrated on the Michael Colliery, and the next largest producer, the Wellesley, was closed down on 22 July 1967. On 9 September 1967 there was a spontaneous underground explosion at the Michael; nine workers died and production was halted instantly, and permanently. Only the Lochhead pit remained active, together with the coal washer, and the railway requirements were minimal. Lochhead closed on 27 March 1970, and the only residual traffic was from external collieries to the washer. This could not continue and the last day of WPR operation was on 26 June 1970. Locomotives The first long section of railway was the Wemyss and Buckhaven Railway; this and several short branches built early on were worked by the North British Railway with that company's locomotives. When the extension railway from Buckhaven to Methil and Leven was made, it was operated by the Wemyss Estate, and a four-wheel saddle tank locomotive was procured in 1884 from Barclays & Co of kilmarnock; it was named Lady Lilian. In 1887 a second similar engine was obtained from Grant, Ritchie and Company, and named Jubilee. When the Leven dock and railway were sold to the North British Railway, the locomotives were transferred also. The Bowman company also operated pug engines for their own purposes, with some running on the Wemyss Estate line; a four-wheel saddle tank was obtained form Andrew Barclay in 1870, and a second was ordered in 1879. From 1884 to 1887 a second hand engine originally manufactured by Andrew Barclay in 1880 was in use on the Methil Dock construction, and in October 1887 it was purchased by Bowman. In 1890 and 1892 two more engines followed, from Andrew Barclay, and in 1892 an engine was also obtained from McCulloch, Sons and Kennedy of Kilmarnock. In 1903 the final engine was purchased form Gibb and Hogg of Airdrie. Five of these locomotives passed to the Wemyss Estate Railway when Bowman's lease terminated in 1905. When the Wemyss Coal Company was formed, the first locomotive it obtained was a powerful six-wheel saddle tank, intended for the steeply graded zigzag to the Michael colliery. It was named Lady Lilian and arrived in 1896. When Lady Lilian divorced Wemyss, the locomotive was designated No 1. instead. WCC nos 2, 3 and 5 were four wheel saddle tanks built by Andrew Barclay and Sons in 1902 and 1903. In 1903 a six-wheel saddle tank was ordered from Dübs and Company in July 1903. The order was fulfilled by the North British Locomotive Company which acquired Dübs shortly afterwards. It was delivered in April 1904 and became WCC no 4. A further six wheel saddle tank was obtained from Gibbs and Hogg, ordered in August 1904; it was second hand and was scrapped in 1907 after an accident; it was WCC no 6. Locomotive no 7 was ordered in August 1904 and delivered the next month from the North British Locomotive Company, and no 8 was ordered form Hudswell Clarke and Co, and it was delivered in October 1905. No 9, also from Hudswell Clarke, was a six- wheeled side tank locomotive, otherwise similar to no 8. No 14 was similar to no 9 and was obtained from Hudswell Clarke in 1912. (The intermediate numbers were taken up by the inherited Bowman locomotives.) No 15 was obtained in May 1914 from R and W Hawthorn; it was another six wheeled side tank engine. In June 1920 the locomotive fleet was run down due to the shortages of the War, and a second hand engine was obtained, becoming no 6 (replacing an earlier no 6). It had been built for the Great Northern Railway in 1875 and was a six- wheel saddle tank. Increasing loadings and the ageing of the original locomotive fleet led to the purchase of a powerful six wheel side tank engine with the extraordinary tractive effort of 22,403 lb. It became WCC no 16 and was delivered from Andrew Barclay in July 1934. Two similar engines, nos 17 and 18 followed in 1935 and 1938, and nos 19 and 20 followed in 1939. The final locomotive was no 21, a Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST type that had been built for the Ministry of Supply by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorn in 1943. It never carried the number 21. After transfer of the colliery assets to the National Coal Board, the Wemyss Private Railway obtained a former Caledonian Railway 782 Class six wheel side tank locomotive built in 1899, formerly in British Railways service. It arrived in 1954 but was in poor condition. It was given the number 21, and was scrapped in 1959. In 1958 a further Austerity locomotive was obtained second hand and given the number 15, followed by another Austerity, no 14, in 1961, and in 1964 a further example came to the line, numbered 16 replacing the earlier no 16, and another, no 13, in 1967.

The treatment involves the use of mild electrical impulses to stimulate the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve which are part of the peripheral nervous system and are located at the back of the head just above the neck area. The electrical impulses are generated by a small device called a neurostimulator – similar to an artificial cardiac pacemaker – which is implanted in the buttock, chest, low abdomen, beneath the shoulder blade or below the clavicle. The electricity is delivered to the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve by small metal electrodes which are arranged on thin leads and implanted just under the skin. The intensity of the electrical impulses can be adjusted using a small remote control device. History The history of PNS is thoroughly reported by Slavin, 2011. The use of PNS for chronic pain was first reported in 1967 by Wall and Sweet although the first implantations were performed in 1962 by Shelden. They demonstrated that electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves suppresses the perception of pain. A period of semi-experimental PNS usage continued for 15 – 20 years. During the latter half of the 1980s, PNS became an established surgical procedure. In the late 1990s, Weiner and Reed reported the percutaneous technique of inserting electrodes in the vicinity of the occipital nerves to treat occipital neuralgia. Weiner showed that placing a PNS electrode close to a nerve is effective for pain relief and a technically simple procedure. This pioneering work heralded the start of the modern era of PNS. It was 2003 before Popeney and Aló proposed using PNS for the treatment of chronic migraine. Subsequently, prospective randomized controlled trials were launched to gather additional clinical evidence. This is further detailed in an article published by Cephalagia titled \\"Safety and efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation of the occipital nerves for the management of chronic migraine: Results from a randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, controlled study.\\" In September 2011, St Jude Medical Inc. became the first company to receive European approval for the use of PNS in treating chronic migraine.  Candidates for the therapy  Appropriate candidates for PNS of the occipital nerves for the treatment of chronic migraine must be diagnosed with chronic migraine which is classified as intractable. Chronic migraine is defined by the International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines: * 15 or more migraine (without aura) headache days per month for more than 3 months with headaches lasting at least 4–72 hours in duration * At least 2 of the following: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, aggravated by or causing avoidance of, routine physical activity (walking or climbing stairs)  During the headache, at least one of the following: nausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia * Not attributed to another disorder * Absence of medication overuse Intractable chronic migraine is generally defined as chronic migraine with failure of three or more preventive drugs and at least moderate disability determined using a validated migraine disability instrument (e.g. MIDAS or HIT-6).  Procedure  = Pre-operation = Prior to the implantation, patients usually undergo a psychological assessment to assess their well-being and mental health. The risks of the procedure will be discussed and the patient will be asked for their informed consent. Risks that may be highlighted include no guarantee of effectiveness, infection, nerve damage, painful direct muscle stimulation, lead movement with loss of stimulation, lead fracture, battery failure, eventual need for battery replacement, hematoma and seroma formation. = Implantation = In most cases, a trial (test) lead placement is performed in order to assess whether the stimulation will work as expected. Local anesthetic is applied to the back of the neck and a Tuohy needle is advanced towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve under fluoroscopic guidance. When the location is confirmed, a temporary lead is placed through the needle before the needle is carefully removed. Electrical impulses are sent through the lead and its position is adjusted until the patient reports a \\"pins-and- needles\\" sensation, called paresthesia, across the areas of the nerves. If paresthesia is successfully achieved in the right place, permanent leads are usually implanted at a later date. In some cases, the trial leads are left in for up to one week to see whether there is any relief of symptoms. Permanent lead placement may be carried out under general anesthetic or local anesthetic with sedation. First, a small incision is made at the base of the skull, then a Tuohy needle is advanced under fluoroscopic guidance towards the location of the greater occipital nerve and lesser occipital nerve on one side of the head. When the lead is adequately positioned through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance, the needle is carefully removed and the lead is fixed in place. Since most patients require two leads, a second lead is usually inserted and fixed in place on the other side of the head in the same way. The lead(s) are then tunneled to a neurostimulator device which is usually implanted the buttock, chest, low abdomen, beneath the shoulder blade or below the clavicle.  Clinical evidence  Results from three randomized controlled trials have been published. One randomized controlled trial of 157 patients with chronic migraine was published in October 2012. Participants were implanted with the device and then randomized to have the device turned on (the treatment group) or off (the control group) for 12 weeks. After week 12, participants received active treatment until week 52. All participants had trial stimulation to ensure correct position of electrodes. A total of 153 participants completed 12 weeks in the trial. There was a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the number of patients in the treatment group]and control group at the 30% reduction in pain level using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In addition the study showed that, on average, the treatment group (device on) had 6.1 fewer days of headache days per month which was more than double the average reduction for the control group (device off), which is statistically significant (p<0.001). The clinical study investigators reported that the overall rate of serious device and procedure related adverse events was 1% and that these included one infection and one case of post-operative pain which required additional hospitalization. In February 2011, the ONSTIM clinical study investigators reported three-month results from a randomized controlled trial of patients with chronic migraine. Participants were first given occipital nerve block. Those who responded were randomized into three groups. The first group was a treatment group (33 participants) and received adjustable stimulation. The other two groups were control groups and received sham stimulation for one minute per day or standard medical management (17 participants each). Patients who achieved a 50% or greater reduction in their number of headache days per month or a three-point or greater reduction in average overall pain intensity compared with baseline were defined as responders to the therapy. 39% of patients in the adjustable stimulation group were responders, 6% in the sham stimulation group and 0% in the medical management group. The differences between the responder rates in the treatment group and control groups were statistically significant. Other outcome measures, such as number of headache days, were not statistically significantly different between the groups. However, the percentage reduction in headache days was 27% for the treatment group and less than 9% for each control group, showing a numerical advantage for the treatment group. No unanticipated device adverse events were reported. Movement of the lead occurred in 24% of subjects. In December 2009, the PRISM study investigators reported three-month results in abstract form from a randomized controlled trial of 125 patients with chronic migraine. Patients were randomized into two groups. One group was a treatment group and received active stimulation. The other was a control group and received sham stimulation. Patients in the treatment group reduced their number of migraine days per month by 5.5 from a baseline of 20.2 days per month. Patients in the control group reduced their number of migraine days per month by 3.9 from a baseline of 19.2 days per month. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.

It is working in Pakistan since 1984. FESF provides educational services, with particular focus on Deaf children and youth. FESF is registered as a non-profit organization with the SECP and is tax exempt. The organization’s main projects are: * Deaf Reach Program * Move Program * Eduserve Training Program * Community Services Program  Projects  = Deaf Reach Program = Upwards of nine million people in Pakistan (5% of pop.) have some form of hearing loss. Of this group, there are approximately 1.5 million profoundly deaf children of school age – the majority of whom suffer from no educational opportunities. The Deaf Reach Program was established in Pakistan in 1998, initially working informally with deaf youth and young adults. The first Deaf Reach School was established by FESF in Karachi in 2005, and the program has grown rapidly to where there are now seven Deaf Reach Schools and Training Centers located in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Nawabshah, and Lahore, with a new large campus in Rashidabad, Tando Allahyar. These schools are providing free education and training to over 1,200 deaf children and young adults from low-income families in both urban and rural areas. There is an important focus on girls attending school, with a female enrollment of 48%. Deaf Reach is the only school for the Deaf in Pakistan that has a branch network, providing educational opportunities in rural areas. Training is also provided for all parents and families in learning how to communicate and care for their children. There is also an active Financial Inclusion program for deaf young adults with training in marketable skills leading to employment and financial independence. In 2014, FESF launched a Pakistan Sign Language (PSL)http://www.psl.org.pk lexicon referencing 5,000 words. The PSL Lexicon received the 2014 P@SHA Award in e-Inclusion & e-Community category.http://tribune.com.pk/story/791888/diversity-praised-at-psha-ict- awards/ =Motivated Volunteer Empowerment Program= The Motivated Volunteer Empowerment (MOVE) Program is aimed at high school and university students but is also effective as a training program. The training courses are organized and implemented by Family Educational Services Foundation (FESF). The MOVE program is an educational development resource, which focuses on leadership, soft skills and volunteerism. The program meets the need for developing committed volunteers and engaging youth voice in solving social problems. The six training sessions are followed by two project planning workshops. At least one community development project is carried out by participants from each MOVE program. Theoretical training along with practical experience is a vital ingredient of MOVE. To this effect, FESF coordinates field implementation projects for the students in partnership with local institutions around the country. Many of the MOVE graduates have gone on to be actively involved in their community with some initiating and sustaining highly effective volunteer projects on a regular basis. = Community Services = A few programs that are regularly organized are: # A yearly Summer Camp for deaf and orphan children # An annual Children's Benefit Concert for approx. 5,000 handicapped and underprivileged children. # Uplift programs in hospitals # Extra- curricular classes and events for less privileged children # Regular book drives and creation of libraries in needy schools and institutes All of these programs are achieved with the help of volunteers.  Master Trainer Program  FESF, in collaboration with NOWPDP launched a master trainer program in Jan. 2010, \\"Instructing and Guiding Children with Special Education Needs.\\" The program objective is capacity building for teachers who impart special education in government and private schools countrywide. 10 master trainers were developed who went on to conduct courses for 226 teachers from 25 different institutes in Karachi and Islamabad.

The name Lucerna means \\"lantern\\" in Czech. Lucerna Palace is an Art Nouveau building built by former President Václav Havel's family. The Lucerna Music Bar is one of the venues within Lucerna Palace involved in the Prague International Jazz Festival and the AghaRTA Prague Jazz Festival. It was used for the Václav Havel Tribute Concert, held in Václav Havel's honor, upon his death in 2011. The Lucerna Music Bar is similar in size to Washington, DC's 9:30 Club, Cleveland's Agora Theatre and Ballroom, Philadelphia's Trocadero Theatre, or Baltimore's Rams Head Live!, however the selection of artists is more international. The Lucera Music Bar has played a role in giving exposure to many bands from the Czech Republic and around the world. Lucerna Palace Inside the Lucerna Palace galleria - Lucerna Music Bar is down the hall on the left The building was designed by Havel (the grandfather of former president Václav Havel), Stanislav Bechyně and Václav Prokop, and built at the beginning of the 20th century. It was completed in 1921. The reinforced concrete construction is an early example of this type of construction and is described in a book by engineer Prof. Bechyně. The building was designed as the first multipurpose building. It is a multilevel open air galleria that houses The Lucerna Music Bar and the Lucerna Theatre, a formal concert hall, in addition to an assortment of shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. The Lucerna Palace has been the site of many significant events in the country's history and is considered the most important private cultural centre in the city. It is the home of the Prague International Jazz Festival and was the site of Václav Havel Tribute Concert. Cultural context DVA, a Czech band, onstage at the Lucerna Music Bar, Prague, Czech Republic, on Monday, 14 November 2011. Up until the end of the 1980s, Czechoslovakia remained under the control of one of the most repressive Communist governments in Eastern Europe. In 1964 Prague's \\"1st International Jazz Festival\\" was held in the hall and the following year Louis Armstrong performed there.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0075vxz Jazz Writers, musicians, artists and intellectuals are credited with promoting the democratic ideals that shaped the Velvet Revolution. Although they could not openly practice their arts, some writers and musicians were among the most elite members of society. A number of music related events transpired during the revolution. Charter 77, a human rights manifesto, was written in response to the arrest of a band called Plastic People of the Universe, one of Václav Havel's favorite bands. In 1979, Havel himself was imprisoned for activities on behalf of the charter and The Jazz Section was targeted by Communists for their work. Five members of The Jazz Section died in prison under suspicious circumstances. Other countries, such as Hungary and Poland, had slowly been changing over time. In 1989, Communism fell in Czechoslovakia. Its first post- communist, elected President was Václav Havel, a strong patron of the Czechoslovak music scene. The Václav Havel Tribute Concert, held in his honor in 2011, featured a wide range of musical talent from around the globe. Following Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, the bans were lifted, and new record labels and publishing houses emerged, producing CDs, magazines, newspapers, and books. Previously banned plays, movies, books and records, including Havel's adaptation of The Beggar's Opera, became available. Previously forbidden news topics, such as drugs, skinheads, the black market, corruption in the Communist Party, began to appear in news media. After the Velvet Revolution, musicians were able to perform in public, and Velvet Underground and Doors songs became very popular. In July 1998, the band Phish played two nights at the Lucerna Theatre that are highly regarded among listeners.http://phish.net/venue/531 A celebration of this musical freedom was held at Lucerna Palace, including the Lucerna Music Bar. Currently, citizens are even free to hold benefit concerts whose proceeds go towards such causes as legalizing marijuana and abolishing the death penalty. Events Today, Lucerna Music Bar is renowned for its 80s and 90s pop discos on Friday and Saturday nights. During the week the bar mainly hosts live music.

It was collected by Francis James Child as Child ballad number 268.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"The Twa Knights\\" It is highly possible that the ballad was popularly unknown in Scotland, and only known through print. It has since been given the Roud number of 303. Synopsis The story belongs to the Aarne-Thompson Type 882: the wager on the wife's chastity. It starts with two best friends, or \\"brothers sworn\\": one a knight, and the other a squire. They begin talking about women, and the unwed squire dourly declares that there cannot be more than nine good women in the world. The knight declares that he is lucky, for his wife is one of them. To test the truth of this claim, the squire suggests a plan where the knight goes off to sea for six months. He wagers his life that he will be able to gain the love of the lady before six months have passed. The knight insists that they lengthen the period to nine months, and then wagers all his lands on his wife's faithfulness. Once the knight has left, the squire tries at once to win the love of the \\"gay lady\\". At first approaches her directly, but she spurns his advances. Next the squire wins the aid of his foster-mother with \\"fifty guineas and three.\\" The foster-mother fakes care for the lady and is able to convince her to send all of her servants out to work the fields. Once the house is empty, the foster-mother lulls the gay lady to sleep and then leaves. The scheming old woman delivers all the keys to the house to the young squire, who goes in and wakes the lady in her bedchamber. He insists that they make love, but the knight's wife spurns him, saying that it would be a sin to sully her husband's bed. Instead, she agrees that she will come to his bed the next day. The next day, the gay lady sends her niece, Maisry, to the squire in her place. The squire is unable to detect the deception and sleeps with the girl, taking her ring and her ring-finger as tokens of the night. The knight returns after the agreed time has ended, and is greeted by the squire. The squire insists that he has won the knight's lands and shows the finger as proof. The knight, distraught, goes to punish his wife. When he gets to the castle, however, the lady is able to show him that her hand is whole and tell to him the plot that saved her chastity. The knight summons both Maisry and the squire, and gives Maisry the choice of whether to stab her lover or wed him. After some thought, Maisry decides to marry the squire, and the ballad ends with a nod to her wisdom. Parallels Within the Child collection, the story bears remarkable similarity to \\"Redesdale and Wise William,\\" which is ballad number 246.S. G. Armistead. \\"Judeo-Spanish and Pan-European Balladry.\\" Jahrbuch für Volksliedforschung, Vol. 24 (1979): pp. 127-138. This version focuses on two friends, Redesdale and Wise William, who wager on the chastity of William's sister. Redesdale bets with his lands, and William with his life. The sister spurns all advances, even when Redesdale burns down her house. Redesdale loses the bet and pays happily, convinced of the sister's goodness.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"Redesdale and Wise William\\" Despite the differences of ending and the distinction of sister rather than wife, the tales are obviously related and both fit within the Aarne-Thompson Type 882. Outside of the collection, a parallel story and possible source is found in many versions of the Greek tale, \\"Maurianos and His Sister.\\"Paul G. Brewster and Georgia Tarsouli. \\"Two English Ballads and Their Greek Counterparts.\\" The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 69, No. 271 (1956): pp. 40-46. Some scholars have even compared it to Shakespeare's Cymbeline.Pavle Popovie. \\"Shakespearean Story in Serbian Folklore.\\" Folklore, Vol. 33, No. 1, (1922): pp. 72-90. Language Like a far more famous poem from the same period, Tae a Moose, \\"The Twa Knights\\" is written in the Scots language. This can be easily observed from the title, which uses the word \\"Twa\\" instead of the English \\"Two.\\" Here is a sample of the original ballad along with an English translation. The section comes near the beginning of the song, when the wager is first being made.

She is also known as Leonie von Zesch or Leonie Zesch. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2012. She was a dental surgeon with the United States Army following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Her mother worked with the American Red Cross to document survivors after the disaster. After recovery, she provided onboard dental services to members of both the United States Pacific Fleet and the United States Atlantic Fleet. During the Great Depression, Meusebach–Zesch provided dental care to enrollees and officers with the Civilian Conservation Corps, and later to inmates at the California Institute for Women. For four years, she practiced in her home state of Texas, with an office in Mason. Three years of her dental career were spent in Arizona, where her patients included people from the Hopi and Navajo populations. To accommodate patients who could not travel to her practice in Winslow, Arizona, she hooked her equipment to the back of her Model T automobile and held mobile dental clinics around the state. For fifteen years, Meusebach–Zesch practiced in the Territory of Alaska, with offices at varying times in Cordova, Nome and Anchorage. To serve remote Inuit villages, she traveled by airplane to islands in the Bering Sea. She survived an airplane crash on her way to Point Barrow and tried to walk to Kotzebue before being transported by an Inuit. Throughout Alaska's interior, she traveled by dog sled to hold mobile dental clinics for both Inuit and non- indigenous patients. She crawled on her abdomen across thin ice to save sled dogs from drowning. She and her assistant were stranded on one occasion, and were rescued by champion dog racer Leonhard Seppala. Family background Leonie von Meusebach–Zesch was the eldest of two daughters born to Elizabeth and Leo Zesch. She was born November 27, 1882 in Mason County, Texas, and her sister Leota was born in Loyal Valley on June 9, 1886. As a child, Leonie had witnessed the aftermath of a public lynching in Mason, the corpses of the accused hanging from a tree in the town square. Leonie's mother Elizabeth (also referred to as Agnes Elizabeth) was born in Texas in 1862, the fifth of eleven (seven surviving to adulthood) children born to John O. Meusebach and his wife Austrian-born Agnes of Coreth, daughter of Count Ernst of Coreth. John O. Meusebach had been born Baron Otfried Hans von Meusebach in Dillenburg, Duchy of Nassau and renounced his title while he was still on the ship sailing to the United States. Ernst Coreth renounced his title when he became a citizen of the United States. Elizabeth married Leo Burcheardt Zesch, who had been born in Mason, Texas in 1859. Thereafter, she used the hyphenated name Elizabeth von Meusebach–Zesch, as did her daughter Leonie. Leo's parents were Robert Zesch (originally Zoesch) and Lina Caroline Dangers (originally D'Angers). Robert Zesch emigrated from Saxony, Germany in 1854 aboard the ship Ammerland, destined for New Braunfels. In her autobiography published after her death, Leonie refers to Robert Zesch as a former German military officer. The father of Robert Zesch was Carl Zesch, a tax officer in Halle, Saxony- Anhalt, Germany. Caroline Dangers, as well as her bricklayer father Wilhelm, and her mother Rebecca emigrated from Hanover, Germany, also aboard the Ammerland . Robert and Caroline were married on May 17, 1856. Their eight children were named Carl, Leo, Herman, Eugen, Meta, Minna, Martha and William. California 1888–1908 In 1888, mother Elizabeth moved to California with her six-year-old daughter Leonie and two-year-old daughter Leota. Their first home in California was Stockton, but they finally settled in San Francisco. Leonie von Meusebach–Zesch completed her basic education through high school in San Francisco, and in 1902 graduated from the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, at that time known as the College of Physicians and Surgeons. She became a practicing dentist in June 1902 after passing the California State Dental Board examination and being hired on to work for Swedish immigrant Dr. Matson. Meusebach–Zesch was expected to replace the duties formerly held by Dr. Matson's wife, and her work hours were initially presented as being 8 a.m.-9 p.m. She would find the reality being longer hours and seven days a week, eventually collapsing on the floor from exhaustion. It was during this period she also began to study the correlation of a patient's diet to their dental health. At 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, San Francisco felt the first foreshock, followed within 20 to 25 seconds later by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the resulting fire. The disaster caused 3,000 deaths, destroyed 28,000 buildings and left 225,000 persons without housing. The United States Army under the command of Brigadier General Frederick Funston immediately went into rescue operations when the earthquake hit. Fire chief Dennis T. Sullivan suffered a skull fracture when the dome of the California Hotel fell through the fire department building. He died four days later. Meusebach–Zesch and her mother evacuated their home after the earthquake and wandered through the streets of the city. She would later describe in vivid detail the chaos, merchant price gouging and human devastation she witnessed. They arrived at the Army station on the Presidio and offered their services. Her mother began working with the combined efforts of the Army and the American Red Cross to document survivors and assist with their needs. Meusebach–Zesch signed on as a Dental Surgeon with the Army, receiving pay for herself, and living quarters to accommodate both herself and her mother. They received word that Leota and her husband were safely on one of the Farallon Islands off the San Francisco coast. On July 1, the rescue and recovery efforts were transferred to the city. The Board of Health replaced Meusebach–Zesch with a male dentist. Brigadier General Funston interceded on her behalf and, with the concurrence of Mayor Eugene Schmitz, she was reinstated. As San Francisco began to rebuild itself in 1907, Meusebach–Zesch attempted to start a private dental practice of her own. She did not receive many new clients, but she had additional income from appointments as dentist to the Children's Hospital and to the Maria Kipp Orphanage. In 1908, she received agreements from commanders of both the United States Pacific Fleet and the United States Atlantic Fleet to bring dentists and lab technicians aboard ships and provide dental services to the crew members. Although there was ample business, Meusebach–Zesch did not feel the endeavor had been financially profitable for her. Texas 1908–1912 Meusebach–Zesch and her mother returned to Mason, Texas in 1908, where she applied for a license to practice dentistry in the state of Texas. In the duration, she was a person at leisure visiting with friends and relatives in the state. She made a train trip to visit an uncle in Torreón, Mexico. On the train she met a group of Belgians who appeared to be smuggling clothing, jewelry and uncut diamonds across the border. She declined one offer from a Dallas businessman to front a statewide chain of dental offices that he intended to manage in the background. Meusebach–Zesch accepted a position with a dental practice in San Antonio, where she treated members of the city's Maverick family. Anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were friends of the owners and came into town during a visit to San Antonio by President Howard Taft. When she passed her state board examination and became licensed in Texas, Meusebach–Zesch returned to Mason to practice. In her memoirs, Meusebach–Zesch mentions an election year campaign barbecue when future Texas governors Miriam Ferguson and James E. Ferguson were present. The Fergusons had moved to Temple in 1907, where Jim Ferguson was founder and president of Temple State Bank. Neither Ferguson had yet held political office. In 1910, Jim Ferguson had served as campaign manager for the unsuccessful gubernatorial bid of Robert Vance Davidson. He had also been involved in the gubernatorial campaign of Oscar Branch Colquitt, who was sworn in as Governor of Texas in 1911. In 1912, Meusebach–Zesch approached Governor Colquitt for a state appointment. He required her to submit a petition signed by citizens of the Mason area recommending her for the position. She saw his response as gender- motivated, and decided it was time to move on to visit her sister and brother- in-law in Alaska. On the way, she decided to stop in Winslow Arizona for a visit with friends. Arizona 1912–1915 Meusebach–Zesch kept an office in Winslow once she became licensed by the state of Arizona. She held mobile dental clinics in remote locations, traveling across the state in her Model T touring car, with her equipment and instruments hooked on the back of the vehicle. She treated all school age children free of charge. Many patients journeyed to her Winslow office from other areas. En route with her mother to a sightseeing adventure at Petrified Forest National Monument, she was tracked down by a patient needing immediate treatment. They unpacked her equipment, and she worked on the patient on the open road, before continuing with her sightseeing agenda. After treating Hopi and Navajo patients in Walpi, Meusebach–Zesch and her mother attended a traditional Hopi Snake Dance, a ceremony in which the Hopi believe the snakes carry their pleas for rain to the appropriate deities. Alaska 1915–1930 =Cordova and the interior= In December 1915 after living in Winslow for three years, Meusebach–Zesch visited her sister and brother-in-law in the Territory of Alaska, with the intent of returning to her practice in Arizona. The Second Organic Act of 1912 had created the Territory of Alaska out of land the United States had purchased from Russia in 1867. Meusebach–Zesch spent that Christmas with her sister and brother-in-law in Cordova, Alaska. In February 1916, she substituted for vacationing Cordova dentist C. W. Hale. She began to realize that Alaska's need for dentists could be a lucrative career decision. Meusebach–Zesch wanted to see Alaska's interior while mulling over her professional future. She arranged with the Alaska Commercial Company to carry her as a passenger on its mail delivery. She began aboard a freight train in Cordova. The mode of transportation and drivers changed several times with the weather and circumstances. Through Chitina, Copper Center, Delta, Gulkana, Paxson, Donnelly and McCarthy, she rode by horseback, on wagons, forded through ice at the Tanana River, and was taken through the Salcha River in a native hewn craft. On dog sleds, she was strapped in for stability, and once rolled down a hill when the sled detached. They stopped at numerous roadhouses, which in Alaska served the same purpose as an inn or stagecoach stop in other states. They provided food, shelter and basic necessities. One of the roadhouses was at Richardson, 70 miles southeast of Fairbanks. Named for Wilds P. Richardson, the community had a population of a few hundred people, and the roadhouse was run by Fred Wilkins. Twenty-four days after the trip began in Cordova, they arrived in Fairbanks. After visiting a gold mine near Fairbanks, she completed her trip with a boat ride along the Yukon River and explored the Yukon Territory. At the trip's end, Meusebach–Zesch had decided to move to Alaska. =Sabbatical and move to Anchorage= She took temporary leave from Alaska to do post-graduate work at Northwestern University in Chicago in 1918, and survived an influenza bout while in San Francisco. The global 1918 flu pandemic killed an estimated 30–50 million. The pandemic spread to Alaska in the fall of 1918, and lasted until the spring of 1919. Hoping to stem the spread, Governor Thomas Riggs, Jr. imposed a maritime quarantine on the territory. The Inuit population was hard hit, partially due to preferring traditional medicines, and partially from fear of western hospitals. In some cases, entire communities were decimated. Dr. Hale in Cordova died as a result of the pandemic, and Meusebach–Zesch purchased his equipment for her office. When copper mining began to decline in Cordova, she moved her practice to Anchorage where she also began to work with the local PTA to improve dental care for children. In 1923, she closed her Anchorage practice to study at Columbia University in New York through the end of 1924. Following her university studies, Meusebach–Zesch vacationed in Europe and Egypt before returning to Alaska. =Nome, remote Inuit villages, near-death experiences= Meusebach–Zesch's goal in 1925 was to mine for gold in Nome. She had a legal agreement with the existing claims owner to mine his claim in exchange for paying $500 for assessment, and $20,000 in royalties. She hired a Mr. Johnson to do the actual mining for her. No gold was found, and the owner of the claims sued her. She believed Mr. Johnson had been working a scheme with the owner. Her only other means of income was to open a dental practice in Nome. She began conducting mobile dental clinics as she had in Arizona, and was put in charge of dental care for children in Inuit villages. She had a custom 16-foot sled built and hired Mr. Johnson, of the failed mining venture, as dog musher. She felt his labor would help repay what she lost in the lawsuit. Their route took them through Cape Nome, Solomon, Bluffs, White Mountain School, Moses, Dime Creek, and Candle, each village giving her a welcoming all-night party. Meusebach–Zesch stayed in Kotzebue for a month. At Noorvik they stayed overnight with an Inuit family in a barabara, a semisubterranean sod housing. Kiana was the final clinic. Returning, they witnessed the aurora borealis at Kotzebue, and spent the night at a barabara built inside a snow bank. Half the dog team fell through the ice near Cape Douglas, and Johnson advised leaving them to drown. Meusebach–Zesch crawled flat on her abdomen across the thin ice herself to save the dogs. Meusebach–Zesch serviced Inuit on Little Diomede Island, Saint Lawrence Island, King Island, Cape Prince of Wales. Chartering a plane to Point Barrow in 1929, she survived a crash and walked partway to Kotzebue before being transported by an Inuit whose water craft was pulled along by his dogs on the beach. In March 1928, Meusebach–Zesch and her assistant Mrs. Cheney scheduled dental clinics at the White Mountain School for Inuit children, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Mission at Pilgrim Hot Springs, and in Council. Because of the lateness of the season and expected break-up of ice and snow, Meusebach–Zesch had trouble finding dogs for the sled, and was unable to hire a man to mush the dogs. She and Mrs. Cheney set off alone with a dog team. Between Cape Nome and Solomon Roadhouse, a blizzard left Meusebach–Zesch snow blind and bedridden for a week. After they completed all scheduled work, they were advised against traveling back to Nome in the inclement conditions. Dire predictions turned to reality when they found themselves stranded, an estimated 30 miles from Nome. The dogs had given up, and they were not even able to make it to the nearest roadhouse. Meusebach–Zesch had begun to believe they might die. Leonhard Seppala, known for winning multiple-year dog sled races, and for participating in the 1925 serum run to Nome, had been alerted about the women's hazardous trek. He hired a caterpillar tractor to search for them, rescuing the women on March 31, 1928. California 1930–1944 In 1930, Meusebach–Zesch returned to California. In 1931 she accompanied her mother to Texas for her mother's recuperation from an illness. Leaving her mother in Texas, she returned to Oakland. The Great Depression was in full swing, and she did not feel there would be sufficient new patients who could afford her services. She met Carl Rhodehamel and joined the Unemployed Exchange Association (UXA), offering her dental services on an exchange basis. The UXA was organized July 20, 1932, in Oakland by unemployed electrical engineer Rhodehamel. The concept behind the organization was for the unemployed to help each other through a type of bartering system. Instead of working for money, they worked for points that would be traded for services of other members in the organization. Meusebach–Zesch remained a member of the UXA until at least 1934, commuting to semi-monthly meetings during breaks from her work with the Civilian Conservation Corps. The state of California instituted a labor program in 1931 to ease unemployment by creating labor camps purposed toward improving and protecting the state's forests and watershed areas. Volunteers received food, shelter and clothing in return for their services. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) with Executive Order 6106. The CCC employed men ages 17 through 28 creating infrastructure, working with the United States Forest Service to fight fires and plant trees, and creating and improving parks. In California, three million young men of the CCC spent nine years improving the state's environment and creating most of the state's park system. In return, they received $30 a month and an education. In 1933, Meusebach–Zesch and her mother moved to Railroad Flat in Calaveras County, at the suggestion of her mother's doctor. Meusebach–Zesch worked out an arrangement with the CCC to provide on- site dental services to the young laborers at the Calaveras camps in Rich Gulch and Angel's Camp, as well as Bear River in Amador County. The government paid for emergency services, and the men paid for their own non-emergency services. For the next four years, she performed dental services on an estimated 4,000 young men. During these years, she also serviced unemployment camps and school children. When it became apparent that the CCC would enlist the services of the Dental Reserve Corps, eliminating the need for her services, she appealed directly to Major McCrystal, head of the CCC in San Francisco. She was turned down, based on her gender. On July 2, 1937, Meusebach–Zesch became dentist for the California Institute for Women at Tehachapi, and operated a private practice in the same city. She provided dentistry to migrant laborers through the Public Works Administration, and to convict labor camps through the California highway department. Death Elizabeth von Meusebach–Zesch died in 1943 at age 81. Leonie died in Oakland on July 7, 1944, at age 61. Leota Zesch Gillis died in 1979 at age 93. All three women are buried in a single grave in the Marschall–Meusebach Cemetery in Cherry Spring, Texas. In 2012, Leonie was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.

He produced and directed The Ballet of Change, a series of four short films that were projected onto London landmarks. His video-diary Our London Lives is in the permanent collection of the Museum of London. Early life Atherton was three months old when he was abandoned in a tent at a disused airport in Cardiff but placed with a white foster family shortly after. Atherton grew up in the village of Ystrad Mynach in South Wales. He left home at 15, when he spent time in children's homes, and at 16 set up home on his own against the wishes of Social Services and started work on a Youth Training Scheme in Howells (department store). He was appointed the Welsh Young Conservatives Press Officer later that year and focused on addressing the issues of homelessness with a programme working with Sixth Forms in schools in Cardiff. He is a graduate of Cardiff Business School. Career In 2002, Atherton got his start in filmmaking with a four-week apprenticeship at British cookery channel UK Food and UK Style. He set up his own production company Simple TV Production in 2004. Then in 2005, Atherton served as producer of Silent Voices, a television docudrama about domestic violence, which premiered on the Community channel (UK) and was later reissued as a DVD to raise funds for the National Centre for Domestic Violence. =The Ballet of Change= The Ballet of Change is a series of four films (approximately 4 minutes) produced and directed by Atherton in 2007. Funding was provided by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Atherton got permission to premiere each films at the landmark in question (Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square and London Bridge). Music specially written for the films was available for download from a website, and many of the 600 people who watched the screening in Piccadilly Circus brought MP3 players with them for this purpose. Atherton said that his purpose in creating the films was to make available to a wider audience the images hidden in archives, so that more people could engage with London's history. The film about Piccadilly Circus was the first film ever shown on the Piccadilly Circus Coca-Cola billboard. =Colour Blind 2009= In 2009 Atherton produced the short film Colour Blind 2009 directed by Amanda Baker which premiered at the British Urban Film Festival the same year.

The player controls a wave of light as it transmits through space and is able to modify the wave's amplitude and wavelength to line it up with objectives, avoid obstacles, and interact with objects that affect the path of the wave, and the world around it, in various ways. Development Waveform was Eden Industries' debut game. The company's founder, Ryan Vandendyck, spent three years developing the game in his spare time while still holding a full time position at Next Level Games. The game was inspired by Auditorium and Orbient. Eden Industries sought to crowdfund $8,000 towards the game's development through Kickstarter in November 2011. The crowdfunding campaign concluded unsuccessfully in January 2012. Despite the failure of the campaign, the game was released in March 2012. Gameplay In Waveform, the player controls a particle of light on a mission from the outer reaches of the solar system to the sun. Instead of controlling the particle directly, the amplitude and frequency of its wave pattern can be changed with the mouse. Stretching and shrinking its path is necessary to collect photons, avoid dark matter, and go through light gates, which increase the point multiplier and score. As the player progresses through the solar system, they encounter mirrors, wormholes, asteroids, gas clouds, fireworks, and particle accelerators that can change the particle's path, clear away obstacles, or destroy the particle outright. The photon path also becomes trickier, forcing the player to change their wavelength mid-arc to collect them and avoid damage. Some stages require a certain number of stars to unlock; stars are earned by improving scores on previous levels. Reception Waveform was generally well received by both critics and gamers upon release, garnering an average critic score of 81 from 8 reviews on Metacritic. Gaming Nexus gave the game an \\"A\\", praising the uniqueness of the game \\"Gamers looking for a truly unique and innovative experience shouldn't hesitate to add Waveform to their list of must-play games this year\\". Darkstation gave Waveform 9/10 stating \\"It is elegant in its simplicity, but don't let that fool you... there's a surprisingly large amount of game and replayability to be had. I see myself coming back to this game often\\". Destructoid also praised Waveform however said \\"Wave manipulation is a neat concept -- one I don't recall encountering in this form before -- but despite admirable attempts to introduce slight tweaks to the formula, it is eventually stretched to its limit\\" Downloadable content Eden Industries, at this moment in time, has created one piece of downloadable content. Waveform: Eris was released on June 4, 2012. Eris is a world of discord and darkness; the player is tasked with restoring the light to a new planet. Eris adds seven new levels to explore, another reverse mode bonus level, a new object called the Pulsar and five new achievements.

Definitions Diagram illustrating the definition of the trilinear polar of a point. Let ABC be a plane triangle and let P be any point in the plane of the triangle not lying on the sides of the triangle. Briefly, the trilinear polar of P is the axis of perspectivity of the cevian triangle of P and the triangle ABC. In detail, let the line AP, BP, CP meet the sidelines BC, CA, AB at D, E, F respectively. Triangle DEF is the cevian triangle of P with reference to triangle ABC. Let the pairs of line (BC, EF), (CA, FD), (DE, AB) intersect at X, Y, Z respectively. By Desargues' theorem the points X, Y, Z are collinear. The line of collinearity is the axis of perspectivity of triangle ABC and triangle DEF. The line XYZ is the trilinear polar of the point P. The points X, Y, Z can also be obtained as the harmonic conjugates of D, E, F with respect to the pairs of points (B,C), (C, A), (A, B) respectively. Poncelet used this idea to define the concept of trilinear polars. If the line L is the trilinear polar of the point P with respect to the reference triangle ABC then P is called the trilinear pole of the line L with respect to the reference triangle ABC. Trilinear equation Let the trilinear coordinates of the point P be (p : q : r). Then the trilinear equation of the trilinear polar of P is :x / p + y / q + z / r = 0. Construction of the trilinear pole Diagram illustrating the construction of the trilinear pole of a given line XYZ Let the line L meet the sides BC, CA, AB of triangle ABC at X, Y, Z respectively. Let the pairs of lines (BY, CZ), (CZ, AX), (AX, BY) meet at U, V, W. Triangles ABC and UVW are in perspective and let P be the center of perspectivity. P is the trilinear pole of the line L. Some trilinear polars Some of the trilinear polars are well known. *The trilinear polar of the centroid of triangle ABC is the line at infinity. *The trilinear polar of the symmedian point is the Lemoine axis of triangle ABC. *The trilinear polar of the orthocenter is the orthic axis. *Trilinear polars are not defined for points coinciding with the vertices of triangle ABC. Poles of pencils of lines Animation illustrating the fact that the locus of the trilinear poles of a pencil of lines passing through a fixed point K is a circumconic of the reference triangle. Let P with trilinear coordinates ( X : Y : Z ) be the pole of a line passing through a fixed point K with trilinear coordinates ( x0 : y0 : z0 ). Equation of the line is * x / X + y / Y + z / Z =0. Since this passes through K, * x0 / X + y0 / Y + z0 / Z =0. Thus the locus of P is * x0 / x + y0 / y + z0 / z =0. This is a circumconic of the triangle of reference ABC.

A very complete catalogue with detailed specifications was issued at the same time. As well as the engine's smaller bore the 15-20 differed from the 25-30 by being only available with a live rear axle and not chain-drive. Otherwise the specifications were the same, the very minor differences are detailed below. Only four cars were manufactured. It was replaced by the 18-24 in 1907. Engine The engine has four separately cast vertical cylinders with interchangeable inlet and exhaust valves, five bearings to the crankshaft, an independent casting for the crank-chamber and easily removable camshafts. Absolute synchronism has been enabled for the combustion cycle. The valve-gear and the ignition gear for the low tension igniters are adjustable and the lift of the valves and the firing moment of each igniter may be adjusted while the engine is running. A circulating pump constantly lubricates all moving parts except the pistons which are fed separately from a fitting on the dashboard. An automatic governor connected to the throttle valve, a small hand-lever above the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal allows the maintenance of any desired speed. At the normal running speed of 900 rpm this engine develops 22 bhp. The 15-20 is provided with a 12-gallon rather than 15-gallon fuel tank and slightly smaller tyres are fitted. Transmission The main clutch is multiple-disc type with metal to metal friction surfaces running in oil. The change-speed gear is designed on \\"Mercedes\\" lines using ball-bearings and it provides four forward speeds. Each shaft has three bearings. The sliding portion of the mechanism is enclosed. There is no joint that can leak. The live axles are connected to the mainframe by a torque-rod as well as by radius-rods. The live shafts inside the back axle take none of the weight of the car. All road wheels have ball-bearings. Chassis frame The frame is pressed steel, narrowed at the front, raised at the rear to clear the axle. Its side members are formed of one piece with the under-frame carrying engine and gear-box. Brakes suspension steering All road wheels as well as the easily adjusted steering gear and the steering-heads have ball bearings. There is no mention of suspension or braking systems. The omission of a mention of brakes was remedied in the advertisement displayed below – there was a pedal- operated brake on the countershaft and a hand-operated lever on internal- acting brakes on the back wheels.

The Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision (BPSS) is part of the New York State Education Department (NYSED). Bureau Structure The bureau was established to oversee educational quality of non-degree granting schools in the state of New York, including trade and business schools, English Second Language Schools (ESL), and others. Most of these schools are geared towards the adult population, providing education and job training. The Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision provides licenses to these proprietary schools and teachers so the programs offered meet state standards. All segments of a school's operation are reviewed including financial standing, ownership structure, personnel, teaching methods, and marketing materials. The bureau has only 20 staff members to cover 500 schools, which has led to criticism of their ability to adequately manage schools. The bureau works together with local, state, and federal organizations to review the safety and equipment of all the schools. This includes investigations into student complaints, and reviews of schools to ensure compliance with Education Law and Commissioner's Regulations. =Licensing= In order to be licensed as a proprietary school within New York State, organizations must undergo a licensing process wherein they submit various documents, including: an application for a school license, proof of type of ownership (e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation), financial documents, curriculum applications, and school prepared forms. Controversy In 2009, the New York's Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision abruptly changed its policy on regulating yoga studio training and threatened those organization with a criminal fine of up to $50,000, although the department noted that they had received zero complaints about subpar yoga training. Until that point, no yoga studio in the state had ever applied for or received a license to train future yoga instructors, which was the alleged crime. Yoga studios were forced to undergo a \\"nightmarish\\" application process which put some smaller yoga studios at risk of shutting down permanently, since the process could take up to a year. The initiative was criticized, and the Bureau of Proprietary School Supervision was forced to abandon this tactic after New York Governor David Paterson signed a bill into law exempting yoga studios from the licensing process.

It is about a teenager who builds a Whirligig in each of the corners of the United States in order to pay restitution (and to find redemption for himself) after he kills another person, by accident, in a suicide attempt by car crash. Plot Seventeen- year-old Brent Bishop has moved with his parents in Chicago, Illinois. He goes to a party in an attempt to fit in and become popular. He decides to talk to Brianna, a girl at the party. She yells at him to stop bothering her and to leave her alone. The entire group hears this. Chaz, the party host, mocks him for his actions at the party. Angered, Brent retaliates and then drives away and tries to kill himself by crashing his car. He says that he has control over his life and everyone else around him are pawns, powerless. Brent then crashes into a car being driven by a girl named Lea Zamora. Lea dies in the crash; however, Brent survives the crash. Instead of a conventional prison sentence, Brent agrees to a form of restitution chosen by Lea's mother. Lea's mother tells Brent to build and place four whirligigs at each corner of the Contiguous United States in order to memorialize and carry on Lea's philanthropic ideals. Brent agrees to this, as he feels guilty for his actions. He receives a bus pass and supplies to help him build his whirligigs. When Brent arrives at Bellevue, Washington he starts to make his first whirligig, a harpist. There, he meets a cyclist who plays Go, who teaches him about the movement of life. In San Diego, California, Brent wanted to stay at a hostel but they tell him that only foreign travelers can stay there. The clerk told him facts about Canada and let him in. He meets a foreign student named Emil at the hostel. Before leaving San Diego, he makes his second whirligig, a mermaid on top of a whale. In Miami, Florida, he ponders the concepts of religion. With the help of some children on the beach, Brent makes his penultimate whirligig, a marching band. His last whirligig was built in Weeksboro, Maine, a model of Lea Zamora which spun its arms in the wind. After that he meets a female painter who realizes Brent's problems and helps him, allowing him to finally realize he was free. He decides to place a whirligig in every state, eventually face his parents and Lea's mother again. The whirligigs left behind to impact the lives of other people that come across them long after Brent has left that area of the United States. They include a girl named Steph from Weeksboro who has a friend that wants to give her a boyfriend, a Puerto Rican street sweeper nicknamed Flaco in Miami looking for quiet time, a Korean boy named Anthony in Bellevue who is desperate to play baseball, and a girl named Jenny in San Diego worried about her grandmother. Style The novel alternates the perspective of the narration every chapter. Among these are Brent, whose perspective takes up every other chapter starting with Chapter 1. In the other chapters, Anthony, Jenny, Caleb, TJ, Flaco and Steph are introduced. They are all profoundly impacted by the whirligigs left behind by Brent.

Appearance Elacatinus evelinae Elacatinus evelynae is a very small, torpedo-shaped fish. It can reach a maximum length of . It has a yellow stripe in front of each eye that joins to form a V near the tip of its snout. Black stripes run under the yellow ones from the snout, over the lower part of the eye to the end of the caudal fin. E. evelynae's fin configuration is the same as all other gobies. Its dorsal fin is split in two, with a rounded anterior fin and a flat posterior fin which lines up with its anal fin. The pectoral fins are almost circular. All its fins are transparent. Habitat They inhabit coral reefs in clear ocean waters at a depth of . The reported temperature range where they are found is . Diet E. evelynae is a cleaner fish as indicated by one of its common names, the Caribbean cleaning goby. They feed on ectoparasites found on other fish. Females tend to clean and feed more than males especially if they are accompanied by a large male, which may be due to mate guarding and the male spending more time guarding the eggs. Reproduction They are monogamous and are usually found in pairs near coral heads. Both males and females show aggression towards potential intruders of the same sex to protect their mates. Attempts to breed them in captivity have shown that they do not produce eggs unless conditions are optimal, with little to no fluctuation in temperature and salinity.

Copenhaver (born December 21, 1942) is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and History at The University of California, Los Angeles. He teaches and writes about philosophy, religion and science in late medieval and early modern Europe. Career Copenhaver was educated at Loyola College (Baltimore), Creighton University and The University of Kansas, before doing post-doctoral studies at the Warburg Institute. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, past President of the Journal of the History of Philosophy and a member of the Council of the Instituto Nazionale di Studi sul Rinascimento in Italy. He serves or has served on the boards of Renaissance Quarterly, Annals of Science, the Journal of the History of Ideas, Early Science and Medicine, the International Archives of the History of Ideas, and the I Tatti Renaissance Library. He was the charter co-editor of Magic, Ritual and Witchcraft, and is the Editor of the History of Philosophy Quarterly, His research has been supported by the Guggenheim Foundation, the Getty Trust, the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Philosophical Society, the Medieval Academy of America and by a Fulbright Scholarship. Scholarship Copenhaver studies magic and related beliefs and practices – astrology, demonology, divination, Kabbalah – as parts of normative philosophy and science as they were a few centuries ago. His research shows that magic and other \\"occult\\" beliefs and practices were supported primarily by the philosophy and science of Aristotle and Aristotelian scholasticism, which dominated European culture from the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries. When confidence in Aristotelianism collapsed in the seventeenth century, magic and its attendant beliefs collapsed with it as serious issues for Europe's leading thinkers. He also studies the ancient Greek and Latin Hermetica, writings from late antiquity ascribed by Renaissance scholars to an ancient Egyptian god, Thoth, whose Greek name is Hermes Trismegistus. Although this legendary Hermes has often been identified as a divine patron of magic, Copenhaver has shown that the Greek Hermetic texts recovered in the fifteenth century by Marsilio Ficino are not about magic: their topic is a religious practice aiming at personal salvation. Copenhaver's work on Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Lorenzo Valla, both famed as Renaissance humanists, goes in two very different directions: Pico as the inventor of Christian Kabbalah; Valla as the scourge of scholastic logic. Copenhaver shows that Pico's famous Oration on the Dignity of Man is not about the dignity of man. (Pico did not give it that title.) Instead, the speech is a manifesto for ascetic mysticism, urging the pious to abandon the body and escape the material world through magic and Kabbalah. Like Pico, Valla was a master of the Latin language and an acute student of philosophy. Unlike Pico, Valla had little influence on his time and place through the work that Copenhaver has studied, the Dialectical Disputations, whose main target is Peter of Spain's Summary of Logic, written in the thirteenth century but still Europe's leading textbook of logic when Valla wrote his Disputations. Although Valla's contemporaries paid little attention to it, his Disputations foreshadows what we now call \\"philosophy of language\\". Both Valla and Pico lived during a great era of Italian intellectual life, starting with Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio in the fourteenth century and ending with Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella and Galileo in the seventeenth century. In the nineteenth century, Italian philosophers worked out the grand narrative of Italian thought in this earlier period – the Renaissance – and afterward: the construction of this story as an artifact of modern Italian politics, especially the Risorgimento and the Fascist regime, is another topic that Copenhaver has explored. Contributions to higher education During his ten years as Provost of UCLA’s College of Letters and Science, Copenhaver led successful efforts to revamp UCLA’s General Education curriculum, implement a stronger writing requirement and make the Internet and Web technology an integral part of academic life for students and faculty. He was also instrumental in the College’s fund-raising campaign, raising five times more than the previous capital campaign. On his watch, UCLA’s College became the first in the country to establish a website – supported by student fees – for every undergraduate course. In response to the September 11 attacks, he worked with Vice-Provost Judi Smith to design the first offering of UCLA’s renowned Fiat Lux courses, and to recruit faculty to teach them on short notice. Copenhaver is currently teaching his own online course, while advising other faculty and staff about this new – and controversial – way to teach and learn. Published works Copenhaver's articles examine magic, astrology, the Hermetica, Kabbalah and their foundations in Neoplatonic, Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy; natural philosophy; scepticism; Averroism; philosophical translation; modern Italian philosophy; historiography; the classical tradition in philosophy; Lorenzo Valla; Marsilio Ficino; Giovanni Pico della Mirandola; Polydore Vergil; Tommaso Campanella; Isaac Newton; Henry More; and Benedetto Croce.

The killing occurred on Friday, March 16, 1984, and was captured on camera by a news television crew. Although Plauché shot and killed Doucet, he was given a seven-year suspended sentence with five years' probation and 300 hours of community service for the shooting and received no prison sentence. The case received wide publicity because some people questioned whether Plauché should have been charged with murder or let off. Plauché stated that he was in the right, and that those in a similar position would have done the same thing.  Kidnapping by Doucet  Gary Plauché lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was separated from his wife, June, at the time of the shooting. During 1983 and 1984, his 11-year-old son, Jody Plauché, was taking karate lessons with an instructor, 25-year-old Jeffrey Doucet, who had been sexually abusing the boy for at least a year. In February 1984, Doucet kidnapped Jody and took him to a motel in California where he sexually assaulted and molested him. Police searched the country for Jody, and he was eventually found after Doucet allowed the boy to place a collect call to his mother from the motel. California police raided the motel and arrested Doucet without incident. On March 1, 1984, Jody was returned to his family in Louisiana, but Gary, who was 38 at the time, heard reports that Doucet had sexually assaulted his son. In an interview with a news television crew, Gary said that he did not know what to do and just felt helpless.  Doucet's killing by Plauché  On March 16, 1984, Doucet was flown back from California to Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport, also known as Ryan Field, to face trial. Doucet arrived and was led in handcuffs by police officers through the airport at around 9:30 p.m., where Plauché was waiting for Doucet with a gun. Plauché was friends with several high-ranking police officers in the Baton Rouge Police Department; while many people believed that these contacts told Plauché where and when Doucet would be arriving, it was actually an employee of the local ABC affiliate WBRZ-TV who gave Plauché the information. A news crew from WBRZ-TV was also waiting for Doucet and had set up their cameras to record his arrival. Opposite the news crew was a bank of pay telephones, where Plauché waited while talking to his best friend on a telephone. He wore a baseball cap and sunglasses, so no one recognized him. As Doucet was escorted through the airport, he passed the news crew who were taping the scene. He then walked past Plauché, who took out his gun and fired a single shot, directly at the right side of Doucet's head, at point-blank range. Doucet immediately fell to the floor, bleeding from a wound close to his right ear. As depicted in the video of the incident, Plauché placed the telephone receiver down before officers restrained him and removed the gun from his other hand and then attended to Doucet. Officers grabbed hold of Plauché and recognized who he was at once. They kept him pinned against the bank of telephones, asking him as captured on camera, \\"Gary, why? Why, Gary?\\" The entire incident was captured on ENG videotape. Doucet died the next day.  Aftermath  Plauché was initially charged with second-degree murder, but agreed to a plea bargain in which he pleaded no contest to manslaughter. He was sentenced to seven years suspended, with five years' probation and 300 hours of community service, which he completed in 1989. Psychological reports helped Plauché's case after it was learned that Doucet had abused Jody months prior to the kidnapping. Edward P. Uzee examined Plauché and determined that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong when he killed Doucet. Plauché's defense team argued that he was driven to a temporarily psychotic state after learning of the abuse of his son. Uzee also determined that Doucet had the ability to manipulate others and took advantage of the fact that Plauché was separated from his wife at the time, and had managed to wedge his way into the Plauché family. Judge Frank Saia ruled that sending Plauché to prison would not help anyone, and that there was virtually no risk of him committing another crime. The video of Plauché killing Doucet has been featured on many television programs and documentaries, including the 2002 Michael Moore documentary Bowling for Columbine and the 1993 shockumentary Traces of Death. The footage has also been uploaded to YouTube, where the video has received more than 20 million views. In March, 2020 the uncensored version of the video was taken down and has been since re-uploaded censored. The video featured on YouTube was taken from the television series Anatomy of Crime, which aired in 2000 on Court TV and was produced by John Langley, the creator of Cops. Before his death Plauché gave one last interview where he said that he didn't regret it and admitted he would do it again. In August 2019, Jody Plauché released his book \\"Why, Gary, Why?\\": The Jody Plauché Story.  Death  Plauché suffered a stroke in 2011 and died in 2014 at a nursing home after another stroke, aged 68.

In 1843, President Martin Van Buren issued a commission dated 5 October 1838 to Philemon S. Parker, of New York, as consul. At times during the 19th and early 20th centuries, a consular agency at Karachi was under its jurisdiction. Effective 1 July 1945, it was raised to a Consulate General, with Consul General Howard Donovan as the principal officer. The consulate operated from Wankaner House, later renamed Lincoln House, located at Breach Candy in south Mumbai from 1957. (The consular residence was Washington House on Altamount Road). The building, declared as a heritage site, is an erstwhile palace of Maharaja Wankaner. The palace was handed over to the U.S. consulate by the Maharaja to raise funds to pay off his taxes, after India became independent. In 2002, the consulate decided to shift its office to northern suburbs owing to security reasons. Since 21 November 2011, all sections of the U.S. Consulate General Mumbai are located at a new facility in Bandra Kurla Complex.

Education  He was born in Düsseldorf in 1946 and studied psychology, art and film. Ulrich Hensel did a number of different series of works (e.g. Middle East and North Africa, 1967-1975, India, 1981-1990, local deities in North and in South India, 1995-1997) but since 1991 he has been focusing on images of construction sites.

Andreas Gursky, with whom for some time he shared a flat, is said to be a fan of his work. Gurskys famous image Gasherd from 1980 was shot in their flat.

His images are often abstract and sometimes minimalist – \\"grids, dots, fastenings and iron grilles extend across the pictures in rigorous formations defined by the functions of the objects shown\\" – and inevitably create associations with the geometric abstract art of Kazimir Malevich Die Entdeckung der Wirklichkeit – Photographie an der Kunstakademie Düsseldorf von 1970 bis Heute (2011).

The technical world of rebars, Lintels, insulation, wall markings, cladding and steel bars in his works are the metaphors to works from Mark Rothko, Donald Judd as well as Cy Twombly.

His work has been exhibited internationally in Germany, the United States, Italy, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. His broad practice includes the creation of sculpture, collage, computer animation, computer generated graphics and interaction design. He is regarded a key figure in Post-Internet art.  Work  In his work he investigates how algorithms can analyse digital archives and guide the artist in aesthetic decision taking, leading to a symbiosis of man- machine art creation. Using computer programming he describes traditional notions in art, such as for example the free use of intuition and expression. Conclusions from this research are then fed back in the production of new work.His ultimate goal is to reveal the reasoning structure of his own consciousness, and his implicit associations and assumptions.

He then says he didn't know her like he thought he knew her. He confesses that he's never worked as hard for a woman as he had with Madison, trying to break down her barriers. Brady then tells Madison to leave the Kiriakis Mansion and to never look his way again, officially ending his relationship with her.

Selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione, corticosteroids, imidazole antifungals, and salicylic acid are common anti-seborrheics. Ideal anti-seborrheic An ideal antiseborrheic should have the following qualities: *It should be non-toxic. *It should relieve pruritus. *It should not cause excessive dryness. *It should have a wide antibacterial and antifungal spectrum. Specific anti- seborrheic agents =Selenium sulfide= Selenium sulfide slows down epidermal proliferation. It is fungicidal to Pityrosporum ovale. It also acts as an anti-keratolytic. Selenium sulfide is also known to reduce dryness of scalp and folliculitis. Systemic toxicity can appear if it is applied to inflamed skin. Hypersensitivity reactions are noted in some people. =Zinc pyrithione= Like selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione (a zinc complex with two chelating pyrithione anions) also reduces epidermal turnover and inhibits fungal growth. It is often administered with ketoconazole for better results. The symptoms do not resolve completely even after prolonged medication. =Corticosteroids= Topical steroids are used to relieve the symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. It has a fungicidal action, and reduces dandruff. The disadvantage is that it has a high relapse rate on discontinuation. Prolonged use can cause poor healing of wounds. =Imidazole antifungals= Only a few imidazole antifungals are effective against seborrheic dermatitis. Ketoconazole was found to be the most active against Pityrosporum ovale. It is available in both oral and topical formulations. It is also available as cream, gel and tablet. Unlike other drugs, it does not cause skin irritation or phototoxicity. Clotrimazole is also used in treating seborrhoea. =Other drugs= Other drugs like sulfur and resorcinol have also been found useful in treating seborrheic dermatitis. These drugs have keratolytic and antiseptic properties which may benefit seborrhoea. Salicylic acid has a mild effect on seborrhoea.

Fewster, a friend and professional colleague of Edward Jenner, played an important role in the discovery of the smallpox vaccine. In 1768 Fewster realized that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox.George Pearson, ed., An Inquiry Concerning the History of the Cowpox, Principally with a View to Supersede and Extinguish the Smallpox (London, England: J. Johnson, 1798), pp. 102-104.Many sources claim that in 1765, Fewster read a paper to the Medical Society of London titled \\"Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox\\". However, the Medical Society of London was created in 1773. See: * History of the Medical Society of London * Wikipedia's article: \\"Medical Society of London\\" Furthermore, the earliest insinuation that Fewster had written a paper titled \\"Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox\\" appeared in 1886. See: * L. Thurston and G. Williams (2015) \\"An examination of John Fewster’s role in the discovery of smallpox vaccination,\\" Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, 45 : 173-179; see p.177. By Fewster's own account ((Pearson, 1798), p. 102), he merely \\" … communicated this fact [that prior infection with cowpox provides immunity to smallpox] to a society, of which I was then a member, … \\". He made no mention of having written a paper on the subject. In 1768, Fewster noted that two brothers (named Creed) had both been variolated (purposefully infected with smallpox) but that one did not react at all to variolation. On questioning, this subject had never had smallpox, but had previously contracted cowpox. This prompted Fewster to wonder whether cowpox might protect against smallpox, a notion of which he was previously unaware. He is reported to have discussed this possibility over a Convivio-Medical Society dinner at the Ship Inn in Alveston. He also encouraged others to take up the inquiry. Amongst those at the meeting was Edward Jenner, a young medical apprentice at the time. Fewster followed up this observation, but only to a limited extent and not in writing. In 1796, Fewster was called to visit a local boy who was ill with early smallpox and was asked by John Player, the boy’s uncle, whether he would consider inoculating the boy with cowpox to save him from smallpox. According to Player Fewster replied that he had already thought of this but had decided against it as, in his view, variolation was very successful and an alternative seemed unnecessary. Nonetheless, Player reports, Fewster went on to inoculate three children in Thornbury with cowpox, during spring 1796. These vaccinations took place at around the same time as Jenner's first vaccination attempts. Fewster never made any claim to have discovered vaccination.

At the urging of his elder brother John Albert I, the cathedral chapter appointed Christopher as the successor of Bishop Christopher I of Ratzeburg in 1554. Christopher thus became the first Lutheran administrator of the Bishopric. In 1555, he was also elected coadjutor of Bishop William of Riga, with the right of succession. His election was controversial and led to armed clashes. During a clash on 1 July 1556 in Koknese, Christoper and William were both taken prisoner. They were released in 1557, and Christopher was recognized as coadjutor. However, when William died in 1563, Christopher found himself unable to exercise his right of succession. Instead, he was taken prisoner again during renewed fighting against Poland. He was released in 1569, after he had renounced all claims on Riga. After his release, he returned to Mecklenburg. He died on 4 March 1592 at Tempzin Abbey and was buried in the northern chapel of the high choir of Schwerin Cathedral.

Algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 that are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction are susceptible to this kind of attack. The SHA-3 algorithm is not susceptible. When a Merkle–Damgård based hash is misused as a message authentication code with construction H(secret ‖ message), and message and the length of secret is known, a length extension attack allows anyone to include extra information at the end of the message and produce a valid hash without knowing the secret. Since HMAC does not use this construction, HMAC hashes are not prone to length extension attacks.  Explanation  The vulnerable hashing functions work by taking the input message, and using it to transform an internal state. After all of the input has been processed, the hash digest is generated by outputting the internal state of the function. It is possible to reconstruct the internal state from the hash digest, which can then be used to process the new data. In this way, one may extend the message and compute the hash that is a valid signature for the new message.  Example  A server for delivering waffles of a specified type to a specific user at a location could be implemented to handle requests of the given format: Original Data: count=10⪫=37.351&user;_id=1&long;=-119.827&waffle;=eggo Original Signature: 6d5f807e23db210bc254a28be2d6759a0f5f5d99 The server would perform the request given (to deliver ten waffles of type eggo to the given location for user \\"1\\" only if the signature is valid for the user). The signature used here is a MAC, signed with a key not known to the attacker. (This example is also vulnerable to a replay attack, by sending the same request and signature a second time.) It is possible for an attacker to modify the request, in this example switching the requested waffle from \\"eggo\\" to \\"liege.\\" This can be done by taking advantage of a flexibility in the message format if duplicate content in the query string gives preference to the latter value. This flexibility does not indicate an exploit in the message format, because the message format was never designed to be cryptographically secure in the first place, without the signature algorithm to help it. Desired New Data: count=10⪫=37.351&user;_id=1&long;=-119.827&waffle;=eggo&waffle;=liege In order to sign this new message, typically the attacker would need to know the key the message was signed with, and generate a new signature by generating a new MAC. However, with a length extension attack, it is possible to feed the hash (the signature given above) into the state of the hashing function, and continue where the original request had left off, so long as you know the length of the original request. In this request, the original key's length was 14 bytes, which could be determined by trying forged requests with various assumed lengths, and checking which length results in a request that the server accepts as valid. The message as fed into the hashing function is often padded, as many algorithms can only work on input messages whose lengths are a multiple of some given size. The content of this padding is always specified by the hash function used. The attacker must include all of these padding bits in their forged message before the internal states of their message and the original will line up. Thus, the attacker constructs a slightly different message using these padding rules: New Data: count=10⪫=37.351&user;_id=1&long;=-119.827&waffle;=eggo\\\\x80\\\\x00\\\\x00 \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x02\\\\x28&waffle;=liege This message includes all of the padding that was appended to the original message inside of the hash function before their payload (in this case, a 0x80 followed by a number of 0x00s and a message length, 0x228 = 552 = (14+55)*8, which is the length of the key plus the original message, appended at the end). The attacker knows that the state behind the hashed key/message pair for the original message is identical to that of new message up to the final \\"&.\\" The attacker also knows the hash digest at this point, which means they know the internal state of the hashing function at that point. It is then trivial to initialize a hashing algorithm at that point, input the last few characters, and generate a new digest which can sign their new message without the original key. New Signature: 0e41270260895979317fff3898ab85668953aaa2 By combining the new signature and new data into a new request, the server will see the forged request as a valid request due to the signature being the same as it would have been generated if the password was known.

Shooting At about 7:30 p.m. on 23 July, Ramesh Sharma, who was assigned to guard duty at the Pashupatinath temple that day, entered a tea shop adjacent to the temple, armed with a Lee–Enfield rifle and his pockets filled with cartridges. He aimed his rifle at the shop owner's nephew, Pradeep, and asked him \\"Should I shoot you?\\", before killing him. Sharma next shot at Rakesh Jain, owner of an idol shop at the temple, hitting him in the shoulder. While Jain stumbled into the nearby Hanuman temple, Motia Bai, owner of another shop in the area, started shouting at Sharma angrily. Sharma shot dead both Motia and her son Hari, before turning his attention back to Jain. After taking off his shoes he entered the temple and shot Jain at point-blank range through his abdomen. Sharma then put his shoes back on and left. Outside he was approached by another policeman posted at the temple that evening, Kanhaiyalal Dube, who wanted to calm him down. Before Dube could intervene, Sharma shot him dead. The gunman then entered the Pashupatinath temple where an aarti, attended by about 60 people, had just begun. Sharma fired a few shots at the pilgrims, wounding several of them, before shouting to halt the aarti, though the priest, Ramachandra Shukla, apparently unaware of what was going on, raised his hand to silence him. Sharma killed the priest by shooting him in his arm and head. At around 7:45 p.m. Sharma left the temple area and headed towards the town, where he killed another seven people in the streets. Police by then were already notified, but it took them another 40 minutes to stop the gunman. At about 8:20 p.m. Sharma was engaged by policeman Mewa Lai. He fired a shot at the officer that missed its target and killed an 18-year-old woman named Sakina. Mewa Lai then returned fire and killed Sharma with a shot in the chest.

It is found in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea.  Description  The green finger sponge usually has upright or sprawling cylindrical branches that occasionally divide. The branches are about in diameter and can grow to in length. Young individuals and some large specimens have an encrusting habit. They grow over the surface of a rock in a layer a few millimetres thick with occasional short chimney- like outgrowths. Other individuals have a number of vertical tubes, each with a large opening called an osculum at the end. These variations in growth habit led to the belief that several different species of sponge were involved. However, specimens growing in reef caves often have an encrusting base with a central, finger-like cluster of branches, so it is now believed that the different forms are a single species, perhaps differing in structure because of different environmental conditions. In the branched form, the osculi are found on the upper side of the branches and may be slightly raised above the surrounding tissue. The consistency of the sponge is soft but resilient, and when squeezed, it exudes a purple fluid. The general colour of the sponge is purplish black but there is often a layer of bright green cells on the epidermis. These have dendritic patterns on the surface and cover sub-surface canals which lead to the osculi.  Distribution and habitat  The green finger sponge is found in the Caribbean Sea at depths varying from . Its range includes the West Indies, the Bahamas, southern Florida, Venezuela and northern Brazil, but it is absent from Bermuda. It inhabits reefs, the deeper water outside the reef crests and the underside and surfaces of rocks in shallow bays.  Biology  The golden zoanthid (Parazoanthus swiftii), a colonial coral, is often found twined round the sponge in a symbiotic relationship. The polyps look like small sea anemones and contain toxins which deter predatory fish from eating the sponge. The coral benefits from the increased volume of food particles its polyps can capture as water is drawn through fine pores into the sponge.

The community was originally built to house veterans returning from the War. =Housing Shortage= The passage of the G.I. Bill at end of World War II caused a housing shortage in the United States, with low- to middle-income families finding few rental property options. The Santa Monica Bay area was especially affected as the opening of Douglas Aircraft's plant in 1940 and the Los Angeles Airport in 1947 led to an increase in housing demand. To combat the housing issue, the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) “created a mortgage insurance program, whose low cost of lending and liberal valuation of land would encourage developers to meet this housing need.” Cultural Heritage Commission, , Los Angeles Department of City Planning, October 6, 2011 Lincoln Place Brochure from 1959 Ralph A. Vaughn (1907-2000), an architect trained at the University of Illinois, was the son of a prominent Washington D.C. architect, Roscoe I. Vaughn. Upon meeting Heth Wharton, they formed Wharton & Vaughn Associates, and were tasked with designing Lincoln Place. Between 1951 and 1986, Lincoln Place was family-owned. In 1986, Lincoln Place was purchased by TransAction Companies, Ltd with Robert Bisno and James Coxeter as the two main partners. In 1990, Bisno announced a plan to raze Lincoln Place and develop condos on the site; however in 1996, the LA City Council rejected the development plan which resulted in Bisno filing suit against the city. In June 2001, Aimco became a 50% partner in Lincoln Place; and in August 2003, Aimco Venezia LLC, an Aimco affiliate became 100% owner of Lincoln Place Apartment Homes. Controversy In September 2000, Bisno began a revised development plan which was to include the demolition of 2 buildings and the rehabilitation of the remaining 50. Approximately 300 families moved out of Lincoln Place during this time with vacant units taken off of the rental market. This was the largest Eviction in Los Angeles History, with only disabled and elderly allowed to remain. In May 2002, Amanda Seward working with the Modern Committee of the LA Conservancy filed a nomination for Lincoln Place to be added to the National Register of Historic Places. In November of that same year, the City Council re-heard Bisno's condo proposal. Finding that there was “no substantial evidence” that Lincoln Place was an historic resource, Bisno's plan was approved. This sparked a lawsuit against the city by the Lincoln Place Tenants Association. Bisno filed applications in January 2003 for five demolition permits but was rejected. He filed a suit against the Department of Building and Safety requesting permits under the Ellis Act. However, in February 2003, the State Historic Resources Commission determined Lincoln Place was eligible for the National Register. The commission forwarded the nomination and recommendation to the Keeper of the National Register, at which time the file was open for 45 days. During these 45 days, Bisno demolished two buildings. The Keeper returned the nomination asking for additional information. In May 2003, permits were issued for five buildings along Lake Street. Several groups, including the California Preservation Foundation, LA Conservancy and the National Organization of Minority Architects filed suit against the City, citing the California Environmental Quality Act and the LA Municipal Code. They also unsuccessfully appealed the demolition permits with the Building and Safety Commission. A total of 99 units were demolished. In November of that year, the LPTA lost its suit against the City; and in January the preservationists lost their case in trial court. Both groups appealed. In March 2004, Aimco began asbestos work related to redevelopment of the property. In July 2004, Amanda Seward submitted a nomination requesting that Lincoln Place be deemed eligible for the California Register of Historic Places. In March, 2004 the Court of Appeal issued an order to prevent further demolition of structures at Lincoln Place. From 2004 to 2006 Aimco relocated tenants in more than 250 units while providing alternative housing and relocation benefits. A number of tenants were able to become first time homebuyers as a result of receiving relocation benefits. In March 2005 Aimco filed a “Notice of Intent to Withdraw” the apartments from the rental market as permitted by the California Ellis Act. Tenants in 289 occupied units were served notices requiring tenants to vacate units within 120 days. Evicted tenants filed a lawsuit, claiming that “Aimco violated conditions of the California Environmental Quality Act as well as an agreement with the city of L.A. to relocate tenants to other units or properties instead of evicting them.” The Second District Court of Appeals eventually ruled in the tenants’ favor., Santa Monica Daily Press, 2009 Of the 147 households engaged in the legal battles, many accepted relocation packages (including funds for moving expenses) offered by Aimco. Resolution =Historic designation= On August 4, 2005, the California State Historical Resources Commission declared that Lincoln Place was eligible to be placed on the California Register of Historical Resources. According to the Commission, Lincoln Place exemplified an \\"excellent enduring example of both the 'garden city' property type and of Modernist architecture.\\" In addition, the Commission cited the unique site plan and observed that it was one of few surviving prominent examples of postwar middle-income residential architecture. Subsequently, Aimco applied to the National Park Service to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This listing was granted in December 2015. =Settlement= In May 2009, Aimco signed a settlement agreement with Amanda Seward and the 20th Century Architectural Alliance which settled and concluded all claims concerning Lincoln Place. The agreement requires that the Secretary of Interior's standards be followed for historic rehabilitation at Lincoln Place. A total of 696 units will be restored and 99 new units are to be constructed on vacant lots. In August, 2009 Aimco signed a settlement agreement with the former occupants of the site which allows up to 83 former tenants to return to Lincoln Place. 50 exercised their option to return. In May 2010, the Los Angeles City Council approved a settlement reached between Aimco and the City which settled and concluded all claims in connection with Lincoln Place. The agreement includes City cooperation for permitting and support for funding to make Lincoln Place a model of sustainability and historic preservation.

XB130 regulates cell proliferation, cell survival, cell motility and gene expression. XB130 is highly similar to AFAP and is thus known as actin filament associated protein 1-like 2 (AFAP1L2). XB130 is a substrate and regulator of multiple tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling. XB130 is highly expressed in the thyroid and spleen.  Molecular structure  Schematic representation of XB130 protein structure The XB130 gene is located on human chromosome 10q25.3 and encodes an 818 amino acid protein. It has a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa and is structurally similar to actin-filament-associated protein (AFAP) and is thus known as AFAP1L2. Several tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a proline rich sequence are included in the N-terminal region of XB130, which allows it to interact and activate c-Src- containing proteins, as well as bind to p85α of PI3K. Two pleckstrin-homology domains are located in the middle portion, giving XB130 its lipid-binding ability. The C-terminal region contains a coiled-coil domain, which shares partial similarity with AFAP's leucine zipper domain. Both the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of XB130 are required for XB130's role in its translocation to the lamellipodia. Despite XB130's structural similarity to AFAP, XB130 does not behave like an actin filament-associated protein. The actin-binding site present in AFAP is only partially present in XB130.  Function  = Role in cell cycle and survival = Roles of XB130 in cell cycle and survival of cancer.XB130 has been demonstrated to play a role in cell proliferation and survival through the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. When tyrosine phosphorylated, XB130 has the ability to interact with the p85ɑ subunit of PI3K through its SH2 domains. This interaction leads to the subsequent activation of Akt, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Activated Akt promotes cell survival and cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and inactivating p21Cip1/WAF1, p27Kip1, and GSK3β, as well as inhibits apoptosis by preventing the cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are involved in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of cell death, respectively.> Alternatively, when the expression of XB130 is suppressed in vitro, Akt phosphorylation and therefore activation becomes significantly reduced. This, in turn, leads to cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and accelerated apoptosis. = Role in cell motility and invasion = During cytoskeletal rearrangement, a process required for cell motility, XB130 translocates to the cell periphery. XB130 exhibits a high affinity for peripheral F-actin structures, such as the lamellipodium. The translocation of XB130 to the cell periphery is particularly important in its potential to influence cell migration and metastasis. = Role in gene expression = The level of XB130 expression influences the expression of multiple genes related to cell proliferation and survival, and microRNAs miR-33a, 149a, and 193a-3p, all of which exhibit tumor suppressive function in thyroid cancer cells. = Role in inflammation = XB130 mediated c-Src binding and activation increases Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine produce by lung epithelial cells, which contains AP-1 and SRE transcription factor binding sites. These binding sites can be activated by the downregulation of XB130 expression and lead to a decrease in IL-8 production in lung cells.  Interactions  XB130 (gene) has been known to interact with * SH2 domain of Src * SH3 domain of Src * c-Src * p85a subunit of PI3K * RET/PTC * GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) * Phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-γ)  Clinical significance  Adaptor proteins play an important role as molecular scaffolds to mediate the transport and interaction of various proteins and is therefore highly involved in signal transduction. Deregulation of adaptor proteins is highly related to the abnormality of cellular functions and many adaptor proteins are frequently overexpressed in cancers. Clinical studies on the expression level and pattern of XB130 in various human tumors demonstrate that XB130 expression is regulated in thyroid and gastrointestinal cancer and soft tissue tumors. Expression level of XB130 was significantly higher in normal and benign lesion than that of papillary and anaplastic/insular carcinoma. Through the studies on many gastrointestinal cancers, the oncogenic roles of XB130 was shown. XB130 expression is significantly correlated with the survival time and disease-free period in gastric cancer patients. XB130 was identified as a potential colorectal cancer markers. XB130 protein level was elevated in human esophageal squamous carcinoma. In addition, XB130 was selected as one of six highly expressed genes related to local aggressiveness of soft tissue tumors in a set of 102 representative tumor samples. These findings suggest that XB130 may be involved in tumorigenesis and that XB130 is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.  Discovery  This adaptor protein was discovered during molecular cloning of human actin filament associated protein (AFAP1) in the Latner Thoracic Surgery Research Laboratories Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The molecule is named XB130 after lead technician Xiaohui Bai and the molecular mass of the protein. This protein was found to have a high sequence identity to AFAP1, thus its name AFAP1L2.

It connected Cape Cod Bay in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. It was active for over 100 years, although it gradually fell out of use and was replaced by the Cape Cod Canal. History The eastern side of Cape Cod has always been treacherous to shipping. On 26 April 1717, a passage between Boat Meadow Creek on the side of Cape Cod Bay and Town Cove to the east was deepened by a storm. The resulting canal was very shallow, allowing a maximum of 20-ton boats. In 1804, it was widened and improved which allowed use during the War of 1812. Proposals for a new canal began to take priority in the late 1800s, and the canal began to fall into disrepair. In 1916, the Cape Cod Canal opened between Bourne and Sandwich, Massachusetts. The only remains of Jeremiah's Gutter are a river and cut through the marsh. These can be viewed from the Cape Cod Rail Trail about 0.3 miles north of the Rock Harbor Road parking. All traces of the canal from the eastern end near Town Cove have been removed by the construction of the rotary at U.S. Route 6 and by the construction of homes.

In the west, the Gurktal Alps reach up to the Katschberg Pass and the Ankogel Group of the Hohe Tauern range. In the east, the Neumarkt Pass in Upper Styria separates it from the adjacent Lavanttal Alps. = Subdivisions = The Gurktal Alps may be divided into five subgroups: * The Nock Mountains lie between the Liesertal and Flattnitzer Höhe. Their highest peak is the Eisenhut (2,441 m). * The Metnitz Mountains lie between the Mur and Metnitz valleys. Their highest point is the Goldachnock (2,171 m). * The Mödring Chain lies between the Metnitz and Gurktal valleys. Its highest point is the Dorferecken (1,726 m) * The Wimitz Mountains lie between the Gurk and Glan valleys through which flows the Wimitz river. Their highest peaks are the Schneebauerberg and the Hocheck (both 1,338 m) At the southern end of the Gurktal Alps is the Klagenfurt Basin. Here there are seven more smaller mountain chains: * Magdalensberg (Lippekogel, 1,079 m) * Ossiach Tauern (Taubenbühel 1,069 m) * Glantal Highlands (Ulrichsberg, 1,022 m) * Sattnitz (Tanzboden, 929 m) * Feldkirchen-Moosburg Upland (Freudenberg, 817 m) * St. Veit Upland (Buchberg, 808 m) * Maria Saal Upland (Maria Saaler Berg, 746 m) Occasionally the Gurktal Alps, along with the Lavanttal Alps to the east, are classified as part of the Noric Alps, but that is not geologically justified. = Peaks = The highest peaks are located within the Nock Mountains (Nockberge, from Nock meaning \\"rounded hilltop\\", cf. Nockerl) subgroup west of Flattnitz Pass, including Mt. Eisenhut, , in Styria. The Nationalpark Nockberge along the scenic Nockalm Road in Carinthia since 1987 is a protected landscape area (IUCN V). The Nock Mountains also stretch down to major Carinthian lakes like Millstätter See and Ossiacher See. Other peaks include: * Großer Rosennock, * Hohe Pressing, * Rinsennock, Economy and tourism Hiking trail near Bad Kleinkirchheim The gentle landscape with its numerous mountain pastures had been the site of transhumance agriculture since ancient times. The Gurktal Alps were also a mining area for iron and silver, still magnesite deposits are exploited near Radenthein. Today tourism is the most important economic sector. The valleys of the Gurktal Alps cater for tourists in summer and for the busy winter season. The leading tourist area is Bad Kleinkirchheim, then Turracher Höhe (Predlitz-Turrach and Reichenau), Falkert (Reichenau) and Innerkrems (Krems in Kärnten), Flattnitz, Afritz and Katschberg (Rennweg am Katschberg). The largest ski areas are Katschberg- Aineck, Innerkrems-Schönfeld-Karneralm, Turracher Höhe and Gerlitzen in the Nock Mountains and Kreischberg in the Metnitz Mountains. The region of the Nock Mountains is also well known for its healing spas. The Karlbad along the Nockalmstraße is the oldest farmers healing spring in Austria. The way in which the baths are made (with spring water and hot rocks), has remained unchanged since the 17th century. Their remote location means there is also no electricity. The name of the spa is derived from the little cirque (Karl from Kar, cirque).

Running entirely within the village of Springvale, the route begins at State Route 11, State Route 11A, and State Route 109 just west of downtown Sanford, and terminates at U.S. Route 202 and State Route 4A east of town. SR 224 functions as a northern bypass of downtown Sanford, running along the Mousam River for most of its length.  Route description  SR 224 begins in Sanford at the intersection of SR 11 / SR 109 (Main Street), Oak Street, and Bridge Street. Bridge Street carries the initial stretch of SR 224; west of Main Street, the road continues southwest on Oak Street as SR 11A. SR 224 heads northeast on Bridge Street, crosses the Mousam River, then immediately turns southeast onto Pleasant Street. The highway runs along the northern side of the river, passing several churches, housing developments, and shops in Springvale. As SR 224 crosses River Street passes Carl J. Lamb Elementary School, the road becomes Shaws Ridge Road. The highway turns northeast, then again southeast and terminates at US 202 / SR 4A (Sanford Road) near the Alfred town line.  History  The SR 224 designation was first used on a route between Dexter and Guilford, which was renumbered in 1933 as SR 24 and exists now as the northernmost stretch of SR 23. The modern SR 224 was designated in 1933 covering the current routing in Springvale and cosigned with SR 4 (modern US 202 / SR 4A) east to Alfred where it terminated at SR 111. In 1939, the concurrency was eliminated and the route was truncated to its modern terminus. Its alignment has not changed since.

It was founded in 1994 in the United States and is now a global organization with seven regions – Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and the United States – which holds annual regional conferences and publishes a research journal and newsletters. In 2011, IAF began creating local chapters. The organization is led by a board of directors elected annually and representing all IAF regions.  Conferences  The first annual IAF conference, \\"The Art and Mastery of Facilitation\\", attracted 278 people to Denver in January 1995. Forty-five sessions in three tracks included the first sessions on Computer Supported Facilitation. The first IAF General Membership meeting was held and Peggy Bushee Services in St. Paul (Minnesota) was chosen to become the official IAF office. The second conference, held in January 1996 in Dallas, Texas, attracted 384 participants to take part in 54 sessions in four tracks. Using participatory strategic planning, all participants developed IAF's plan for the next decade. During 1996, the IAF website was created and work began on developing the IAF journal, Group Facilitation: A Research and Applications Journal. In the fall of 1996, a conference was held in the Netherlands – the first conference outside the United States – and links began with local facilitator groups that were springing up around the world. More than 400 people attended the third annual IAF conference, \\"Discovery Along Wisdom Pathways: The Art and Mastery of Facilitation\\", held January 1997 in Tulsa (Oklahoma). Topics discussed included facilitation as a profession and facilitator competencies, on which extensive work would be done over the next few years. During 1997, an IAF Europe/Africa Conference was held in London (England), with 70 participants from England, Belgium, Netherlands, Scotland, South Africa, Kenya, and Israel, who shared practices and learned new techniques and models during 17 concurrent sessions. In the spring of 1997, IAF adopted Grp-Facl as its electronic discussion group, allowing facilitators around the world to communicate virtually.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the Diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with that of St Catherine, West Bradford. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church dates from about 1500, but only the tower remains from that time. The nave and chancel were rebuilt in 1898–1901 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. Architecture St Helen's is constructed in sandstone with stone slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, short north and south transepts, a lower chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with a west doorway, above which is a three-light window. The bell openings have two lights, and the parapet is embattled, with pinnacles and gargoyles at the corners. The parapets of the aisles are also embattled. The east window of the chancel has five lights. Inside the church are open timber roofs. The five-bay arcades have pointed arches carried on octagonal piers. Above the inner arch of the west door are nine carved heads. The octagonal sandstone font dates from the 16th-century, and has a bowl carved with the instruments of the Passion.

The character and the series, a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. He is voiced by David Faustino. Because he is a firebender, Mako is able to create and manipulate the classical element of fire. Mako also has the ability to both generate and redirect lightning. The character was named in honor of the late Mako Iwamatsu who voiced Iroh, a major supporting character, in the first two seasons of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Character overview Mako is a talented firebender from a multicultural family who grew up on the streets of Republic City as an orphan with his younger brother, Bolin. In sharp contrast to his brother, Mako's personality can best be characterized as stoic and brooding. Living on the streets has given him a “rough-edge\\", though he relaxes somewhat when he's with his friends. Mako is also described as being outspoken, generally not afraid to share his opinions with others. He’s also characterized as smart and a dedicated worker who at times puts his career before anything else. Additionally, Mako is very guarded in his dealings with strangers, lacking the naivety of his brother. For roughly 1/2 of the series' run, Mako wore a signature red scarf that was once his father San's, who was murdered along with his mother when he was eight years old. Mako formed a pro-bending team with his brother, dreaming that it would bring him fame and fortune. However, his aspirations changed when he met Avatar Korra, who joined the team and became a loyal friend. In the following months, Mako joined the Republic City Police Force, where he steadily rose in rank from a beat cop to a detective. He joined his friends, including Korra, on numerous occasions in stopping various global threats. Mako was later appointed as Prince Wu's bodyguard, a position he continued after the latter's coronation as Earth King. Creation and conception David Faustino voices Mako. Mako along with his brother Bolin were designed by Ryu Ki-Hyun. Mako went through a number of design changes. Joaquim Dos Santos originally wanted both characters to have strong noses, however the idea was nixed. It was decided that as the younger brother, Bolin's character would have a somewhat simplistic and naive view of the world, while Mako's character as the older brother and provider for the two, would be more reserved, cynical and serious in nature. Mako and Bolin live in Republic City a “modern metropolis” in the United Republic. According to the creators, the United Republic was founded by Aang and Zuko after the Hundred Year War as a place where benders and non-Benders from all four Kingdoms could live in harmony. Mako and Bolin were created in part to highlight the radical changes that had occurred in the seventy years since the end of the war, specifically the ethnic diversity and blending of cultures of the various nations in the United Republic. Mako and Bolin are the sons of an Earth Kingdom father and a Fire Nation mother. Because of the heritages of their parents, Mako is a firebender and Bolin is an earthbender. Toza teaching Mako pro-bending as well as Mako learning lightning techniques from Lightning Bolt Zolt were cut from the series to save time.DVD commentary for \\"A Leaf in the Wind\\"DVD commentary for \\"The Revelation\\" During production of the second season, wherein Mako becomes an officer in Republic City, the design for his police uniform went through several concepts before its final design was settled on, all of which having his trademark red scarf tucked into his jacket. Bryan Konietzko made the decision to have it removed. Though Joaquim Dos Santos was initially supportive of the scarf being implemented, he left open to the idea that a police officer having on scarf while showing up to a crime spree would be \\"strange\\". Of the core members of Team Avatar in The Legend of Korra, Mako was the only one to remain single by the end of the series. He was originally intended to become romantically involved with Fire Lord Izumi's daughter during the fourth season, but the idea was scrapped as the writers felt there were too many characters in the season.Joshua Hamilton on the DVD commentary for \\"The Coronation\\" = Voice = Mako is voiced by David Faustino. Faustino felt Mako's love for Asami was different than the love he had for Korra, calling it \\"much deeper\\". Faustino was supportive of the romantic relationship between Mako and Korra being reestablished during the fourth season.  Appearances  =The Legend of Korra= Book One: Air At the beginning of the series, Mako is a member of the Fire Ferrets pro-bending team, alongside his brother and the waterbender Hasook. He initially does not get along well with Korra, mistaking her for one of Bolin's “fangirls” when they first meet, but later befriends her when she joins the Fire Ferrets after Hasook did not show up for a match. Mako later starts dating Asami Sato, the daughter of wealthy industrialist and Fire Ferrets sponsor Hiroshi Sato. Following the Equalists' attack on the Pro-Bending arena, Mako and Bolin moved in with Asami. Tensions between Korra and Mako again appeared when Korra began to suspect Hiroshi of being an Equalist, with Mako believing her to be acting on her jealousy towards Asami. After Korra's suspicions were proven to be true, he comforted the distraught Asami at the Avatar's urging. Mako - along with Asami and Bolin - later joined Korra in fighting the Equalists. The trio were subsequently arrested by Republic City Councilman Tarrlok, who wanted to use them as leverage against Korra. He, along with Asami and Bolin, were later freed by Lin Beifong after Tarrlok kidnapped Korra. During the crisis, Mako was very open about his feelings for Korra in front of Asami, leading to friction between the two of them. This was exacerbated when Asami found out about Mako and Korra's earlier kiss. Mako ended his relationship with Asami. Shortly, Mako and Korra later discovered that Amon, the leader of the Equalists, was a powerful bender and not the non- bender he claimed to be. They eventually exposed Amon, ending the revolution, but in the process Korra lost much of her bending. When Korra traveled to the South Pole to receive treatment from Katara, Mako accompanied her confessing his love for her while there. After Korra bending was restored by Aang, the two of them embraced and kissed, with Korra admitting her love for Mako. Book Two: Spirits In Season Two, Mako became a police officer for the Republic City Police Force. When a cultural center associated with the Southern Water Tribe was bombed, most suspected that the Northern Water Tribe was involved. However, Mako was one of the few who doubted that the Northern Water Tribe was the culprit. This brought him into sharp conflict with Korra, a native of the Southern Water Tribe. Once Mako revealed Korra's plans to ask the United Forces fleet to help the Southern Water Tribe in their civil war with their northern counterparts to the president, Mako and Korra's romantic relationship abruptly ended in a bitter argument. Determined to find the true culprits of the bombing and help Asami's struggling company, Mako set up a sting operation with the help of a local triad. However, they were double- crossed by the gangsters. During the operation, Asami's company's warehouse was raided, effectively bankrupting her company. While consoling the distraught Asami, Asami kissed Mako. Mako continued his investigation and eventually grew suspicious of the businessman, Varrick. Before he could proceed in his investigation, incriminating evidence concerning the bombing of the Southern Water Tribe center was found in his apartment. Mako was subsequently arrested. After Varrick was arrested for the attempted kidnapping of President Raiko, Mako was released from prison. In his subsequent reunion with Korra, who through an encounter with an evil spirit forgot she broke up with Mako, Korra kissed Mako in front of Asami, Bolin, Tenzin, Lin, Bumi and Kya. To the chagrin of everyone present, Mako failed to remind Korra of their breakup and that he was dating Asami. This ended Mako's romantic involvement with Asami. At the end of Season 2, Mako assisted in the efforts to keep a multitude of dark spirits away from Korra's meditating body in the Tree of Time while the Avatar defeated the Dark Avatar. After the battle, Korra revealed to Mako that she sensed the two broke up before her encounter with the evil spirit and the two agreed to end their romantic involvement. Book Three: Change Season Three saw Mako accompanying the rest of Team Avatar, Tenzin and Bumi to the Earth Kingdom in their efforts to recruit new airbenders to recreate the Air Nation. Initially they enjoyed limited success as they were able to successfully recruit one person, Kai, a young orphan whose life was not unlike Mako's childhood. However at the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, the group discovered that a number of airbenders were imprisoned by the Earth Queen. The group would successfully liberate the captive airbenders who all agreed to join the Air Nation. While in the capital Mako and Bolin reunited with their extended family, who resided in the city. In an emotionally poignant moment, Mako elected to give his scarf, which was his murdered father's scarf, to his grandmother, believing his parents would have wanted her to have it. Later Mako and Bolin would find themselves locked in the first of a series of battles with Zaheer's Red Lotus allies Ming-Hua and Ghazan. The firebender fared poorly against Ming-Hua and the brothers were captured. The brothers were transported to Ba Sing Se, where there was a bounty on the two for aiding the airbenders’ escape, and incarcerated. After Zaheer murdered the Earth Queen, ushering a period of anarchy in the capital, Zaheer allowed every prisoner to escape except Mako and Bolin. Zaheer informed the two that they would be freed, but only after they agreed to relay a message to Korra. The two commandeered an airship and subsequently rescued their extended family from their burning house. They reunited with Korra and Asami where Mako relayed Zaheer’s message to Korra: Zaheer and other members of the Red Lotus planned to travel to the Northern Air Temple to eliminate the newly reborn Air Nation unless Korra surrendered to him. The Avatar agreed to surrender to the Red Lotus in exchange for the Air Nation, who were being held captive by the Red Lotus. When it became apparent that the Red Lotus double- crossed the group; Mako was able to radio Korra about the deception. He and Bolin attempted to battle Ghazan and Ming-Hua, but Ghazan utilized his lavabending to trap the brothers. Thanks to a miraculous act of lavabending from Bolin and the timely appearance of Kai on his baby bison, Lefty, they were able to escape the doomed Northern Air Temple. Later the brothers would be locked in yet another battle with Ming-Hua and Ghazan, with Mako once again battling Ming-Hua. Utilizing his lightning-bending abilities, Mako electrocuted Ming-Hua, killing the waterbender in the process. Mako then assisted Bolin who was engaged in battle with Ghazan at a cave. When it became apparent that Ghazan was no match for the two, the lavabender collapsed the entire cave on the three. Ghazan died in the process while the brothers safely escaped. Book Four: Balance Season Four began with Mako appointed the bodyguard of Prince Wu, who was next in line for the Earth Kingdom throne. He spent a large amount of his time in this capacity, helping the young prince get through some turbulent times, particularly when Kuvira refused to hand power to Wu. Later, Mako reunited with Korra, who he had not seen in three years, and Asami. When the businesswoman revealed that she had been worried when Korra informed her that she could no longer go into the Avatar State, Mako asked when Korra had told her that. He inquired what was going on between them, learning that Korra had written to Asami during her absence. This annoyed Mako, who was miffed that he was kept out of the loop. After Wu was kidnapped, the three set out to rescue the prince. The three were successful in rescuing Wu, though in the process, Mako and Korra clashed repeatedly. When Asami remarked that their rescue mission reminded her of their old times, minus the \\"getting on each other's nerves part\\", Mako good-naturedly replied that arguing with Korra was normal for him. Wu would eventually be moved to the Asami's mansion, where he would share residence with Mako's extended family Later, Mako suggested that they \\"toughen up\\" the prince, so that he would be able to protect himself in the future. Soon however the conversation turned to Mako's past as he told Wu, his grandmother and his cousin Tu about his complicated romantic history with Korra and Asami. He was critiqued by the trio, with Tu making the observation that “…it seems like you're [Mako] so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone.” Later when it was revealed that Kuvira's army had a large superweapon and also planned to invade Republic City, Mako, Korra, Bolin and Asami decided that they would attempt to destroy Kuvira's superweapon before it reached the city. However, they were unsuccessful in their attempts. After Kuvira's army arrived in Republic City, Mako took part in a plan to stop the large robot: the benders would relentlessly attack the robot to distract Kuvira while two hummingbird mecha suits would make an incision in the machine. A team would then enter Kuvira's machine through the hole and destroy the massive machine from its inside. The plan was generally successful as he managed to enter inside the hole with Suyin, Lin, Bolin, and Korra. Mako and Bolin entered the engine room in an attempt to demolish the engine. After defeating the soldiers, the two was unable to shut the engine down. Mako ordered Bolin to remove the cataleptic engineers and leave the room explaining that he planned to utilize his lightning-bending to destroy the engine room. Bolin realized that doing so could cost Mako his life and raised serious reservations. Mako brushed off Bolin's concerns and promised him that he would escape safely, telling him he loved him. In the process of implementing his plan Mako was struck by a bolt of energy, rendering him unconscious. He was saved by Bolin who had returned and carried Mako to relative safety. In the series’ closing, Mako attended the wedding ceremony of Varrick and Zhu Li at Air Temple Island. Outside the wedding party, Mako and Korra had a conversation in which the latter thanked Mako for his help. Mako and Korra reaffirmed their close friendship. =Graphic novels= The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars In part one of the graphic novel continuation of the series, Mako is now a police officer in Chief Lin Beifong's triad task force, with Bolin serving as his temporary partner. After breaking up a fight between the Triple Threat and the Creeping Crystal triads, Mako and Bolin arrest Two-Toed Ping and Mako tricks Ping into revealing the name of the Triple Threat's new leader. Mako and Bolin reunite with Korra and Asami, who have returned from their vacation in the Spirit World. The reunion is cut short when the Air Nomads are attacked by Triple Threats at the Spirit Portal. Mako goes after their leader Tokuga but loses the fight when Tokuga exploits Mako's injured arm. Bolin comes to Mako's rescue but Tokuga is able to get away. In the aftermath of the battle, Korra kisses Asami out of relief, leading to Mako, Bolin, Jinora and Opal discovering their relationship. The Legend of Korra: Ruins of the Empire Mako continues to be the Earth King's bodyguard detail. =Outside of The Legend of Korra= Together with his brother Bolin, Mako starred in \\"Republic City Hustle\\", the first of three character-focused shorts Nickelodeon released in advance of the September premiere of the second season. In this short, a younger Mako and Bolin are shown living on the street, where they \\"enter the crime-ridden underworld of Republic City.\\" Mako appears in The Legend of Korra books Revolution and Endgame, two novels that together adapt the first season of the series. Abilities As a police officer, Mako uses a motorcycle as his vehicle of choice, displaying great skill with maneuvering it over slick terrain and even incorporating his firebending as a booster to extend the distance of his jumps and to stabilize after a near crash. =Firebending= Mako is highly skilled in Firebending which utilizes chinese martial arts techniques of Changquan, Shaolinquan, Lóng Xíng Mó Qiáo and Xing Yi Quan.The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=1038 Firebending represents the element of power,Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director). (June 2, 2006). \\"Bitter Work\\". Avatar: The Last Airbender. Season 2. Episode 9. Nickelodeon. and is categorized as the most aggressive of the \\"four bending arts\\". Firebending involves \\"external styles\\" that prioritize one's legwork (as opposed to the arms) and emphasizes \\"kicking over hand fighting\\"; the highly technical kicking strikes are meant to \\"extend as far as possible\\" without compromising balance. This is intended to sacrifices defense for optimized preemptive strikess and attrition warfare. Mako implements \\"a modern hybrid-martial arts style of firebending\\" that he developed as a pro-bending athlete; which primarily involves a series of defensive weaving and dodging patterns quickly followed by successive spurts of offense. This technique compensates firebending's inherent lack of defence; rendering Mako capable of defeating an entire pro-bending team by himself. Outside of pro-bending, Mako demonstrated great skill in traditional firebending combat. The raw strength of his firebending is considerable, as he is able to offset a large and point-blank explosion unharmed.Hedrick, Tim (writer) & Heck, Colin (director).

Additionally, Mako is able to generate lightning in the most stressful situations. For example, when the equalist leader Amon had Mako restrained via bloodbending, Mako was able to maintain the clarity in his mind to conjure a precise lightning directly at Amon despite his predicament.  Reception  Mako received a mixed reception from both the media and fans, best summarized by reviewer Michal Schick in an article for Hypable: \\"Mako is a hard character to love, but he’s also almost impossible to hate.\\" In some circles Mako received critical acclaim. The character's backstory was praised, with the three part prequel to the series, \\"Republic City Hustle\\" praised for sensitively depicting Mako's difficult childhood. Mako has been described as \\"a slender Clark Kent\\", \\"the stereotypical heroic-type lead\\" and a respectable male character. The depiction of the strong, positive sibling relationship between Mako and Bolin also drew praise and the scene where Mako gives his grandmother his red scarf was described as \\"an unbelievably powerful moment shared by him, Bolin, and their family\\". Mako's heroic actions in the finale nearly sacrificing himself in the effort to destroy Kuvira's large robot also drew praise from reviewer Max Nicholson of IGN who opined that the character \\"earned back all his street cred by making a powerful and emotional sacrifice to destroy the engine himself.\\" Reviewer Lauren Davis felt that while the writers of the series \\"weren't entirely sure how to treat Mako\\" after his romantic relationships ended, they made his role during the fourth season \\"stronger\\" than that of the previous season and he was given \\"his moment\\" in the series finale. Zach Blumenfeld of Paste ranked Mako as the 11th best character from the Avatar universe, noting that Mako has \\"a heart of gold, the rare cop who shows tough love and sympathy in every situation.\\" In other circles, Mako was panned. Reviewer Erin Tatum described Mako as \\"...a botched attempt to recapture the popularity of Zuko, resident bad boy and puberty catalyst of the A:TLA universe\\". In particular Mako's \\"love triangle\\" with fellow characters Korra and Asami was heavily criticized. Reviewer Alex Cranz described the situation as \\"soapiness usually reserved for shows about women banging vampires\\". Reviewer Hannah Strom described the love triangle as \\"ridiculousness\\" and described Mako as \\"kind of a terrible person\\". She also held that \\"both Korra and Asami are way too cool for any of this ridiculousness and should go run away and have their own adventures\\". At the conclusion of Season Two, reviewer Jason Krell created an extensive list of suggestions to make Season Three “amazing”. At the top of his list was for Korra and Asami to “love Mako no more”. Krell characterized the love triangle as a tired romantic dynamic. Reviewer Max Nicholson noted that fans \\"expressed frustration\\" with Mako in his treatment of particularly Asami in the saga while praising the show's creators decision to give voice to fans' frustrations with Mako in the form of Prince Wu in \\"Remembrances\\". On the other hand, Zach Blumenfeld of Paste wrote that \\"Mako represents one of the more adult and important takes on romance ever to appear in all-ages entertainment. His confused feelings for both Korra and Asami mirror the situation in which many a young boy will eventually find himself—wanting two girls, ending up with neither.\\" Following the conclusion of the series, reviewer William Cannon of the Latin Times listed a number of characters from The Legend of Korra who he felt would be suitable to have the lead role in a spin-off series. Mako and Bolin as co-leads made his list, with the reviewer commenting that \\"the funny awkward brother and the more serious brooding bro\\" would make \\"sitcom magic\\". Cannon felt that the two brothers had the best chemistry on The Legend of Korra. He also believed the fact that the two characters were \\"powerful benders\\" would make the spin-off series interesting. In response to Cannon's article, Adam Bellotto of Venture Capital Post was more reserved in his assessment of Bolin and Mako co-starring in a spin-off series. While he agreed with Cannon that a spin-off series focusing on the brothers would work well, Bellotto felt that such a series would be unoriginal. He held that either a new character or an underdeveloped character from the series was most appropriate to star in a spin-off.

The character and the series, a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. He is voiced by P. J. Byrne. Bolin is able to manipulate the classical element of earth, which is known as earthbending. It is revealed in the third season that he is also able to create and control lava, which is a very rare sub-ability called lavabending. Character overview Bolin (愽林, in in-universe orthography) is an earthbender from a multicultural family who grew up on the streets of Republic City as an orphan with his older brother, Mako. As an earthbender, Bolin has the ability to move and shape earth at will. However, he knows a rare subset of earthbending called lavabending, allowing him to manipulate lava, turning it into earth and back. As a friend of Avatar Korra, the character often plays the role of comic relief within The Legend of Korra, taking over Sokka's role in The Last Airbender. Bolin is characterized as being somewhat dimwitted, but having a \\"heart of gold.\\" His enthusiastic personality led him to becoming an actor. Furthermore, much like Sokka, Bolin has had relationships with various young female characters within the show. Creation and conception P.J. Byrne voices Bolin. According to Bryan Konietzko, Bolin's character was inspired by the original concept of Toph Beifong, who was going to be a male character Konietzko described as \\"kind of a big, not sharpest tool in the shed.\\" When Toph's character was decided to be a smaller girl, the creators still had many ideas for the male earthbender, which they implemented into Bolin. Bolin along with his older brother Mako were designed by Ryu Ki-Hyun. The character went through a series of design changes in its development. Joaquim Dos Santos originally wanted both characters to have strong noses, however the idea was nixed. It was decided that as the younger brother, Bolin's character would have a somewhat simplistic and naive view of the world, while Mako's character as the older brother and provider for the two, would be more cynical and serious in nature. Bolin and Mako live in Republic City, a “modern metropolis” in the United Republic. According to the creators, the United Republic was founded by Aang and Zuko after the Hundred Year War as a place where benders and non-Benders from all four Kingdoms could live in harmony. Mako and Bolin were created in part to highlight the radical changes that had occurred in the seventy years since the end of the war, specifically the ethnic diversity and blending of cultures of the various nations in the United Republic. The two are the sons of an Earth Kingdom father and a Fire Nation mother. Because of the heritages of their parents, Bolin is an earthbender and Mako is a firebender. =Voice actor= Bolin is voiced by P.J. Byrne. Byrne related to the character as he explained, \\"I’m a people person, I’m a peoplely people, and I think that’s what my character is.\\" Fellow The Legend of Korra voice actor David Faustino, who voiced Mako, said during the show's run that while they were all given \\"some freedom\\", Byrne especially as he was \\"sort of the comic relief of the show\\" and that much of his material was improv which would either be kept or cut depending on how it was received. Appearances =The Legend of Korra= Book One: Air In Season One, Bolin was initially infatuated with Korra. He befriended her showing her pro-bending tricks. When the team needed to come up with thirty thousand yuans to enter the pro-bending Championship, Bolin accepted Shady Shin's offer to work for the local criminal underworld. He along with four triad members was kidnapped and taken before Amon, leader of the Equalists, a revolutionary movement dedicated to removing bending from all benders. Bolin was rescued by Mako and Korra. Bolin would take Korra on a date, although his feelings were unrequited. Later Amon and his Equalists destroyed the pro-bending arena, leaving Bolin and Mako homeless. Asami offered them a place to stay. However, after Hiroshi Sato was revealed as an Equalist, the brothers and Asami moved to Air Temple Island with Korra. After Bolin and his brother were arrested for allegedly interfering with police activities, Lin Beifong freed the two, who informed them that Korra was kidnapped. After finding Korra, Amon launched a large- scale attack on the city. \\"Team Avatar\\" (Korra, Mako, Bolin and Asami) was forced to retreat into the tunnel system of the city, where they would await the arrival of reinforcements. After the reinforcements were overwhelmed by the Equalists biplanes, the team split up, and Bolin accompanied Asami to an Equalist airfield in order to stop the planes from flying. They would eventually destroy the airfield capturing Hiroshi Sato in the process. Book Two: Spirits In Season Two, after the Anti-bending Revolution, Bolin accompanied Team Avatar to the Southern Water Tribe. He became romantically involved with Korra's cousin, Eska, a macabrely domineering princess from the Northern Water Tribe, who was visiting her southern counterparts. Bolin soon found the relationship borderline abusive and intended to break up with the princess. However, when he tried to do so, Eska engaged herself to him. Bolin secretly left the Southern Water Tribe for Republic City, avoiding an angered and deranged Eska in the process. Later, Bolin was cast to play Nuktuk, the male lead in the businessman Varrick's film The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South. The movie was a success and Bolin enjoyed fame and fortune. On the night of the final screening of the film, Bolin thwarted a kidnapping of President Raiko. Despite being outnumbered by the would-be kidnappers, Bolin overpowered them. He forced one of them to reveal who his employer was, thus exposing Varrick's duplicity. Later Bolin rejoined Team Avatar at the South Pole. At the end of Season 2, Bolin assisted in the efforts to keep a multitude of evil spirits away from Korra's meditating body in the Tree of Time while the Avatar defeated the Dark Avatar. Bolin had an unlikely ally in this effort in Eska and at one point admitted his love for the princess, who in turn kissed him. Before they were completely overrun by the evil spirits, Korra's returning spirit nullified the threat. After the crisis ended, Bolin suggested to Eska that she live with him at Republic City. However, Eska declined, confessing that she was only caught up in the moment when she kissed him. She told Bolin that he would have a special place \\"in the organ that pumps [her] blood\\". Book Three: Change In Season Three, Bolin would accompany Team Avatar as well as Tenzin and Bumi, in their quest to find new airbenders in the Earth Kingdom to help recreate the Air Nation. Initially they enjoyed limited success. However at the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se, the group discovered that a number of airbenders were imprisoned by the Earth Queen. While in the capital Mako and Bolin reunited with their extended family, who resided in the city. The group would successfully liberate the captive airbenders who all agreed to join the Air Nation. Team Avatar traveled to the Earth Kingdom city of Zaofu to recruit one more known airbender, Lin Beifong's niece Opal. When Bolin met Opal, the two almost immediately fell in love, beginning a romantic relationship. Opal agreed to join the Air Nation, and departed Zaofu to join the nascent Air Nation at the Northern Air Temple. Later Bolin and Mako would find themselves locked in the first of a series of battles with Zaheer's Red Lotus allies Ming-Hua and Ghazan. The earthbender was routed by Ghazan and the brothers were captured. The brothers were transported to Ba Sing Se, where there was a bounty on the two for aiding the airbenders’ escape, and incarcerated. After Zaheer murdered the Earth Queen, ushering a period of anarchy in the capital, Zaheer allowed every prisoner to escape except Bolin and Mako. Zaheer informed the two that they would be freed, but only after they agreed to relay a message to Korra. The two commandeered an airship and subsequently rescued their extended family from their burning house. They reunited with Korra and Asami where Mako relayed Zaheer's message to Korra: Zaheer and other members of the Red Lotus planned to travel to the Northern Air Temple to eliminate the Air Nation unless Korra surrendered to him. The Avatar agreed to surrender to the Red Lotus in exchange for the Air Nation, who were being held captive by the Red Lotus. When it became apparent that the Red Lotus double-crossed the group; Bolin and Mako attempted to battle Ghazan and Ming-Hua, but Ghazan utilized his lavabending to trap the brothers. Facing certain death in the collapsing temple which was being consumed by lava, Bolin miraculously discovered that he, like Ghazan, could lavabend. Coupled with the timely appearance of Kai on his baby bison, Lefty, the brothers were able to escape the doomed Northern Air Temple. Later the brothers would be locked in yet another battle with Ming-Hua and Ghazan, with Bolin once again battling Ghazan, this time in a cave. With Bolin utilizing his newly found lavabending abilities, the two were much more evenly matched. However, when Ghazan began to gain the upper hand Mako, having dispatched Ming-Hua, joined the fray. When it became apparent that Ghazan was no match for the two, the lavabender collapsed the entire cave on the three. Ghazan died in the process while the brothers safely escaped. Book Four: Balance Opal kissing Bolin on the cheek as a sign of forgiveness for his actions while working for Kuvira. During the fourth season, Bolin began working to re-unite the Earth Kingdom under Kuvira, who would become the season's villain. During this season, he was stuck between being loyal to his boss or to his friends, where he believed that Kuvira was doing the right thing despite his friends trying to convince him otherwise. Later in the season, the character realized that Kuvira was going too far and escaped her control. By helping saving the family of his girlfriend Opal, Bolin regained her trust. After returning to Republic City, Bolin along with Lin, Suyin, and Zhu Li, interrupted a conference of President Raiko's, who was meeting with Korra, Prince Wu, Tenzin and Mako. Zhu Li informed everyone that Kuvira planned to attack Republic City in two weeks. The President ordered the evacuation of Republic City while Bolin, along with the rest of team Avatar, decided to launch a preemptive strike against Kuvira in an attempt to destroy the dictator's superweapon. However their mission was unsuccessful, discovering the army was only hours away from Republic city, a week earlier than expected, They also were surprised that Kuvira mounted her superweapon on a 25-story tall robot, which she controlled through her metalbending. The team briefed their allies on Kuvira's progress. After Kuvira's army arrived in Republic City, Bolin took part in a plan to stop the large robot: the benders would relentlessly attack the robot to distract Kuvira while two hummingbird mecha suits would cut a circular hole in the machine without being crushed. A team would then enter the suit through the hole and ultimately destroy the massive machine from its inside. The plan was generally successful as he managed to enter inside the hole with Suyin, Lin, Mako, and Korra. In the process Bolin saved Mako from certain death, carrying his brother to safety after he found him unconscious in the engine room of the crumbling machine. In the series' end, Bolin would preside over Varrick (who he befriended in Season Four) and Zhu Li's wedding at Air Temple Island. =Graphic novel trilogy= In part one, Bolin is now a police officer on Chief Lin Beifong's triad task force, with Mako serving as his temporary partner. After breaking up a fight between the Triple Threat and the Creeping Crystal triads, Bolin and Mako arrest Two-Toed Ping. Bolin and Mako reunite with Korra and Asami, who have returned from their vacation in the Spirit World. The reunion is cut short when the Air Nomads are attacked by Triple Threats at the Spirit Portal. Bolin comes to Mako's rescue when he loses a fight with the Triple Threat's new leader, Tokuga, but Tokuga is able to get away. In the aftermath of the battle, Korra kisses Asami out of relief, leading to Bolin, Mako, Jinora and Opal discovering their relationship. The Legend of Korra: Ruins of the Empire In part one of the graphic novel continuation of the series, Bolin is now Secretary to the President of the United Republic. =Outside of The Legend of Korra= Together with his brother Mako, Bolin starred in \\"Republic City Hustle\\", the first of three character-focused shorts Nickelodeon released in advance of the September premiere of the second season. In this short, a younger Mako and Bolin are shown living on the street, where they \\"enter the crime-ridden underworld of Republic City.\\" Bolin appears in The Legend of Korra: A New Era Begins as a playable character. Bolin appears in The Legend of Korra books Revolution and Endgame, two novels that together adapt the first season of the series. Reception Bolin was generally well received by press and fans alike. The character's backstory was commended, with the three part prequel to the series, \\"Republic City Hustle\\" praised for sensitively depicting Bolin and his brother's Mako difficult childhood. The depiction of the strong relationship between Mako and Bolin in the series also drew praise with the scene where Mako gives his grandmother his red scarf described as \\"an unbelievably powerful moment shared by [Mako], Bolin, and their family\\". Tor.com editor Moddicai Knode praised Bolin's role in the episode \\"Operation Beifong\\", seeing it as the start of his character arc. According to Knode, here Bolin finally became as good as a character as Sokka was in the original series. Knode states that it was clear from the start that Bolin was designed to be a similar character to that of Sokka, but he states that \\"you can’t just provide a bit of comedic relief and call yourself the Sokka of the group.\\" Knode claims that to be \\"the Sokka of the group,\\" Bolin needed enough character growth, to be \\"the man with the plan\\" and, optionally, be the character with the most romantic development on the show. Knode praises how the character of Bolin makes bold, risky decisions while acknowledging when he makes a mistake, and that despite not being the \\"sharpest pencil in the box,\\" he makes up for this by teamwork and \\"stepping up to the plate.\\" Matt Patches of ScreenCrush compared Bolin and Varrick's escape in the season four episode \\"Reunion\\" to the 2008 film Defiance, where the characters are \\"blasting their way through [enemies] as they survived in the woods.\\" Patches enjoyed the comedy in the dialogue between Bolin and Varrick, but also comments that \\"there’s a tremendous amount of moral insight too.\\" Reviewer Michael Mammano of Den of Geek also praised Bolin's role in this episode, pointing out the \\"sense of authority and competence he’s developed\\" and noting that he is \\"far more poised and precise\\" than in previous seasons. P.J. Byrne also drew praise for his frenetic voicework, with reviewer Oliver Sava noting that Byrne's performance helped convincingly reflect the character's occasionally \\"chaotic\\" mindset. Bolin's relationship with \\"ice princess\\" Eska during season two has been criticized for playing an abusive relationship for laughs, with a scene where Eska forcefully separates Bolin and his friend Korra being brought up often as an example. Following the conclusion of the series, reviewer William Cannon of the Latin Times listed a number of characters from The Legend of Korra series who he felt would be suitable to have the lead role in a spin-off series. Bolin and Mako as co-leads made his list, with the reviewer commenting that \\"the funny awkward brother and the more serious brooding bro\\" would make \\"sitcom magic\\". Cannon felt that the two brothers had the best chemistry on The Legend of Korra. He also believed the fact that the two characters were \\"powerful benders\\" would make the spin-off series interesting.

However, he died in 1743, at just two years of age.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40577245 Mordecai left school at the age of eleven, as there was a severe lack of schools, with his father continuing his Jewish education. Upon his bar mitzvah, he ordered tefillin and s'farim for his son from England. The order arrived slightly late, and his father became worried that the ship holding the tefillin and s'farim got lost at sea or was captured by an \\"enemy\\" vessel. England was in middle of King George's war at the time, so he was probably talking about the French when he referred to an \\"enemy.\\"https://hamodia.com/letters/sheftalls- tefillin/ Sheftall went into business by the time he was seventeen, and was making a nice profit buying, tanning, and then selling deerskin. When he was eighteen, he had made enough money to purchase fifty acres of land near Savannah. By his mid twenties, he was doing business with companies from the Caribbean, Charleston, and Philadelphia, making substantial sums of money.

Also on the property was a tanning facility that he made with his half-brother Levi. =Revolutionary War= British soldiers attacking an American position at Savannah, January, 1779 From the outbreak of the Revolution Sheftall was prominently identified with the American cause. He became chairman of \\"the Parochial Committee,\\" organized to regulate the internal affairs of Savannah, and composed of patriots opposed to the royal government. As chairman of this rebel committee he was subsequently denounced and persecuted by the British. In 1777 Sheftall was appointed commissary- general to the troops of Georgia and to the Continental troops also; in October of the following year he became \\"Deputy Commissary of Issues in South Carolina and Georgia\\"; and he figured as a staff-officer in the Continental line of the Georgia brigade during the war.Major General Robert Howe gave him the rank of colonel as a result. Sheftall appointed his son Sheftall as his assistant.https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history- archaeology/mordecai-sheftall-1735-1797 When the British attacked Savannah in late 1778, Sheftall not only took an active part in its defense, but he also advanced considerable sums of money (including loans) for the American cause. After the city had been taken, he and his son were captured, but he resisted all inducements to give up the cause of liberty; as a result he suffered severely from persecution on the part of the British, and was placed on board a prison-ship, the Nancy, with his son Sheftall.https://hamodia.com/prime/for- country-and-for-kashrus/ On the ship, he refused to eat the pork given to him, due to his keeping of kosher. To persecute him further, the British ordered his cutlery be smeared in pork grease, knowing he would refuse to use it. While Sheftall was on the ship, another prisoner jumped overboard in an attempt to escape. The man drowned, and his body was brought back on the ship. Sheftall offered to pay almost all the money he had to have the man buried. On February 25, 1779, Sheftall was told he would be released. He actually was released that June. However, on his way north, he was captured again, and exiled to the Caribbean island of Antigua. Sheftall, however, negotiated a prisoner exchange, and was released in April 1780.https://hamodia.com/prime/for-country-and-for-kashrus/ Due to the British presence in Savannah, Sheftall and Sheftall traveled to New York, before moving to Philadelphia. The British had seized his property during their occupation of Savannah, and his loans that he gave for the defense of Georgia were never paid back. However, he opened a shipping business from Philadelphia, and tried his hand at privateering, in 1781. The latter failed, but he was called back to Georgia the same year, to Agent for the State of Georgia for Purchasing Clothing. In 1782, he was a witness at the court- martial of Robert Howe, where it was being decided if he was at fault for failing to defend Savannah, back in 1779.

For several years the only Jewish place of worship in Savannah was a room fitted up by him in his own house, where services were held until about 1774. In 1773 he deeded a piece of land for the purpose of erecting a synagogue, but the project was abandoned owing to the incipient war with Great Britain. He and his brother Levi also donated the land for the Savannah Jewish cemetery, which was known for decades as the \\"Sheftall cemetery.\\"Revolutionary Jews in Georgia, Exhibit at the American Jewish Archives In 1782, in Philadelphia, Sheftall helped build the synagogue for the Congregation Mikveh Israel. In 1790, Sheftall became president of Congregation Mickve Israel, a position he held for five years. Death  Sheftall died on July 6, 1797.

The original inhabitants were evicted in the fall of 1941. Italian troops burned the village during the Rog Offensive in the summer of 1942 and it was never rebuilt. Church Belfry of Sts. Peter and Paul Church The church in the village was a chapel of ease dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. It had a rectangular nave and an octagonal chancel walled on three sides. A square belfry stood against the south wall of the building. The church was first mentioned in written sources in 1689 by Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, who referred to it as the Church of \\"S. Pauli zu Toplaverch.\\" The church was probably built in the 17th century, but architectural features indicate that it may date from a century earlier. The church had a simple stone door casing and small rectangular windows, with quoined corners and decorative painting. The belfry also featured quoining. The nave and the chancel were covered with a tiled gabled roof. The church fell into ruin after the departure of the Gottchee Germans, and the local people removed much of the material, leaving only the belfry, whose roof was repaired in 2004.Ferenc, Mitja. \\"Topli vrh (Črmošnjice) Podružnična cerkev sv.

German transnational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products in the hotel, lodging and metasearch fields. The United States travel company Expedia Group owns a majority of the company's stock. The company is incorporated in the Netherlands. Trivago was the first hotel search engine in Germany. It became one of the fastest growing companies in Germany, with profitability doubling from 2008 to 2012. History The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany, in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany's first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stephan Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders (Rolf Schrömgens, Peter Vinnemeier and Malte Siewert) remained. Initially, Trivago received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers, Florian Heinemann, and Christian Vollmann. In 2007, Trivago received US$1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. In December 2010, Trivago sold a quarter of the company for US$52.86 million to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners. In December 2012, Expedia, an American travel company, announced that it would acquire a stake in Trivago for $632 million. The deal was completed in 2013. In December 2014, Trivago acquired mobile app product and development company Rheinfabrik. After the acquisition, Rheinfabrik remains independent from Trivago in its work. In 2015, Trivago reported more than US$500 million in revenue. In March 2016, Trivago announced it had acquired a portion of Cloud-PMS company Base7booking. In April 2016, Trivago reached 1,000 employees and began building a new campus in Düsseldorf. On December 16, 2016, Trivago became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TRVG. On November 5, 2019, CEO Rolf Schrömgens announced he will step down at the end of the year and be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Axel Hefer. Operations Trivago is headquartered in Düsseldorf, where the international operations are conducted and 90% of the company's employees work. In 2013, Trivago opened offices in Leipzig and Palma de Mallorca. There are also offices in Amsterdam and Shanghai. Business model As a hotel price comparison website, Trivago makes money from advertising partners primarily using a cost-per-click (CPC) business model. Booking platforms, hoteliers and other providers list rates and advertise on the Trivago site, paying for the clicks received from Trivago users. Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions of its Hotel Manager product, which hoteliers use to market their facilities on the Trivago site. Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. Since their majority shareholder is Expedia, the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various \\"adjustments\\" to how other sites' rates are perceived. They also offer rates through many sites reselling for travel wholesalers, where rooms may or may not be available at time of booking. Products and features *Trivago app *Trivago Hotel Manager *Hotel Manager Pro *Rate Connect =Indices and rankings= Trivago Rating Index (tRI) The tRI aggregates all ratings for destinations listed on Trivago and ranks them between 0 and 100. The index includes criteria such as location, price, food, internet, room and facilities, and is used to create annual Trivago rankings and awards such as the Reputation Ranking, Island Ranking, Ski Ranking, the Top Hotel Awards, and the Best Value Destinations (based on an algorithm combining the tRI with price). Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI) The Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI) displays the average overnight accommodation prices for the most popular cities worldwide. Prices are based on the cost of a standard double room, taken from over 2 million daily price inquiries over the past month. Marketing Trivago focuses on online marketing (SEM and display advertising), public relations and brand marketing (TV). =The \\"Trivago guy\\"= When the company aired its first U.S. TV advertisement in 2012, the ad's spokesman inspired a trending Twitter hashtag, #trivagoguy, based on his unusual look. According to Rolling Stone, Trivago \\"wanted someone real, approachable and genuine\\" when it chose actor Tim Williams to star in the ad. The Trivago guy became an unexpected celebrity, with some people noting his unbuttoned shirt and creepy vibe, while others found his scruffy appearance and deep voice \\"inexplicably sexy\\". Trivago responded to the comments by launching a contest that invited people to give the Trivago guy a makeover. (updated March 25, 2017) The Trivago guy inspired parodies, fan fiction and a large gay following. Many commenters asked why Trivago chose not to have the actor wear a belt. According to the actor, that was an accident. \\"Unfortunately none of the belts fit the belt loops that I had on,\\" Williams said. \\"I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten.\\" Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago guys. From 2016 until June 2017, the French actor Mehdi Nebbou was the German Trivago guy. For Latin America (the whole Spanish-speaking region) Trivago's commercials are presented by Spanish actor Gonzalo Peña. In Brazil, the man shown on screen is the well-known actor and model Willian Mello. In 2016, the company aired ads in India with Abhinav Kumar. Abhinav became popular and an internet sensation for his role in ubiquitous Trivago ads in India. =The \\"Trivago girl\\"= In the UK, Trivago's advertisements are fronted by Australian actress and musician Gabrielle Miller. In Japan, Trivago is represented in their TV commercials by singer/songwriter Natalie Emmons, who uses the pseudonym \\"Strae\\" in the United States. In Malaysia, actress and TV host Dahlia Shazwan has starred in Trivago's advertisements. Legal issues  In August 2016, Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn, LLC filed a class-action lawsuit in California accusing the company and its partners of \\"brazen deceit\\" by coordinating with internet search engines and social media institutions to return false results on lodging entities in favor of those affiliated with their websites, in violation of the Lanham Act. As of January 2017, the case remained pending. In August 2018, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged in a court case brought against Trivago in the Federal Court of Australia that the company had misled consumers on their website and in their television advertising. The court found that search results were ordered giving preference to the highest paying \\"cost per click\\" advertisers, rather than outright cheapest prices. It was also found that the company's television advertising misled consumers by purporting to be \\"impartial and objective\\", when it fact it wasn't. The ACCC case started in the Australian Federal Court in September 2019.The Sydney Morning Herald, Hotels? Trivago's best deals were with best advertisers, ACCC claims, September 9, 2019. In January 2020, the court found that Trivago breached Australian consumer law by misleading consumers on which hotel deals were best and made false representations to consumers. The ACCC argued Trivago promised customers impartial, objective and transparent hotel price comparisons which would allow them to quickly and easily identify the cheapest offer available. Instead, Trivago promoted its best advertisers, the ACCC claimed. The ACCC claimed Trivago failed to properly disclose its operating model and used misleading \\"strike-through\\" price comparisons that compared a more expensive luxury room with a standard room. The matter will return to court for orders for penalties, declarations, injunctions and costs.The Age, Trivago misled consumers in favour of advertiser dollars, federal court finds, January 21, 2020.

The submarine was laid down on 8 August 1942 at the Bremer Vulkan yard at Bremen-Vegesack as yard number 52. She was launched on 13 August 1943 and commissioned on 22 September under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Heinrich Meyer. She did not sink or damage any ships. Official records report that she was sunk by a mine in May 1945 in the Elbe estuary. But late interviews with crew members support that she was scuttled. According to these sources the remaining four crew members convinced British investigators they were struck by a mine. This version avoided the whole crew for being charged for destroying the sub which was supposed to be handed over to allies forces according to German Instrument of Surrender. Design German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-287 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged.

Service history U-287 served with the 24th U-boat Flotilla for training from September 1943 to February 1945 and operationally with the 31st flotilla from 1 March. The boat's only patrol was preceded by two short voyages from Kiel in April 1945 to Horten Naval Base and Kristiansand in Norway (the former being located northeast of Kristiansand).The Times Atlas of the World - Third edition, revised 1995, , p. 12 =Patrol and loss= The boat departed Kristiansand on 29 April 1945 and was stayed in the Elbe estuary.

The first American Snakes & Lattes opened in 2018 in Tempe, AZ. Other locations are being developed and should be opening starting in 2019. Guests pay a small cover charge to play board games for as long as they like, choosing from the cafe's collection of 1,000 - 3,000 games, depending on location. There was no wi-fi available at the original cafe when it first opened as the focus is on playing games and socialising with friends, however, public wi-fi was installed in all locations to accommodate those who wished to use their computers and specifically the morning business and student crowd. The cafes serve food and beverage items, including numerous local draft beers. History Snakes & Lattes was opened on August 30, 2010 by Ben Castanie and Aurelia Peynet, at what later became known as Snakes & Lattes' Annex location. The couple had moved to Toronto from France four years earlier, and came up with the idea for Snakes & Lattes, which they named after Snakes and Ladders, from a visit to a Chicago area game store in 2008. Over the next two years, they slowly built up their sizable game collection to prepare for the 2010 opening. As the cafe gained popularity it quickly outgrew its seating capacity. In 2011, the adjacent property was purchased and the wall between the two properties was demolished, adding roughly 2,000 square feet to the existing café and increasing capacity from 45 to 150 seats. With 7,500 square feet of space, Snakes & Lattes was, according to its managers, the biggest board game café in the world in January 2016. In January 2014, a second location was opened, a board game bar called Snakes & Lagers. Also in 2014, Snakes & Lattes became a sponsor of the Toronto International Film Festival, offering a board game concierge for interested visitors. In July 2015, The Globe and Mail reported that a sitcom, Snakes and Lattes: The Show, would air starting in September as a fictionalized account of the cafe's early years. In September 2015, Snakes & Lagers closed, but immediately reopened in a larger space across the street under the name Snakes & Lattes College in the space that was formerly occupied by the Andy Poolhall bar. The new location features space for 240 guests, a collection of more than 1,000 games, and a combination of the Lattes and Lagers concepts, offering beer, wine, and assorted coffee based beverages. In December 2017, Snakes & Lattes opened the corporate flagship location in Midtown at 45 Eglinton Ave East, Toronto, Canada The latest Toronto location covers 10,000 square feet and three floors. However, it is not the latest one to be opened overall. Snakes & Lattes expanded their operation to the United States in 2018. In May 2018, construction began at the first location in the United States in Tempe, AZ. \\"Snakes & Lattes Tempe\\" opened in October 2018, and is located at 20 W. Sixth Street in the popular Mill Avenue District. Snakes & Lattes is a wholly owned subsidiary of Amfil Technologies, Inc, a publicly traded company using the symbol FUNN.  Publishing division  In July 2017, Snakes & Lattes announced the formation of its own board game publishing division. And one month later, Snakes & Lattes officially received its first publishing contract, which includes exclusive distribution rights as well as a $200,000 signing bonus. Snakes & Lattes has retained the services of distinguished graphic designer Daniel Bieber to work with the Snakes & Lattes publishing division's design team. The first in-house published title by Snakes & Lattes is due out in 2018. On May 29, 2018, Amfil Technologies, Inc. acquired French board game publisher and distributor 'Morning' in an all cash deal worth $150,000 EUR. ‘Morning’ will continue to be run by a group of six experienced professionals within the industry from France as Snakes & Lattes Publishing SAS. This acquisition immediately gives Snakes & Lattes ownership of five games that are on the market or currently being developed. Games Snakes and Lattes Annex location began in 2010 with approximately 1,200 games, and its collection, under the guidance of a game curator, had grown to about 3,000 games by 2015, all of which are available to the public to be played for as long as desired for a small cover charge. The cafés sell a wide variety of games, at both locations and through an online store. Trained 'game gurus', some with teaching backgrounds, are on hand to help newcomers learn games they are unfamiliar with. Snakes and Lattes features a monthly Game Designers Night, where game designers offer prototypes to be tested by the public, as well as regularly hosting tutorials and tournaments. Global influence Snakes and Lattes has been cited as the inspiration for the opening of many other board game cafes around the world, such as Victory Point Café in Berkeley, Draughts in London, Thirsty Meeples in Oxford, the Tabletop Board Game Café in Cleveland, Loot & XP in Oklahoma, The Castle, near Boston, Boxcar Board Game Café in Calgary, Chance & Counters in Bristol, Small Print on Prince Edward's Island, and Bonus Round Games in Chicago. Its business model has also been a model for many of these board game cafes opening worldwide. Snakes and Lattes also pioneered the proliferation of board game cafés in Toronto, which has more than 20 such businesses operating across the city..

He is the founder and president of Matthew 25: Ministries, a non-profit humanitarian aid and disaster relief organization which ships over 12 million pounds of aid worldwide each year. Mettey and his wife Mickey (Michelle) have three children and 6 grandchildren. Early life Mettey was born on March 2, 1945, to Joseph and Mary Mettey. He grew up in Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, Ohio and attended Withrow High School. After attending the University of Cincinnati on a baseball scholarship and obtaining a bachelor's degree in Economics in 1968, Mettey enrolled at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary where he obtained a Master of Divinity Degree in 1972. Later that year, Mettey was ordained as a minister at Walnut Hills Baptist Church. Mettey served as Pastor at Walnut Hills Baptist Church for 11 years and in 1980 he began a 12-year pastorate at Montgomery Community Church. After making the decision to devote himself to the work of ministering to the poor, Mettey resigned his position at MCC and started Matthew 25: Ministries. Matthew 25: Ministries Matthew 25: Ministries began as the result of a trip Mettey made with a group of doctors and nurses to Nicaragua in 1990. Seeing the poverty there, Mettey knew he needed to find a way to help the people of Nicaragua. Using his degree in economics, he was able to develop a system to collect and redistribute food, clothing, personal care, cleaning, medical and educational supplies which were no longer useful by US standards. Since 1991, Mettey has developed several programs within Matthew 25 including their print center which produces notebooks for underprivileged children. In addition to running the ministry, Mettey also pastored the Church of Matthew 25 for over 10 years. Many members of the church helped Mettey run the organization throughout its early years of existence. Through Matthew 25, Mettey was able to establish partnerships with numerous companies including Cintas Corporation. These partnerships have been beneficial not only on a day- to-day basis but especially when natural disasters affect the world. In 1998, Mettey and his Matthew 25 partners sent their first disaster relief to Nicaragua following Hurricane Mitch. Since then, Matthew 25: Ministries has continued to respond to disasters throughout the US and worldwide. Published works Mettey is the author of numerous devotional & inspirational publications. His book \\"Are Not My People Worthy? The Story of Matthew 25: Ministries\\" was released in 2004. His sequel, \\"What God Desires: The Story of the Center for Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief\\" was released in the summer of 2008. His third book, \\"On Which Side of the Road Do the Flowers Grow?\\" was released in early 2009. In 2012, Mettey released \\"Meet Those Who Met The Master,\\" which tells the stories of some of the individuals who met Jesus Christ face-to-face. In 2013 he released his latest book \\"Lost and Found, Stories of Christmas\\". In addition to these books, Reverend Mettey has published several compilations of stories, sermons and reflections. Awards and honors In June 2003, Mettey received the Jefferson Award for Public Service from the American Institute for Public Service. Mettey was one of only 5 regional recipients chosen from 14,000 nominees nationwide to attend the national award ceremonies in Washington DC and to receive the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Outstanding Public Service Benefiting the Local Community. In 2014, Reverend Mettey was the recipient of the NuWay Foundation International Bridge Award. This award honors local philanthropists and citizens who are actively making a difference in the world.

The movement has an intense chromaticism with a great representation of ayahuasca experience psychedelic —a delirious artistic style that is seen strongly in the non-Amazonian pop art works of Pablo Amaringo. Originally, it is a mural art that blends prominently the colorful amazonian culture, European motifs and commercial characters, which could be influenced by American pop art when the era of cable television came to the city, like MTV. Amazonian pop art grew self-taught. Mainly started in the suburbs of Iquitos, where there was no art market, or some kind of art school, because that too is considered a naive style. Essentially, the Amazonian pop art originated from various mixes of popular culture Iquitos received through the media, including movie posters, typography of film in Mexico and India. Another important feature is the visual style that originated from music videos. Typically, in most of the Amazonian pop art works is denoted nightclubs, bars and pubs video scene. In several other compositions, it also becomes large presence of the feminine and the erotic. In the visual, Amazonian pop art is divided into two categories: the diurnal works have consistent and complete colors, and the nocturn works, the most attractive, are painted with phosphorescent material —often taking infinite forms as a collection of neon lights—, that glow under black light or simple night. Currently, several artists engaged in decorating the rustic architecture of the city —such as huts and palafittes— in areas such as the Belen District as a method of artistic expression and cultural influence.

In Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet Union republics, the term sanatorium is generally used for a combination resort/recreational facility and a medical facility to provide short-term complex rest and medical services. It is similar to spa resorts but with medical services. On the other hand, for most Eastern Europeans including Russians, Ukrainians, Czechs, and other national cultures, sanatorium mostly means a kind of hotel with health resort facilities and various available services (such as massage, pools, saunas, aromatherapy, oxygen therapy, etc.) not covered by medical insurance. It is mostly, without any double connotation, a spa resort where relatively healthy people can rest and recuperate during a regular job vacation. For example, Sanatorium Astória Sanatorium Astória and others located in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, or Geneva Sanatorium Hotel in Ukraine, serve this purpose.Geneva Sanatorium Hotel, Truskavets, Ukraine Usually in this case a doctor's prescription is not required. However, a general practitioner is available and it is recommended guests check their health status at the beginning and end of their stay. Sanatoriums first began to achieve prominence in the USSR in the early 1920s, with the introduction of the Labour Code of the RSFSR, which established basic recommendations and standards for workers in Russia (distinct labour codes of the Soviet republics would later be standardized in 1970). This Labour Code guaranteed at least two weeks of leave per year for all workers, recommending that it be spent at a sanatorium for health reasons. By 1990, sanatoriums in the USSR could hold up to 50,000 guests at once. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many sanatoriums fell into disrepair, some becoming refugee camps, but a number of sanatoriums across the former republics still operate.

Operation OAU was an intermittent battle that may have resulted in over 25,000 deaths on both sides. Although the Biafran soldiers were outnumbered, they were able to retain control of Umuahia and eventually recapture the cities of Owerri and Aba. Prelude In April 1968, the Commander of the 3 MCDO General Benjamin Adekunle began drawing up plans to invade the Biafran heartland and capture all remaining major cities. On April 14, the Nigerian 3rd Marine Division under Gen. Adekunle made their way north from their position in Calabar to Ikot Ekpene where they managed to capture the city after a stubborn Biafran defense. For 36 days the 3rd Division pushed their way west through the Niger Delta and reached the area surrounding Port Harcourt on May 19. The Nigerian Army and Navy bombarded the city before carrying out an amphibious assault led by the 31st, 32nd and 33rd battalions. This led to the retreat of Biafran forces. On July 30, Gen. Adekunle began making plans to capture Biafra's remaining major cities, even boldly stating that he would be able to capture Owerri, Aba, and Umuahia in two weeks. In August 1968 the Nigerian Army set up positions along the Aba-Umuahia road and cut off all food shipments from entering the city. Adekunle's strategy for gaining Aba was to surround the city, cut off food shipments, and starve the city into submission. On August 24 two Nigerian battalions and their Soviet advisers crossed the Imo River Bridge and began making their way towards Owerri. The Biafran 4th Commando Brigade under the South African mercenary Maj. Taffy Williams threw themselves headfirst against the Nigerian attack. For three days light machine gun and repeater rifle fire did not stop, and neither side gave an inch until the Biafrans ran out of ammunition and were forced to retreat to Aba. Invasion On September 2, Nigerian artillery began shelling Aba while ground forces began to enter the city under heavy Biafran fire. For twelve days bloody house-to-house fighting ensued and bodies filled Red Cross hospitals before the final Biafrans surrendered on the 14th September. On the 13th September the Biafran 14th Division came under heavy artillery fire from the Nigerian 16th Brigade under the command of Colonel E.A. Etuk. On September 17, the Nigerian 3rd Marine Division began making their way towards Umuahia but were intercepted outside the city by a division of Biafran soldiers and a bloody battle ensued. On September 18, after a fierce five-day stand, the Biafran 14th Division abandoned fighting in Ohoba and Obinze and retreated from the city, leaving Owerri open to Col. Etuk's 16th Division. After Owerri's capture Colonel Ogbugo Kalu was made commander of the 14th Division and Col. Lambert Ihenacho was made commander of the 63rd Brigade. In a letter sent from Genralissmao Ojukwu to Col. Kalu he states \\"Your role in the Port Harcourt disaster is still fresh in the minds of people. You must clear the enemy from Obinze in 24 hours or submit your resignation from the army.\\" Only a few hours later Colonel Kalu ordered a Biafran counter-attack and with the assistance of the Ogbunigwe mine the Nigerian advance was halted and Obinze was captured. The 5th, 21st, 22nd, and 44th battalions of the Nigerian 1st Division began making their way northwards towards the Obiangwu airstrip from to axes after over-running Biafran positions on the banks of the Imo River. Due to the swiftness of the Nigerian advance the Biafran 63rd Brigade retreated from the Obiangwu airstrip on September 22, leaving the bulk of its equipment to the Nigerian 22nd and 44th battalions. The same day, the Biafran Maj. Joseph Achuzie attempted a counterattack at the Obiangwu airstrip, but was swiftly repulsed by the Nigerian 22nd Battalion. On September 30,the Nigerian 21st battalion outflanked the defending Biafran 13th Division and captured Okigwe town. In mid-September, the French President Charles de Gaulle openly voiced his support for the Biafran cause and began shipping weapons to Biafra. The terrain around Umuahia consisted of areas of vast jungles and rivers that were littered with mines and Biafran soldiers. For 14 days, the two sides exchanged gunfire and artillery, resulting in mass casualties on both sides. Adekunle radioed in that he needed re-enforcements or his entire division would be at risk of annihilation, but they never arrived. Nearly 15,000 Nigerian soldiers had either been killed or wounded in the Umuahia sector and on October 1, the 3rd Marine Division retreated to Port Harcourt while the 16th Division was left isolated in Owerri. Instead of pursuing the retreating Nigerians to Port Harcourt the Biafrans slowly made their way up the Aba-Umuahia road and managed to capture Aba on October 15. Aftermath Although Shuwa's 1st Division successfully captured Okigwe and the Obiangwu airstrip the operation resulted in disaster for Adekunle's 3rd Marine Division in which it lost over 20,000 of its 35,000 soldiers, over two thirds of the entire division, and found itself in short supply of both men and food. While Yakubu Gowon was distracted by the anti-tax riots in western Nigeria the Biafran Brigadier Alexander Madiebo encircled Owerri, trapping the 3,000-man Nigerian 16th Division inside the city. For the next several months attacks were launched by Biafran soldiers on Nigerian defensive positions around the city which allowed them to inch closer to Owerri with every battle. On December 5 the Biafrans launched a two-day offensive on Owerri in which 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 300 mortars, 200 howitzer shells, and 20 anti-tank weapons were fired by the Biafrans but the Nigerian 16th Division under Col. Etuk managed to stay put in their original positions. On January 15, 1969, the Biafran 60th Brigade entered Owerri and forced the Nigerians within the city to retreat across the Otamini Bridge. Hungry and half-naked Biafran soldiers discovered the Nigerians’ food and clothing supplies and decided to stay and have their fill while the Nigerians regrouped and launched a counter-attack, causing the Biafrans to retreat. By March 31, 1969, the Biafrans had control over 70% of Owerri while the remaining 300 Nigerian soldiers fled the city on April 25.

Thompson was born to Albert and Laura (née Crabtree) Thompson at Bay Minette, Alabama in 1889. After attending school in Bay Minette, Thompson attended the University of Alabama and Meridian College in Mississippi, graduating from the latter in 1910. Thompson then entered into military service, eventually becoming Captain of Company B of the 1st Alabama Infantry in 1915. He also served a brief term in the Alabama House of Representatives as a representative for Baldwin County in that same year. He was admitted to the bar in 1916 but he was quickly called into federal military service in 1917 when he was sent to France in 1918 to command a Prisoner of War camp until the prisoners were repatriated back to Germany in 1919. After his return to the United States, Thompson opened a law practice in Luverne, Alabama and arranged Battery A of the 141st Field Artillery in the National Guard, which he would later resign from in 1932. Thompson was an active member of the local Ku Klux Klan organization in Crenshaw County and Luverne in the late 1920s, serving as the exalted cyclops of the Crenshaw KKK around 1927 and 1928. In October 1927, Thompson, along with 35 other suspected Klansmen were all indicted by the Crenshaw County grand jury on the basis of their participation of floggings throughout the county. The case, however was dropped later in December by the attorney general's withdrawal on his belief that the state police had assisted the Klan. Less than a year after Thompson's indictment, Governor Bibb Graves appointed him the prosecuting attorney of Crenshaw County. In 1927, Thompson was appointed solicitor of Luverne, and was re-elected to two more consecutive terms in 1928 and 1932. He was called back to active military service in 1942 when he was a captain in the military police corps. He had previously served as the attorney for Crenshaw County since 1941. He sat once again in the Alabama House of Representatives, this time for Crenshaw County as a Democrat from 1943 until 1951. Thompson married Eugenia Marie Little in 1917. They had one child, Mary Eugenia. He was an active community member, sitting on the state athletic commission, Luverne's education board, founding the Lurverne Bank and Trust Company, and serving as a member in the local Lion's Club, Red Cross and American Legion. He also taught Sunday school at his church for over 30 years. He died in 1973 in Luverne.

The merged company was named Ripolin, in honor of Riep, and a Ripolin factory was established in France. Ripolin paints became sufficiently renowned during the period that “ripolin” became synonymous with enamel paints in general and entered the French dictionary as early as 1907. Today Ripolin is the property of PPG Industries. Picasso and Le Corbusier both used Ripolin in their works.

Nicollin notably served as chairman of Montpellier Hérault Sport Club, a football team, from 1974 to his death. Early life Nicollin was born in Valence, capital of the Drôme department. As a young man he worked in the family business of waste collection. Business career In 1974, he became chairman of the amateur football club Montpellier Paillade Sport Club, which played in the division d'honneur. Under his leadership, and the support of Mayor Georges Frêche, the club grew and was promoted to Ligue 1 within eight years. He became the manager in 1977 and developed its activity mainly in Montpellier, before spreading the company around France and creating overseas departments. The company has operations in Belgium and Morocco. It took the name of Montpellier Hérault Sport Club (MHSC) in 1989, the same year Nicollin became the sole shareholder. Under his leadership, the Montpellier has won the championship of Ligue 2 in 1987, the Coupe de France in 1990, and Ligue 1 in 2012. Nicollin not only invested in football, but also in other sports. In rugby, the Nicollin Company was the main sponsor of the AS Béziers Hérault from 1999 to 2009. In 2009, through a holding in his name, Nicollin became a shareholder in Montpellier Hérault Rugby Club. In 2000, he bought Paris Basket Racing and in 2002 Paris Handball. He placed his associates, including Jean-Claude Lemoult, in charge of the teams. He is also president of the Fédération Française de Joute et Sauvetage Nautique (FFJSN), a regulatory group for water jousting. His responsibilities and his image in the sports world raised Nicollin's profile among local officials, which helped him win new waste collection contracts for the Nicollin Company. He was a member of the Club des Cinquante (Club of Fifty), a fraternal organization, as well as the Masonic Lodge of Montpellier, which is affiliated with the Grand Orient de France. Nicollin was the 354th richest man in France at the time of his death. On 15 April 2012, he told TF1 that he would give himself an orange and blue fauxhauk in the style of Jérémy Ménez if his club finished first. On 24 May 2012, Nicollin duly dyed his hair the orange and blue (Montpellier HSC colors) when Montpellier HSC won the 2012 Ligue 1 trophy. Personal life As a big football fan, he held one of the largest collections of football jerseys. The collection comprises around 4500 pieces, some of which belonged to football legends. He was married to Colette, with whom he has two sons Oliver (42 years) and Laurent (39), who both work within the company and the club. His younger son Laurent is the Chairman of Montpellier HSC. Death Nicollin died on his 74th birthday on 29 June 2017 of a heart attack in Nîmes, France. Controversies Louis Nicollin (2013). Nicollin was known in the world of French football for his explosive temperament, marked by frequent verbal blunders and outbursts. On 31 October 2009, he called Benoit Pedretti, captain of AJ Auxerre (to whom Montpellier had just lost), a petit tarlouze, a highly offensive term for a gay man. Nicollin insinuated Pedretti would be treated badly at the next match between the teams. The next day, the Collective Against Homophobia (CCH) asked the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) for sanctions against Louis Nicollin, who apologized the day after. Subsequently, the National Council of Ethics gave Nicollin a four-month ban from official duties, saying his comments were \\"discriminatory and threatening\\". On 15 May 2010, following the club's qualification for the 3rd qualifying round of the Europa League, he bragged to Canal +: \\"The role of idiot is not for us, it is for Mr. Triaud and Mr. de Tavernost (directors of the Bordeaux football club, Ligue 1 champions 2009), and that, that makes me laugh.\\" On 30 December 2011, the newspaper L'Équipe reported Nicollin's comments about Carlo Ancelotti, coach of Paris Saint-Germain. \\"I prefer Courbis to Ancelotti! [...] The greatest coaches are those who win titles with half-good players. Courbis went up in Ligue 1 coaching half-retarded players.\\" On 17 April 2012, barely a month after he was awarded the Pierre Guenin prize for working against homophobia, he lost the prize and its reward of 2,000 euros as a result of a homophobic insult said on Radio Monte Carlo. On 28 July 2012, Nicollin mocked A.C. Milan's Vice president and CEO Adriano Galliani calling him Kojak: > Kojak never called me\\", Nicollin told Canal+. \\"This makes me laugh.

Because of his popularity in the western rice district, he is nicknamed the president of Nickerie. He was a member of the National Assembly of Suriname, between 2000 and 2020 on behalf of the National Democratic Party of Dési Bouterse. Presidential elections 2000 In 2000, the Millennium Combination of Desi Bouterse unexpectedly nominated Doekhie as a candidate for the presidential elections of July 2000. Doekhie's opponent in the elections was Ronald Venetiaan. Doekhi lost the elections and Venetiaan was, for the second time, chosen as president of Suriname. Fight in the parliament On 13 December 2007, there was a fight in the Surinamese parliament in which Doekhi was involved. It all started after the suspension of a heated discussion about alleged corruption at the ministry of Ground and Forestry. According to Doekhi then chairman of the parliament Paul Somohardjo was also involved and Doekhi accused him of repeatedly enriching himself and his affiliated foundations with pieces of land from the government. \\"I know of no Somohardjo who has ever been in prison, but you, Doekhie, go inquire how many Doekhis there are in prison,\\" replied Somohardjo shortly before he suspended the debate and walked away from his chair. Glaringly Doekhi rushed towards Somohardjo and an altercation followed between the two. What was said could not be heard, because after suspension the sound in the parliament gets turned off. MP Ronnie Brunswijk, who noticed the altercation, interfered between the two and shortly after this Doekhi pushed Somohardjo. Brunswijk vigorously pushed Doekhi who subsequently ended up with his back on a table. Brunswijk grabbed Doekhi by the ankles and pulled him to the floor. Thereafter both Brunswijk and Somohardjo gave Doekhi some firm kicks. Through intervention of police and other parliamentarians, the fight ended. The fight was aired live on the television and caused international disgrace for the Surinamese parliament and Suriname as country. Doekhi filed a complaint against Somohardjo and Brunswijk. On several occasions, Doekhi was allotted large areas of land by the government. Altogether, over one thousand acres of state land was allocated to him. Wikileaks According to U.S. Embassy documents published by WikiLeaks, the meeting of Dési Bouterse and Guyanese drug lord Roger Khan was arranged by Doekhi. The cables report that Doekhi introduced Bouterse to Roger Khan on his private land in South Drain, Nickerie. Doekhi replied to the 'disclosures' of Wikileaks by saying that they are all rumors and Doekhi also denied knowing Roger Khan. He said that he knew Roger Khan only from the photographs of him that appeared in the newspapers. The cables also report that Doekhi, Bouterse and Roger Khan plotted to murder then Suriname's minister of Justice Chan Santokhi and Suriname's attorney general Subhaas Punwasi.http://propagandapress.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/wikileaks-guyana- roger-khan-desi-bouterse-cocaine-weapons-the-farc-of-colombia/ Elections 2010 At the Surinamese parliamentary elections of May 2010, Doekhi had the number one place on the MegaCombinatie (a political alliance chaired by Desi Bouterse) voting's list in Nickerie. At the elections Doekhi was re-elected as member of National Assembly of Suriname. Trivia The daughter of Rashied Doekhi, Chantal Doekhi, was shortly after the inauguration of President Bouterse appointed by him as chargé d'affaires of Suriname in the Netherlands. According to the daughter of Doekhi, she was appointed in that function because of her knowledge and experience and not because of the political influence of her father.

Adherents describe themselves only as Muammmin (\\"believers\\"). The sect is named after its founder, Faizrakhman Sattarov, a Russian Muslim who calls himself a prophet. The sect is considered illegitimate by mainstream Russian Muslim clergy because orthodox Islam holds that there are no prophets after Muhammad. Founding and beliefs Sect founder Faizrakhman Sattarov, who was at one time a mufti, presented himself as a prophet in the mid-1960s after he encountered sparks from a trolleybus cable and interpreted the sparks as a divine light from God. He established the sect in the 1970s. The sect is relatively small, with about 70 members. Sattarov and his followers are rejected by mainstream Islamic clergy, who hold Muhammad as the final prophet of Allah. In 1996, Sattarov moved into a three- storey building in Kazan that he declared to be an independent Islamic state. The sect established a madrassa (religious school) in 1997, allowing only its sect members to preach to the students. Instead of using orthodox Islamic scripture, the textbooks used are written and often copied and adapted by Sattarov himself. =Separatism= The Faizrakhmanists stress their native roots and lack of association with other Russian and worldwide Islamic organizations. The sect is believed to reject the modern Russian state and its laws, as well as mainstream and orthodox Islam. In the first decade of the 21st century, Sattarov led his followers into isolation from mainstream society, pursuing an extreme version of religious separatism. Underground compound discovery and raid In August 2012, during an investigation of attacks on Muslim clergy in Tatarstan, Russian police found an eight-level complex of underground chambers beneath Sattarov's home in Kazan, occupied by 38 adults and 27 children who lived in dug-out rooms described as being like catacombs. According to Russian authorities, most of the children had never been outside their underground home, but adult members of the sect said the children were able to play outdoors. Most sect members were forbidden to leave the compound, although a few were permitted to leave in order to work as traders in a local marketplace. One man who lived in the underground complex with his family told news media that he had defied the restrictions to go to a job outside, escaping by jumping over the gate. Four members of the Faizrakhmanist sect were charged with cruelty against children.

This species depends on moisture for survival. So it is abundant during the rainy season, while in the dry season it is present only in damp areas or in cool places.Jimson S. Solatre A promising component in Philippine agroforestry: a land snail called bayuku (Ryssota ovum) shell of Ryssota ovum Description This species is the largest land snail in the Philippines. Shells of Ryssota ovum can reach a diameter of . These very large shells vary in color from pale brown to maroon and sometimes they show a brighter apex. The aperture is large and the interior may be white or bluish-white. Behavior Ryssota ovum is nocturnal. As darkness approaches, these land snails start to move and feed on decomposing forest debris. At daybreak, they hide themselves among the forest litter. They are well-camouflaged in the soil at the base of trees among roots, fallen rotten branches, dead leaves or weathered rock surfaces. Human culture The meat of these land snails (in Filipino called Bayuku) are considered a delicacy in Philippines. The empty shells are used as salt containers, ashtrays and drinking vessels.

History The congregation was founded in 1755 in order to serve the needs of Lutheran immigrants from Germany, as well as Germans from Pennsylvania who moved to Baltimore. It has a bilingual congregation that provides sermons in both German and English. In 1762 the congregation built its first church on Fish Street (later East Fayette Street). By 1773, a new church constitution had replaced the church's earlier core document, and eventually, the 1762 structure was also replaced by a bigger building, the current Zion Church on North Gay Street, erected from 1807 to 1808 in a Gothic style. An additional expansion of the church to the west along East Lexington Street to North Holliday Street composed of an \\"Adlersaal\\" (Parish House), bell tower, parsonage and an enclosed garden designed of Hanseatic North German architecture was constructed under Rev. Julius K. Hoffman in 1912-1913. In the late 1920s, the entire block south of the church was razed to form a monumental square (known as War Memorial Plaza or, less frequently, as \\"City Hall Plaza\\") opposite the Baltimore City Hall of 1875 on the western side and construction at the eastern end of the War Memorial Building with an auditorium, historical exhibit area and veterans organizations offices. On the south side of the church buildings facing the plaza, a new headquarters for the Baltimore City Fire Department was constructed in a Georgian-Federal style complementing the original Zion Church around the corner. German-language sermons have been provided for over 250 years at Zion Church, the only church left in Maryland still holding weekly German-language services. The church participates in the annual Maryland German Festival and is a member of the German-American Citizens Association of Maryland. Zion Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. People The composer George Frederick Boyle was married at the church.

Races do not include a first person cockpit view. The popular gamemode \\"Drift\\" was shown in a gameplay preview by Codemasters. Drivers are given certain cars before some race modes, and can unlock others through other vehicle challenges. Car liveries can be customised by the player, using preset graphic designs adapted with colours or varying shades. =World Series Racing= World Series Racing (WSR) is a highly competitive racing event that races on various tracks on various continents around the globe. It also features a mode called \\"LiveRoutes\\" where the circuit track dynamically changes with no track map. It features race types including Race, Time Attack, Drift, Eliminator, Checkpoint, Touge, and Vehicle Challenges. A player assumes the role of a new driver who is enlisted by Patrick Callahan, an investor, to help launch the WSR by challenging drivers of racing clubs. Winning races against drivers in established clubs in North America, Europe and Asia gains more fans for the series, and leads to drivers from those clubs agreeing to join the WSR. Marketing In May 2013 Codemasters announced that there would be a single £125,000 special edition release of the game which includes a BAC Mono supercar featuring a Grid themed paint job and a tour of the BAC factory. On 30 November 2013, Sony Computer Entertainment America announced that Grid 2 would be entered in the Instant Game Collection of PlayStation Plus so it would be free for the month of December. It began on 3 December 2013. On 1 May 2016, the game was available free to Xbox Live Gold subscribers through the Games with Gold feature. Grid 2 also sponsored Matt Kenseth's #18 GameStop Toyota during a NASCAR Nationwide Series event at Dover International Speedway. Reception Grid 2 received generally positive reviews from critics following its release. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PC version 80/100, the PlayStation 3 version 82/100, and the Xbox 360 version 78/100. Sequel On 17 April 2014, Codemasters released a teaser video suggesting a new game in the Grid series. On 22 April 2014 Codemasters officially announced a sequel, titled Grid Autosport.

Directed by David R. Brooks, it was filmed in Utah with a \\"predominantly Mormon cast,\\" the film was shown at a number of film festivals, winning a number of festival awards, although it was never theatrically released.www.the-numbers.com, retrieved August 14, 2012 However, in 2012 it was picked up by Magnolia Home Entertainment for DVD release.Stockdale, Jenny, Huntington Beach Independent, June 6, 2012 Plot and title The Rosh yeshiva (rabbinical dean) of an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva (theological school) decides that the school should have a baseball team to compete in the college league. Elliot (Michael Buster), one of the students with a background in minor league baseball, is able to convince Charlie Jones (Brian Wimmer), a former major league player who had been imprisoned as a result of DUI convictions—and now has to perform almost 200 hours of community service—to coach the team. As he coaches the team, he gives the players \\"a new measure of skill and confidence,\\" as they help him regain his self- respect.Rottentomatoes.com The title is the name of the ball team, based on Yankle as the Yiddish language nickname for Jacob, used as a play-on-words with the famous ball team, the Yankees.Ritrosky, Madelyn, Film Entertainment Magazine, retrieved August 14, 2012 An additional pun is reflected in the words painted on the school bus the yeshiva ball team uses: \\"In the Big Inning.\\" Themes According to publicity releases, the film is \\"not just a funny film about baseball; it's about second chances, reconciliation and forgiveness....about making mistakes and moving on, about living by principles and not passions.\\"Vittachi, Imran, \\"Film with local ties to screen at Bella Terra,\\" Huntington Beach Independent, January 4, 2012 Production Co- writers (and brothers) David and Zev Brooks have stated that the idea for the movie came to them when they were discussing movie concepts at their dinner table and the film The Chosen brought to mind a movie scene with Orthodox and non-Orthodox students playing baseball.Milan, Alexa, \\"The Yankles,\\" Feb. 24, 2011, gotriad.com They agreed the image was \\"visually entertaining\\" and built the film around that image. Once the script was completed, the brothers established \\"DZB productions\\" and began seeking out investors to fund the film. When it became clear that shooting a low-budget independent film in Los Angeles would be too expensive for them, they made the decision to film the movie in Utah, using many local men and women for cast and crew. According to the film's creators, the decision to film in Utah was made based on a combination of economic factors, the cooperation they would receive from the Utah Film Commission, and the large number of actors and film crew members who lived in that State.Hardy, Rodger L., \\"'The Yankles' featured at LDS, Jewish Film Festivals,\\" Deseret News, January 26, 2010, retrieved August 14, 2010 Evidently because of the large number of Mormon actors and crew members involved in the production, the film (featured in many Jewish film festivals) was included in the \\"LDS Film Festival\\" as well. While the brothers co-wrote the film, David directed it and Zev produced it. The movie was filmed on a tight schedule, and because the actors were not trained baseball players—and there was no time on the schedule to hold a training camp to improve their skills—the number of actual scenes of ball games were limited. The script was completed by the two brothers in 1996, and most of the film was completed by 2007, but a post-production lack of funding postponed the film's completion until 2009. =DVD extras= The DVD includes an 11-minute behind-the-scenes film, 11 minutes of extended musical numbers, and 16 minutes of deleted scenes.

The parish is bounded to the east by the Salisbury Avon and contains the small settlements of Wilsford, Normanton and Lake. Wilsford is about southwest of Amesbury and north of Salisbury.  History  The parish is rich in archaeological features, and lies within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. The scheduled monuments at Normanton Down include a Neolithic long barrow and some 40 Bronze Age round barrows. Three estates were recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, with 19 households. A chapel at Lake belonged to Bradenstoke Priory in the early 12th century; it fell into disuse before the 16th century. By the early 13th century, the two adjacent church parishes of Wilsford and Woodford supported a prebendary at Salisbury. A small Church of England school was built at Wilsford in 1857, extended in 1915 and closed in 1960. Normanton was transferred from Durnford to the parish in 1885.  Notable buildings  The parish church of St Michael is from the 12th century but was largely rebuilt in 1852 by T.H. Wyatt. Wall monuments inside the church include an engraved slate tablet by Eric Gill. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1958. Wilsford House, near the church, is also Grade II* listed. The house was built in 17th-century style by Detmar Blow in 1904–1906 for Sir Edward Tennant, a Scottish politician who was Member of Parliament for Salisbury from 1906 to 1910. The house was inherited by Sir Edward's son, Stephen Tennant, a leading member of the \\"Bright young things\\" social set. Author V. S. Naipaul rented a cottage in the grounds and much of his 1987 novel The Enigma of Arrival is based on the surrounding area. Normanton Manor was the retirement home of Sir Oliver Lodge (1851–1940), the physicist and writer who was involved in the development of radio. Lake House, dating from 1578, is Grade I listed and has Grade II listed gardens. It was built for George Duke, a clothier, and remained in the Duke family until 1897. Restoration was carried out by Detmar Blow at that time, and again after 1912 following a major fire. Governance Wilsford cum Lake parish does not elect a parish council; instead the first tier of local government is a parish meeting, which all electors are entitled to attend. The parish falls under the Bourne and Woodford Valley ward of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. It is within the parliamentary constituency of Salisbury, whose MP since 2010 is John Glen of the Conservative Party.

Between 1239Official Website-Village+History accessed 8 August 2012 and 1256 Rudolf von Alwandingen was mentioned in the record. In 1256 the Lords of Allmendingen sold both Allmendingen and the neighboring hamlet of Märchligen to Interlaken Abbey. The castle fell into disrepair and during the 16th century the cartographer Thomas Schöpf referred to it as a arx disruta or broken castle. In 1676 Albrecht Kauws mentioned the ruins of Alt-Allmendingen CastleSwisscastles.ch Allmendingen Castle accessed 8 August 2012 and by 1729 the ruins were still visible. The old castle had walls that were about and was a square with long walls. The south and west side had no windows. After the Protestant Reformation in 1528, Interlaken Abbey was secularized and its lands, including Allmendingen, were taken by Bern. A new Allmendingen Castle was built near the old castle during the 16th or 17th century. One clue as to the construction date is that a door in the tower bears the year 1607. The new castle was built for the Graffenried family in the Renaissance style. The tower was initially topped with a high pointed roof, which was later replaced with a lower one. In the 18th century, the castle was renovated by the Schultheiss Isaak Steiger and then by his son Franz Ludwig. They expanded the castle with a garden court yard and a connecting arbor. On 17 September 1946 Winston Churchill visited Allmendingen Castle.

Lenzi stated in an interview that both the film's story and script were by Franco Enna, a giallo novelist who lived in Switzerland and that the credited writer Ombretta Lanza was a daughter of one of the producers who attributed to the story. Lenzi than later claimed that he completely re-wrote the script as it was closer to a 1930s crime film than a film noir. It was filmed at Icet - De Paolis Studios in Milan and on location in Milan. Release Gang War in Milan was released theatrically in Italy on 23 February 1973 where it was distributed by Variety Film. The film grossed a total of 631.702 million Italian lira on its release. Reception Director Umberto Lenzi later felt that the film's story had \\"a basic error on the behalf of the producers [...]. We shouldn't have made the protagonist a pimp.

In a racing career which lasted from September 1996 to April 1998 she ran six times and won two races. In two races as a two-year-old she won one race, and finished third in the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot. On her three-year-old debut she was beaten in the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury but then won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse. On her only subsequent appearance that year she finished third in the Coronation Stakes. After one unsuccessful run in 1998 she was retired from racing to become a successful broodmare. Background Sleepytime, a dark-coated bay filly with a white star,Sleepytime image was bred by Charles H. Wacker III and raced in the colours of Wacker's Greenbay Stables. As a two-year-old, Sleepytime was described as having a dragster-like physique, with a \\"slender, delicate front\\" and \\"hugely powerful\\" hind quarters. Her sire, Royal Academy won the July Cup at Newmarket and the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1990. At stud, his best winners have included the double Irish St. Leger winner Oscar Schindler and the Hong Kong champion Bullish Luck. Sleepytime's dam, Alidiva, who was probably the best horse sired by Chief Singer, won at Listed level and was a half-sister to the Prix d'Ispahan winner Croco Rouge. In addition to Sleepytime produced the Group One winners Taipan (Preis von Europa, Premio Roma) and Ali-Royal (Sussex Stakes). As a descendant of the broodmare Bourtai, Sleepytime and Alidiva came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 9-f which produced Big Spruce and Coastal. Sleepytime was trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in four of her six races by Kieren Fallon. Racing career Sleepytime made her racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Sandown Park in September. Her reputation had already been established by her performances in training and she started at odds of 30/100 against fourteen opponents. Ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery, Sleepytime took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew away to win by five lengths in what the Racing Post described as a \\"very impressive\\" victory. Eleven days later, Sleepytime was moved directly into Group One class for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot and started 6/4 favourite. Sleepytime finished third to her stable companion Reams of Verse after being unable to obtain space for a clear run in the straight. Reams of Verse went on to win The Oaks in 1997. In early 1997, Sleepytime was a clear favourite for the 1000 Guineas, after avoiding the respiratory infection which had affected many horses in Cecil's stables. Her training gallops had been highly impressive, making her the choice on many Newmarket experts and insiders. On 18 April, Sleepytime started 4/7 favourite for her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Fred Darling Stakes, a trial for the Guineas. The race produced an upset, with Sleepytime, ridden for the first time by Kieren Fallon, finishing fourth behind the 16/1 outsider Dance Parade. Two weeks later, Sleepytime was one of fifteen runners for the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. She started at odds of 5/1, the third choice in the betting behind Pas de Reponse the European champion two-year-old filly of 1996, and the Godolphin challenger Moonlight Paradise. Fallon restrained the filly in the early stages before moving forward three furlongs from the finish. After briefly looking unlikely to find space for a clear run, Fallon sent Sleepytime through a gap to take the lead inside the final furlong. The filly accelerated clear of the field to win by four lengths from Oh Nellie and Dazzle. After the race, Cecil, who was winning the classic for a fifth time, said that \\"Everything has gone against her but we know how good she is and she proved it today\\". He also expressed the view that while Sleepytime was likely to improve further, she would not stay beyond a mile and a quarter. In June, Sleepytime started 5/6 favourite for the Group One Coronation Stakes, in which her rivals included the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Classic Park. After travelling well for much of the race she failed to quicken in the closing stages and finished third to the 25/1 outsider Rebecca Sharp. Sleepytime did not run again in 1997. Fallon reportedly felt that the ground had been too firm for the filly to show her best form. Sleepytime remained in training as a four-year-old and reappeared in April at Newmarket in the Earl of Sefton Stakes. Racing against colts for the first time she was made 5/6 favourite but weakened badly in the closing stages and finished tailed-off last of the seven runners. Sleepytime returned from the race with injuries to her rear fetlocks and was retired from racing. Assessment In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sleepytime an \\"average\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Stud record Sleepytime became a broodmare for Charles H. Wacker's breeding operation. She has produced several winners including Gentleman's Deal, a colt sired by Danehill, who won nine races including the Winter Derby in 2007. * 1999 Secret Dream (IRE) : Bay filly, foaled 22 April, by Zafonic (USA) – unraced * 2000 Ellen (IRE) : Chestnut filly, foaled 1 May, by Machiavellian (USA) – unraced * 2001 Gentleman's Deal (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 23 April, by Danehill (USA) – won 9 races (£143,109) including G3 Winter Derby, Lingfield; LR Ladybird Stakes, Kempton; LR Quebec Stakes, Lingfield in England 2004-7 * 2004 Spanish Harlem (IRE) : Brown colt, 13 February, by Danehill (USA) – won 1 race and 2nd G3 Gallinule Stakes, Curragh in Ireland 2006-7 * 2006 Dame Ellen (USA) : Bay filly, 6 foaled April, by Elusive Quality (USA) – won in the U.S.A. including a minor stakes at Belmont Park 2008 * 2007 Hypnology (USA) : Bay or brown filly, foaled 11 April, by Gone West (USA) – unraced, dam of winner Trust The Wind (GB)(2011, by Dansili) * 2009 Lashyn (USA) : Chestnut filly, foaled 16 April, by Mr Greeley (USA) – won 1 race from 4 starts in England 2012 * 2011 Oh Star (USA) : Bay filly, foaled 18 February, by Tale of The Cat (USA) – won 1 race and placed 5 times, including 2nd LR Prix de Bagatelle, Maisons- Laffitte from 8 starts in England, France and Dubai 2013–15 * 2012 Hathal (USA) : Chestnut colt, foaled 5 March, by Speightstown (USA) – won 1 race and placed second from two starts to date in England in 2014–15 Pedigree References Category:1994 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 9-f Category:1000 Guineas winners ","title":"Sleepytime"},{"id":"36669166","text":"Shah Sefid (, also Romanized as Shah Sefīd) is a village in Howmeh Rural District, in the Central District of Garmsar County, Semnan Province, Iran.

Zazou stressed that tourists should feel secure in Egypt. =Resignations= In June 2013, Zazou submitted his resignation in protest at President Morsi's appointment of a member of the Construction and Development party as governor of Luxor - this party being associated with the Jama'a al-Islamiya group, which had killed 62 tourists and local tourism- industry workers in the 1997 Luxor Massacre.

Prime Minister Hisham Qandil \\"refused the resignation and asked him to stay at his post to review the situation\\". A few days later the new governor resigned instead. However, he and four other ministers resigned from office on 1 July due to government's reaction to mass demonstrations in the country. Then prime minister Qandil refused to accept Zazou's resignation, however, and asked him to remain in the post.

Having shot more than twenty feature films in the Caribbean, France, Canada, Africa, he is regarded by many as \\"the Father of French Antilles cinema\\".Christian Lara's bio on Imdb  Life and career  Christian Lara began his professional career in Paris (France) as a journalist for Le Figaro, a French daily newspaper. As of 1973, he turns film-maker, directing his first movie, Jeu de dames (en: Dames play), starring Georges de Caunes. That same year, following a then Parisian trend for erotic films, Christian Lara directed Les Infidèles (en: The unfaithfulls), from a screenplay written by French erotic films director Daniel Daërt (born Jacques Godaert). The two men renewed their collaboration a year after, Lara working as camera operator on Daërt's ninth porn film, Cours du soir pour monsieur seul (en: Night classes for lonely men). He produced a more personal project with French actor Jacques Weber and newcomer Anne Parillaud: Un Amour de sable (en: Sandy Love), released in 1976. Aware of the lack of visibility of his fellow Creole people on French movie screens, Lara soon engaged in creating a truly Antillean cinema. In this, he was following the advice legendary cinematographer Ingmar Bergman once gave him, at the time of a three-month stay in Sweden: \\"Only film what you truly know!\\"Testimony by Christian Lara at the time of the presentation of Coco la Fleur, candidate for the movies cycle «Images des Outre-mer» at the Cinémathèque française, in Paris (December 2011). For the first feature of his series of Guadeloupean films, Christian Lara wrote a storyline set during election time in his home island, calling upon Guadeloupean actors Greg Germain (at the time the new star of Médecins de nuit, a French medical drama television series) and Robert Liensol (an experienced movie actor) to star in the film. Overcoming ambient scepticism and the many difficulties attached to its production, Coco la Fleur, candidate was released on February 14, 1979,Doc-file for \\"Coco la Fleur, candidate\\" on Encyclociné and received acclaim both in continental France and its overseas dependencies. Several movies followed, among them Mamito, the portrayal of a grandmother caught in the social inadequacies of a former French overseas colony that became a full- fledged department of France. Released in 1980, the movie was already raising issues that would be brought up 30 years later during Guadeloupe's 2009 general strike. Christian Lara was deliberately striving to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, Oruno Lara (1879-1924), who was Guadeloupe's first historian of African descent, in featuring the history of the Caribbean,archive : Mention of Oruno Lara's work in Negritude by Nick Nesbitt, in. geocities.com, African Writers, March 18, 2001. as is apparent from Christian Lara's subsequent historical feature films. First, in Vivre libre ou mourir (en: Live Free or Die Hard), Oruno Lara is credited as original screenwriter.Oruno Lara on the Internet Movie Database Secondly, Lara himself acknowledges his grandfather's heritage in 1998 when Sucre amer (en: Bittersweet) is released; and again in 2004, when 1802, l'Épopée guadeloupéenne premiered in France on May 10, the very day of the National Celebration of the Abolition of Slavery.

She was sunk off the Normandy beaches with great loss of life in 1944. Construction Derrycunihy was general purpose cargo ship of 10,200 tons built (yard number 275) by Burntisland Shipbuilding Company for McGowan & Gross of London. Because of critical shipping requirements during the Second World War she had been built at great speed: her keel was laid on 22 June 1943, she was launched on 11 November the same year, and was delivered on 26 February 1944. She immediately came under the overall control of the Ministry of War Transport as Motor Transport Ship (MTS) T72, and guns were fitted fore and aft (manned by Royal Navy gunners). Disaster off Normandy Shortly after D-Day the ship was selected to transport one of the regiments required for the build-up of troops in the Normandy bridgehead. On 18 June 1944 HQ, A and C squadrons of the 43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment ('43 Recce') embarked at West India Docks, London, aboard the Derrycunihy. She joined a convoy off Southend-on-Sea, and arrived off the British landing area Sword on the evening of 20 June. High seas and enemy shelling prevented unloading for three days and it was decided to move T72 to Juno Beach for disembarkation. As the ship started engines at 07.40 on the morning of 24 June it detonated an acoustic or 'Oyster' mine dropped by one of the nightly Luftwaffe raiders. The mine exploded under the keel, splitting the ship in two, and the after part, packed with sleeping men of 43 Recce, sank rapidly. Worse still, a 3-tonner ammunition lorry caught fire, and oil floating on the water was set alight. Landing craft and the gunboat quickly came alongside and picked up survivors, most of whom were evacuated to SS Cap Touraine, a former French liner.43 Recce War Diary June 1944, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 171/491.Ellis Vol 1 p. 275.Essame, pp 16–17.McKee pp. 149–152. When all the survivors had been taken off, Captain Richardson of the Derrycunihy and the commanding officer of 43 Recce, Lieutenant-colonel Francis Lane Fox, argued over who should be last to leave the half-sunken ship.McKee, p. 151. The Regimental War Diary records that 'Great gallantry was displayed by all troops in the two aft holds' and lists 183 men of the regiment lost and about 120 others evacuated wounded. In addition, 25 of the ship's crew, (including Army gunners and a Royal Observer Corps Seaborne Observer), died in the disaster, which represented the biggest single loss of life off the Normandy invasion beaches.43 Recce War Diary June 1944, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 171/491. Aftermath In the days following the sinking, most of 43 Recce's vehicles were landed from the beached fore part of the Derrycunihy, and reinforcements were sent from England, but 43 Recce was not fully up to strength until the end of July 1944 and was unable to assist its parent division in the bitter Battle for Caen.43 Recce War Diary July-August 1944, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 171/491.Essame, p. 63. The sunken after-part of the Derrycunihy remains as a wreck site off Sword. Another ship built at Burntisland for the Ministry of War Transport, the Empire Calshot (1945) was bought by McGowan & Gross after the war and renamed Derrycunihy. Notes References * Major L. F.

He plays at wing back. He won one All- Ireland Senior Football Championship and four Ulster Senior Football Championships with his county. Playing career =Club= Playing alongside John Gildea in midfield, Thompson scored three points, including two frees, in the final as Naomh Conaill won their first ever Donegal Senior Football Championship in 2005. He was sent off in the final of the 2009 Donegal Senior Football Championship, which his team lost to St Eunan's. His club won the 2010 County Final and went on to reach the final of the 2010 Ulster Senior Club Football Championship, knocking out Cavan champions Kingscourt, Monaghan champions Clontibret and Tyrone champions Coalisland along the way. He played for his club in the final of the 2015 Donegal Senior Football Championship. They won. =Inter-county= Thompson was a member of the Donegal squad that won the 2007 National Football League. Under the management of Jim McGuinness, and in McGuinness's first season in charge, Thompson won the 2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship, playing and scoring two points in the final against Derry. He played again when Donegal returned to the final in 2012. Donegal defeated Down in that game. Normally a quiet member of the team, in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final defeat of Kerry at Croke Park on 5 August 2012, he knocked teammate Patrick McBrearty out of the game with his head. He played in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final against Mayo. Donegal won. Though nominated for an All Star he was not successful, but was selected as a replacement All Star for the Football Tour of New York when others such as Colm McFadden and Frank McGlynn were unable to attend. Thompson won his third Ulster Senior Football Championship in 2014, scoring one point against Monaghan in the final. He played 52 of the 54 league and championship matches under McGuinness's management, missing only two league games against Cork and Kerry due to injury; only goalkeeper Paul Durcan played in more games under McGuinness. Under the management of Rory Gallagher, who succeeded McGuinness ahead of the 2015 season, Thompson continued to play for his county. For much of Donegal's 2015 campaign, he commuted from his work base in Essex, England. He moved back to Ireland in 2016. His last appearance for Donegal during Gallagher's ill- fated managerial reign was against Dublin in the 2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final defeat at Croke Park, a game in which he scored one point. Thompson returned to the fore under the management of Declan Bonner. He collected his fourth and final Ulster SFC in 2018, appearing as a second half substitute for Odhrán Mac Niallais in the final against Cavan. However, he did not return after the winter. Style of play Thompson has been considered by national media to be \\"an invaluable leader\\", a \\"selfless player\\" and \\"one of the most iconic number 5s in the county's history\\". His virtuoso performance in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was highlighted by The Irish Times which noted how he \\"seemed to shepherd the play exactly to his liking and moved through the fare in that unhurried, three-quarters pace style of his\\", at one stage \\"loitering in front of David Clarke's goal, a de facto full forward doing what good front men do: keeping quiet as a church mouse and waiting to be spotted\\". Despite playing at wing back, he was the first person to congratulate Michael Murphy following his early goal in that game, having raced through to offer support to his full-forward team captain.

At the edge of the Parliament Buildings was originally a summer gazebo for Counts of Holland. It was connected by a drawbridge with the count's garden. At the site of this garden, later east of the Tower the Mauritshuis was built around 1640 as the residence for John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen. Today the Mauritshuis is a museum. Usage West of the Tower is the Mauritshuis and the Grenadiers Gate, that gives access to Parliament Buildings. Directly opposite the Tower are offices of the House of Representatives. On the ground floor in the Tower there is small meeting room. The first floor houses the office of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and the Minister of General Affairs.

A crossing of the Passaic at Point-No-Point was originally built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in the early 1890s to bypass its mainline and thus shorten the distance to its rail yard at Harsimus Cove. At the time the railroad crossed the Passaic at the Centre Street Bridge (no longer in existence) near its Newark station, at the site of today's New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The new Pennsylvania Cut- off diverged from the line (now today's Northeast Corridor) at Waverly Yard, crossed the Newark Ironbound and the Passaic to the Kearny Meadows and then crossed the Hackensack River on the Harsimus Branch Lift Bridge. It rejoined the main line at the Bergen Hill Cut, but diverged again using the Harsimus Stem Embankment to reach its freight yards on the Hudson River waterfront north of its passenger terminal at Exchange Place. The PRR also used the Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge to reach its car float operations at Greenville Yard on the Upper New York Bay. The Point-No-Point Bridge's creosote-covered piers caught fire in 2000. The lower of the Passaic River below the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable commercial maritime traffic upstream of the Point-No-Point Bridge is constricted by the width between its piers when the moveable span is open. Rules regulating the drawbridge operations determined by the US Coast Guard require 4 hours' notice for it to be swung open.

The network content was produced by NBC Sports Group and distributed by Westwood One, which is the corporate successor to the remains of the original NBC Radio Network that was dissolved in the 1980s. NBC Sports Radio was available through over 300 affiliates throughout the United States as of September 2013, as well as through live streaming on NBCSportsRadio.com, NBCSports.com, WestwoodOneSports.com, and the affiliates' websites. Its launch made NBC the last major broadcast network with a sports radio network to complement its sports division. On January 1, 2019, NBC Sports Radio switched from a 24/7 full-time network feed to a service featuring sports newsfeeds and syndicated offerings; the network's remaining operations were shut down 15 months later. Programming NBC Sports Radio programming began airing 7:00pm–5:00am ET weekdays, but sports updates aired on the hour, every hour week-round. In January 2013, NBC Sports Radio launched weekend programming beginning Saturday at 7:00am and ending Monday at 1:00am. NBC Sports Radio had a full weekly schedule of programming beginning on Monday, April 8, 2013. =Live sports= Beginning with the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals, NBC Sports Radio relaunched the NHL Radio national broadcasts, which had not been heard nationwide since 2008. The 2016-17 season brought regular season games, the All-Star Game, a playoff game of the week, both conference finals, and the Stanley Cup Finals to the network. NBC Sports Radio also had the rights to the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Discontinuation of network programming On November 29, 2018, Westwood One announced that NBC Sports Radio would no longer operate as a full-time network and would switch to a stripped-down syndicated service providing 24/7 sportscast newsfeeds at the top and bottom of the hour. Following the change, on January 1, 2019, the network carried two daily programs, PFT Live with Mike Florio in mornings and a revival of the fan-based The Daily Line in the afternoons. While not mentioned in the announcement, the live sports programming NBC Sports Radio carried would also continue, and the 2019 NHL Winter Classic aired on NBC Sports Radio unaffected.https://westwoodonesports.com/?league- archive=2019-nhl-hockey/ Hosts Newy Scruggs, Keith Irizarry, Mark Malone, and Dan Schwartzman were no longer part of the lineup, although their shows continue to be available online. Westwood One cited the increasing competition among sports radio networks (Westwood One was effectively competing with itself since it also distributed CBS Sports Radio) as a factor as well as the network's inability to draw prominent affiliates (unlike CBS Sports Radio, which has a core affiliation with Entercom and Cumulus Media outlets, NBC had no major station group affiliations and largely relied on lower-end independent affiliates). In March 2020, Westwood One informed affiliates that it would no longer distribute or represent NBC Sports Radio's remaining programming after March 31, 2020; the discontinuation did not affect Westwood One's distribution of NHL playoff broadcasts.

It housed a showroom, 18 Packards & other vintage automobiles plus a collection of Route 66 memorabilia, including items from the now- demolished Buffalo Ranch Trading Post. A restored set of historic D-X fuel pumps stood in the old station's forecourt and the red and white on blue \\"Approved Packard Service\\" dealership logo was proudly displayed atop a signpost. As a Route 66 information stop for travelers, who came from as far afield as Europe, Australia, and Asia, the station/welcome center distributed maps, guidebooks and memorabilia as well as word-of-mouth information about The Mother Road.  History  Afton, established 1886 and named for River Afton in Scotland by a railroad surveyor, was once home to a railroad repair facility, turntable and roundhouse. The locomotive repair facility closed in the 1930s, soon after the 1926 designation of U.S. Route 66 in the area. The Eagle D-X station opened in 1933 and has sold various brands of fuel under different owners over the years. In its 1940s heyday, it was one of three stations in a four-block section of US 66\\\\. A 1981 photo shows the station as a tin-roof structure with three modern D-X fuel pumps in the forecourt. It was the first 24-hour filling station on Route 66. The town depended on Route 66 as its economic lifeblood until the construction of Interstate 44 in Oklahoma in 1957 sent the community into decline. Various motels and cafés closed their doors forever; the Buffalo Ranch Trading Post closed upon its owner Aleene Albro's demise in 1997 and was demolished in 2002. Laurel and David Kane purchased the former D-X station in 1999 to be restored and used to house an existing Packard memorabilia collection. The once-vibrant town, long bypassed by the Interstate highway system, had been reduced to 800 people and a handful of local stores. Afton Station was recognised as the \\"Route 66 Business of the Year\\" at the 2009 International Route 66 Festival in Flagstaff, Arizona. Following the deaths of Laurel Kane in 2016, and that of David Kane in 2018, Afton Station's collection of Packards and other memorabilia were sold. According to the station's website, the property is expected to be sold in a public auction scheduled for June 29, 2019.

The survivors said Luther Pendragon had been known to \\"obstruct, apply pressure, and threaten survivors and whistle-blowers who had spoken out about Anglican clergy abuse\\". In the letter the survivors called upon parishioners in Winchester and London dioceses to withhold donations until their bishops terminated the Luther Pendragon contracts.

It is generally considered to be the first portrait medal of the Renaissance.Scher, p.45Weiss, p.10Jardine and Brotton, p.25 On the obverse of the medal is a profile portrait of the penultimate Byzantine emperor, John VIII Palaeologus; the reverse contains an image of the emperor on horseback before a wayside cross. Although the date of the work is not clear it was likely to have been some time during 1438 and 1439, the years John was in Italy attending the Council of Ferrara (later moved to Florence). It is not known whether the emperor himself or his Italian hosts commissioned Pisanello to make the medal, but Leonello d’Este, the heir apparent to the marquisate of Ferrara, has been suggested as the most likely candidate.Scher, p.46 Several drawings by Pisanello are closely associated with the medal and these include sketches now held in Paris and Chicago. Its impact on art was significant: it extended beyond numismatics and the proliferation of outstanding Renaissance medals to influence sculpture and painting. Renaissance artists subsequently used Pisanello's portrait of John almost as a stock type to represent exotic or antique figures.Weiss, p.28 This can be seen in the work of Piero della Francesca who used the image of John in his Flagellation of Christ and Arezzo frescoes.Weiss, p.23 Description Medal of John VIII Palaeologus (reverse) A number of specimens exist of Pisanello's medal of John; most of these are bronze or lead casts. Renaissance medals were often produced in a variety of metals, sometimes with a few gold or silver ones. The bronze example in the British Museum measures 10.3 centimetres in diameter.Cast bronze medal of John VIII Palaeologus, Emperor of Byzantium, by Pisanello - British Museum website The obverse of the work portrays a bust of the emperor looking to the right. His hair hangs in corkscrew curls and he sports a moustache and pointed beard. The emperor’s back is curved, giving the suggestion of a slight stoop. He is dressed in a high-necked shirt with an open jacket, with discernible buttons on both garments. The most striking aspect of the portrait is the emperor’s hat: this large garment occupies around half the pictorial space of the obverse. The hat is sharply peaked and its crown is tall, domed and vertically ribbed. Extravagant hats were typical of Byzantine officialdom and many were drawn by Pisanello. At the summit of the hat is a jewel which intrudes into the space of the Greek inscription encircling the portrait. The inscription reads: Ἰωάννης Βασιλεύς καί Αὑτοκρἀτωρ Ῥωμαἰων ό Παλαιολόγός (‘John, emperor and autocrat of the Romans, the Palaeologus’).Jardine and Brotton, p.26 This style of hat is similar to that which had often been used to represent Mongols in earlier European painting. Unlike some of Pisanello's other portrait medals, such as those of Leonello d'Este,Gordon and Syson, pp.90-91 the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the right. Behind him, mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and foreshortened. The emperor wears his distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reins of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. The gesture of the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is framed in the bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.Jardine and Brotton, p.26 Historical context =The Council of Ferrara= An example cast in gilt-bronze Pisanello's medal was created in response to John's visit to Italy. The emperor had been invited to attend the council in Ferrara by pope Eugenius IV to address the question of unifying the Latin and Greek churches. One of John's chief motivations for unification was to secure help from the western powers in order to meet the constant threat to his crumbling empire from the Turks.Scher, p.46 The emperor arrived in Venice in February 1438 where he was met by Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. Niccolò, with his sons Leonello and Borso, accompanied the emperor as they rode into Ferrara on the 4 March. Following its first magnificent opening public session on 9 April 1438, the Council was repeatedly postponed until the 8 October to allow the many different representatives of the European rulers to arrive. During this lengthy period of waiting for the representatives, the emperor relocated outside of Ferrara because of an outbreak of plague in the city.Gordon and Syson, p.31 He occupied himself with hunting: his enthusiasm for the sport was such that Niccolò was forced on two occasions to make unsuccessful representations to the emperor requesting that he restrain his hunting activities because of the damage to the local game population and surrounding properties.Gill, p.114 John was also criticized by the contemporary Greek chronicler Syropoulos (who was possibly Patriarch Sophronius I of Constantinople when a young cleric) for spending \\"all his time hunting without bothering in the slightest with ecclesiastical affairs.\\"Jardine and Brotton, p.28 In order to encourage John's attendance to the Council, the pope offered to pay the expenses of the Greek delegation. Eugenius found this offer extremely difficult to honour, particularly as John's entourage numbered around seven hundred. In January 1439, however, the Council removed to Florence upon the invitation of Cosimo de' Medici to whom the pope was heavily indebted. In Florence contentious points of theology were resolved, particularly the Filioque, which had contributed significantly to the Great Schism.Gordon and Syson, p.31 A decree of union was signed in Florence in July 1439. When John and his delegation returned to Constantinople, however, it was strongly rejected by the clergy and lay population there, and never took effect. Although the exact date of Pisanello's medal is not known, most writers hold that it is more likely to have been made in Ferrara rather than Florence. One reason for this is the existence of a letter dated 12 May 1439 in which Pisanello is promised payment from a church in Mantua, near Ferrara.Jones (1979), p.14 Drawings Some notable drawings and sketches are associated with Pisanello's medal. One is a highly finished pen drawing of a saddled and harnessed horse from the front and the back (The Louvre, Vallardi, 2468, fol. 277). The horse from the back is clearly the same horse as that of the emperor's squire on the reverse of the medal. The horse is very likely to have come from a Byzantine stable because of its slit nostrils. It was believed in some oriental countries that slitting the nostrils of horses enabled them to breathe easier under exertion.Hill (1964), p.34 A similarly maltreated horse is depicted in the centre of the Paris sheet of sketches of John and members of his retinue. Sketches of John VIII Palaeologus and members of his retinue (Louvre MI 1062) The sketches of John on sheets held in Paris and Chicago are the only drawings by Pisanello that can be securely dated and provide firm evidence of his presence in Ferrara.Gordon and Syson, p.34 The figure on the horse in the recto of the Paris leaf (Louvre MI 1062) is undoubtedly the emperor because of the Italian inscription above the figure, part of which reads: \\"The hat of the Emperor should be white on top and red underneath, the profile black all around. The doublet of green damask, and the mantle of top crimson. A black beard on a pale face, hair and eye-brows alike.\\"Fasanelli, p.38 Pisanello's references to colours on this sheet suggests that the artist intended to do a painting of the emperor.Gordon and Syson, p.34 Scholars differ as to the circumstances of the production of the Paris and Chicago sheets and what they depict. It has been argued that Pisanello made his drawings at the opening of the first dogmatic session on 8 October 1438 when the emperor, in a characteristic insistence on punctilio, required that he be allowed to proceed on horseback to his throne in the council chamber.Fasanelli, 1965, p.39 While the emperor and his retinue waited outside for this impossible demand to be accommodated, Pisanello had the opportunity to sketch the emperor and members of his delegation, including perhaps Joseph II. Contrary to this position, however, is the argument that every figure (except the standing figure in the centre of the Chicago recto) is a drawing of the emperor. This view argues that the Paris and Chicago leaves show Pisanello’s early attempt to formulate the composition of the medal by sketching the emperor in diverse poses wearing different hats and robes.Vickers, p.424 Influences on the creation of Pisanello's medal =Humanism and Ancient Rome= Alberti's self-portrait plaque, c.1430-45 (Paris, Cabinet des Médailles) It is probable that Pisanello's portrait medals were cast with the intention of reviving the form of ancient coins. Pisanello’s medal of John can be firmly located within a period when the court at Ferrara was witnessing an escalation in the appreciation of classical learning. Niccolò III d’Este was the first lord of Ferrara to be educated by a Renaissance humanist and in 1429 he invited the humanist scholar, Guarino da Verona, to tutor his son Leonello. Leonello cultivated a strong admiration for writers like Cicero. During his reign in the 1440s he resolved to revitalise the Studium of Ferrara by recruiting more humanist scholars to work there.Gundersheimer, p.100 Part of this appreciation gave rise to the study of ancient coins: these were the most enduring and abundant artefacts available from antiquity and Leonello himself was an enthusiastic numismatist. Pisanello’s own personal interest in Roman coins is vividly apparent from his drawings of them, and his successful development of the portrait medal as a medium of sculpture can be explained in part to its similarity to coins. The medal evoked a powerful link to antiquity which made it very appealing to patrons.Gordon and Syson, p.95 It has been suggested that Leon Battista Alberti may have played a significant role in Pisanello's conception of the medal of John.Scher, p.46 Alberti attended the Council in Ferrara as a member of the papal Curia and could therefore have encountered Pisanello. Between 1430-35, Alberti cast a bronze, self-portrait plaque in a style that was clearly influenced by Roman imperial portraits. Alberti's plaque was the first labeled self-portrait of an artist.Scher, p.41 =Franco- Burgundian culture= In Northern Italian city-states like Ferrara, the literary culture of high society in the early fifteenth century was more French than Italian,Woods-Marsden, p.402 hence there was a strong culture of chivalry in these areas. Pisanello's medal reflects this culture in its portrayal of John as a huntsman. Hunting was regarded as a noble activity in Italy and was a central ingredient in medieval Romance literature. Franco- Burgundian art in particular celebrated the hunt and certain images of animals by Pisanello are thought to have derived from miniatures from the canonical version of the Livre de Chasse by Gaston Phoebus.Gordon and Syson, p.85 The Vision of Saint Eustace. The reverse of the medal is similar in many respects to Pisanello's Vision of St Eustace. This painting also presents a huntsman on horseback arrested by the sight of a cross and it contains animals that seem to have derived from illuminations in French hunting treatises.Gordon and Syson, p.167 The similarity between John and St Eustace in Pisanello's respective representations could signify the artist's attempt to present John as a modern St Eustace.Gordon and Syson, p.114 =Constantine and Heraclius medals= Two important prototypes for Pisanello's portrait medal were copies of the medals of the emperors Constantine and Heraclius. It is believed that Jean, duke of Berry commissioned the medals to be copied from originals, now lost, during the period 1402–1413. The original Constantine medal was purchased by the duke from a Florentine merchant in 1402, which closely associates the medals with the visit of John’s father, Manuel II Palaeologus, to Paris from 1400 to 1402. The Heraclius medal was likely to have been acquired at the same time. Jean’s acquisition of the medals could have been intended as gifts for the Byzantine emperor in response to a group of relics Jean received from Manuel. The political context in which Jean de Berry’s medals were purchased was therefore similar to that in which Pisanello cast his medal of John: Manuel II, like his son after him, also visited the west in an attempt to secure protection for Constantinople from the Ottomans. The context of their purchase and the lack of any numismatic precedent for the medals suggests the originals may well have had Byzantine enkolpia as their model: these were sacred objects \\"worn about the neck and endowed with spiritual efficacy’.Jones, 2010, p.6 Portrait medal of the emperor Constantine (obverse) The Constantine and Heraclius medals were widely circulated in Italy and the Heraclius medal was recorded in an inventory of Niccolò d’Este’s treasures in 1432. Pisanello’s familiarity with both medals seems unquestionable because of their similarity in size and design to the medal of John VIII. Pisanello appears to have merged various elements from both medals to produce a single piece. The obverse of the Constantine medal, for example, is an equestrian portrait, and that of the Heraclius medal is a profile portrait. Like Pisanello’s medal, the obverse of the Heraclius medal shows the emperor with a servant and contains text in both Greek and Latin. Both emperors were associated with the True Cross, which is portrayed on their obverses. The ownership of the True Cross relic was something of which the Palaeologus dynasty was very proud, making these highly appropriate models for Pisanello to use. It is not known whether Pisanello believed the medals to have come from antiquity or if he was aware of their more recent French background. It is certainly plausible that he observed their similarity of style with that of French illuminated manuscripts and therefore hoped to harness, through his medal, their associations with the culture of chivalry rather than antiquity.Gordon and Syson, p.114 The bold yet refined technique and style of Pisanello's medal is nevertheless clearly different from that of the more overtly intricate Constantine and Heraclius medals.Jones (1979), p.16 Impact on art The Flagellation of Christ by Piero della Francesca The success of Pisanello's medal is evident from the flow of commissions that the artist received from patrons including Filippo Maria Visconti and Francesco Sforza. It initiated the creation of a new art form in which Pisanello set the highest standards that later medallists found hard to equal.Jones (1979), p.27 The success of the medal is also clear from the number of Renaissance sculptors, illuminators and painters who used Pisanello's portrait of John almost as a stock type for figures from distant lands or times. Piero della Francesca is perhaps the most celebrated artist in this respect. In his fresco of Constantine leading his troops into battle by the Milvian Bridge in The History of the True Cross series of frescos in Arezzo, the portrait and headgear of Constantine is clearly modeled on Pisanello's medal.Weiss, p.23 Piero also used Pisanello's portrait of John to depict Pontius Pilate in his Flagellation of Christ.Gordon and Syson, p.195 Other notable artists who were either directly or indirectly acquainted with Pisanello's image of John include Filarete, whose bronze doors for St. Peter's Church in Rome from 1445 depicts the journey home of John from the Council of Florence, and Gozzoli who used John's image as a model to depict one of the magi in his Magi Chapel. John's profile can also be clearly discerned in Carpaccio's St Stephen is Consecrated Deacon from 1511.Weiss, p.23 Notes References *Fasanelli, J.

Among other accolades, he has one All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and four Ulster Senior Football Championships to his name. He is from Creeslough. Playing career =Club and college= McElhinney's club reached the final of the 2011 Donegal Senior Football Championship-- their first ever senior final--but lost, though McElhinney scored during the game. McElhinney also played for DCU. =Inter-county= McElhinney scored two goals for Donegal at Croke Park in the 2006 Ulster Minor Football Championship Final, which Donegal won. He made his debut at senior inter-county level under the management of Brian McIver in 2007. By the time of Jim McGuinness's arrival as manager, McElhinney was still part of the team. Against Derry in the 2011 Ulster Senior Football Championship final, Rory Kavanagh went off injured late in the first half and McElhinney replaced him. In the 2012 Ulster final against Down, his appearance as a second-half substitute was credited with being vital to the victory. He started Donegal's next game, a comprehensive All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter- final defeat of Kerry at Croke Park. He came on as a second-half substitute for Patrick McBrearty in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, won by Donegal. He was treated like a VIP when himself and Maxi Curran brought the Sam Maguire Cup to Mulroy College in Milford. McElhinney started Rory Gallagher's first match in charge of the county, a 2015 Dr McKenna Cup away defeat to Derry. He came on a substitute in the first match of the 2015 National Football League (also against Derry but at home), contributing 0–1 to the team's victory. He also made a substitute appearances in the next game against Dublin at Croke Park, the third fixture against Cork in Ballyshannon and the fourth fixture against Monaghan. He started the fifth fixture against Kerry at Austin Stack Park and contributed 0–1. He started the sixth fixture against Tyrone and scored 0–2 in what RTÉ described as an \\"impressive\\" performance. He followed this up with a further point in the seventh fixture against Mayo. Donegal qualified for the NFL semi-final. McElhinney started and scored 0–2. McElhinney started the 2015 Ulster Senior Football Championship final. He had previously started the preliminary round against Tyrone (scoring 1–2), the quarter-final against Armagh (scoring 0–1) and the semi-final against Derry (scoring 0–1). McElhinney made substitute appearances in the 2015 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Galway at Croke Park and the next game against Mayo at the same venue. McElhinney made a substitute appearance in the second fixture of the 2016 National Football League against Cork, a ten-point win in Ballyshannon. He also made substitute appearances in the third and fourth fixtures against Mayo and Kerry. He started the fifth fixture against Roscommon. Another substitute appearance followed in the next game away to Dublin at Croke Park, during which James McCarthy used his left hand to seemingly gouge McElhinney's eye. McElhinney started the seventh fixture away to Monaghan in Castleblayney and scored a goal. Donegal qualified for the NFL semi-final. McElhinney also started this game, scoring a point. McElhinney made a substitute appearance in the 2016 Ulster Senior Football Championship final. He had previously started the quarter-final against Fermanagh (scoring 0–1), the semi-final against Monaghan and the semi-final replay against the same opposition (scoring 0–1). McElhinney also started the 2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Cork at Croke Park and the next game against Dublin at the same venue. McElhinney made a late substitute appearance in the fifth fixture of the 20017 National Football League against Tyrone. He made further substitute appearances in the sixth and seventh fixtures against Monaghan and Mayo. McElhinney made substitute appearances in the 2017 Ulster Senior Football Championship quarter-final victory against Antrim and semi-final loss to Tyrone. He made a further substitute appearance in the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship qualifier defeat of Meath at Páirc Tailteann. He then made a substitute appearance in the qualifier loss to Galway at Markievicz Park and scored 0–1. Under the management of Declan Bonner, McElhinney made his 100th appearance for Donegal against Cavan in the 2019 Dr McKenna Cup. Following Donegal's victory over Armagh in the 2019 National Football League, McElhinney informed Bonner of his decision to withdraw from inter-county football. He had been an unused substitute in that game and the game before, though he had played in three earlier games of that year's league. These were a substitute appearance in the opening fixture of the competition against Clare in Ennis, Meath in the second fixture (starting then making way for Jason McGee), and again as a substitute, on this occasion for Oisín Gallen, in the third fixture against Tipperary.

His father was John Erhardt Kraus, of German ancestry, and his mother, Rosa Kocher Kraus, was of Swiss descent. After training in the high school of Syracuse, he entered Syracuse University, from which he was graduated as Bachelor of Science in 1896. During the following year he was a graduate student in that university and was also an assistant in chemistry and German. He received the degree of Master of Science at the end of the year. For two years, 1897–1899, he was instructor in German and mineralogy at Syracuse. During 1899–1901 he studied at the University of Munich, and at the end of the period received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy magna cum laude. His major study was mineralogy with chemistry and geology as minors. His doctoral thesis was entitled \\"Ueber einige Salze der seltenen Erden\\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/zkri/34/1/article-p397.xml?language=en He returned to Syracuse University for one year, first as instructor in mineralogy and then as associate professor of the same subject. During 1902–1904 he was head of the department of science in the Syracuse High School and in the summer sessions of Syracuse University of 1903 and 1904 he was professor of chemistry and geology. Dr. Kraus was a fellow of the Geological Society of America, member of the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and other scientific organizations. For two years, 1903–1904, he was president of the Onondaga Academy of Science.The Michigan Alumnus 58-65, November 1904 (http://um2017.org/faculty-history/faculty/edward-henry-kraus/bio ) In the fall of 1904 he was called to the University of Michigan as Assistant Professor of Mineralogy, and in 1906 he became Junior Professor.

Established in the early 1980s, the ICM supports about a thousand congregants, drawn from local permanent residents and numerous students at Middle Tennessee State University. Since the late 20th century, an increasing number of Muslim immigrants from Somalia and Iraq have settled in the city, and international students have increased. By 2009, the ICM's growth made the existing mosque and community center in central Murfreesboro inadequate for the number of worshippers using those facilities. The ICM bought a vacant lot on the outskirts of the city and submitted plans to build a new community center and mosque on the site. Although the plans were approved unanimously by the local county planning commission, some local residents and anti-Islamic activists opposed the project. Rival demonstrations were held in the town to express support for and opposition to the mosque project. During the following two years, the mosque site was subjected to vandalism and arson. The ICM became the subject of heightened political rhetoric in an election year. Numerous opponents alleged that the ICM would support terrorism, that Islam was not a religion, and that it was a plot to overthrow the US Constitution and impose Sharia law. At the same time, numerous local people and rights groups spoke out in support of the project, and the issues received national media coverage with emphasis on the US constitutional right to religious freedom. A local judge rejected that claim and found that the planning commission did not act improperly in granting approval, but that public notice of the planning commission's hearing on the action may have been inadequate. The court prohibited the issuance of a certificate of occupancy necessary to use the building. In August 2012, a US federal court lifted the county court's prohibition, saying it was inappropriate to subject the ICM to requirements in excess of other religious organizations. The mosque was allowed to open in time for the end of Ramadan in 2012. Further appeals and new lawsuits by the mosque's opponents prolonged the litigation until June 2014, when the last lawsuits were finally dismissed by the federal courts. Background Map of Murfreesboro showing the location of the new Islamic Center of Murfreesboro mosque (marked with a red dot) Murfreesboro is a town of about 100,000 people located in Middle Tennessee about 30 miles south of the state capital, Nashville. Although the area's population is dominated by white conservative Christians, in recent years the foreign-born population of the Nashville metropolitan area (including Murfreesboro) has grown considerably. Between 2000 and 2008, the immigrant population jumped from 58,539 to 107,184 – an 83.1 percent rise, the fourth-largest percentage increase in the United States over that period. At the same time, the white population of the area fell by 7.5% while the percentage of ethnic minority inhabitants rose to 20% of Rutherford County's population. The local Muslim population has likewise increased and now numbers about 25,000 people. The rise since the late 20th century has resulted in part from the arrival of refugees from Somalia and Kurds from Iraq, who were resettled there by the federal government upon fleeing the repression of Saddam Hussein after the first Gulf War. Middle Tennessee now has the largest population of Iraqi Kurds in the United States. In addition, a significant number of foreign-born Muslims have moved to the area to study at Vanderbilt University or Middle Tennessee State University. Established in 1982, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro (ICM) formerly occupied a building of located on Middle Tennessee Boulevard near Middle Tennessee State University. Its congregation consists of about 250-300 local families and 400-500 Muslim students from the university – in total, about 1,000 people. By 2009, the congregation had outgrown the space available. Prayers were held in a poorly ventilated room while women, who worship separately from men, had to use a converted garage nearby to watch the proceedings on closed-circuit TV. Many worshippers frequently had to stand in the parking lot during prayers. The ICM began looking for a new location in March 2009. Members raised about $600,000 to fund the construction of a new complex that would include a mosque, school, swimming pool, and cemetery. In November 2009, the ICM purchased an area of undeveloped land at the intersection of Bradyville Pike and Veals Road on the outskirts of Murfreesboro, about from its existing facilities in the town center, at a cost of $320,000 cash. A sign advertising the \\"Future Site of Islamic Center of Murfreesboro\\" was put up on the vacant lot, but in January 2010 it was vandalized during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day weekend. The local newspaper, The Daily News Journal, condemned the vandalism as \\"a sign of stupidity\\" and commented that \\"for someone to paint such an idiotic message on the center's billboard is a clear sign that we have some backwards nuts in our midst.\\" The sign was replaced but was subsequently ripped up and destroyed. Planning controversy Pro-mosque supporters at a September 2010 rally in Murfreesboro Anti-mosque demonstrators proclaiming \\"Murfreesboro Mosque = Islamic Victory\\" In April 2010, the ICM sent the Regional Planning Commission of Rutherford County a request for the approval of the construction of a complex on the Veals Road lot. Prior to its next meeting, the commission ran an advertisement in The Murfreesboro Post newspaper. The main local newspaper, The Daily News Journal, also published a small news story on the day of the meeting. The commission unanimously approved the ICM's plans at its monthly meeting on May 24, 2010. County law did not require public hearings on religious construction projects and took a \\"use-by-right\\" approach, under which all that was needed for approval was a satisfactory set of plans, the approval of the commission at one public meeting, and the advertisement of that meeting in advance in a local newspaper. Other local religious buildings, such as the World Outreach Church, had been approved on a similar basis. Additionally, federal and state law made it all but impossible for local government bodies to deny building permits for religious institutions. Although the application process attracted little comment at the time, a controversy broke out after the ICM's plans were approved. At the commission's next meeting, on June 17, 2010, more than 600 people, some wearing Christian- or patriotic-themed clothes, turned out to protest its approval of the ICM's plans. Many said they had become aware of the plans only after they had been approved. Opponents were harshly critical both of the ICM and of Islam itself. Karen Harrell, a Murfreesboro resident, said: \\"Everybody knows they are trying to kill us. People are really concerned about this. Somebody has to stand up and take this country back.\\" Other residents complained that the new mosque would have a harmful effect on traffic and housing values, noting that it was located in a primarily residential area. Commission officials rejected the criticism, stating that the plans met zoning requirements and that the law did not allow them to reject a project on religious grounds. The tenor of the opposition attracted criticism, with some residents calling the dispute \\"one of the ugliest displays of religious intolerance in the county's history.\\" Rabbi Rami Shapiro of Middle Tennessee State University blamed misinformation and misplaced fears, commenting that \\"there are some who are just anti-Muslim and will do anything to keep a mosque out of their neighborhood. They really feel that Islam is a threat to America and American values.\\" Essam Fathy, an ICM member, said: \\"We have nothing to hide. We do not have a hidden agenda. We're not affiliated with anyone. Where is the tolerance?\\" The mosque's imam, Ossama Bahloul, said that he had told a child that the hatred faced by the center was \\"just a misunderstanding, miscommunication. I told him to love the people because one day they can love you, too.\\" The controversy gained national attention when Lou Ann Zelenik, a Tennessee Republican Party candidate for the vacant representative's seat in Tennessee's 6th congressional district, issued a statement in opposition. On June 24, 2010, Zelenik denounced the planned mosque as \\"an Islamic training center,\\" saying that it was not a bona fide religious institution but a political one \\"designed to fracture the moral and political foundation of Middle Tennessee\\". She declared: \\"Until the American Muslim community find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil, radical counterparts, to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them, we are not obligated to open our society to any of them.\\" Ben Lemming, a Democratic candidate for the same seat, was one of the few Tennessee politicians to support the mosque project, stating: \\"The Americans that want to build this mosque are already our neighbors. They live next to us and they are a part of our community. They are not the enemy.\\" Another Republican, Ron Ramsey, the Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, questioned whether Islam is \\"actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, cult or whatever you want to call it\\" and described it as resembling \\"a violent political philosophy more than [a] peace-loving religion.\\" His comments, made in the run-up to a Republican primary election, were strongly criticised by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that Ramsey's comments were part of \\"a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths.\\" Murfreesboro's local state Senator, Bill Ketron, subsequently introduced what The American Prospect described as \\"one of the most extreme anti-Sharia-law bills in the country\\", authorizing the state attorney general to designate \\"Sharia organizations\\" and imposing a 15-year jail term on anyone convicted of supporting such an organization. The law was passed, but the state legislature took out direct references to Sharia and Islam. Hedy Weinburg of the American Civil Liberties Union's Tennessee branch views the controversy as part of a trend; she told The American Prospect that \\"[y]ou don't have to dig too deep to see and hear the very rampant xenophobia and anti-Muslim voices.\\" In mid-July 2010, supporters and opponents of the mosque organized rival marches to the Rutherford County courthouse. Around 800 people turned up, with about the same number on either side. Middle Tennesseans for Religious Freedom promoted slogans such as \\"Freedom of religion means freedom for all religions\\", while opponents circulated a petition asking the planning commission to overturn its decision and expressed concerns that the mosque's members wanted to impose Islamic law. The mosque's opponents wore \\"Vote for Jesus\\" T-shirts, carried signs with slogans such as \\"Keep Tennessee Terror Free\\", chanted \\"USA! USA!\\", conducted Christian group prayers and heard anti-mosque pastor Dusty Ray of the Heartland Baptist Church telling them, \\"Lord, we're trying to stop a political movement.\\" Televangelist Pat Robertson weighed in during August 2010, telling his TV audience, \\"You mark my word, if they start bringing thousands and thousands of Muslims into that relatively rural area the next thing you know they're going to be taking over the city council.\\" Murfreesboro's mayor, Ernest Burgess, called Robertson's claims \\"so ridiculous they do not deserve a response.\\" Opposition was also fanned by a local newspaper, the ultra- conservative Rutherford Reader, which published numerous anti-Islamic articles. After protests from readers over these, some of its advertisers boycotted the newspaper. As the barrage of criticism from right-wingers continued, the ICM received a series of threatening and offensive anonymous telephone messages. Reviewing the controversy, the Nashville daily newspaper The Tennessean noted that in 1929 another faith group which was controversial at the time had faced opposition, led by the Ku Klux Klan, to its establishment in Murfreesboro. The building of the Roman Catholic church of St. Rose of Lima had prompted a march by angry residents to the town courthouse to highlight their fears that the project would endanger their security and way of life, amid claims that \\"suspicious outsiders\\" were funding it. The church was built to serve recently arrived Irish, German and Italian immigrants. The newspaper highlighted four factors driving the opposition to the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a \\"swell of fear and hatred\\" prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being \\"the wrong kind of Christians\\", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that \\"Muslims are in the way of God's plan\\" for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: \\"It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, a lot of people have very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue.\\" Litigation and attacks against the ICM The Planning Commission gave final approval to the building plans in early August 2010 and on August 20, contractors broke ground on the site. A week later on August 28, an arsonist doused four excavators with an accelerant and set one on fire, destroying it. The incident was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and a $20,000 reward was announced for \\"information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators\\". Although the attack did not substantially delay the construction project, it resulted in an increase in tensions. Tennessee's governor, Phil Bredesen, responded to the incident by calling on state residents to \\"please have great respect for anyone's religious preferences and their rights to practice those in the United States.\\" Republican Sue Myrick, a North Carolina member of the United States House of Representatives, called the attack \\"un-American\\". Two days after the fire, 150 local residents attended a candle-lit vigil on the steps of the Rutherford County Courthouse to protest the arson attack. Many Christians, some of whom had sons fighting in Afghanistan, sent messages of support to the ICM which posted them on a \\"wall of support\\" in its existing building. One local resident said that the planned mosque didn't \\"bother me because everybody has a right to practise their religion. They've been here, they're quiet. They haven't bothered anybody.\\" The planning commission's September 16, 2010 meeting was dominated by supporters of the mosque, who said that they represented the majority opinion in Murfreesboro and expressed concern that the controversy was hurting the town. Ernest Burgess, the Republican mayor of Murfreesboro and an elder at the North Boulevard Church of Christ, argued that it was a matter of principle to uphold the constitutions of the United States and the state of Tennessee. But the following day, several opponents of the ICM filed a lawsuit against the county to block the mosque's construction. The litigation was spearheaded by lobbyist Laurie Cardoza-Moore, who demanded that the Rutherford County sheriff investigate a supposed conspiracy linking the mosque with Islamic militants in Somalia and Gaza. She said to a Christian television station that the mosque was part of a plot to take over Middle Tennessee. Cardoza-Moore led a group called Proclaiming Justice To The Nation (PJTN), which funded the lawsuit via donations. Some of the donors were called as witnesses in the hearing. One witness admitted that PJTN had paid him thousands of dollars to read to the court extracts from anti-Muslim Internet websites. Kevin Fisher, an anti- mosque activist who had led the July protest march, was one of the three plaintiffs. He claimed that the planning commission had improperly rushed the application process in an attempt to avoid a panic among the local population, a claim dismissed by the director of the commission. He had walked out of the planning commission's meeting the previous day, telling the Murfreesboro Post newspaper, \\"All I heard was this socialist garbage being spewed by the pro- mosque crowd. It was too much. The things that they represent offend me.\\" The plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order to halt construction and called for the construction permit to be nullified, arguing that the planning commission had broken state law by not giving adequate notice of the meeting at which the ICM's building plans had been approved. They also claimed that the project put local residents at risk because \\"there was considerable evidence of elevated risks to the public safety of citizens of Rutherford County from the proposed ICM compound.\\" The plaintiffs said they \\"have been and will be irreparably harmed by the risk of terrorism generated by proselytising for Islam and inciting the practices of sharia law.\\" The Anti- Defamation League intervened in the case, Estes v. Rutherford County Regional Planning Commission, to support the mosque on the grounds that the plaintiffs were seeking to interfere with the builders' religious freedoms. The ADL's amicus brief pointed out that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) requires courts to \\"apply a strict standard for reviewing laws that substantially burden religious exercise.\\" The United States Department of Justice also submitted an amicus brief to support the county's position. As well as reiterating the requirements of RLUIPA, the Justice Department's brief affirmed that Islam was protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and emphasized that mosques should be treated no differently from churches or synagogues. The local U.S. Attorney, Jerry Martin, commented that the suggestion by the plaintiffs that Islam was not a religion was \\"quite simply ridiculous.\\" He told a press conference that \\"[a]ll three branches of government have repeatedly recognized Islam as a religion. Presidents, as far back as Lincoln and Jefferson and as recent as President George W. Bush, have, indeed, publicly recognized Islam as one of the world's largest religions.\\" Lou Ann Zelenik (center), the former Rutherford County Republican chair who opposed the mosque project, attended the hearings in support of the plaintiffs' case The plaintiffs' lawyer spent six days trying to convince the court that Islam should not be considered a religion and that the mosque was not entitled to religious land use zoning regulations \\"because these are the same people who flew jets into the World Trade Center on 9/11.\\" The lawyer, Joe Brandon Jr, called a series of non- expert witnesses, including anti-Islam activist Frank Gaffney, accused the ICM of being linked to terrorism, and claimed that its members wanted to impose Sharia law on the United States. The proceedings were criticized by the county's attorney as a \\"circus\\". The media compared the case to the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, at which evolution was effectively put on trial, while Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts characterized the mosque's opponents as a \\"clownish band of bigots\\". On November 17, 2010 Rutherford County Chancellor Robert Corlew refused to halt construction, and found that the county had not \\"acted illegally, arbitrarily or capriciously\\" in approving the plans. He said that there were some legitimate concerns about the county's public notice requirements and suggested that they should be reviewed, but found that the ICM's members did not adhere to extremist religious ideas. In his ruling, he dismissed the plaintiffs' claims that \\"Kevin Fisher, an African American Christian, would be subject to being a second-class citizen under Sharia law; Lisa Moore would be targeted for death under Sharia law because she's a Jewish female; Henry Golzynski has been harmed because he lost a son fighting in Fallujah, Iraq, by insurgents pursuing jihad as dictated by Sharia law.\\" Controversy over the mosque continued despite the failure of the lawsuit. In July 2011, Herman Cain, a former pizza tycoon and candidate for the 2012 U.S. Republican Party presidential nomination, told Fox News that communities, including the residents of Murfreesboro, should have the right to block mosques being built in their areas. He said that the Murfreesboro project was \\"not a mosque for religious purposes\\". His remarks were strongly criticized by commentators. Stephen Fotopulos of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition said Cain's comments \\"demonstrate[d] a profound misunderstanding of the U.S. Constitution.\\" The ICM's imam Ossama Bahloul said it was \\"sad to hear these words coming from a GOP presidential candidate, who is not only supposed to believe in but should also uphold the US constitution. Mr. Cain is encouraged to educate himself about the first amendment and learn more about our peaceful and productive Muslim community in Murfreesboro.\\" The controversy affected the building project, with some contractors becoming reluctant to work on it, and community relations. According to Professor Saleh Sbenaty of Middle Tennessee State University, a board member of the ICM, \\"kids [began] asking their mothers who have head scarves not to go to the malls because they're scared of seeing their mom being harassed,\\" while adults had become \\"afraid to come to the mosque and pray.\\" One contractor told ICM officials that although he needed the work, \\"I don't want to get on bad terms with my preacher.\\" The ICM had to pay significantly more for the project because of contractors' reluctance to work on it. It also had to hire a security guard to protect the Veals Road construction site and install a security system in its existing building. Chancellor Corlew had rejected the claims that the county acted improperly is permitting construction of the mosque. But in September 2011 he granted the plaintiffs permission to challenge whether the county's approval of the mosque had violated open meeting laws. A few days later, an anonymous caller left a bomb threat on the ICM's voicemail, accompanied by \\"extreme profanities and derogatory remarks toward Muslims.\\" Federal authorities later arrested and charged Javier Alan Correa, a 24-year-old resident of Corpus Christi, Texas. Correa was charged with violating the civil rights of mosque members by infringing on their religious freedom and faced up to 30 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years' probation, including eight months of home detention, on a charge of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs. Further litigation and federal intervention In the fall of 2011, seventeen plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Rutherford County, alleging that it had violated Tennessee's open-meetings law. Their attorney said that the approval of the mosque violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, on the grounds that \\"mosque members were compelled by their religion to subdue non-Muslims.\\" This was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, leaving the question of whether there had been sufficient public notice for the planning commission's meeting of May 24, 2010 as the only remaining issue to be decided. The plaintiffs' attorney repeatedly tried to expand the case, for instance, comparing the mosque unfavorably to a neighboring Baptist church: \\"Are you aware of any information linking Grace Baptist Church to organizations that call for the killing of Americans?\\" Because the Islamic Center was not named as a defendant, its members were unable to defend themselves in court against such accusations. If the case went against them, they would be forced to seek fresh approval in a climate that had become intensely hostile towards them. Saleh Sbenaty, a Syrian-born spokesman for the ICM, called the attacks \\"draining\\" and said that he had \\"left my country over 30 years ago to get my freedom over here, and now that's being threatened. My First Amendment rights are under fire.\\" The issue of whether adequate notice had been given was complicated by the fact that Tennessee law did not define what would count as adequate, and the issue had never been satisfactorily settled in court. The county contended that the notice that had been given – an advertisement in the Sunday edition of the local free newspaper and on that paper's website – met the requirements of the law. Its attorney, Josh McCreary, noted that the approval of the mosque had been a routine matter that had not been controversial at the time. He said that the public controversy had been stirred up by the plaintiffs after the fact to make the situation \\"notorious\\". He told the court: \\"In this instance, everything they are relying on to prove this is a matter of pervasive public importance came after the lawsuit was filed\\". Chancellor Corlew ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on May 29, 2012, finding that the county had not given adequate public notice to the planning commission's meeting. The ruling found that only about 196 copies of The Murfreesboro Post newspaper, in which the meeting was advertised, had been distributed in unincorporated areas of Rutherford County, where a third of the county's population lived. The county had also failed to advertise the meeting on its website or local cable channel, which officials acknowledged had been an oversight. Corlew stated in his opinion that because of the great public interest in the mosque, the county should have taken extra steps to make the public aware of the meeting. Although the ruling voided the planning commission's approval, the judge noted that the commission was free to reconsider the issue and come to a fresh decision as long as it was taken for \\"non-discriminatory reasons.\\" The judge did not order a halt to the mosque's construction, which was by that point nearly finished. Its opponents returned to court to ask for construction to be suspended. Their bid was rejected by Chancellor Corlew, who ruled that a separate motion would need to be filed. The opponents' subsequent motion to halt construction was denied by Corlew on June 13, but he ruled that the county could not issue the ICM with an occupancy certificate because he had previously voided the approval of the site plan. On June 22, the county appealed the judgment and requested that the court lift the injunction on issuing an occupancy certificate. The request was turned down on July 2, meaning that the full court process – taking up to a year – would be required. But on July 18, however, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, alleging that the county violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act by Corlew's decision. The ICM also filed suit in the same US District Court. The Justice Department's filing criticized Corlew for treating the mosque unequally by imposing a heightened requirement of notice of a kind to which other religious organizations had not been subject. Judge Todd Campbell issued a temporary restraining order requiring the county to conduct a final inspection and to issue a certificate of occupancy if the inspection showed that the structure complied with the building code and applicable regulations. In response, Chancellor Corlew stayed his own actions under the doctrine of Federal preemption, but made it clear that he had been preparing to order cessation of construction had the federal authorities not stepped in. The mosque's opponents filed a motion in the federal district court, claiming that Judge Campbell had accepted \\"false allegations\\" and questioning whether Islam was a religion. The local US Representative, Republican Diane Black, and her primary opponent, Lou Anne Zelenik, both issued statements criticizing the federal intervention. Black said: \\"Christians' rights to freedom of religion are violated frequently and the Obama Justice Department doesn't come rushing to our aid, but they will meddle in a local zoning matter to promote Islam.\\" The mosque's imam, Ossama Bahloul, told the media that the ruling was a victory for religious freedom: \\"We are here to celebrate the freedom of religion and that the concept of liberty is a fact existing in this nation. The winner today is not an individual, the winner today is our nation and the fact that our Constitution prevailed.\\" Luke Goodrich of The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a national civil liberties organization, said: > No congregation should have its right of religious liberty curtailed solely > because some of its neighbors disapprove of its religious beliefs. No > religion is an island. When the rights of one faith are abridged, the rights > of all faiths are threatened. All faiths have the right to worship God in > freedom and in peace. Opening Interior of the new mosque After final safety checks, the new mosque received a temporary certificate of occupancy on August 7, 2012, during Ramadan. The building opened on August 10 for Friday prayers. Although there were concerns about public safety, the occasion passed off peacefully. A single opponent turned up in an \\"I Love Jesus\\" hat and told reporters that he was there to \\"represent the Christians\\". Shortly before the opening, members of the neighboring Grace Baptist Church erected 13 white crosses in a field across the road from the mosque \\"to make a statement to the Muslims about how we felt about our religion, our Christianity. We wanted them to see the crosses and know how we felt about things.\\" Ossama Bahloul of the ICM told worshippers, \\"This day is a day of forgiveness. We want to say that we have nothing bad in our heart against anyone.\\" The New York Times praised the forbearance of the ICM's members in an editorial published on August 19, noting that \\"[w]ith patience and dignity, the Islamic Americans of Murfreesboro learned the hard way the endless American lesson that constitutional rights don't come guaranteed.\\" The mosque received its permanent certificate of occupancy on August 23 after the county completed its inspections of the new building. However, the litigation continued as the mosque's opponents sought to intervene in the federal case and the county continued its appeal to a higher state court against Chancellor Corlew's May decision. The litigation against the mosque's opening finally came to an end on June 2, 2014 when a bid by opponents to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of the United States was rebuffed, with the court declining to take the case. The four-year litigation had by this point cost the county more than $340,000 in legal fees. One positive outcome of the dispute, according to a spokesperson for the Nashville-based American Center for Outreach, was that it had prompted local Muslims to build closer ties to local interfaith groups and become more engaged in the community, from which they had received a great deal of support. Mosque opponents also attempted to block the construction of a cemetery adjacent to the complex, filing a suit in a state court. The suit was dismissed by a senior judge on June 19, 2014, with no further possibility of appeals.

The Afizere are speakers of Izere language. They are surrounded by the Berom to the west, Mwaghavul in Mangu to the south, Anaguta people to the northwest. Settlement The Afizere previously settled in the Chawai region of southern Kaduna State and has time passed different Afizere groups moved southwards. The first group from Southern Kaduna settled at the foot of the hills called Gwash close to the current location of the Jos Museum and others settled at the foot of Shere Hills in the Jos Plateau. Different Afizere clans soon settled southwards of Chawai lands. Currently there are more than 500,000 Afizere people distributed over 16 major traditional districts who inhabit territories within Jos North, Jos East, Mangu, in Plateau State and Tafawa Balewa and Toro Local Government Areas in Bauchi State. During the pre-colonial period, the people lived in hilly terrains surrounding the Jos Plateau as a defense mechanism against jihadist attacks during and after the Fulani Jihad. Some Afizere towns and villages include Dong, Tudun Wada (Gyese), Kabong, Jos Jarawa, Rikkos, Fudawa, Kwanga, Fobur, Angware, Maijuju, Fusa, and Gwafan (Lamingo), Shere, Zandi, etc. Culture Izere towns have a traditional and gerontocratic chieftaincy system that is headed by an Agwom and supported by five districts heads representing the five royal families of the Afizere: Fobur, Forsum, Maigemu, Shere and Federe. In Afizere land, a district could be a combination of 6 to 12 villages. Historically, the Agwom was also the chief priest of the people A traditional dance called Asharuwa is one of the cultural heritage the Afizere have maintained over the years. The asharwa dance group represented Nigeria in countries like USA, UK, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Ukraine, and Kenya. =Language= The language of the people is called Izere and it is spoken in five different dialects. The dialects are Ibor spoken largely in the Fobur district, Isum spoken in Forsum villages, Iganang spoken in Shere, Ifudere spoken in Federe and Ikyo. Izere is considered to be part of the Benue-Congo language group that is prominent in Central Nigeria. =Religion= Christianity and Islam are the two major religions among the Afizere but some Afizere still choose to adhere to their traditional beliefs. In traditional Afizere religion, there is a supreme deity called Adakunom meaning father of the sun who is considered the creator and source of life and health. A few minor gods exist to act as mediators to Adakunom. Father of the sun is the literal translation of Adakunom but can be translated as \\"father, the sun\\" or \\"mighty sun\\" (the almighty sun). Then there are the spirits or witches who are the source of both good and evil. Christianity came to Afizere land by the way of Sudan Interior Mission preachers who converted some Afizere individuals who later acted as agents of dispersion of the religion. Islam came to the region after the Fulani jihad when part of Afizere territory came under the authority of the Emir of Bauchi Further reading *Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Africana, 1st edition.

The episode was written by series co-creator Mark Frost and directed by series co- creator David Lynch. It features series regulars Kyle MacLachlan, Michael Ontkean, Ray Wise and Richard Beymer; and guest stars Frank Silva (uncredited) as Killer BOB, Hank Worden as The Waiter, Julee Cruise as Singer, and David Lynch as Gordon Cole. Twin Peaks centers on the investigation into the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) in the small rural town in Washington state after which the series is named. In this episode, during the ongoing investigation into Laura's death, FBI special agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) and Sheriff Truman (Ontkean) continue to search for her killer, the demonic BOB, who has possessed a human host. Aided by Mike (Al Strobel), Cooper and Truman arrest Benjamin Horne (Beymer), believing him to be inhabited by BOB. Later that night, Cooper is warned by The Giant (Carel Struycken) that \\"it is happening again\\", while BOB's real host, Leland Palmer (Wise), murders Madeline Ferguson (Lee). \\"Episode 14\\" was first broadcast on November 10, 1990, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and was watched by an audience of 17.2 million households in the United States, about 20 percent of the available audience. The episode was well received, garnering positive reviews after its initial broadcast and in subsequent years. Academic readings of the entry have highlighted the theme of duality and the cinematography in the revelation scene. Plot =Background= The small fictional town of Twin Peaks, Washington, has been shocked by the murder of schoolgirl Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) and the attempted murder of her friend Ronette Pulaski (Phoebe Augustine). FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) has been sent to the town to investigate, and has come to the realization that the killer was possessed by a demonic entity—Killer BOB (Frank Silva). MIKE (Al Strobel), a similar spirit, has spoken to Cooper and his FBI superior, Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch), explaining the nature of their existence. Meanwhile, Madeline \\"Maddy\\" Ferguson (Lee), Laura's cousin, has arrived in Twin Peaks from Missoula, Montana, and helps Laura's friends Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and James Hurley (James Marshall) investigate the killing. Donna finds Harold Smith (Lenny Von Dohlen), one of Laura's friends to whom she had given a secret diary, and Donna and Maddy attempt to steal it from him. =Events= It is morning at the Sheriff's Station. Agent Cooper, Chief Gordon Cole, Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz), Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse), and Phillip Gerard (Al Strobel) are drinking coffee in the lobby. Truman informs that preparations have been made for them at The Great Northern. Gerard, currently possessed by MIKE, mutters his description of Bob's current location. Truman tells Hawk to search Harold Smith's apartment. Cooper tells Hawk to search for Laura Palmer's secret diary. Cole bids all farewell and leaves for Bend, Oregon. Cooper, Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost), Brennan, and Gerard / MIKE are in the lobby of The Great Northern Hotel attempting to find BOB's human host. The hotel is hosting a contingent of sailors who are bouncing rubber balls in the hotel lobby. MIKE is seated while hotel guests are brought to him one by one for \\"inspection.\\" One after another, MIKE turns each away. An angry Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) enters the lobby demanding to know what is going on. Just then, Gerard enters a fit and collapses while grasping at his missing arm. Meanwhile, Deputy Hawk visits the residence of Harold Smith and finds him hanging dead amongst his orchids. Maddy announces to her Uncle Leland (Ray Wise) and Aunt Sarah (Grace Zabriskie) that she is leaving Twin Peaks to return to her home in Missoula, Montana. Cooper, Truman, and a police team arrive at Smith's residence. They discover the torn-up remains of Laura Palmer's secret diary strewn about, and a suicide note that reads, \\"J'ai une âme solitaire.\\" Cooper translates, \\"I am a lonely soul.\\" Elsewhere, Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) and Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick) discuss their financial concerns regarding Shelly's catatonic husband Leo (Eric Da Re). Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) confronts her father Ben over his ownership of the brothel One Eyed Jacks. He confesses that he and Laura Palmer had a sexual relationship. When Audrey asks him if he killed her, he replies \\"I loved her.\\" Later, Shelly arrives for work at the Double R Diner and tearfully informs Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) that she has to quit the diner to care for Leo full-time. Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and his wife Nadine (Wendy Robie) enter the diner. Nadine, believing she is an eighteen-year-old high school student, asks Norma about her relationship with Ed, to their embarrassment. Nadine then accidentally shatters her milkshake glass. At the Johnson residence, Bobby Briggs and Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) break open the heel of Leo Johnson's boot, discovering a microcassette hidden within. Cooper examines the remains of Laura's secret diary at the police station, finding repeated references to BOB, and a description of sexual abuse since childhood. Laura wrote that BOB was a friend of her father, and in another entry wrote, \\"Someday I'm going to tell the world about Ben Horne.\\" Audrey then enters and tells Cooper about Ben and Laura's affair. After she leaves, Cooper reminds Sheriff Truman of The Giant's message, \\"Without chemicals, he points\\". Cooper states that MIKE manifests when his human host, Philip Gerard, is not medicated, and that MIKE fainted that morning just as a certain person approached him. Cooper exclaims to Truman, \\"Harry, we need a warrant ... a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Horne!\\" Later that evening, Benjamin Horne is meeting with Mr. Tojamura at The Great Northern. Mr. Tojamura gives Horne a check for $5 million to purchase the lands of the Packard Sawmill. Immediately after accepting the check, Sheriff Truman, Deputy Hawk, and Agent Cooper enter Horne's office. Truman arrests Horne for murder. Horne attempts to flee but is restrained and handcuffed. At the Palmer home, a severely impaired Sarah Palmer crawls down the stairs, crying to Leland for help. A phonograph is spinning in the background, its needle skipping at the end of the record. After jailing Horne at the Sheriff's Station, Cooper and Truman encounter the Log Lady (Catherine E. Coulson), who tells Cooper, \\"... there are owls in The Roadhouse.\\" Cooper replies, \\"Something is happening, isn't it, Margaret?\\" The moon is full, partially obscured by a dark and cloudy sky. At the Packard residence, Pete Martell (Jack Nance) is fixing himself a midnight snack. He encounters Mr. Tojamura in the dark, who roughly embraces and kisses him, causing Pete to drop and shatter his plate. In a high dudgeon, Pete orders Tojamura to leave. Tojamura coyly reveals that he is actually Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) in disguise. The two embrace as Pete emotionally dissolves. Sarah Palmer crawls into her living room. She sees a vision of a pale white horse then passes out. Leland Palmer is fixing his tie in the mirror, ignoring her. Cooper, Truman, and The Log Lady visit The Roadhouse, which is filled with sailors. Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and James Hurley (James Marshall) are seated together discussing Harold's death and Maddy's departure from Twin Peaks. Bobby Briggs is seated at the bar next to the old waiter (Hank Worden) from The Great Northern. While a singer and band perform, Cooper has a vision of The Giant standing alone on stage. The Giant says to Cooper, \\"It is happening again.\\" He repeats this warning. At the Palmer home, Leland smiles at himself in the mirror. BOB stares back at him from the reflection and cackles madly. Leland dons a pair of latex gloves. Maddy comes downstairs complaining of a burning smell and sees Sarah unconscious on the floor. She sees Leland grinning at her, then sees BOB appear in Leland's place. She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her \\"Laura,\\" while Bob kisses her. Leland / BOB then becomes enraged and screams, \\"Leland says you're going back to Missoula, MONTANA!\\" as he rams her head into a glass picture frame, the words \\"Missoula, Montana\\" in the lower corner of the picture. Maddy collapses, bloodied and dead. A crazed Leland places a cutout of the letter \\"O\\" under the nail of Maddy's left ring finger. Cooper's vision of The Giant ends, replaced by the singer and band. The old waiter walks over to Cooper and says, \\"I'm so sorry.\\" Donna begins to sob. James comforts her, to no avail. Bobby Briggs turns from the bar, overcome by a mysterious sadness. Cooper stares out, bewildered, as the band repeats a melancholy refrain. Production alt=A man in a tuxedo smiles at the camera. \\"Episode 14\\" was written by series co-creator Mark Frost, who had written six previous episodes and directed the first-season finale, \\"Episode 7\\". Frost co-wrote three further installments—\\"Episode 16\\", \\"Episode 26\\" and Episode 29\\"— and all of the episodes of the 2017 limited series. This episode was directed by Lynch, the fifth such episode of Twin Peaks; he later directed \\"Episode 29\\", the series' finale, and all the installments of the limited series. Lynch has later stated that he feels he was able to show more on screen in the episode than he expected the network's standards and practicies office to allow. He credits this to the unusual imagery used, adding \\"if it's not quite standard it sneaks through, but it could be that the 'not quite standard' things make it even more terrifying and disturbing\\". The cast of Twin Peaks did not know who would be revealed as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland would not be the eventual murderer; as the parent of a young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said \\"Ray, it was you, it was always you\\". However, Wise felt that the end result was \\"beautiful\\", and that it left him and his character \\"satisfied and redeemed\\". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie- in novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.Jennifer Lynch, 00:09–00:41 Lynch has mentioned that he tried to avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated \\"each week, you know, they [the writers for The Fugitive] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end\\". =Cinematography= The climactic murder of Madeline Ferguson in the episode features extensive use of jump cuts to portray Leland Palmer's spirit possession, switching rapidly between actors Ray Wise and Frank Silva. The scene is unusually long for a murder on television, lasting over four minutes. Some of its elements, including the insertion of a paper letter under Ferguson's fingernail and the use of jump cuts to events in the Roadhouse bar, are intended to echo similar aspects of \\"Pilot\\". Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, in their book The Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions, have drawn attention to the use of mise en scène early in the episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer sitting in the Palmers' living room pans across the family's \\"bric-à-brac\\". This technique draws attention to the painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on \\"the famous homecoming queen shot\\" of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible. Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the \\"emotional claustrophobia\\" felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling. Themes The revelation scene, in which Bob is shown to have inhabited Leland Palmer, has been noted for its sense of duality, a common theme throughout Twin Peaks. In Full of Secrets: Critical Approaches to Twin Peaks, David Lavery wrote that upon The Giant's appearance to Dale Cooper, \\"The Giant has transmuted the public place into something private\\". Lavery added that the murder scene is \\"in the living room, the public within the private\\". He summarized that the ambiguity between the public perception and the private perception—\\"the outer and the inner\\"—\\"reverberates\\" throughout the scene. In his view, Maddy Ferguson was Laura Palmer's \\"double\\" and Leland is \\"doubled\\" by Bob. However, Lavery referred to the duality of Leland and Bob as a \\"subjective formation\\" and added that the use of jump cuts \\"could be Maddy's view of Leland just as much as Leland's view of himself\\". This scene has also been noted by critic Sue Lafky from the Journal of Film and Video as one of several in the series that suggest incest and necrophilia. She speculated that \\"Leland/Bob may have raped the dead or dying Maddie\\", comparing this to the \\"necrophilic fantasies\\" that Laura Palmer's corpse evokes, and Ben Horne's unwitting brush with incest when he encounters his daughter Audrey at a brothel. Earlier in the episode it is revealed that Laura had been subject to sexual abuse by BOB, and implicitly Leland, which was further explored in the 1992 prequel film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Broadcast and reception \\"Episode 14\\" first aired on the ABC network on November 10, 1990. The initial broadcast was viewed by 17.2 million households in the United States, making it the fifty-first most-viewed broadcast episode for the week. These viewing figures represented 20 percent of the available audience and 10.4 percent of all households in the country. This represented a significant rise in viewing figures compared to the preceding episode, \\"Episode 13\\", which was seen by 11.3 million households. However, the following episode, \\"Episode 15\\", suffered a drop in viewing figures, attracting 13.3 million households. The episode was well received critically. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper noted that fans and critics had begun to lose interest in the series by this point, but felt that \\"even at its most strained and obtuse, [Twin Peaks] displays more imagination and effort than almost everything else in TV land\\". He added that viewers may have been put off by the series' frame of time, explaining that only two weeks of narrative time had elapsed since \\"Pilot\\", a slow pace contrasted with the \\"fast-forward, instant payoff philosophy of most television\\". AllRovi's Andrea LeVasseur described the installment as \\"pivotal\\", noting that it \\"answers some of the series' long-running questions\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps rated the episode an \\"A\\", adding \\"it's not like there's any shortage of action\\". He felt that the effects used in the episode were effective and frightening while still seeming low-key. In his view, the episode's blending of surrealism and horror was similar to scenes from Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive. Phipps described the climactic murder as \\"one of the most disturbing moments in the Lynch filmography\\", adding that it was a recurring Lynchian theme to represent the end of innocence as an actual death. IGN's Matt Fowler included the murder at number 16 in a list of the \\"Top 20 Creepiest Moments on TV\\", describing it as \\"nightmare fuel\\". Fowler felt the depiction of the killing was \\"savage\\" and unusually long for a television scene; however, he added that the rampant speculation as to the identity of the killer meant that whoever it was revealed to have been, it would be \\"somewhat expected\\". Keith Uhlich, writing for Slant Magazine, described the episode as \\"quintessential Lynch, perhaps his finest work\\", noting that the climactic murder scene was more powerful because of its necessary use of implication and suggestion. However, Uhlich felt that the installment was \\"a tough act to follow\\", arguing that the only subsequent installments that competed with it were the series' finale and the 1992 psychological thriller film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, which is based on Twin Peaks. DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich described the installment as \\"a violent, disturbing revelation\\". Rich felt that the entry's supernatural elements assured the audience that there was \\"a grander scheme to the Laura Palmer story\\", elevating the series' long-running murder plot beyond \\"just a random night partying with drug dealers gone wrong\\".

In 1943, Løken was one of 1,100 Norwegian officers arrested and sent as prisoners-of-war to Germany, only being released after the German capitulation in 1945. Early life and education Kristian Løken was born in the town of Elverum in Hedmark county, Norway. He was the son of smallholder Rikard Løken (1845–1909) and Gurine Syversen (1852–1902). Kristian had an older brother, Halvor (born 8 March 1876), who also sought a military career. He attended the upper section of the Norwegian Military Academy from 1903, graduating as an infantry officer in 1906. That same year he took his examen artium. After graduating, Løken was posted as a first lieutenant to the 1st Akershus Brigade. In 1910 he achieved a permanent position in the Norwegian infantry. He was transferred to the 5th Brigade in 1911 and to the 2nd Brigade on 1 October 1912.Barth 1930, p. 391 Belgian service and the First World War Løken was declared supernumerary soon after graduation, and granted leave from the Norwegian Army in 1907. He then entered the service of the Force Publique in the Congo Free State. He would have three periods of service in the Congo in the coming ten years. Løken was among a sizeable number of Norwegian junior officers who sought foreign service after being unable to gain paid officers positions in Norway. The Norwegian Armed Forces had trained a large number of officers in the lead-up to the 1905 dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, officers that were no longer required once the crisis between the two countries had settled. Along with other Norwegian officers, Løken was shipped out of Kristiania in March 1907. His brother, then army captain Halvor Løken, bid him farewell at the docks with the words \\"It's a comfort to know that ill weeds never wither\\" (Norwegian: \\"'\\"), in reference to the unhealthy and dangerous conditions then to be found in the Congo Free State. Løken's group of officers first underwent a three-month colonial training course in Brussels, Belgium, before being shipped to the Congo. During his service in the Congo, Løken would periodically receive renewed permission from the Norwegian authorities to remain in Force Publique service. Initially given command of a Force Publique company, Løken eventually became a battalion commander in the Belgian Congo.Viksveen 1992, p. 72 Løken was one 21 Norwegians to attain the rank of Commandant in the Force Publique.Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, p. 202 He remained in Force Publique service after Leopold II of Belgium gave up his personal control of the territory in 1908 and transferred it to the Belgian state. Løken's first tour in the Congo lasted until 1910, when he returned to Norway. He went back to the Congo in 1911, staying until 1913, and had a final tour from 1914 to 1917. During his final years in the Belgian Congo, Løken saw action as first a company commander and later a battalion commander in the First World War East African Campaign, fighting the German colonial forces commanded by General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Amongst the battles in German East Africa where Løken fought was that at Ruakadigi in present-day Rwanda in January 1916. Kristian Løken left the Force Publique and the Congo in 1917 and returned to Norway on 12 November 1917. Due to his years spent in the Congo he was affectionately nicknamed \\"Kongo-Løken\\" by his Norwegian friends and colleagues.Christensen 1990, p. 16Hovland 2000, p. 92 During his final years of life, Løken received a pension from the Belgian state for his Force Publique service.Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, p. 196 Inter-war years Returning to regular Norwegian Army service, Løken was promoted to the rank of captain in May 1918. Following his promotion, he assumed command of the 4th Company of the 4th Infantry Regiment, a command he continued to hold until 1930. In 1918 he attended a hand grenade course, in 1919 the Norwegian infantry shooting school, in 1921 a machine gun course and in 1928 a tactical command course. From 1926 onwards he served on occasion as an instructor at the shooting school. From 1929 to 1931 he commanded the First Company of the Norwegian Royal Guards. In the period 1932–1933 he led the Norwegian Military Academy. He attained the rank of major in 1933, and colonel in 1939. From 1933 to 1939 he served with the 6th Infantry Regiment in Hønefoss. In the inter-war years Løken wrote three articles for the military journal Norsk Militært Tidsskrift, one in 1927 on the subject of basic military training and two in 1936 on Norwegians serving with the Force Publique in the First World War East African Campaign.Johnsen and Wasberg 1969, pp. 223, 328, 330 In addition to his military career, Løken worked for the Office of the Auditor General of Norway from 1920 to 1923. After his years at the Auditor General, Løken spent a year in France in 1923–1924, teaching Norwegian students at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille in Rouen, Normandy. He had been a state authorised French language translator in Norway since 1920. On 17 January 1931, Kristian Løken married the Brandval-born Guldborg Noer (born 3 July 1886), the daughter of forest owner Arne Noer and Thea Hokaasen. The couple had no children. Second World War By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Løken was in command of the 14th Infantry Regiment in Nordland county, a position he had held since 17 January 1939, when he replaced Colonel Carl Gustav Fleischer, who went on to command the 6th Division with the rank of major general.Fure 1995, pp. 80, 90, 225 On 16 December 1939, Løken assumed command of Norwegian 6th Brigade, after the brigade's previous commander Colonel Wilhelm Faye had been appointed chief of defence for Finnmark county following the outbreak of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union. Colonel Løken was also appointed chief of defence for the mainland of Troms county in Northern Norway. In this command Løken carried out brigade-sized field exercises to prepare his troops for potential combat operations.Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 26Sandvik 1965I, pp. 54-55Hovland 2000, p. 62 Løken was replaced as commander of the 14th Infantry Regiment by Lieutenant Colonel Thoralf Nummedal.Hovland 2000, p. 109 By April 1940, Løken was temporarily in command of the 6th Division's officer cadets, while these were deployed on winter exercises.Haga 1998, p. 252 Løken's headquarters were located at Bardu in Troms.Steen 1958, p. 176 =Norwegian Campaign= Following the invasion of Norway and the German attack on Narvik on 9 April 1940, by 3rd Mountain Division troops led by Generaloberst Eduard Dietl, Løken was responsible for carrying out the Norwegian mobilization in Troms.Berg and Vollan 1999, pp. 45-53, 94 The first task Løken carried out, in addition to the mobilization, was using the forces initially available to him to block the German forces at Narvik from advancing into Troms. Maintaining control of the central army base Setermoen was vital for the Norwegian mobilization.Haga 1998, p. 30 The forces under Løken's direct command when the Germans invaded were an infantry battalion, a mountain artillery battalion and assorted support troops. In the evening of 8 April, Colonel Løken had been ordered to send his infantry battalion and a motorized artillery battery to Narvik to defend the town, but the transfer of forces was pre-empted by the German landing.Steen 1958, pp. 23, 59 In maintaining a defensive posture with almost his entire force during the mobilization stage, Løken came into disagreement with the top leadership of the 6th Division, which wanted a swift counter-attack against the Germans as soon as possible.Berg and Vollan 1999, pp. 425-426 Despite not mounting an immediate counter-attack, Løken did move troops forward to blocking positions further south than planned, as he saw it as important to stop the German advance in the Gratangen area.Lunde 2009, p. 262 Colonel Løken's more cautious approach to warfare lead to a deterioration of his relationship with the more offensive division commander, Carl Gustav Fleischer. On 19 April, Løken reported that the morale of the opposing German forces seemed to be faltering, and that most of the Germans appeared to be \\"below average\\" at skiing.Lie 2000, p. 165 After completing the mobilization in his area of responsibility and stopping the German advances into Troms, Colonel Løken was in overall command of the early counter-attacks carried out in late April 1940 by the 6th Brigade against the German forces in the Gratangen area.Sandvik 1965I, p. 256Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 78 During this time, Løken first had his headquarters at Kroken in Salangsdalen in Troms, before it moved forward to Fossbakken in Lavangen. Løken personally commanded the central axis of the failed first Norwegian advance at Gratangen.Ramberg et. al. 1996, pp. 103, 107Andersen 1997, p. 170 During the attack the 6th Brigade greatly outnumbered the German defenders, with two infantry battalions with artillery support mounting a direct attack against the German positions on Lapphaugen, while another two battalions made a flank march to cut off the defenders. The frontal attack failed after Løken had hesitated in attacking and sent his units against strong German positions in a disorganized and uncoordinated manner. While the main attack failed, the flank march of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment was counter-attacked by the Germans, the Norwegians suffering heavy losses and being routed.Lunde 2009, pp. 294-309 After the failed initial offensive, Løken severely criticized the commander of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, Major Nils Christoffer Bøckman, for having bypassed Løken's brigade command in order to receive permission to advance directly from the 6th Division, exposing his unit to counter-attack.Andersen 1997, p. 174 Løken's orders to the battalion had been to under no circumstance move down into the Gratangen valley, but stay on defensible ground.Den Militære undersøkelseskommisjon av 1946, 1979, p. 132 On 29 April 1940, the 6th Division was reorganized into two weak brigades, the three-battalion strong 6th Brigade under Colonel Løken and the slightly smaller 7th Brigade under Colonel Wilhelm Faye. While the 6th Brigade was to follow a generally mountainous advance route against the Germans, the 7th was to attack along the coast in cooperation with French expeditionary forces.Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 139 The 6th Brigade carried out a hard-fought mountain campaign over the coming weeks, pushing the Germans southwards along the Swedish border.Haarr 2010, p. 241 During the advance ski patrols reported in late April to Colonel Løken that the mountainous Kuberg Plateau, in the advance route of the brigade, was unoccupied by the Germans. Failure on the part of Løken to act on this information and seize the plateau allowed the Germans to occupy and fortify the feature on 7 May 1940, requiring heavy fighting a week later before they were dislodged.Lunde 2009, p. 420 In May 1940, Løken was relieved of command of the 6th Brigade, being replaced by the Lieutenant Colonel Ole Berg. Colonel Løken was instead appointed temporary chief of the 6th District Command (covering Northern Norway) on 7 May 1940, replacing Colonel Lars Mjelde, who had taken sick.Haga 1998, pp. 94, 168, 252Sandvik 1965II, p. 51Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 233 The appointment was formally confirmed by royal resolution on 31 May 1940, at a meeting of the King and Cabinet at Storsteinnes in Balsfjord, Troms.Nygaardsvold 1947, pp. 42-43 According to General Otto Ruge's memoirs, the replacement of Løken as a field commander was motivated by a wish on the side of the commander of the 6th Division, General Carl Gustav Fleischer, to have a \\"young and aggressive\\" brigade commander.Berg and Vollan 1999, p. 256 Following his appointment, Lieutenant Colonel Berg led the 6th Brigade in successful offensive actions against the Germans. The main task of the 6th District Command, which Løken led for the remaining month of the Norwegian Campaign, was to coordinate the efforts of the civilian authorities in Northern Norway in support of the needs of the Norwegian front line forces.Hovland 2000, p. 169 During Løken's time in command, the 6th District Command was initially based in Harstad, then later at Moen in Målselv, Troms.Hauge 1960, p. 185Lie 2000, p. 180 On 10 June 1940, the forces in Northern Norway capitulated, a ceasefire having been in place since 24:00 on 9 June. Despite having been on the offensive until 8 June, the Norwegian troops were ordered to capitulate after the Allies had pulled out of Norway. Before releasing the Norwegian officers from captivity, the Germans demanded that each gave their word of honour not to participate in further resistance. Following the Norwegian capitulation, Colonel Løken worked on maintaining order and calm in Northern Norway in the transition phase to German occupation.Jensen 1956, pp. 153-154 Løken had been made the acting commander of the 6th Division in the demobilization phase, retaining a 10-man force of armed military police under his command until 27 July 1940. The military police officers worked on returning requisitioned civilian vehicles and organizing military depots.Austigard, Grüner and Julnes, p. 114 Once the tasks in connection with the demobilization of the Norwegian forces in the north were completed, Løken returned to his home in Mosjøen. In mid-1941 Løken moved to Oslo. In the period March 1942 to July 1943 he worked in Oslo's civil air defence. =Imprisonment= In August 1943, the German occupying authorities carried out mass arrests of 1,100 Norwegian officers, suspecting the officer class of supporting the Norwegian resistance movement. Colonel Kristian Løken was arrested on 16 August 1943 and given prisoner number 913.Ottosen 2004, p. 462 He was first imprisoned at Oflag XXI-C in Schildberg in the German-annexed Reichsgau Wartheland. While interned at Oflag XXI-C, Løken shared a room with Colonel Johannes Schiøtz, with whom he had attended the Norwegian Military Academy close to four decades earlier. Løken and Schiøtz were roommates at Oflag XXI-C from 6 January 1944 to 19 January 1945, when the Norwegian prisoners were sent on a one-week forced-march on foot and by train to Oflag III-A in Luckenwalde, Germany. On 24 January, five days into the journey, Løken was transferred to a hospital train carriage, suffering from ill health. The Norwegian prisoners of war remained interned at Oflag III-A until their German guards abandoned the camp on 21 April 1945, with Soviet forces arriving the next day. On 10 May 1945, two days after the end of the war in Europe, the Norwegian prisoners left Luckenwalde, reaching Norway in several groups in late May/early June 1945.Schiøtz 2007, pp. 193, 307-323, 350-351, 375-423 Løken arrived in Oslo on 28 May 1945. Post-war life From 1946 to 1954, Løken worked with the General Inspector of the Infantry, and until 1952 as a French language teacher at the Norwegian Military Academy. In 1947, Løken also held the position as second in command of District Command North in Northern Norway. According to the Norwegian military intelligence officer Christian Christensen, Løken's relationship with the commander of District Command North, General Arne Dagfin Dahl, was poor. Løken was, according to Christensen, completely relegated from any meaningful tasks by General Dahl. Several years previously, during the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, Løken had been Dahl's commanding officer.Haga 1998, p. 53 On 1 August 1949 he formally retired from the Norwegian Armed Forces, yet continued working for several years under temporary contracts. Colonel Kristian Løken was the vice chairman of the reconstituted Norwegian Congo Veterans' Association (, ). He remained a member until the association was finally disestablished in 1960, being awarded the society's 50 year medal (commemorating the disestablishment of the Congo Free State in 1908) in 1958.Morel and Morgenstierne 2002, pp. 153, 190-196 By 1948, he lived in Oslo, Norway. Kristian Rikardsen Løken died in March 1961, aged 76. Honours and awards For his services in the Congo, the Belgian authorities awarded Løken a total of 14 decorations. Among his Belgian honours, Løken was made an Officer of the Order of Leopold II, a Knight of Order of Leopold, a Knight of the Royal Order of the Lion and a Knight of the Order of the Crown with palm, as well as being awarded the Croix de guerre with palm, the Order of the African Star, Silver Medal, the 1914–1917 African Campaigns Commemorative Medal, the Commemorative Medal of the 1914–1918 War, the Inter-Allied Victory Medal 1914–1918, and the Commemorative Medal of Congo. After the end of the Second World War, Colonel Løken was decorated by the Norwegian government with the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch, the second highest Norwegian war decoration.Gjems-Onstad 1996, p. 202 He also received the Defence Medal 1940–1945 and the Haakon VII Jubilee Medal 1905–1955.

In collaboration with the Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects, and sponsored by the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, the Project is a collective effort to organize and present historical data covering significant events from 1894 to the current day.  Project history  Established in 2010, the Waterfront Workers History Project began with a team of research associates and financial support from the Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies. The Project was established in partnership with the Unions Reexamined Working Group, an organization that studies the effects of union governance and organizational culture on solidarity and political commitments. The Project represents a collaborative effort between professors, students, labor unions, and community members.  Overview  The Project provides access to a vast collection of digitized historical documentation and photographic resources for educational purposes. The image and document repository is available for study at the University of Washington and through an extensive Internet database portal on the university Web site. The online repository is organized by industry, with separate sections for longshore workers, maritime workers, cannery workers, and shipyard workers. Each section includes brief summaries, indepth research reports, historical documents, newspaper articles, and rare photographs. The sections depict everyday life and labor on the West Coast waterfront as well as strikes and other dramatic struggles for workplace rights. A particular focus is given to the influential International Longshore and Warehouse Union. A detailed special section examines the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike that spurred the union's formation, and includes newspaper articles published during the strike, a day by day narrative of major events and a collection of archival photographs. Another section looks at the life of longtime President Harry Bridges, including footage of his testimony at a deportation hearing in 1950. The Project includes more than 20 oral histories with longshore leaders, cannery workers, and labor history experts examining the tradition of dissent on the West Coast waterfront and the struggle of Filipino cannery workers for democratic unionism. Other industrial sections shed light on less-studied aspects of waterfront labor, including the trailblazing racial progressivism and integrationist efforts of the Marine Cooks and Stewards and the Ship Scalers Union.  Historical collections  ;International Longshore and Warehouse Union Collection Donations to the Project include historical collections from the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) archives, offered by Union historian Gene Vrana. The ILWU donation includes rare digitized copies of the Waterfront Worker, the labor newspaper that served as a catalyst to address workers rights on the waterfront in the early 1930s, eventually leading to the 1934 strike and the creation of the ILWU. ;Ronald E. Magden Collection The Ronald E. Magden is an historian, author, and professor at Tacoma Community College. In 1977, Local 23 of the ILWU began preparing a grant proposal in response to a request by the Washington Commission for the Humanities. At this time, the Union asked Magden to assist them with writing and editing the documentation. The history that he uncovered about the waterfront workers initiated a 30-year involvement in researching the history of longshoremen on the Pacific Coast. The Ronald E. Magden Collection in the University of Washington Special Collections Library includes an extensive presentation of archival materials, from which researchers have created a database of thousands of documents, books, films, and nearly 200 digitized photographs of waterfront workers from the 1880s to the present.

Recent figures have indicated there are over three hundred fifty thousand Akunakuna people.Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Africana, 1st edition. New York: Basic Civitas Books, .  Name  The Igbo word akwünaakwüna, originally referring to a town where the Akunakuna people live, was Anglicized to Akunakuna. This exonym takes no account for what the Akunakuna people actually call themselves in the Gwune language, agwaGwunɛ, though, they are related. According to the book New Dimensions in African Linguistics and Languages, During World War I, married and unmarried women were recruited to serve in the West African Frontier Force and later in the Expeditionary Force into Igboland as cooks and as soldiers' comfort. Ever since then, the word akwüna, shortened from akwünaakwüna, has referred to a prostitute. The name akunakuna can be alternatively spelled as Agwa'agune, Akuraakura, or Akura:kura.  History  In 1846, the Umon attacked some Akunakuna canoes on the Cross River that were going to trade with the Efik, who had previously traded for European luxury goods. This was used by the Akunakuna as a Casus Belli to go to war with the Umon. Though the war lasted for years, the Akunakuna eventually lost. Under the negotiation of the Efik, the result was as follows, the Akunakuna had to pay an annual tribute to the king of Umon, in return for \\"keeping peace over the river\\". In 1888, a treaty was written with Akunakuna leaders giving the British full control to their land.

History  Originally the Manns were merchants, allegedly already in the 16th century in Nuremberg, documented since 1611 in Parchim, since 1713 in Rostock and since 1775 in Lübeck. There they became wealthy grain merchants, a Hanseatic family and as such members of the small ruling class of the Free City of Lübeck, a city republic and state of the German Empire. The symbol in the family's coat of arms is Mercury, the ancient god of commerce (as well as of eloquence). The family's most famous member is Nobel Prize for Literature laureate Thomas Mann, who portrayed his own family and social class in the novel Buddenbrooks. In 1877, Thomas Mann's father Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann was elected Senator of Lübeck (corresponding to presiding minister of a government office in other German states).Hans Wißkirchen: Die Familie Mann.

It was built by the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad in 1908 to house electrical equipment used by the electric railway. Power was generated at the Nine Mile Falls dam and transmitted to the Frequency Changing Station. The station provided direct current to the streetcar network within the city of Spokane. To provide power to the rail network outside Spokane, the station converted a portion of the power to alternating current and fed it to a series of electrical substations spaced about on the operating line. The substations then converted power back to direct current for the streetcars, but also sold power at 110 volts AC to the communities. The main station houses four motor-generator sets, four 1250 kilowatt transformers, three 375 kilowatt transformers, and three 75 kilowatt transformers. The east wing of the station contained a 550-volt, 275-cell storage battery. All of this electrical equipment was removed around 1939, when the owning railroad sold the property. The railroad connected the cities of Colfax, Washington and Moscow, Idaho to Spokane, and the electric railway figured heavily in the rapid development of the area where it passed.

He is known for his role on cable and satellite television truTV's reality series, Hardcore Pawn. Early life and career Lester \\"Les\\" Gold, is a third generation pawnbroker/salesman, the grandson of a Jewish pawnbroker who once owned company \\"Sam's Loans\\", a now-defunct pawnshop on Michigan Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Sam's Loans was where Gold made his first sale, at age 7. (The Sam's Loans building is in the process of being remodeled into a pawn shop-themed restaurant, to be called \\"Gold Cash Gold\\".Curbed: \\"Gold Cash Gold blows out facade, remod marches forward\\", April 17, 2014.)

In 1998, independent producer Richard Dominick saw Gold's TV ads which ran during the local commercial breaks of The Jerry Springer Show, which Dominick was working on at the time. He saw potential in Les and his business as a reality TV show and approached the Gold family with this idea. Les's son, Seth, was initially reluctant, but Les overruled him and agreed to let the cameras in. The pilot aired in late 2009. Dominick is now the series co-executive producer with Mike Gamson. Les and Seth Gold were also credited as executive producers, beginning with the third season.Per the credits on IMDB's entry for Hardcore Pawn.

She was launched in September 1938 by Harland and Wolff at Belfast in Northern Ireland. She was one of a class of 20 similar tankers built for Anglo-Saxon. In 1951 Dromus suffered an explosion and fire that killed 22 of her crew and five oil terminal staff, after which she was extensively repaired. In 1958 she rescued 24 members of the crew of a British tanker that had been sunk by the CIA. Shell retired Dromus from service in 1962 and she was scrapped that year. 1951 explosion in Singapore In August 1951 Dromus was in Singapore, and on 18 August she took on a new crew for a voyage to the Philippines. On the night of 19–20 August Dromus was loading at Wharf Number 6 of the oil terminal on the island of Pulau Bukom off Singapore. During the process of topping up one of her forward tanks there was an overflow of oil from her foredeck and at about 1250 hrs she suffered an explosion and fire that took hold from her forecastle as far aft as her central superstructure. Dromus crew and Pulau Bukom's fire-fighting squad fought the fire. Dromus Master, Henry Watkins had her stern mooring cables cut to help get her away from the wharf and for more than an hour, efforts were made to distance Dromus from the oil terminal to prevent the fire from spreading. Two Singapore Harbour Board fire-fighting tugs, and Tarik, came to assist, along with five water-boats belonging to Hammer and Company based on Pulau Bukom. The explosion woke hundreds of Shell employees living away. They came to the terminal to help fight the fire, while their wives went to Singapore General Hospital to help to receive the injured. There was a second explosion about 20 minutes after the first, probably caused by Dromus flexible hose parting company. Survivors leapt into the sea and swam to safety under petrol that had spilled onto the water around the ship. The fire worsened until about 0230 hrs. The disaster killed three European officers and 22 Chinese and Malayans, including the ship's carpenter who was rescued but died in Singapore General Hospital of his injuries. The hospital treated at least eight other injured, including two officers. Two crew initially listed as missing were later found safe: late on the afternoon of 20 August Dromus terrified bosun and quartermaster were found sheltering behind bushes on the far side of Pulau Bukom, from the disaster scene. Most of the dead were from Dromus crew, but five staff of the Pulau Bukom oil terminal were also among those killed. It took days to find the bodies of some of the missing, and 11 victims' bodies were so badly injured that they were never identified. For the first few days there was some confusion to the total number of dead and missing. Despite the explosion, Dromus still contained a cargo of 8,000 tons of benzene and 2,000 tons of fuel oil that survived the fire. After the fire was put out and the ship made safe, the cargo was discharged at Pulau Bukom. Aftermath In the days immediately after the disaster the Port of Singapore's Deputy Master Attendant (equivalent to a Deputy Port Master) held an initial enquiry that was completed on 29 August. In September 1951 the Governor of Singapore, Sir Franklin Gimson, ordered a Commission of Enquiry. The report of the Commission's findings was published in February 1952. Captain Watkins and his Chief engineer, Kenneth Armstrong, were found to have acted correctly and fire precautions taken during loading were found to have been adequate. The officer of the watch was found to have failed to keep a close enough eye on the topping up process, but he was among the dead and so could not be interviewed or called to account. The report speculated, though without any actual evidence, that a member of the crew could have caused the accident by emerging from the crew quarters while smoking. The three officers killed were the Chief Officer Edward Dyer, Second Officer Samuel Pilling and Third Officer Edwin Hearth. All three were buried at Bidadari Cemetery on 21 August.In December 2001 Edward Dyer's remains were exhumed, cremated and reburied on the Isle of Colonsay, Scotland: see Colonsay Graveyard . Ten of the Chinese victims were buried at the Chinese cemetery in Bukit Timah Road. In September 1951 Anglo-Saxon and Shell presented an organ to the Seafarers' Chapel in Singapore as a memorial to those killed on Dromus. The Bishop of Singapore, the Rt. Rev. Henry Baines, dedicated the organ and paid tribute to the services of the Merchant Navy and Royal Navy to Singapore's development and defence. In July 1952 five people were honoured for their bravery in response to the explosion and fire. Queen Elizabeth II made Dromus Master, Henry Watkins and Chief Engineer, Kenneth Armstrong MBEs. British Empire Medals were awarded to three Malay firemen of the Pulau Bukom fire-fighting squad: Sergeant Baharun bin Mat, Corporal Rahman bin Mohammed and Corporal Mohammed Din bin Abdullah. The fire gutted Dromus forecastle, forward tanks and bridge. On 14 September 1951 she was drydocked in Singapore to begin a refit estimated at S$2,000,000. Dromus was fully repaired and in due course returned to service. 1958 rescue in Borneo On 28 April 1958 at Balikpapan Harbour, in the East Kalimantan Province of Borneo, a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, flown by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, attacked the Shell oil terminal there. The Invader bombed and sank Eagle Oil and Shipping's and made an unsuccessful attack on Anglo-Saxon Petroleum's . Immediately after the attack Daronia left Balikpapan for the safety of Singapore, taking with her 26 of San Flavianos rescued crew. A few days later Dromus assisted by taking a further 24 of San Flavianos crew from Balikpapan to Singapore. Shell also evacuated shore-based wives and families to Singapore and suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan. Withdrawal and scrapping Dromus remained in Shell service until 1962, when she was scrapped at Yokosuka, Japan. Successor ship In 2004 Shell chartered the oil tanker Maersk Prime from the Danish shipping company Maersk and renamed her Dromus. Maersk Prime is a 110,000 ton oil tanker that was built in Dalian, China in 1999. In March 2010 her charter ended and she reverted to her original owners and name.

Recent studies have indicated there are roughly 200,000 Angas people. History According to local folklore, the Angas migrated from Bornu passing through villages before settling on the highlands of Plateau State. In the course of migration, the groups splintered into sub-groups settling in Ampang, Amper and Kabwir districts. The settlers at Kabwir were led by a chief called Gwallam and the chief of the Ampers was Kendim. Later settlements populated the highlands of the Jos Plateau. =Festival= The Angas celebrate a major festival called the Tsafi Tar or Mos Tar, during the celebration, a brief event called Shooting the Moon takes places to mark the end season and the beginning of a new season. The festival is usually celebrated during the time of harvest. =Settlement= The Angas who predominantly live on the lowlands and the Southeastern edge of the Jos Plateau are the largest group in the Jos highlands. The major city is Pankshin. The Gyangyan or Ampang district is dominated by hills and ridges, to the west of the ridges form the plains that constitute the lands of the Amper district. The soil of the plains of Amper are littered with granite and farmers in the district grow crops on terraced fields to plant cereal crops such as millet, guinea corn and maize. The people used the granite boulders as foundations and walls for their houses. References *Appiah, Kwame Anthony and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Africana, 1st edition. New York: Basic Civitas Books, .

He was a member of the Hanseatic Berenberg/Gossler family and the son of banker Johann Heinrich Gossler (1805–1879), grandson of banker and senator Johann Heinrich Gossler and great-grandson of banker Johann Hinrich Gossler. His uncle was First Mayor and President of the Senate (head of state) Hermann Gossler. His mother was Mary Elizabeth Bray (1810–1886), a granddaughter of Samuel Eliot and a member of the Eliot family from Boston. Known as \\"John Bi\\" (B pronounced in English) by his friends, he was a Schöngeist. He loved music and the theatre, and wanted to study languages, literature and history. But his father had destined him to become a banker. After apprenticeships in England, France, North and South America, he became an associé of his father's bank in 1864. After the death of his father in 1879, he became head of Berenberg Bank. In 1880, the Hamburg senate granted him the name of Berenberg-Gossler in recognition of the fact that he was the owner of the Berenberg Bank (the Berenberg family became extinct in the male line in 1773, but the Gosslers were descended from the family through the family's last member Elisabeth Berenberg married Gossler, who died in 1822). In 1888, Johann Berenberg-Gossler was ennobled in the Kingdom of Prussia (although he was a citizen of Hamburg and not of Prussia) and conferred the title of Baron in 1910. The ennoblement was controversial within his family and Hamburg high society, as nobility (which did not exist in Hamburg) was frowned upon by the staunchly republican Hamburg grand burghers. His sister Susanne, married Amsinck, exclaimed \\"Aber John, unser guter Name!\\"Renate Hauschild-Thiessen: \\"Adel und Bürgertum in Hamburg.\\" In: Hamburgisches Geschlechterbuch 14, 1997, p. 30. Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was less inclined to take risks than his father, and closed the bank's branches in New York City and Boston in 1880 and 1891 respectively. At the time of his death, he was the second richest person in Hamburg. He was the father of Senator and Ambassador John von Berenberg-Gossler (1866–1943) and banker Baron Cornelius von Berenberg-Gossler (1874–1953). His son John von Berenberg-Gossler became a politician despite his father's wish that he would succeed him as head of the bank, and therefore had to give up his shares in the company. He was succeeded as head of the bank and as Baron of Berenberg-Gossler (a title tied to the ownership of Gut Niendorf) by his younger son Cornelius von Berenberg-Gossler.

ProFTPD is Free and open- source software, compatible with Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows (via Cygwin). Along with vsftpd and Pure-FTPd, ProFTPD is among the most popular FTP servers in Unix-like environments today. Compared to those, which focus e.g. on simplicity, speed or security, ProFTPD's primary design goal is to be a highly feature rich FTP server, exposing a large amount of configuration options to the user.FTP Server Software for LinuxA glance at the common Linux ftp servers Supported platforms * AIX * BSD/OS * DG/UX * Digital Unix * FreeBSD * HP/UX * IRIX * Linux for IBM S/390, zSeries * Linux * Mac OS X * NetBSD * OpenBSD * SCO * Solaris * SunOS * Windows (via Cygwin) Configuration and features ProFTPD includes a number of options that are not available with many other FTP daemons. The configuration of ProFTPD is performed in a single main configuration file called \`/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf\`. Due to its similarities to the configuration file of Apache HTTP Server it is intuitively understandable to someone who uses this popular web server. Some of the most noticeable features are:http://proftpd.org/features.html Features * Per directory \\".ftpaccess\\" configuration similar to Apache's \\".htaccess\\" * Multiple virtual FTP servers and anonymous FTP services * Runs either as a stand-alone server or from inetd/xinetd, depending on system load * Anonymous FTP root directories do not require any specific directory structure, system binaries or other system files * No SITE EXEC command, which in modern Internet environments represent a security issue * Hidden directories and files, based on Unix-style permissions or user/group ownership * Runs as a configurable non-privileged user in stand-alone mode in order to decrease chances of attacks which might exploit its \\"root\\" abilities * Logging and utmp/wtmp support. * Shadow password suite support, including support for expired accounts * Modular design, allowing server to be extended easily with modules. Modules have been written for SQL databases, LDAP servers, SSL/TLS encryption, RADIUS support, etc. * IPv6 support Graphical user interface Screenshot of GAdmin-ProFTPD showing the user administration tab. ProFTPD comes with a command-line interface (CLI) only, but there are several third-party Graphical user interfaces (GUI) existing for ProFTP for users who prefer this to the CLI, or like to use a combination of both. Especially when it comes for example to real-time monitoring of current user actions and file transmissions, a GUI can be very helpful and superior to the CLI.
