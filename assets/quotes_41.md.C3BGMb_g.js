It has white flowers. Description Cistus inflatus is a slightly spreading shrub, up to tall. It leaves are green, oblong in shape, usually long by wide, with turned under (revolute) margins, variably hairy, with long simple and stellate hairs on both sides. The leaves are unstalked (sessile) and, at least near the base, have three veins. The flowers are arranged in cymes with one to five individual flowers, each across with five white petals with narrowed yellow bases, and five sepals. The style is very short. Taxonomy Cistus inflatus has somewhat confused nomenclatural history. In 1786, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck described this species under the name Cistus hirsutus, but it was an illegitimate name since he had earlier used it for a different species. In 1826, Robert Sweet published the name Cistus psilosepalus, which was then applied to this species by many authors. In 1997, Jean-Pierre Demoly identified Sweet's type as C. √ó laxus Aiton, a hybrid between this species and C. populifolius. As the name Cistus laxus was published by Aiton in 1789, it has priority over the name Cistus psilosepalus, which becomes a synonym. Demoly revived a name used (but not published) by Pierre Andr√© Pourret, namely C. inflatus. In summary, in Demoly's analysis: * Cistus psilosepalus Sweet is a synonym of Cistus √ó laxus Aiton * Cistus psilosepalus auct., non Sweet has incorrectly been used for what is now Cistus inflatus Pourr. ex J.-P.Demoly Sweet called his C. psilosepalus \\"the smooth sepaled rock-rose\\" (the meaning of the epithet), describing it as \\"differing from all others ... by its smooth glossy sepals\\", whereas later sources (including Flora Europaea) described C. psilosepalus as having hairy sepals. In C. √ó laxus the backs of the outer sepals are hairless (glabrous); in C. inflatus they are hairy. A 2011 molecular phylogenetic study placed C. inflatus in the white and whitish pink clade of Cistus species. No particularly close relationship to any other species in the clade was identified. Phylogeny Cistus inflatus belongs to the white and whitish pink flowered clade of Cistus species. Distribution Cistus inflatus (generally recorded as C. psilosepalus) is native to Portugal, western Spain, and two small regions of north-west France.

Mayank and Soni meet secretly, but someone sees them and tells Ma Thakurain (Bindiya). She plans to get Soni married within three days. When Mayank hears of this, he tries to commit suicide. When Ananya finds out the reason behind the suicide, she decides to let Soni and Mayank meet for one last time. But Mayank cheats Ananya and runs away with Soni. When the five brothers find out Ananya helped in Soni getting out, they kidnap her and torture to find out where Soni and Mayank went. When Ananya gets free, through the help of the police, the police arrest Ma Thakurain and the brothers decide to get revenge. Ma Thakurain gets out of jail and Soni and Mayank return to Badi Haveli.

It is sometimes treated as synonymous with Cistus symphytifolius or as its subspecies C. symphytifolius subsp. leucophyllus. Its name is sometimes spelt Cistus ochreatus. It is endemic to Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. Description Cistus ocreatus has ovate leaves with three main veins and a short stalk (petiole). The flowers are purple, with styles longer than the stamens. It resembles Cistus symphytifolius, but has smaller flowers, and its leaves have a whitish appearance due to a covering of fine hairs. Taxonomy and phylogeny The name Cistus ocreatus originates from Christen Smith, who collected plants in the Canary Islands. Smith died in 1816. In 1819 (i.e. after Smith's death), the name and description were published by Christian Leopold von Buch, attributed to \\"Dr Smith's notes\\". Smith differentiated C. ocreatus from Cistus symphytifolius (which he called C. vaginatus), noting that it had smaller flowers. The specific epithet ocreatus derives from the Latin noun ocrea, \\"greave\\", plus the ending -atus, \\"possessing or resembling\\". Although the noun may also be spelt ochrea, the spelling ocreatus was used by Buch in publishing Smith's notes. An alternative name for the taxon derives ultimately from √âdouard Spach, who in 1836 published a description of Rhodocistus berthelotianus, including variety leucophyllus. Rhodocistus berthelotianus was later synonymized with Cistus symphytifolius, and G√ºnther Kunkel transferred the variety as the subspecies C. symphytifolius subsp. leucophyllus. Smith's name Cistus ocreatus is considered to be a synonym of C. symphytifolius or its subspecies leucophyllus by some sources; others accept it as an independent species. A 2011 molecular phylogenetic study placed C. ocreatus as a member of the purple and pink flowered clade (PPC) of Cistus species, along with some other Canary Island endemics (Cistus asper, Cistus chinamadensis, Cistus horrens, and Cistus symphytifolius). Distribution and habitat Cistus ocreatus is endemic to Gran Canaria, where it is found in pine forests at altitudes of , in a climate described as \\"subhumid\\" and \\"temperate-warm\\".

Description Cistus osbeckiifolius is a shrub usually up to tall, although it may reach . Its three-nerved leaves are narrow, lanceolate to elliptical in shape, and slightly pointed at the apex. They are densely covered with simple hairs. The flowers are about across, with pink to purple petals. The stigma is longer than the stamens. The fruiting capsules are brown and covered with hairs. Taxonomy and phylogeny Cistus osbeckiifolius was formally named in 1887 (the epithet was originally spelt osbeckiaefolius). Philip Webb collected in the Canary Islands in 1828‚Äì1830. Although he gave this species a name and wrote a description, it was not published in his lifetime (he died in 1854). In 1887, Heinrich Christ published Webb's description, along with those of other plants in Webb's herbarium. The epithet osbeckiifolius means \\"with leaves like Osbeckia\\". A subspecies, C. osbeckiifolius subsp. tomentosus Ba√±ares & Demoly, has been recognized (hence creating the nominate subspecies, C. osbeckiifolius subsp. osbeckiifolius), although The Plant List does not accept this taxon. A 2011 molecular phylogenetic study placed C. osbeckiifolius as a member of the purple and pink flowered clade (PPC) of Cistus species, along with other Canary Island endemics. Distribution and habitat Cistus osbeckiifolius is endemic to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It is found at elevations of around Mount Teide, particularly in the region known as Las Ca√±adas. The climate is relatively dry and temperate to cold.

Dawkins, Jr., of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana declared that segregation at the bus terminal imposed an \\"undue burden\\" upon interstate commerce at odds with the Commerce Clause of Article 1, Section 8, of the United States Constitution. In November 1962, the court directed city officials, including Mayor Clyde Fant and Commissioner Downs, to halt the state segregation policy at the bus terminal and to pay costs related to the lawsuit. Flournoy and Goslin were removed as defendants in the case; the attorney for the city was a rising political figure, later U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. In another case involving Sheriff Goslin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans upheld a ruling from the U.S. District Court in Shreveport regarding the appointment of legal counsel for indigent defenders in misdemeanor cases. The issue centered on Willie Lee Thomas, who was prosecuted with four misdemeanors and two escapes in Caddo Parish in 1963 and 1964, when Flournoy was still sheriff. Goslin contended that the district court erred in mandating the appointment of counsel in a misdemeanor case. He argued that such a requirements imposes an \\"impossible burden\\" on the state administration of justice. Thomas pleaded guilty to a charge of escape and was given the maximum penalty of one year in jail, but he was not informed of his right to the assistance of counsel. Like the district court, the circuit court in 1968 sided with the prisoner and against the sheriff. When Flournoy died in December 1966, Goslin as the chief criminal deputy was appointed sheriff eight days later by Governor John McKeithen to finish the year and a half remaining in the term. For those eight days, he had shared the duties of sheriff with the Caddo Parish Coroner Stuart DeLee. A Democrat, Goslin was subsequently elected sheriff in 1967 and 1971 for two four-year terms of his own. Flournoy announced plans to retire two months before his death. He endorsed Goslin as his successor. In the general election held on February 6, 1968, in which Goslin ran unopposed, Republican State Representative Taylor W. O'Hearn of Shreveport, who was seeking, unsuccessfully as it developed, to a second term notified Goslin and Shreveport Public Service Commissioner George W. D'Artois that election laws had been violated at three predominantly African-American voting precincts in Shreveport ‚Äî that Democrats passed out campaign literature at the door of one polling place and were less than the required two hundred feet minimum from the two other precincts. O'Hearn said that Goslin and D'Artois both told him that the matter was out of their jurisdiction.Shreveport Journal, February 7, 1968, p. 1 Goslin worked in the department to implement a central purchasing system and to bring forth changes in insurance, the maintenance of criminal records, and bookkeeping procedures. A sheriff's substation was added in Vivian in northern Caddo Parish. Goslin established a toll-free incoming telephone line for use by the public. The department began its own training academy and opened an indoor shooting range. Goslin authorized classes on narcotics, water safety, self-defense for women, and student traffic and pedestrian programs. In 1971, Goslin established the since defunct Caddo Correctional Institute at Spring Ridge in south Caddo Parish. It replaced a former facility on West 70th Street, which had been utilized for more than sixty years. In 1974, under federal court order, Goslin seized equipment of the Charlotte Hornets, who were in Shreveport playing at Independence Stadium for the World Football League against the Shreveport Steamer, both teams soon disbanded. Goslin was complying with a suit seeking more than $26,000 in accumulated debts that had been filed against the Hornets by plaintiffs in New York City, where the team had been domiciled during the first half of 1974. However, Goslin allowed the team to play the game before the impounding of the equipment. Later years After he left office, Goslin became involved in the 1978 campaign to choose a successor to retiring U.S. Representative Joe Waggonner of Louisiana's 4th congressional district. He supported a fellow Democrat Loy F. Weaver, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administrator and a banker from Homer in Claiborne Parish. Victory, however, went in a disputed vote to Waggonner's preferred choice, Buddy Leach, a state representative from Vernon Parish,The Shreveport Journal, November 8, 1978, p. 4A who was subsequently unseated after one term in 1980 by Buddy Roemer. Goslin was formerly named \\"Lawman of the Year,\\" \\"Mr. Shreveport,\\"The Shreveport Times, May 29, 1973 and received the Liberty Bell Award, which recognizes an outstanding non-lawyer who has made a strong contribution to the community. He was honored in 1976 by the American Legion.The Shreveport Times, March 18, 1976 Goslin died of Alzheimer's disease and a lung infection. He was predeceased by his wife of fifty-three years, the former Nettye Lewis. The couple had one son. Goslin is interred at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport.

It was later released as a single in 1984 in the UK and South East Asia. The song's release in the UK as the fourth single from Richard's Silver album was belated after initially being consigned to the B-side of the album's third single \\"Baby You're Dynamite\\". Although pressure was mounted from fans and disc-jockeys, it was only after \\"Baby You're Dynamite\\" had finished its chart run that the record company finally flipped the single, promoting \\"Ocean Deep\\" to the A-side. As the A-side, \\"Ocean Deep\\" only reached number 72 in a further 3 week run on the UK Singles Chart. Despite having little chart success, the song quickly became a phenomenon among Richard's fans the world over, with fans voting the song as their favourite, 25 times out of 26 in the annual \\"Cliff Poll\\" of fans' favourite songs between 1984 (when it first appeared) and the final poll in 2009. The song broke through to the wider public in South East Asia, becoming very popular in the Philippines where it became one of the bigger hits of the 1980s, and in Hong Kong where it was also adapted into Cantonese for Frances Yip in 1985. The Cantonese version was then covered by Prudence Liew in 1989 for the lead single of her Jokingly Saying album. Background Richard discussed how he came to record the song with an interviewer from the Philippines, ‚ÄúOcean Deep was an unusual one because it came through the post from two writers who I didn‚Äôt know; they were amateurs. When something comes in like that, privately, usually they‚Äôre not very good. So I didn‚Äôt listen to it for about three months. And then when I came home from a tour, I saw this tape and I said, ‚ÄòOkay, I‚Äôll play it,‚Äô and I exclaimed, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs fantastic!‚Äô I love the song! I was so pleased that these two guys sent that to me. I'm very happy that \\"Ocean Deep\\" is very popular in Southeast Asia.‚Äù Single release \\"Ocean Deep\\" first appeared on a single as the B-side of the UK release of \\"Baby You're Dynamite\\" in March 1984 (the third single from Richard's album Silver). During the single's 6 week run on UK Singles Chart (peaking at no 27), both fans and several disc-jockeys (who played the B-side instead of the A-side) mounted enough pressure to eventually cause EMI Records to release \\"Ocean Deep\\" as the A-side. A new picture cover was created for the single, but the release simply reused the same catalogue number and relegated an extended mix of \\"Baby You're Dynamite\\" to the B-side. \\"Ocean Deep\\" entered the chart at number 72 in May, three weeks after \\"Baby You're Dynamite\\" had left the chart, but climbed no further in its three remaining weeks in the top 100. In the United States and Canada, it was released in early 1984 as the B-side of \\"Donna\\" (originally by Ritchie Valens) on EMI America. Both songs were taken from the 1983 album Give a Little Bit More (the US version of the Silver). Other albums The song has subsequently been included in many compilation albums, including: *1988: Private Collection: 1979‚Äì1988 *2007: Love... The Album.

It was either an accidental seedling from a wild variety of blackberry, or possibly a sort accidentally brought to this country by the French Huguenots who settled New Rochelle in 1688. The fruit-bearing bush is from the genus Rubus, in the rose family, and bears large berries that grow to about an inch long.The New Rochelle or Lawton Blackberry, The New York Times, 1857 The first plant was discovered in 1834 by Lewis Seacor, who noticed the plant growing wild in a field owned by neighbor Frederick Prime. Seacor was initially drawn to the fruit on account of its large size and rich flavor and, in 1838, he removed some of the plants to his garden and began their cultivation. Several years later he began distributing plants to neighbors and townspeople whose interest in the new fruit helped spread its notoriety. Throughout the region the blackberry became commonly known as\\"Seacor's Mammoth\\".Natural Resources of The United States, Jacob Harris Patton, pg.460 In 1848, George Seymour & Co., of Norwalk, Ct., nurserymen, obtained some plants and began working to increase their stock before advertising the new berry to the general public. At the same time, William Lawton, also of New Rochelle, obtained his first plants and spent the next several years working on their propagation. In 1853, Lawton showed the berries at a meeting of the \\"American Farmers' Club\\", stating that while he did not know who initially discovered the plant and brought it into garden culture, it was found on the roadside and thence introduced into neighboring gardens. The Farmers' Club passed a vote of thanks to Mr. Lawton, and named the fruit the \\"Lawton Blackberry\\". Individuals in New Rochelle, acquainted with the blackberry, knew of its discovery by Seacor and referred to the plant as \\"Seacor's\\" or \\"Seacor's Mammoth\\". It was also well known that Mr. Prince, owner of the farm where the fruit was found, actually destroyed many of the original bushes while making improvements to the property without knowing anything of their existence, and, was it not for Seacor's efforts, the fruit would have become extinct.

(15 March 1869 - Toulouse 9 September 1942) was a Basque Jesuit priest, linguistic and translator. He authored a complete translation of the Bible into the Basque language. Life Olabide was born in 1869 in Vitoria, √Ålava, Spain, to a couple who lived on the Plaza de la Virgen Blanca in the center of the city, where they ran a small business. Though both his parents were ethnically Basque, his mother had been born and raised in Madrid, and her native tongue was Castillian. As a result, he grow up speaking only that language. When he came of age, his parents sent him to the Jesuit college in Urdu√±a. In 1884, at the age of 15, Olabide entered the Society of Jesus which operated the school. He then pursued his philosophical and theological studies at the Jesuit communities of Veruela Abbey and Tortosa. In the course as his formation with the Society, he worked as a teacher in Valladolid, O√±a, Gijon and Salamanca. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1902. It was while studying at the University of Salamanca in 1911 that Olabide came across a grammar book of Basque written by Arturo Campi√≥n, a leading proponent of Basque nationalism. It was then finally that, at the age of 27, he began to learn his mother tongue, to the study and promotion of which he dedicated the rest of his life. The noted Basque lexographer who had published a classic dictionary of the language in 1904, Resurrecci√≥n Mar√≠a de Azkue, later commented that Olabide seemed to know his work better than he himself, the author, did.  Translator  In 1914 Olabide published his first translation into that language, that of the noted Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, in Basque Loyola'tar Eneko Deunaren Gogo-i√±arkunak. Three years later, he published a complete dictionary of human anatomy Giza-so√±a (The Human Body). His translations became noted for the purity of his language, as he refused to use loanwords from other languages. He was admitted to the Royal Academy of the Basque language in 1919 due to his contributions to the revival of the language. The following year, Olabide published his translation into the Basque of the medieval spiritual classic, Imitation of Christ by Thomas √† Kempis, with the title of Kisto'ren antz- bidea. His goal had become the publishing of translations across the entire range of the sciences, so as to advance the use of the language. Olabide, however, then made the decision to embark on a translation of the Bible. The New Testament took him ten years; it was published in 1931 in Bilbao. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in the course of the Spanish Civil War, he took shelter at the Franciscan Sanctuary of Arantzazu in O√±ati, where he devoted himself to the translation of the Old Testament. By chance, he was living in the city of Guernica on 26 April 1937 when the German Luftwaffe conducted its attack on the city. He was able to save his manuscripts from his residence before it was destroyed by fire and escaped to the nearby town of Kanala, where he was given refuge in the rectory of the town. He then left Spain and settled in Toulouse, France, where he died as the result of an accident on the streets of the city. The translation on which Olabide had been working at the town of his death was completed by a fellow Jesuit, Patxi Etxeberria, who was brought back from missionary service in Taiwan for this effort. It was published in 1958.

Early life and education William M. Plater was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, United States. Plater attended the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign from 1963 to 1973, earning a baccalaureate (1967), master's (1969), and PhD (1973), all in English literature. Plater met his future wife, Gail Maxwell, at the University of Illinois. They married in 1971 and had two children. They reside in Indianapolis, Indiana. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Plater worked for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences from 1967 until 1983. As research assistant and assistant to the dean, he wrote a monograph, Man and the Multitude (1967), for the College to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the university. He created an annual senior survey and conducted research on student satisfaction; he authored A Vocational Guide to the Liberal Arts and Sciences, published by the College in 1970 and widely disseminated to students for several years. As assistant to the dean and assistant dean, Plater joined art professor Billy Morrow Jackson in supporting the Special Education Opportunities Program by establishing a course designed for a large number of African American students recruited to the university following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The course enrolled several hundred students and Plater served as instructor. Offered from 1970‚Äì77, the course was based on an annual lecture series of prominent African American leaders. Plater also served on several campus committees considering a range of educational reforms and was one of the founders of Unit One established in 1973, serving as assistant director in 1971-72 and then acting director in 1972-73. One of the nation's first ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù colleges integrating learning with residential facilities, Unit One has remained in continuous operation for over 40 years, now serving over 600 students a year. The University of Illinois Archives maintains the ‚ÄúWilliam Plater Papers 1968-73‚Äù in its collection documenting the formation of Unit One and the lecture series. Plater served as assistant director (1974‚Äì1977) and associate director (1977‚Äì83) of the School of Humanities, where he played the lead administrative role in establishing the Cohn Scholars Program in 1978 and in 1981 the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory. During a period of significant decline in graduate enrollments in the humanities nationwide, Plater played a central role in working with department leaders and School officials to accommodate major changes in graduate programs and budgetary reductions. He left UIUC in 1983 for Indiana University. Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Plater was appointed Professor of English and Dean of the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI in 1983. He served as Dean of the Faculties at IUPUI from 1987 to 1988, when he also assumed the title and responsibilities of the Executive Vice Chancellor. IUPUI was established in 1969 as the merger of the IU Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, and Law with the extension campuses of Purdue University and Indiana University in Indianapolis. Plater served as the chief academic officer for over half of its existence by the time he left the position in 2006, after 19 years. During this period, Plater is credited with articulating a vision for the development of the campus, which enjoyed significant growth in enrollments, student retention, degree programs, externally funded research, and national recognition for innovations in undergraduate education, community engagement, internationalization, and applications of technology to learning. In his history of IUPUI, Ralph Gray wrote in 2003 that ‚ÄúThis truly remarkable, visionary, and comprehensive document, the IUPUI Development Plan, 1988-2000, set what may at the time have been seen as impossibly high standards and goals, but its theme and its promises have been followed and, for the most part, achieved.‚Äù Plater served under the leadership of Gerald L. Bepko, Chancellor from 1986 until 2003, when Bepko became Interim President of Indiana University and Plater was appointed Acting Chancellor. From 2006 to 2010, Plater was appointed Chancellor's Professor of Public Affairs, Philanthropy, and English and Director of the Workshop on International Community Development, a program sponsored by the IU Center on Philanthropy (now the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy) and the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs. The Workshop was designed to coordinate IUPUI international activities with those of the greater Indianapolis community and to apply university knowledge, expertise, and experience to the growing internationalization of the region's economic, social, cultural, and educational development. Plater's principal achievements at IUPUI include: creation of a major collaboration with Ivy Tech Community College under the Passport Program that contributed to the College's establishment as an accredited statewide community college, creation of University College, formation of Integrated Technologies (that combined academic and administrative computing with telecommunications, as the predecessor to the university-wide University Information Technology Services, development of the IUPUI University Library, and creation of the Office of Professional Development, the Center for Service and Learning, the Office of International Affairs, Center on Philanthropy, Senior Academy, Community Learning Network, Solution Center, and Public Health (Fairbanks School of Public Health). In support of the development of IUPUI, Plater was the co- director (with Deborah Freund) of a Lilly Endowment $8 million grant for ‚ÄúImproved Graduation from Public Universities‚Äù (1997‚Äì2002) and a $3.2 million grant from the Pew Charitable Trust (with Margaret Miller and Barbara Cambridge) for ‚ÄúQuality Assurance at Urban Public Universities‚Äù (1998‚Äì2001). Committed to serving adult learners, Plater was a strong advocate of programming to accommodate working and returning students. He was a member of the board of directors of the Council on Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL), from 1995 to 2009, serving as chair in 2005-2007. Plater's role in developing IUPUI was recognized by Governor of Indiana Mitch Daniels with the state's highest award, the Sagamore of the Wabash in 2006, by IUPUI in establishing the annual Plater Institute on the Future of Learning, and by Indiana University awarding him the Thomas Hart Benton Medal in 1988. Community engagement At its establishment in 1969, IUPUI was a loose federation of schools, some of sponsored by Purdue (science, technology, and engineering) and the rest by IU; some were mature and large (such as medicine or dentistry); some had very recently been private schools (law, physical education, and art); some were jointly administered with counterparts on the IU Bloomington campus (business, public affairs, and education); five were system-wide schools, with programs on each of IU's eight campuses, and several were located in different sites scattered around the city and even as far away as Columbus, Indiana, a city nearly 50 miles away. A sense of identity and common purpose were major issues for the new campus. Plater played the central role in identifying community engagement based on community-based learning (as inherent in professional fields such as medicine, education, or social work) as the unifying concept that quickly became a differentiating characteristic of the campus. With the creation of the Center for Service and Learning in 1993, IUPUI emerged as a national leader in community engagement, winning the inaugural President's Award for exceptional community service in 2006 awarded by the Corporation for National and Community Service. Plater oversaw the development of a special partnership with an adjacent neighborhood, receiving a grant of $800,000 from Housing and Urban Development for a Community Outreach Partnership Center, which in turn won several national awards for its engagement activities. The campus has also won numerous additional awards, including the Carnegie Foundation's community engagement classification in 2006 and again in 2015. In recognition of Plater's leadership, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities in 2006 established the William M. Plater Award for Leadership in Civic Engagement, the only national award for chief academic officers. IUPUI established the William M. Plater Civic Engagement Medallion, also in 2006, to recognize outstanding graduates at baccalaureate through PhD levels for their community service. Plater was one of the inaugural members of the national advisory panel for the Carnegie Classification for Community Engagement. Plater was recognized with the ‚ÄúSpirit of Philanthropy‚Äù Award for community engagement work in 2009 and by Mayor of Indianapolis Bart Peterson with the Mayor's Community Service Award in 2006. In Indiana, he served his community through memberships on several boards, including the internationally renowned Children's Museum, the Indiana Humanities Council, The Indiana Repertory Theater, Metropolitan Indianapolis Public Broadcasting, and the American Red Cross of Greater Indianapolis. Educational technology Anticipating the convergence of information and computing technologies (academic and administrative), Plater led in the reorganization of these service units into an integrated technologies unit at IUPUI and championed the development of a library information system that propelled the IUPUI University Library into an international leadership role in digital information resources. Plater authorized the creation of the IUPUI Cyber Lab, which in turn produced several major learning technologies, including OnCourse (1996) that became the foundation for Sakai, ANGEL Learning (2000) that was acquired by Blackboard in 2009, Epsilen (2010) that was acquired by The New York Times and sold to ConnectEDU in 2012, and Course Networking (2012). Plater served as Senior Consultant for Higher Education Strategies at Epsilen and on the NYT Epsilen board (2010‚Äì2011), Senior Advisor for Education Strategies at Course Networking (2011‚Äì2012), and the Course Networking advisory board (2014 -). Plater provided administrative leadership for the creation of the New Media Program that was incorporated into the IU School of Informatics in 2006 as a foundational program. Plater arranged for the creation of the Global Classroom at IUPUI to facilitate transnational learning opportunities using evolving forms of communication technologies. Plater has written extensively on the impact of technology on student learning. In 2010, Purdue University awarded Plater an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters for his role in promoting the effective use of technology in learning. International higher education Over a period of 20 years, Plater led the establishment and expansion of the Office of International Affairs at IUPUI into one of the nation's exemplars of internationalization among urban serving universities, a role recognized with the Institute of International Education Andrew Heiskell Award for Innovation in International Education in 2009 for its strategic partnerships. Plater's role was recognized in 2006 with the establishment of the Plater International Scholars Program. Plater led the Center on Philanthropy international programs from 2006 to 2010, developing extensive relationships with foundations, academic centers, and nonprofit programs in several nations including China, Egypt, Thailand, and Kenya.

It is a true bug and sucks sap from plants. Description The adults of Eriosoma lanigerum are small to medium-sized aphids, up to 2mm long, and have an elliptical shape, are reddish brown to purple in colour but the colour is normally hidden by the white cotton-like secretion from the specialised glands in the aphid's abdomen which gives it the common name of woolly apple aphid. The wax is produced after each moult so newly moulted individuals lack the wax coating, the main purpose of which is thought to be to prevent the honeydew secreted by the aphids to contaminate them but it may also produce a shelter from the weather and from parasites and predators. It has sooty-brown antennae has six segments and the colour of the tibias varies from dark brown to yellowish. When the adults are crushed they leave a blood red stain. The presence of this wooly substance distinguishes E. lanigerum from any other aphid occurring on apple trees. In many populations reproduction is wholly asexual and nymphs are produced by parthenogenesis. The nymphs are salmon pink in colour with dark eyes and circular cornicles which are slightly raised from the surface of the abdomen. The nymphs go through four instar moults before becoming an imago. The earliest stages are known as crawlers and they do not produce the waxy filaments until they settle to feed. The hibernating nymphs are very dark green, almost black, although they may be paler and can be dingy yellowish-brown and lack the secreted white waxy covering. Distribution E. lanigerum is native to North America but it is now found in all of the regions of the world where apples are grown. It was first recorded from Great Britain in 1787. Life Cycle In cooler areas E. lanigerum spends the winter months as a nymph on the roots of its host plant or in the more sheltered above ground portions of the host such as under bark on the trunk or main branches. Where sexual reproduction occurs they will also overwinter as eggs and this occurs when elms are prevalent with the eggs being laid into crevices in the bark. The eggs hatch out into wingless \\"stem mothers\\" who begin to give birth to nymphs by parthenogenesis. Nymph colonies wintering above ground may be wiped out by severe winter weather. In the Spring, April in Great Britain, the colonies begin to produce young which infest the host tree and if there are no above ground colonies they move up the tree until almost the whole tree is covered in aphid colonies, which prefer to be sited at the axils of leaves on terminal shoots. Where the population levels are high almost every leaf on the tree will have a colony at its base. The third generation of young produced grow into winged adult females which are capable of sexual reproduction. each female producing a single egg, but these can only develop on the American elm Ulmus americana. The males are wingless. Each aphid may give birth to up to five live young a day allowing the rapid growth of colonies, with a total of over 100 nymphs in its life. The aphids feed on sap by piercing the outer integument of the host where it is thinnest and excrete a substance known as honeydew which contains a high proportion of sugars. There can be between eight and twelve generations in a year, depending on the summer temperatures. In its native range in north eastern North America the winged adults, or alates migrate at the end of the summer to overwinter on elms but in regions where there are no elms the fate of these alates is not known and all observed reproduction is by parthenogenesis. Elm is the primary host species and it appears that egg production on other species, such as apple trees, is rare and that eggs laid on apple always fail to hatch. Impact on apple trees Where colonies of E. lanigerum feed on twigs and roots the tree forms galls, which are small initially but increase in size over time and are most damaging when they are formed among the roots. Continued feeding in the roots can destroy the roots and consequently reduce the growth of the tree or kill it. The aphids are attracted to the sunken sites caused by the perennial canker fungus Cryptosporiopsis perennans and the galls are then the most frequent places on the tree for the fungus to re-infect it. The galls can also allow infection by Gloeosporium sp. The galls are more sensitive to cold weather than the surrounding tissue and burst at -18 ¬∞C(0 ¬∞F), the resulting damage providing the fungus with an entry site for reinfection. As the aphids feed they produce a honeydew which drips onto the fruit allowing the growth of sooty mould which has an impact on the saleability of the fruit. The honeydew can also create unpleasant conditions for orchard workers to work in due to high levels of sticky honeydew excreted. The honeydew can also cover the leaves allowing the mould to grow there too. The aphids can also infest the apples, especially on varieties with an open calyx when the aphis can feed on the apple core. Infestation of E. lanigerum on apple in California Control Eriosoma lanigerum infestations have increased in the North-western United States as apple growers have reduced the use of organophosphate pesticides, it is thought that the use of these chemicals to control the codling moth in orchards also repressed the infestation by the aphids. The chalcid wasp Aphelinus mali is used as a biological control and this wasp has been deliberately or accidentally introduced into most regions where the woolly apple aphid occurs. When they have been parasitised by the wasps the aphids cease wax production and turn black in colour. Sometimes it is possible to see a circular hole on the upper surface of the aphid which the adult wasp created when it emerged from the body of its host. Rootstocks have been developed which convey resistance to the aphids to the roots but they do not appear to be effective against aerial infestation. Growers have also tried to prevent infestation by preventing the crawler stage of the nymph from climbing into the crown but these have proven ineffective as aphids can colonise the crown from neighbouring trees. As well as the parasitoid, Alphelinus mali, these aphids are preyed on by the bug Anthocoris nemoralis, ladybirds, hoverfly larvae and lacewings. The presence of earwigs Forficula auricularia on the trees can reduce the levels of aphid infestation, so encouraging these insects by providing shelters may be another means of biological control. Exclsuion experiments in Poland showed that the earwigs, and to a lesser extent the seven-spot ladybird Coccinella septempunctata were important in controlling the numbers of aphids later in the season while in the early Spring the pine ladybird Exochomus quadripustulatus was the main predator on the aphids. The hoverflies, Heringia calcarata and Eupeodes americana, have also been used as effective biological control organisms. Areopraon lepelleyi is another species of wasp which is a parasitoid of the woolly apple aphid. In addition, entomopathogenic nematodes have been used to control root-dwelling populations of E. lanigerum. Host plants The host plants include apple, pear, Prunus spp, crab apple, Pyracantha, Cotoneaster, elm, hawthorn and mountain ash. It has also been known to attack Japanese quince Chaenomeles sp.. Taxonomic issues There is some debate about the host plant of E. lanigerum as the wooly aphids collected from Ulmus americana are now considered to be a separate species, Eriosoma herioti which migrates from Ulmus americana onto similar species of plant which E. lanigerum has been recorded on. Other specimens collected from elms and described as E. lingerum may have been misidentifications of the related Eriosoma crataegi or Eriosoma americanum, which some authority place in the Eriosoma lanigerum group.

It was invented by former truck driver Zeblon Gwala, who has claimed that he got the idea for it in a dream. Gwala advises his patients to take ubhejane instead of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), saying that while both ubhejane and ARVs work, ubhejane, unlike ARVs, does not have side effects. The price at which ubhejane was sold has been reported variously at $25 and $50 US dollars. Ingredients Ubhejane consists of two herbal remedies: one is sold in a bottle with a blue cap, the other in a bottle with a white one. Both are black and liquid in appearance. The blue one, according to Gwala, fights the virus that causes AIDS, and the other is said to boost the immune system. Ubhejane has 89 herbal ingredients, which Gwala says he collects from all over Africa and mixes together by hand. Gwala was criticized by AIDS expert Dennis Sifris for refusing to reveal the ingredients of ubhejane. Research In 2005, Gwala approached the dean of University of KwaZulu-Natal's medical school to ask them to conduct a clinical trial of ubhejane, but he said it was too soon for this, and suggested performing lab tests instead. The results of these tests showed that ubhejane was not toxic to cells, and that it kills bacteria. One of ubhejane's most outspoken promoters, Herbert Vilakazi, claimed that this research had shown that the remedy was effective, but the university subsequently released a statement saying that this was not the case. Reaction =Support= Among the notable supporters of ubhejane was Obed Mlaba, who was the mayor of Durban during the 2000s, as well as former South African health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. Gwala has responded to criticisms by saying that he has not claimed that ubhejane is a cure for HIV/AIDS, and that he has not told any of his patients to stop taking ARVs. =Opposition= In 2007, the Democratic Alliance Party of South Africa requested a police investigation of Gwala, whom it described as a \\"backyard chemist\\" manufacturing a \\"fake AIDS cure.\\" Ubhejane has also been implicated in causing liver failure, as well as causing the development of drug resistance, in some patients who took it.

While she‚Äôs away, Marta is killed by Liza‚Äôs only friend, Tomy Tani, the ghost of a Japanese pop singer from the 1950s, resulting in Liza inheriting her apartment. Relatives report Liza to the police for murdering Marta.

CRIAW is the only Canadian research institute focusing on feminist issues and making research accessible to all groups and individuals. Since its inception forty years ago, CRIAW has ensured that the realities faced by all women are acknowledged and respected, and in turn, the experiences of these women have been used in order to bring about social change and equality for all women.  History of CRIAW  1975, known as International Women's Year, brought attention to the fact that there was little research available on women, and that the research which did exist was sexist. March of that year, in Ottawa, Ontario, 16 community members, from diverse backgrounds and occupations, formed a small organization as a platform to meet regularly and discuss this problem. It was through these conferences that the necessity of a women's research institute was realized. In April 1976, representatives from various Canadian organizations were invited to a two-day conference in Ottawa. After careful planning and deliberation, the election of board members, and the adoption of a constitution, the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women was founded.Bonnett, Laura. Building Bridges and Expanding Expectations: The Work of the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, 1976-1996. Carleton University, n.d. Web. 25 Feb. 2015. = CRIAW's objectives = Following its formation, CRIAW set out a list of goals and objectives: *Promoting the advancement of women through feminist and women-centered research *Encouraging and facilitating communication and information exchange among female academics, women's groups, workers, and activists *Disseminating research results through publications *Sponsoring and assisting research of interest to women and by women in CanadaA Short History of CRIAW. Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women, n.d. Web. 25 Feb. 2015. During CRIAW's first annual conference in Winnipeg, Manitoba, an appeal for funding was sent to the Minister responsible for the Status of Women. This funding was to ensure that the organization could keep its commitment to embracing the diverse community of Canada by providing service in both official languages. This funding was ultimately granted, and since then, CRIAW has remained active in serving the community in both English and French. However, from 2006 to 2017, funding from Status of Women Canada, CRIAW's main funding source, was cut completely. = Early years and initiatives = Shortly after being founded, one of CRIAW's first initiatives was to gather adequate funding to conduct its research. This funding came in the form of small membership fees, donations, and provisions by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada and the Social Science Federation of Canada. Then, in 1979, CRIAW received enough operational funding to carry out its work. 1980 and 1981 brought about even more change for CRIAW, when funding tripled by the Women's Program, Secretary of State, leading CRIAW to invest in adequate office space, a larger staff, and more services for members. CRIAW continues to recognize outstanding contributions to feminist research annually, along with feminist writers and researchers. The CRIAW Papers, one of CRIAW's notable early works, was a series of publications exploring feminist theory, analysis, policy, and the history of the women's movement. Specific topics of discussion include, Canadian feminist-pacifists and the Great War, Canada's early women writers, sexism in research and its policy implications, and the experience of shared custody in Canada. Feminist Perspectives, another of CRIAW's notable works, was a series of essays covering topics such as child care, Meech Lake Accord, and pornography. Both of these publications are still used by professors and students, activists, and researchers. Aside from these publications, CRIAW also began producing newsletters four times a year in 1981, and published its first Proceedings in 1982. Before this, papers from CRIAW's conferences were published in Atlantis and Resources for Feminist Research. Along with written publications, CRIAW sponsors annual conferences featuring prominent members of the community where research and artwork are presented, and workshops are conducted. Some cities where these conferences have been held include Vancouver, British Columbia; Yellowknife, Northwest Territories; and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The themes of these conferences differ each year, but all of these conferences have increased the visibility of women in research, and helped researchers and interest groups work towards improving the status of women. During its first decade, CRIAW initiated the Bank of Researchers, a database of feminist researchers, and the Title Word Index, a reference tool for finding recent, relevant articles. Both of these projects have enabled researchers to easily access information and find the necessary references to conduct their own work. CRIAW has always been actively seized in working with other women's organizations to achieve gender equality. For example, in 1977, the President of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, Kay McPherson, collaborated with CRIAW, hoping that a conjunction of research and action would help improve the position of women in Canada. CRIAW has used its findings to critique various policies and decisions made in Canada, such as those of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the Macdonald Commission, and the Federal Task Force on Child Care. = Expansion and other projects = After expanding its network across Canada, several independent projects were undertaken to spread CRIAW's message on an international scope. In 1985 and 1986, CRIAW presidents Marie Lavigne and Linda Christiansen-Ruffman served as the organization's representatives in Nairobi, Kenya. Furthermore, member Marilyn Assheton-Smith was invited by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to meet in Paris, France, to discuss a network of feminist research institutes. CRIAW further went on to carry out a pilot project for UNESCO on \\"Women's Involvement in Political Life\\". Following CRIAW's involvement with UNESCO, the organization took on an activist role in research, and began dealing with issues affecting women in northern Canada, such as in Yellowknife and other parts of the Northwest Territories. These initiatives by CRIAW aligned with their non-discriminative mission of serving and assisting women of all cultures and backgrounds and was the foundation to the later development of Intersectional Feminist Frameworks (IFF). Some research topics included women and violence, development, disability, and ethno-cultural communities.  Current work  CRIAW is currently in the process of undertaking new and innovative projects. One important recent project is Intersectional Feminist Frameworks (IFF). Intersectionality refers to the interconnected nature of various types of oppression, and how diverse women may face multiple forms of discrimination. In feminist theory, this has led to consideration of various aspects of identity (age, race, sex, social class, sexual orientation or gender identity, religion, physical or mental ability) by activists and researchers, when studying the different types of discrimination. This has also insisted on further investigation of the larger forces and structures (colonialization, capitalism, immigration system, legal system, education system etc.) in exploring these aspects of identity and experiences. Intersectionality involves the analysis of discrimination in its many forms, and how these many forms intersect with each other and engage with discussions surrounding experiences of discrimination and inequality. An intersectional research approach has specified the importance of recognizing women's experiences with discrimination as being diverse, rather than homogeneous. Two publications by CRIAW, Intersectional Feminist Frameworks - A Primer, and Intersectional Feminist Frameworks - An Emerging Version effectively explain intersectionality and its impact on the feminist movement. The twenty-five publications currently available on CRIAW's website deal with various topics in intersectional feminist research. Another project undertaken by CRIAW was FemNorthNet, a five-year long initiative which focused on how economic development in northern Canada affects communities culturally, economically, and socially, particularly for women. FemNorthNet releases several newsletters throughout the year, along with articles, fact sheets, and other publications which draw upon the experiences faced by northern women during this period of immense innovation and development. Changing Public Services was a project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). This research project was conducted to ensure that diverse women can inform and influence the government at federal, provincial, and municipal levels about their needs and access to public services. The goals of this project involve exploring what is changing in public services, how these changes and how public services are impacting diverse women, and what actions can be made in response to these changes. Research was conducted in four regional clusters, Ottawa, Halifax, Saskatoon, and Vancouver, and was scheduled to take place over three years. CRIAW's mandate is to make resources accessible for diverse women and provides several research articles for free access on their website. Some of this research focuses on subjects such as, women with disabilities, Aboriginal women, and women's health. As well, CRIAW releases a newsletter several times during the year, with reports, articles on global women's issues, and on upcoming projects for the organization. CRIAW's work involves engaging women of all age groups, backgrounds, and demographics, to provide comprehension and awareness of the experiences of all types of women. This engagement is formulated through research, writing, artwork, and discussion.

Written while her husband was terminally ill, and partly for his benefit, the novel offers a satirical version of the 1972 Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum, and pokes fun at museum politics, academic scholars, and Cold War spying.  Plot  In London in January 1973 the Museum (never named in the novel) is exhibiting for the first time anywhere the golden Garamantian treasures, on loan from the Garamantian government, that had been discovered years earlier by the eminent archaeologist Sir William Simpkin. Sir William, wealthy and now elderly, is retained by the Museum as a figurehead, largely because the Museum‚Äôs director, Sir John Allison, expects to receive a large bequest on the old man's death. Huge crowds queue for hours for a brief glimpse under poor lighting of the two most famous exhibits: the Golden Child and the Ball of Golden Twine. Rumours circulate that the Child is cursed. Sir William shows little interest in the exhibition, but he does ask to take a closer look at one of the many clay tablets that accompany the treasures. Late at night, while returning the tablet to its case at Sir William‚Äôs request, a junior exhibition officer, Waring Smith, is attacked and partly strangled, apparently with the Golden Twine. The German Garamantologist Professor Untermensch tells the Director that all the artefacts in the exhibition are fakes. Sir John decides that a second opinion is needed (this has to be obtained covertly because of the political sensitivities of the government loan), and he dispatches Smith to Moscow, along with one of the lesser treasures, to get the opinion of the Russian Garamantologist Professor Semyonov. The Director expects that no one will be suspicious of Smith because of his lowly position. Untermensch, however, thinks that the Soviets will assume he is a spy, and he shadows him. The Soviets do indeed make that assumption and, to show that they know the game they think the British are playing, they allow Smith and Untermensch into the Kremlin to view the real Garamantian treasures. Smith discovers that there is no such person as Semyonov. Smith returns, demoralised, and is temporarily detained on his arrival by a man from the Ministry of Defence who wants to know what his business was in Russia. Trying to explain himself, he invokes Sir William, whom he expects will clarify the reasons for his activities, only to learn that Sir William has been found dead, trapped between two sliding steel shelf units in the Museum library. A warder, Jones, is also later found dead: he has fallen from a fifth-floor window. Len Coker, a Museum technician, reveals that the tablet Smith took back to its case was a fake that he had made himself on Sir William‚Äôs instructions. Untermensch decodes the Garamantian characters on the tablet to reveal Sir William‚Äôs message: that he revokes his bequest to Sir John Allison. Accused of murder, Sir John pulls a gun and flees. Cornered, he shoots himself and crashes down on the exhibits, revealing them for the fakes they are. The staff patch up the exhibits so that they look convincing in the dim light, just in time for the evening opening.  Principal characters  * Sir William Simpkin: elderly archaeologist, discoverer of the Golden Child * Sir John Allison: Museum Director * Marcus Hawthorne-Mannering: Keeper of Funerary Art * Waring Smith: Junior Exhibition Officer * Professor Heinrich Untermensch: German Garamantologist * Dr Tite-Live Rochegrosse-Bergson (Schwarz): French cultural anthropologist * Professor Cyril Ivanovitch Semyonov: Supposed Russian Garamantologist * Jones Jones: Warder, unofficial retainer to Sir William * Len Coker: Technician, Conservation and Technical Services Department. * Dousha Vartarian: Secretary to Sir William Simpkin * Miss Rank: Secretary to Sir John Allison.  Background  Fitzgerald wrote the novel to amuse her husband, who was terminally ill with bowel cancer. She also wanted to deal with the annoyance she had felt when visiting The Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum in 1972 (having speculated that everything in it was a forgery), and also to write about someone who had been unpleasant to her when she was visiting museums to research her book on Burne- Jones. Fitzgerald‚Äôs original manuscript for the novel, to be called The Golden Opinion, was much longer than the published version. It included chapters on the continuing cover-up of the fraud, as well as scenes in which the Cabinet Secretary discusses the possibility of public disorder sparked by the fake exhibition. The publisher told her that they needed to be cut, along with the entirety of a subplot and several additional characters. Fitzgerald's publisher suggested that she should write more novels featuring Professor Untermensch as a recurring detective. She did indeed start work on two Untermensch thrillers, but in the end she thought it best not to be typecast. Critical reception H. R. F. Keating, reviewing the book as a crime novel for The Times, referred to the novel‚Äôs good joking, if occasionally in-joking; muted social criticism; and good writing, if somewhat self-consciously so. Writing in the Library Journal, Henri C. Veit called the novel \\"A muddle of violence and intrigue that I wouldn't have missed for the world\\". In a 2014 introduction to the Fourth Estate paperback reissue Charles Saumarez Smith called the book \\"taut, finely plotted [and] richly comic, with some of the elements of exaggerated satire characteristic of a campus novel\\".

She is the State Minister of Finance for Investment and Privatization in the Ugandan Cabinet since 6 June 2016. Previously, she served as State Minister for Youth. She was appointed to that position on 1 March 2015, replacing Ronald Kibuule, who was appointed State Minister for Water Resources. She also serves as the elected Member of Parliament for Koboko Municipality, in the West Nile sub-region, in the Northern Region of Uganda, a position she has occupied since 2011. Background and education Anite was born on 11 November 1984, in Adakado Village, Koboko District, to Steven Dravu, a civil servant, and Sarah Wokoru Dravu, a businesswoman. She belongs to the Lugbara-speaking Ugandans whose native area spills into the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. She is fluent in both Lugbara and Kakwa languages. She attended Arua Hill Primary School for her elementary school education. She studied at Saint Mary's Ediofe Secondary School for her O-Level studies. She transferred to Muni Girls' Secondary School, for her A-Level education. She holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication, awarded by Uganda Christian University in 2008. In January 2018, Evelyn Anite was admitted to the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts, in the United States, to pursue the Master in International Relations and Diplomacy Programme. In July 2019, Anite graduated from Tufts University, having met all the requirements for the Master of Arts program. Career Right out of high school in 2005, Anite started working as a radio presenter at a radio station in Arua, continuing in that capacity intermittently until 2007. Beginning in 2006 and continuing until 2010, she worked as a radio presenter at Uganda Broadcasting Corporation in Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. From 2008 until 2010, she worked at the Uganda Media Centre as the Public Affairs Assistant for International Relations. In 2011, she contested for the parliamentary seat of Youth Representative for Northern Uganda. She beat nine other candidates to win the seat. She is the current incumbent. On 6 June 2016, she was named State Minister for Investment and Privatization. Controversies In 2014, Evelyn Anite was involved in an argument with Margaret Baba Diri with the latter claiming that Evelyn Anite was vying for her political seat in Koboko for the 2016 general elections. In this dispute, Margaret Baba Diri claimed that Evelyn Anite was a \\"foreigner sowing confusion in Koboko and NRM\\". In response, Evelyn Anite claimed that she was only campaigning in Koboko to \\"relieve\\" her \\"mother\\" Baba Diri of the burden of \\"hectic politics\\". In February 2014, during the NRM Parliamentary Caucus, ahead of the 2016 presidential elections, Evelyn Anite moved a resolution to declare President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni the official party flag bearer. The resolution that came to be known as the Kyankwanzi Resolution, was met with resistance. In response to her support for the removal of the age limit bill, Evelyn Anite claimed that she had received multiple death threats. This prompted the government to give her a security detail. She also described fellow legislators who were opposed to the bill as \\"selfish hooligans\\". Speaking in support of the removal of the age limit bill, Evelyn Anite that the ruling party had \\"the numbers and the national army on their side\\". The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) has since distanced itself from this utterance. In a letter to President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni in July 2018, Hamilton Telecom accused Evelyn Anite of discrediting the telecommunications firm from bidding for the purchase of Uganda Telecom (UTL). In July 2018, it was alleged that Evelyn Anite had fled the country, on account of being under investigation following reports that allegedly solicited a $8 million (Shs 28.8billion) bribe from a group of Arab investors. She in turn sued a local newspaper for publishing the story about her. Following her admission to Tufts University, a section of Ugandans living in the United States started a petition and carried out a demonstration demanding that her admission to the university be cancelled. They alleged that the United States should not provide refuge for corrupt officials under the guise of further studies. Tufts University rejected the request stating that she had done nothing wrong to warrant her expulsion. They further added that as a student at the school of law, her privacy was protected.  Personal life  Evelyn Anite is married to Allan Kajik, a former deputy Resident District Commissioner of Kampala. They got married in 2011 and had 2 children as of 2018.

It relates the fictionalised experiences of a group of BBC employees at Broadcasting House, London, in 1940 when the city was under nightly attack from the Luftwaffe's high explosive, incendiary, and parachute bombs. Plot Seymour ‚ÄòSam‚Äô Brooks is the BBC's Recorded Programme Director (RPD), a technically brilliant though needy man. Self-centred, obsessed with his work, and oblivious to much of what goes on around him, he deals with his colleagues‚Äô lack of understanding and sympathy by surrounding himself with young female Recorded Programme Assistants (RPAs) whom he uses for sharing his complaints and worries. He faces constant fights to maintain his department‚Äôs status within Broadcasting House. His manager, the Director of Programme Planning (DPP) Jeff Haggard, helps to protect Sam from the day-to-day annoyances of working for the Corporation. After one of Sam's new RPAs, Lise Bernard, leaves unexpectedly very soon after being appointed in order to seek her French soldier boyfriend, Jeff and senior management decide that Sam should no longer be permitted to recruit. Without Sam's input they select as his new RPA Annie Asra, the 17-year-old orphaned daughter of a piano tuner from Birmingham. She astonishes Sam the first time they meet when she steadfastly maintains that the singer on one of Sam's cherished recordings is slightly flat. To celebrate the successful completion of his design for a new microphone windshield, Sam takes his RPAs out to dinner at an expensive French restaurant. Annie realises that she has fallen in love with him. Lise, who has not been seen for months, unexpectedly contacts one of her ex-colleagues and persuades her to provide a ticket allowing her to sleep for a few nights in the BBC's bunk room, intended for employees who are not able to get home after their shift. It transpires that Lise is pregnant, and on arriving at the bunk room she goes into labour. Jeff arranges for Lise to be transferred to a nearby hospital. Bombs rain down on broadcasting house, and Annie rushes to Sam's office. She acknowledges her love for him, and the two leave the building together to talk at a local cafe. Sam telephones Jeff to ask him to come over immediately, to discuss his intended resignation. Unknown to Sam, Jeff has also decided to resign from the BBC. He hesitates, and then tells Sam that he cannot come. Leaving Broadcasting House in the dark, Jeff mistakes an unexploded parachute bomb resting against the kerb for his taxi. It explodes, and he is killed.

Background Fitzgerald worked for the wartime Ministry of Food from June to November 1940, after which she worked as a features producer for the BBC. Critical reception Writing in the Library Journal in 1999, Starr E. Smith said that Fitzgerald, drawing on her own youthful employment at the BBC, \\"brings time, place, and characters to life in a book remarkable for its dexterous and appealing prose\\". In his Understanding Penelope Fitzgerald (2004) Peter Wolfe called the book \\"fluent without wordiness and poetic without being showy\\", and the author's \\"ability to make it look easy\\" a marvel. Wolfe noted that the book delivered what readers had come to expect: ‚Äúa well-crafted plot with sensitive emotional understanding, prose graced by shining moments, intimacy and immediacy, and engaging people who are trying to sort out their lives in the teeth of disaster‚Äù. Hermione Lee, Fitzgerald's biographer, noted that although the novel at first appears to be a light, funny, brilliantly accurate recreation of the BBC in wartime, there is also danger and anguish, a strong idea about truth, and a sad affectionate remembering of the author's younger self. In his introduction to the 2014 paperback edition of the novel, Mark Damazer noted that while Fitzgerald may only have been in her mid-20s when she worked for the BBC, she palpably understood its ‚Äúprofound, fussy, and sometimes vain but largely heroic and invaluable commitment to the truth ‚Äì and expressed it in the form of a concise, witty and beautiful novel\\".

Forms There are two basic forms of knitting patterns: * Text patterns which use numerals and words (and usually abbreviations), and * Chart patterns which use symbols in a chart. Some patterns include the entire instructions in both forms, as some knitters prefer one or the other. Some patterns mix the forms to take advantage of the best of each. For example, a pattern's start and end may be described in text and a repeated design as a chart. Each knitting pattern typically provides its own abbreviations and symbol keys or refers to a standard. There is no single authoritative source for knitting symbology and Knitting abbreviations, so multiple standards exist. Both forms use the convention of sequential row numbers; a row counter is often used to keep track of progress through the pattern. =Text patterns= Text pattern details can vary from a general description to detailed stitch-by-stitch instruction. Knitting abbreviations are used for brevity. Text patterns typically provide sequential instructions to be followed and may also include helpful advice. =Chart patterns= Chart patterns use a matrix of blocks filled with letters and symbols to describe the knitted stitches, typically with one stitch per block. Chart patterns provide visual feedback on the relative position of stitches. They may be color-coded for multi-color knitting. List of typical chart symbols * : (blank) knit stitch (K) on right side; purl on wrong side *-: purl (P) on right side; knit on wrong side *o: yarn over (YO) *\\\\: slip, slip, knit (ssk) on right side; slip, slip, purl (ssp) on wrong side */: knit 2 together (k2tog) on right side; purl 2 together (p2tog) on wrong side Sources: Cables can be denoted by diagonal lines across multiple blocks to indicate number of stitches and direction of cable. Other symbols unique to a particular pattern may be used. Sources Knitting patterns can be sold as a means of income. Knitting pattern collections are sold in books and magazines, but web sites such as Ravelry allow sale of individual knitting patterns. The earliest known pattern book containing a knitting pattern was published in 1524. The earliest published English knitting pattern appeared in Natura Exenterata: or Nature Unbowelled, which was printed in London in 1655 Rutt, Richard. A History of Hand Knitting.

It is affiliated with Texans for Fiscal Responsibility and the Empower Texans Foundation. Empower Texans is based in Austin with operations in Dallas, Houston, and Midland. Empower Texans focuses on fiscal conservatism by supporting lower taxes and spending restraint. It operates in Republican state-level politics in Texas, targeting candidates whom the group views as insufficiently conservative in Republican primaries. History Empower Texans was formed in 2006 by Tim Dunn. Dunn is the group's primary financial contributor. Dan and Farris Wilks are also major donors to Empower Texans. The group has been described as Tea Party-aligned. In 2014, Empower Texans CEO Michael Quinn Sullivan was fined by the Texas Ethics Commission after the agency alleged that he had failed to register as a lobbyist starting in 2010. Sullivan said his activities were best described as journalism rather than lobbying. He appealed the fine; as of 2020, a series of delays had prevented the case from going to trial. Texans for Fiscal Responsibility Texans for Fiscal Responsibility (TFR), which is a project of Empower Texans, is a conservative political advocacy group based in Austin, Texas. Founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, the stated mission of TFR is to \\"create and sustain a system of strong fiscal stewardship within all levels of Texas government, ensuring the greatest amounts of economic and personal liberty, and promoting public policies that provide individuals with the freedom to use their strengths and talents in pursuit of greater opportunities.\\" TFR is a nonprofit organization and files as a 501c(4). TFR advocates for limited government via reduced taxation and greater public accountability. The group has been described as trying to \\"purge the GOP establishment.\\" Texas Monthly called TFR \\"one of the most influential advocacy groups in Austin\\". Through TFR, Empower Texans publishes an annual Fiscal Responsibility Index, which is a scorecard the group uses to grade legislators according to how well they protect the interests of taxpayers; and a Taxpayer Pledge, which is signed by lawmakers who promise not to raise taxes. The group hands out \\"Taxpayer Champion Awards\\" to legislators who score well on TFR's Fiscal Responsibility Index. In 2012 and 2013, Texas Monthly and The Texas Observer wrote that Michael Quinn Sullivan had exaggerated budget increases and other statistics to make it appear that more moderate Republicans were not sufficiently conservative. Texas Scorecard In January 2015, Empower Texans launched a print and online publication project called Texas Scorecard. In 2019, two employees of Texas Scorecard were granted media credentials to the Texas Senate but denied media credentials to the Texas House. Texas Scorecard was spun off into its own nonprofit entity in 2020. Former Empower Texans CEO Michael Quinn Sullivan became the publisher of the publication. Activities =2016= The group, which opposed Republican Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives Joe Straus, made $1.4 million in donations and in-kind contributions to anti- Straus candidates in the 2016 primary election. =2018= In the 2018 Texas Republican primary elections, which were held on March 6, 2018, Empower Texans endorsed 34 candidates. A total of 13 endorsed candidates won, while 17 lost and four advanced to runoff primary elections in May 2018. Two of the group's notable victories were the defeat of state representatives Jason Villalba and Wayne Faircloth. It donated a total of $4.7 million to candidates during the 2018 election cycle. =2020= In the 2020 election cycle, Empower Texans made endorsements in six state House races. As of June 2020, its political action committees had not yet reported any spending on the election cycle. In June 2020, Empower Texans vice president Cary Cheshire and its general counsel Tony McDonald were recorded making derogatory comments about Texas Governor Greg Abbott, including joking about his use of a wheelchair. Cheshire and McDonald were disciplined by the organization over the incident. House Speaker scandal In June 2019, Texas Speaker of the House Dennis Bonnen was secretly recorded by Empower Texans president Michael Quinn Sullivan offering Sullivan a deal in which Empower Texans would be granted press credentials that would allow them on the floor of the Texas House while it would be in session for the 2021 legislative session. In exchange, Bonnen wanted Empower Texans to target certain Republican representatives in the next primary election for defeat while not criticizing certain other Republicans. The incident was described by Texas Monthly as \\"the most significant political scandal in Texas politics in many years.\\" After Sullivan released a tape of the meeting, Bonnen announced he would not seek re-election.

History  NET Ministries was founded in the United States and is based in Saint Paul, Minnesota in the diocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. NET's roots go back to the St. Paul Catholic Youth Center (CYC) which offered a variety of programs from 1939 to 1989. In 1980 NET's founder, Mark Berchem, through CYC organized eighteen high school youth retreats around southern Minnesota. Young adults traveled in a van giving these retreats over a three-week period in January. The following January three teams of youth were sent to Winona, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. In 1981 these missions extended to a full year commitment. In 1982 the acronym NET (standing for National Evangelization Team) became name of this movement, inspired by Mark 1:17 and Luke 5:4. CYC closed in 1989 and NET was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under the Archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis. = NET in other countries = In 1988, NET Ministries expanded to Australia, and to Canada in 1994. NET Australia and NET Canada are now separate organizations. In 2004, NET Uganda started as an offshoot of NET Australia, and NET Canada started a sister organization in Ireland. NET Scotland is currently run through NET USA.  Programs  Each year, around 180 young Catholics from ages 18‚Äì28 are accepted to be \\"netters\\" for the year.

It is set in 1912 at a fictional Cambridge college, St Angelicus. The novel was shortlisted for the Booker prize. Plot Fred Fairly, a Junior Fellow of St Angelicus ('Angels'), a fictional Cambridge college, is a physicist whose research focuses on the exciting modern field of quantum theory. As Fred cycles along the Guestingley Road in the dark, an unlit farmer's cart pulls out of a gateway into his path, causing him to crash into a stranger - a young woman by the name of Daisy Saunders. Both are knocked unconscious, and are taken in by the wife of Professor Wrayburn who lives nearby. Noting that the young woman wears a wedding ring, she incorrectly assumes that the pair are husband and wife and she puts them into the same bed to recover. On coming round, Fred immediately falls in love with Daisy, but she leaves without giving an address and he has no way of locating her. Daisy is in fact an impoverished young woman from South London, who has been working towards a nursing position at Blackfriars Hospital. She is single but wears a wedding ring to fend off unwanted male attention. At the time of the accident she was cycling with Thomas Kelly, a seedy journalist, who quickly made himself scarce. While Fred is recuperating in a nursing home, Daisy returns to Cambridge and gets a job at the local asylum. She visits Mrs Wrayburn, quickly realises that the household chores are a burden to her, and offers to take them over in return for lodging. As soon as Fred learns of her return, he proposes marriage. Daisy says that she will consider it. The driver of the farmer's cart that caused the accident has not been found and this draws the interest of Dr Matthews, Provost of St James and teller of ghost stories. It also draws the attention of the local police who open an investigation. In the ensuing trial, Fred, Daisy and Mrs Wrayburn are called as witnesses. While Daisy is in the witness box, the police unexpectedly introduce Thomas Kelly, whom she denies knowing. But Kelly, determined to cause Daisy damage, testifies that he is waiting for her to come to him at a local hotel where rooms are rented by the hour. Fred is horrified. He leaves the courtroom and waits in a nearby cafe for three hours until Kelly emerges. When he does, Fred knocks him unconscious. Following the trial, Daisy loses her job. She responds indignantly to Fred's questioning and their relationship appears to be at an end. Daisy says goodbye to Mrs Wrayburn and with no job and no money walks the several miles back to the station for a train to London. After losing her way, she finds herself outside a side gate of Fred's college, St Angelicus, which mysteriously stands open for only the third time in the college's long history. She hears a cry, goes in and helps the blind master of the college who has fainted. The incident has taken only five minutes - a delay just long enough for her to run into Fred, who is returning from a physics lecture. Principal characters * Frederick Aylmer \\"Fred\\" Fairly: 25-year-old lecturer in practical physics and junior fellow at St Angelicus * Daisy Saunders: penniless nursing student * Thomas Kelly: disreputable journalist * Dr Matthews: Provost of St James, medievalist, paleographer, teller of ghost stories * Professor Henry Flowerdew: Fred's mentor, a strict Machian * George Turner: farmer, owner of the cart that collided with Fred and Daisy * Herbert and Venetia Wrayburn: residents of Cambridge * James Elder: an attempted suicide * Dr Sage: a quack. Background Fitzgerald's inspiration for the opening of the novel came when she saw through a Cambridge bus window some cows in ecstasy over willow branches that had been broken off by strong winds; she viewed this as an instance of reason giving way to imagination in 'this orderly University city'. Fitzgerald was familiar with the Cambridge of the 1910s, having researched it for The Knox Brothers (1977), a history of her Knox relatives. Her uncle, Dillwyn Knox had been a classical scholar there, rather than a physicist, but like the Fred of the book had had a passionate attention to proofs and exact detail; he also like Fred had as a young man suffered a loss of faith that he had tried to shield from his father. Dillwyn Knox had been a student and Fellow at King's, whose Provost at the time, M. R. James, was - like the Dr Matthews of the novel - a medievalist, palaeographer and author of ghost stories. Fitzgerald explained that \\"I set my novel in the Cambridge of 1912 because that was the height of the so-called 'mind/body controversy' with the scientists of the Cavendish in controversy with professing Christians, championed by James ... The ghost story is there to give atmosphere to the anti-materialists of Cambridge, who don't believe that physics can explain everything.\\" The central event of the book, the bicycle crash of mutual strangers who wake up after the accident in the same bed, is based on an incident reported by Burne-Jones. Fitzgerald has stated that The Gate of Angels is her only novel with a happy ending.  Critical reception  Contemporary reviewers of the novel were long and enthusiastic, with John Bailey speaking of her 'mesmeric insouciance' and Sebastian Faulks likening it to being taken in a ride in a peculiar kind of car where everything works beautifully but, halfway through and with exhilarating results, \\"someone throws the steering wheel out of the window\\". Louis B. Jones for The New York Times Book Review noted that \\"In this novel, atoms and spooks have equal epistemological status\\". In his Understanding Penelope Fitzgerald (2004), Peter Wolfe noted that the book explores the Victorian themes of good, evil and responsibility. Fitzgerald being \\"[t]oo accomplished to go heavy on the signals\\", the book's strength lies in what is withheld and implied. And, its \\"irony and deadpan wit impart a quiet intensity that make other novels look soggy and loose\\". Writing in 2010, Frank Kermode praised the work for its wealth of period detail, and opined that \\"The density of implication provided by this short novel is remarkable ... one senses a developed interest in the mysteriousness of the story, the exploitation of a new skill, which is to arrange for the story to project another story, less definite, more puzzling, than the first-hand narrative itself\\". Fitzgerald's biographer, Hermione Lee, noted that the novel masquerades as a light, comical love story set in Edwardian times, while also raising - but deliberately not answering - questions about the nature of belief, relativity and truth. Lee held the book to be the most feminist of all of Fitzgerald's novels (though noting that the author did not use that categorisation), dealing as it does with themes of women's struggles, the abuses against them, and their need for solidarity. The novel was shortlisted for the Irish Times/Aer Lingus Prize and for the Booker Prize.

It's a place where play areas, basketball and tennis courts, an indoor theater and the Berkeley Art Center share space with native oaks and California Bay Laurels, quiet shady picnic areas, a spacious grassy knoll and the lovely Codornices Creek, which flows through the park. Live Oak Park is one of Berkeley's oldest and most naturalistic public parks.City of Berkeley Parkfacilities, Retrieved 7 March 2015  Geography  Live Oak Park sits along both sides of Codornices Creek like a narrow green belt in 1301 Shattuck Avenue, at Berryman Street between Shattuck Avenue and Oxford Street. Walnut Street runs through the middle of the park as Codornices Creek meanders through its grove of native oaks, accented here and there with big, old specimen trees originally planted in the original gardens that preceded the park. Live Oak Park is situated here because of the many little creeks that flow from the Berkeley Hills the short way down to San Francisco Bay. These little creeks are more powerful than they look. As rising sea level filled the current Bay at the end of the last Ice Age, the creeks basically built what are now the flatlands, by carrying rock and soil eroded from the earthquake- riven, still-rising hills. Codornices Creek is one of these original creeks which run out of the Berkeley Hills in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. In its upper stretch, it passes entirely within the city limits of Berkeley and further downstream, it marks the city limit to the adjacent city of Albany in its lower section. The name of the creek derives from the Spanish word \\"codornices\\", meaning \\"quails\\". California valley quail were once common in the area. The name was given by one of the family Peralta, once owners of the vast Rancho San Antonio.  History  = Origin = In the early days of Berkeley, the vast area that now includes the Life Oak Park and its neighborhoods and which extended over the top of the Berkeley Hills, was acquired in 1860 by one of Berkeley's earliest settlers, Napoleon Bonaparte Byrne. He and his family and Pete and Hannah Byrne, two former slaves who had been freed prior to the journey west, made the long trek across the continent from Missouri to settle on the banks of Codornices Creek and to begin farming their 800 acres. Because the Byrnes had invested in a farming venture in the Delta, they began selling their Berkeley property piece by piece, beginning in 1873.

Envisioning a developing town, Henry Berryman, as owner of the Berkeley Waterworks, built the Berryman Reservoir (still located a few blocks above the Live Oak Park), and also extended the steam train line north on Shattuck to Vine Street (Berryman Station), both as measures to increase the desirability of his North Berkeley lots. A few of the earliest houses built then are still standing today. When the extensive Byrne lands were subdivided by Henry Berryman in the 1870s, two parcels on Codornices Creek remained intact and were developed as a private estate. To the north of the creek was the home of Michael O¬¥Toole and Russell Penniman owned the property to the south. On March 10, 1914 the City Council approved an ordinance appropriating $72.500 to purchase the property in order to establish a city park. At that time Berkeley, like many other American cities, was swept up in the City Beautiful Movement, and had recently commissioned a report on city planning, which revealed a lack of public parks. The city took formal possession of the property on Juli 1 and the still unnamed park was opened to the public with appropriate ceremony. For the next two weeks everyone ¬¥s mind was on choosing a name for the new park and suggestions were published almost daily in the Berkeley Gazette. Among those names proposed were ‚ÄúPenniman‚Äù, ‚ÄúBerryman‚Äù, and even ‚ÄúWhitehall‚Äù (the name of Bishop Berkeley's home). On July 14, 1914, the City Council adopted ‚ÄúLive Oak‚Äù. Several years later the park was extended one block to Oxford Street, Codornices Creek and its groves of both native and introduced trees were preserved. One of the first improvements was the present Walnut Street Bridge, designed in 1915. In 1917 a large, stone Arts & Crafts fireplace was built, an in 1918 William Miles donated a rustic aviary. Penniman's brown shingle became the clubhouse and North Branch library. = Live Oak Community Center = When the Penniman Clubhouse burned in 1951 the city built the current Live Oak Community Center, the \\"Live Oak Park Recreation Center, Social Hall Shattuck & Berryman, Berkeley, California\\",Live Oak Community Center, Retrieved 7 March 2015 where such groups as the \\"Berkeley Folk Dancers\\" have their home.Homepage of Berkeley Folk Dancers, Retrieved 7 March 2015 The \\"Berkeley Art Center\\" is now situated on the east side of Walnut Street Bridge.

Two Sisters Vase with Lilies Patrons and awards Many of her paintings were bought by Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, a noted critic, poet and art collector, who wrote extensively about her work, comparing it to classical Byzantine art and the works of the Quattrocento. She was awarded a first-class prize at the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. Publication of her work Her reputation was enhanced by a series of social-awareness themed engravings and illustrations done for the magazine Cuv√¢ntul Liber during the thirties. Her drawings also appeared in Rom√¢nia Muncitoare. In addition to her canvases, she provided decorations for the Church of Saint Constantine and Elena in Constan»õa and the Church of Elijah the Tishbite in Sinaia. For many years, she participated in exhibitions held by the fine arts society of Bessarabia. She was also a teacher at the \\"Academy of Decorative Arts\\", founded by M. H. Maxy. Following her sister's execution in 1937, she retired from public life. Her death appears to have been the result of an accident.

It was first described by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829. There are several synonyms, some of which represent misspellings of the original name, and others which were given to female fish, at the time thought to be a separate species. Description Parapercis hexophtalma The speckled sandperch grows to a length of around and is about five times as long as the body is deep. The anterior (front) end of the body is cylindrical and the posterior end is somewhat flattened. The eyes are rather close together on the top of the head and the fish rests on the seabed, propping itself up with its widely separated pelvic fins. The dorsal fin has five spines and 21 or 22 soft rays, and the anal fin has a single spine and 17 or 18 soft rays. The dorsal surface of the fish is greenish dappled with dark brown, the flanks are pale grey and the underparts white. There is a lateral row of large white spots each with one or more small black spots in the middle. On the underparts there are further black spots, mostly edged with yellow. Females have brown spots on the head and males have diagonal yellowish-brown markings on the cheek. The dorsal fin has a black spot at the base of the spines and the caudal fin, which is rounded or has a short extension from the upper lobe, has a larger black spot. There are several rows of small black spots on the soft rays of the dorsal fin and one row on the anal fin. Distribution The speckled sandperch is found in shallow waters on the east coast of Africa as far south as Natal, the Red Sea and the western Indo-Pacific. Its range extends as far east as Sumatra, and includes the Maldives, the Laccadives and Sri Lanka. The type location is the Red Sea. Although its range was originally thought to extend as far east as Fiji, three new species of Parapercis were recognised in 2007 based on their number of fin rays, their colouration and markings, and the location and number of spots on their anal fins; Parapercis pacifica occurs from southern Japan to the Timor Sea, Parapercis queenslandica from northern Australia, and Parapercis xanthogramma from Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. The speckled sandperch generally occurs on sandy or rubble substrates in areas sheltered by reefs. Biology The speckled sandperch is a predator and feeds on small crustaceans and other invertebrates, also taking small fish. Several members of the family Pinguipedidae are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting their adult life as females and changing sex to males later, and this is the case with the speckled sandperch. Not only do the fish change sex, but they also change their markings at the same time. The sexual inversion occurs at a length of about . Male fish are territorial and defend a harem of females. The eggs are planktonic and larval development takes place during one to two months.

Cirone has taken photographs of celebrities; including actors, musicians, artists, politicians including President Donald Trump in the United States and internationally since about 1970. Her works have appeared in magazines, newspapers, books and at the Guggenheim Museum (1965). A retrospective of her work was held in Norwich, Connecticut in 1995 at the New England Museum for Contemporary Art. Biography =Model= Bettina Cirone was a Ford model in the 1960s, during which she modeled for major fashion magazines. She modeled for, and was a friend of, Salvador Dal√≠, who gave her prints that he personally autographed, along with a copy of his book, Diary of a Genius, signed \\"Pour mon amie Bettina, Hommage Dal√≠, 1966,\\" and includes a pen sketch of Don Quixote. The book was sold in the late 2000s. Another was a framed print of a blue lion that signed \\"Pour Bettina\\". It, along with another print that Dali gave her, was stolen in 2014. =Photographer= Cirone started working as a photojournalist around 1970, when she was hired during New York City Mayor John Lindsay's administration and assigned to the Lower Manhattan Development City Planning Commission to shoot landmarks in downtown Manhattan. In the early 70's she gravitated to capturing images of celebrities like Alec Baldwin, Sigourney Weaver, Kim Basinger, Ben Vereen, Michael Douglas, and Gregory Hines. Her photographs have appeared in publications, like Daily News, Newsday, People magazine, New York Magazine, Jet, New York Newsday, The New York Post, and American Photo.

One roll of black and white film that she took of Dustin Hoffman trying on hats for Death of a Salesman is one of the most well-published works. In January 1986, her images were produced for a Playboy pictorial essay entitled \\"Grapevine: Reviving a Dead Salesman\\". Many of her images have been personally autographed by the celebrities that she has photographed, like two signed photographs of Andy Warhol that had been taken by Cirone at Studio 54 with author and playwright Tennessee Williams. Pictures of George Clooney, Mary Tyler Moore holding Cirone's cat, and Mia Farrow are a few of the photographs in Cirone's home. International artists that she's portrayed include Jordi Aluma and Ert√©. Her works have appeared in books, such as Urban Design as Public Policy, There's No Place Like Home: Confessions of an Interior Designer, Human Biology, and Hollywood Royalty: Hepburn, Davis, Stewart, and Friends at the Dinner Party of the Century.

Owned and bred by the Aga Khan he was trained by Alain de Royer-Dupr√© and ridden by Christophe Soumillon in a racing career which comprised six races between September 2005 and July 2006. As a two-year-old he showed some promise by finishing third on his debut and winning a minor race by six lengths. In the following spring he finished second on his reappearance before winning the Prix de Courteuil and then recorded his biggest win when recording an upset victory in the Prix du Jockey Club. He was injured when running poorly in the Irish Derby (his only subsequent race), and was retired from racing to become a National Hunt breeding stallion in Ireland. Background Darsi is a \\"big, imposing\\" bay horse standing 16.2 hands high bred in France by his owner the Aga Khan. He was sired by Polish Precedent, a lightly-raced horse who won the Prix Jacques Le Marois and the Prix du Moulin in 1989 before sustaining his only defeat when finishing second to Zilzal in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He later became a very successful breeding stallion, siring Pilsudski, Rakti, Court Masterpiece (Prix de la For√™t, Sussex Stakes), Pure Grain (Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks) and Polish Summer (Dubai Sheema Classic). Darsi's dam Darashandeh won one minor race, finished second in the Prix de Flore and fourth in the Prix Saint-Alary in 1997. She was a daughter of Daralinsha, a mare who won the Prix de Minerve in 1987 and was also the great-grandam of Darjina (Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Moulin). Darsi was sent into training with Alain de Royer-Dupr√© at Chantilly and was ridden in all of his races by the Belgian jockey Christophe Soumillon. Racing career =2005: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Darsi contested the Prix de Villebon, for previously unraced colts and geldings over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 16 September. Starting the 6/4 favourite against twelve opponents, he took the lead in the straight but faded in the closing stages to finish fifth behind the Andr√© Fabre-trained Gravitas. Four weeks later the colt was sent south for the Prix des Glaieuls over 1600 metres at Lyon-Parilly and started favourite against six opponents. He took the lead soon after the start, went clear of the field approaching the last 200 metres and won by six lengths from Pitcher. =2006: three-year-old season= Darsi began his second season in the Prix de Ferrieres over 2200 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 9 April. Starting the 5/4 favourite in a seven-runner field he took the lead from the start and maintained his advantage until the last 150 metres when he was overtaken and beaten one and a half lengths by Vison Celebre. On 2 May, Darsi started 3/5 favourite for the Prix de Courteuil over 2500 metres at Chantilly. He tracked the leaders before taking the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by two lengths from Puit d'Or with Estrela Borg two and a half lengths away in third place. At Chantilly on 4 June, Darsi started a 14/1 outsider for the 169th running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2100 metres (the distance had been shortened from 2400 metres in the previous year). The Irish-trained Aussie Rules was made favourite after winning the Poule d'Essai des Poulains three weeks earlier, whilst the other leading contenders included Olympian Odyssey (third behind George Washington and Sir Percy in the 2000 Guineas), Best Name (Prix Fran√ßois Mathet), Numide (Prix Hocquart), Art Deco (Dee Stakes), Barastraight (Prix La Force) and the undefeated Arras. Darsi raced in fifth place for most of the way before making a sustained run in the straight. He overtook the leader Arras 100 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length. Best Name finished strongly to take second place by a short neck from Arras, just ahead of Art Deco, Numide and Irish Wells. Soumillon, winning the race for the third time and celebrating his 25th birthday said \\"I had a dream of a race and just followed Arras for as long as possible. Then Darsi was very brave and courageous.\\" He did however, receive a four-day ban from the racecourse stewards for the misuse of his whip. The Aga Khan commented \\"We knew he was certain to stay and this victory has been a team effort. Darsi is a very good-looking horse, most consistent and has been gradually moved up in class. He was a late developer and Alain de Royer-Dupr√© has given him plenty of time.\\" Four weeks later, Darsi was sent to Ireland and started 5/1 second favourite for the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh after his owner paid a ‚Ç¨100,000 supplementary entry fee. Before the race, Alain de Royer-Dupr√© said that the horse had been working well, but expressed some concern about sending him abroad, as Darsi had never previously traveled on a plane. Darsi's chances were not helped when he unseated Soumillon on the way to the start. He raced in mid-division before making steady progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished fifth of the thirteen runners behind Dylan Thomas. He sustained a broken sesamoid bone in the race and did not run again. Announcing his retirement in October 2006, the Aga Khan's racing manager Georges Rimaud described him as \\"a brave and courageous horse who had both speed and stamina\\". Stud record At the end of his racing career, Darsi was bought by a consortium of Irish breeders and retired to become a National Hunt breeding stallion at the Beechbrook Stud near Tinahely in County Wicklow. His early crops of foals yielded several minor winners.

He was born and died in Mons, Austrian Netherlands (present-day Belgium). Military service Uprising in the Brabant At the age of 14 he joined the Infantry as a Cadet; by age 23, he was an officer, in the 38th Infantry Regiment (L'Aisne). At the beginning of Austria's wars with Turkey, 1788, he was a major in the Gemmingen Infantry. In 1790 he served in Habsburg military to suppress the uprising in the Austrian Netherlands, with particularly distinguished service at the Battle of Falmagne, after which he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the Clerfayt Infantry N. 9, a Walloon regiment. In 1794, he acquired command of the Grenadier Battalion Rousseau and fought with this regiment during the Rhine Campaign of 1795 in the Army of the Upper Rhine under command of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. At the 1795 Siege of Mannheim he led his grenadiers in a special night foray on 10-11 November along the shore of the Neckar River, skirmishing with French troops; his regiment stormed both Schwetzingen and Heidelberg by bayonet. Wurmser commended the outstanding bravery of the grenadier battalion commander and attached the Wolff's battalion to the main army. In April 1796, Wolff was attached to the column of Archduke Charles by the Lahn river.There is some confusion in the sources regarding when his promotion to Lt. Colonel occurred, some stating it occurred in 1793 and some in 1796. Wurzach cites both promotions, and it is probable that the second promotion to Lt. Colonel was actually a promotion to colonel and simply an error in the 19th century biographical documents. Certainly by the end of 1798, he was a full colonel, and in command of the regiment Clerfayt. On 19 June, he participated in the engagement by Uckerath, and defended the left wing of the retreat against the French army under Kl√©ber.

In late May, he held a group reserve of over 3,000 troops in the Valtelline, on the Lombard border with Switzerland, where he supported Gottfried Strauch's suppression of the Cisalpine revolutionaries.Gottfried von Strauch, Freiherr, Feldzeugmeister and Inhaber of Galician Infantry Regiment Nr. 24 (appointed 1808), died in Vienna 18 March 1836.

He was colonel of the Clerfayt Regiment in 1798, although it is unclear when this promotion actually took place; in September 1799 he was promoted to major general and his promotion papers specifically referenced his leadership at Uckerrath. He received the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 18 August 1801.

In 2013, he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, representing a district in Sarpy County, in the Omaha metropolitan area. Garrett is a member of the Republican Party. In Nebraska, the legislature is non-partisan. Early life and career Garrett was born at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. His father died when he was 13, and the family settled in Colorado; Garrett graduated from William C. Hinkley High School in Aurora, Colorado, in 1972. In 1976, he received a B.S. in business management from Colorado State University; in the same year, he joined the U.S. Air Force. He received an M.S. in international relations from Troy State University in 1986, and an M.S. in national security strategy from the National War College in 2000. In 1977, Garrett married Julie Ann Cullen; the couple produced three children. In the Air Force, Garrett worked in the field of intelligence. He served overseas in Operation Desert Storm and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Garrett and his family moved 17 times during his 26 years in the military, ending at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska, where he retired in 2003 with the rank of colonel. After leaving the Air Force, Garrett spent four years working as a manager for a major defense contractor. In 2007, he founded the Garrett Group in Bellevue; the disabled- veteran-owned business provides security, intelligence, and information security consulting to the Defense Department. Nebraska Legislature In November 2013, state senator Scott Price of Bellevue resigned his seat in the Legislature, citing family responsibilities. Price had represented the 3rd District, consisting of part of eastern Sarpy County, including parts of Bellevue and Papillion. Governor Dave Heineman, charged with naming a replacement, announced that he was appointing Bellevue businessman Patrick Shannon, who had unsuccessfully run for the position in 2004. Hours after Heineman's announcement, Shannon withdrew his name from consideration, stating that the need to care for his elderly parents took precedence. Several of Nebraska's major media outlets noted that he had never paid a $16,000 fine arising from 2004 campaign-law violations, and suggested that this might have influenced his decision to withdraw. On December 11, 2013, Heineman announced that he was naming Garrett to the post; Garrett was sworn in that day. =2014 election= In 2014, an election was held to determine who would fill the remaining two years of the four-year legislative term. Garrett ran for the position; he was challenged by Carol Blood, a member of the Bellevue City Council. In the nonpartisan primary election, Garrett, a Republican, received 1747 of the 3453 votes cast, or 50.6% of the total; Blood, a Democrat, received 1706 votes, or 49.4%. As the top two vote-getters, both moved on to the general election. Each candidate claimed to be the one who best understood, and who could do the most for, small businesses. Each declared that taxes needed to be lowered for veterans and retirees. Garrett decried \\"needless government regulation\\"; Blood called for more promotion of wind energy in Nebraska, stating that it would create many jobs. Over the entire course of the election, Garrett's campaign raised over $84,000, and spent nearly $87,000. Major contributions included over $9000 from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry PAC and over $3500 from the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce PAC, $8200 from the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, $7000 from the Nebraska Bankers State PAC, $4500 from the Nebraska Realtors PAC, and $3000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee. Blood raised about $49,500 and spent over $57,000. Major contributions to her campaign included $4000 from the Nebraska Association of Trial Attorneys PAC, $4000 from the Nebraska Hospital Association PAC, $2500 from Firefighters for Better Government, $2500 from two International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers locals, and about $1800 from the Nebraska Democratic Party. In the general election, Garrett received 4845 of the 9024 votes cast, or 53.7% of the total. Blood received 4179 votes, or 46.3%. =2016 election= In 2016, Garrett ran against Blood a second time for his incumbent seat. However, Garrett was defeated by Blood, who received 7,959 votes, or 51.4%. Garrett received 7,476 of the votes cast, or 48.3%. =Legislative tenure= 2015 session In the Legislature, Garrett served as chairman of the Rules Committee; as vice- chairman of the Government, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee; and on the Transportation and Telecommunications Committee, and the Committee on Committees. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Garrett voted in favor of the death-penalty repeal, and to override Ricketts's veto of the measure; he voted for passage of LB623, and to override the gubernatorial veto; and he voted against the gas-tax increase, and to sustain the veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Garrett voted for the bill in its 29-15 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8, with 4 present and not voting; Garrett was among those voting in favor. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5; the veto override passed 31-13-5\\\\. Garrett voted for the bill, and for the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Garrett was among those who voted against the bill.

It held that an automatic crystallisation clause was part of the parties‚Äô freedom of contract. It could not be limited by court created public policy exceptions. The significance of the case was largely outpaced by the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251, which said a floating charge was one that was created as a floating charge. Facts Brightlife Ltd had a charge over book debts in favour of Norandex, its bank. The charge said it was a \\"first specific charge\\" and did not allow Brightlife to sell, factor or discount debts without written consent. A debenture holder gave the company a notice converting the floating charge into a fixed charge a week before a voluntary winding up resolution was passed. Counsel argued public policy required restriction on crystallising events, one reason being that an automatic crystallisation clause could take effect without knowledge of company or debenture holder. It could be prejudicial to a third party, because it does not get registered. Counsel referred to the Canadian case R v Consolidated Churchill Copper Corp Ltd,[1978] 5 WWR 652 where Berger J rejected the concept of a \\"self generating crystallisation\\". Judgment Hoffmann J held that in reality, the charge on book debts was a floating charge, but had crystallised a week before, and so took priority over other debts. Following Re Manurewa Transport Ltd[1971] NZLR 909 crystallisation clauses were a necessary incident of parties‚Äô freedom to contract and policy objections should be dealt with by Parliament. He noted various statutory already, including priority to preferential debts. And certainly he at first instance was not going to add to the list. It followed that there was a floating charge if a company can continue to use book debts without the consent of the chargee. He added that although clause 3(A)(ii)(a) referred to a ‚Äòfirst specific charge‚Äô over book debts and others, ‚Äòthe rights over the debts created by the debenture were in my judgment such as to be categorised in law as a floating charge.' Authority The case was cited by the House of Lords with approval by Lord Scott in (at paragraph 87) in relation to the recharacterisation of a charge described as a fixed charge over book debts as a floating charge.

Trial The trial lasted a total of 15 days. Notable counsel who appeared included Jeremiah Harman QC and Elizabeth Gloster.

Dieterich (born 1942) is an American geophysics professor emeritus at University of California, Riverside (UCR). Early life and education Born in Seattle, Washington, Dieterich studied geology at the University of Washington before going on to graduate work at Yale University. He earned his Ph.D in 1968. His doctoral thesis discussed the \\"Sequence and mechanics of folding in the area of New Haven, Westport, and Naugatuck, Connecticut.\\" He then went to work for the USGS. Career Dieterich spent most of his career at USGS/Menlo Park. In October 1983 Dieterich made a trip to Costa Rica to evaluate recent University of California, Santa Cruz earthquake prediction models. His research, published in both his 1994 paper A constitutive law for rate of earthquake production and its application to earthquake clustering and his 1996 paper with Brian D. Kilgore entitled Implications of fault constitutive properties for earthquake prediction, theorized that the magnitude of a given earthquake and the rate of follow-on aftershocks occurred in inverse proportion, meaning that stronger earthquakes have fewer aftershocks. A study published in 2002 by Shinji Toda et al., addressing an earthquake swarm at the Izu Islands in 2000, confirms Dieterich's hypothesis. In 2003 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2011, Dieterich's Department of Earth Sciences at UCR was awarded a five-year, grant by the National Science Foundation to study earthquake fault system dynamics.

Recording Recorded in June, July and August 1996, it is the closest the listener could get to the experience of attending one of his live performances. Other instruments were added (on four of the eleven tracks) by Rens van der Zalm (fiddle and mandolin), Stephen Cooney (didgeridoo, Kpanlogo drum), Declan Masterson (low whistle) and Irvine himself, who played a second mandolin on two of the tracks. The album opens with \\"Prince Among Men\\", a song about the hazards and dangers of working underground in a mine-which Irvine wrote from the perspective of a man whose late father, James Doyle, had been a miner. \\"BƒÉneasƒÉ's Green Glade\\" is a re- worked version of the song he had first recorded with Planxty, followed this time around by \\"Rumen Sirakov's Daichevo\\", Irvine's solo adaptation of \\"Didinata\\", a dance tune in time (3‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì2) composed by Bulgarian tambura player Rumen Sirakov.Rumen Sirakov ‚Äì Tambura, Gega New Records, 2000. \\"Rain on the Roof/The Blue Mountains of New South Wales\\" is a self-penned set of jigs. \\"My Heart's Tonight in Ireland\\" is Irvine's nostalgic recollection of the times he spent touring in County Clare with Sweeney's Men. \\"Forgotten Hero\\" is a passionate song reminiscing about the life and struggle of Michael Davitt, the founder of the Irish National Land League. Then comes a set of Bulgarian dance tunes: \\"Pamela's R≈≠tchenitsa\\" in time, \\"Gruncharsko Horo\\" in time and \\"Baker's Dozen\\", an apt and witty title for a dance tune in time. \\"He Fades Away\\" is a poignant song written by Alistair Hulett, about the compensation due to the young men who died from exposure to blue asbestos in the Wittenoom mine in Western Australia in the 1940s. \\"Come With Me Over The Mountain\\" is Irvine's adaptation of H61a from Sam Henry's collection (Songs of the People), followed by another self-penned jig: \\"A Smile In The Dark\\". \\"The Monument (Lest We Forget)\\" is Irvine's revisiting of the Ludlow Massacre in the coalfields of Southern Colorado on 20 April 1914. With \\"Take No Prisoners/Old Brunswick\\", we find Irvine combining rhythms and musical phrases from the Irish and Greek traditions. The album closes with \\"Never Tire of the Road\\", Irvine's tribute to his lifelong hero, Woody Guthrie. In this updated version, Irvine included the chorus from a song Guthrie recorded in March 1944: \\"You Fascists Are Bound to Lose\\".

Previous Northeast Minneapolis libraries, 1892‚Äì1972 The first library service for the \\"New Boston\\" community in Northeast Minneapolis was a deposit station \\"H,\\" located at Moody's Drug Store, 25th and Central in 1892. In the early 20th century, Gratia Countryman, Director of the Minneapolis Public Library, tracked patron metrics of branch libraries and determined that the New Boston Branch, which had opened in January 1907, was busy enough to warrant moving from a rented space at Central Ave. and 24th Ave. NE into a purpose-built library. The Central Avenue branch, the second of Andrew Carnegie's four libraries in Minneapolis, opened on November 15, 1915 and quickly became one of the most active and important branches of the Minneapolis Public Library System.Benidt, Bruce Weir, ‚ÄúThe Library Book,‚Äù Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center, 1984, pp. 94, 99-100.

Mirroring the Minneapolis Public Library's other Carnegie branches, children constituted a significant portion of the library's patronage, and many children who grew up in Northeast Minneapolis before the library was razed, remember the Central Avenue branch as their neighborhood library.Arnold, Caroline, ‚ÄúMy First Library: Hennepin County Library Northeast,‚Äù September 30, 2015, http://carolinearnoldart.blogspot.com/2015/09/my-first-library-hennepin- county.html The Central Avenue branch was the only Carnegie library in Minneapolis to be torn down. The building was in very poor condition at several points in its existence, and multiple renovations of the branch in 1936 and 1950 could not keep it from falling into disrepair again by the 1960s. In 1970, Minneapolis Public Library Director Ervin Gaines announced that the cost of renovating the Central Avenue branch was higher than the cost of a new building. The Central Avenue branch was razed in 1972, and in 1973 Northeast Library was dedicated on the same site.Sassaman, Judith, ‚ÄúThe History and Development of the Carnegie Branch Library Buildings in Minneapolis and St. Paul from Their Beginning to the Present,‚Äù 1979, p. 26.

In some cases the finite state is even more disadvantageous for everybody than before (for the totality as well as for the individual). The term Paradox of competition () was coined by German economist Wolfgang St√ºtzel. It is about a case of a rationality trap. St√ºtzel distinguishes three categories of paradoxes of competition:Rolf-Dieter Grass, Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Volkswirtschaftslehre. M√ºnchen 1988, p. 156-165 # Circuit paradoxes # Classical paradoxes # Marx paradoxes  Examples  * Advertising: the overall demand for detergent is assumed steady. By advertisement the individual venture can expand its share in market at the expense of its competitors. But if all producers of detergent do the same, their expenses for advertisement rise without gaining higher sales at large, so that profits even decline. * Opening hours: assumed the legislator extends the allowed opening hours by two hours. Now when an individual shop applies that new opening hours, though it has to pay more work, it can gain higher sales and thereby more profit. But if all shops practise the extended opening hours, customers can shop again at other shops with similar supply and the potential sales volume again allocates to all (similar) shops. * Wage policy: for each individual country counts: a state can improve its price competitiveness in comparison with other states by a restrained wage policy. But from that it does just not follow that all countries (can) improve their competitiveness when they apply restrained wage policy.Johannes Schmidt, 2012: Sparen ‚Äì Fluch oder Segen? In: Normative und institutionelle Grundfragen der √ñkonomik: Lehren aus der Krise f√ºr die Makro√∂konomik. (PDF; 125 kB) p. 12 f. * Current account balance: a current account surplus is to the expense of an others state current account deficit ‚Äì insofar not all can improve their balance at the same time. On the contrary ‚Äì if all simultaneously begin to cut down their imports they will have a decline of balance in their current account in the end.Wolfgang St√ºtzel in: Zins, Kredit und Produktion. T√ºbingen 1952. Einleitung der Herausgebers. p. 9: ‚ÄûAlle L√§nder wollen [...] mehr exportieren als importieren. Es ist wieder von vornherein klar, da√ü sie nicht zum Ziele kommen werden. Grunds√§tzlich theoretisch gibt es hier zwei M√∂glichkeiten. Entweder betreiben alle Staaten aktive Exportf√∂rderung und lassen die Importe frei: In einem Taumel internationaler Austauschlust wird das Gesamtexportvolumen steigen, ohne da√ü in summa irgend jemand mehr exportiert als importiert h√§tte. Oder aber und das ist das Wahrscheinlichere und leider immer wieder historisch Gegebene: Man wird zur Gewinnung eines aktiven Leistungsbilanzsaldos die Importe zu beschr√§nken suchen. Damit kann auch kein Land mehr seinen Export steigern. Im Gegenteil. Das allgemeine Streben nach einer Differenz zwischen Export und Import wird das Gesamtaustauschvolumen kumulativ zur√ºckgehen lassen.‚Äú (see also: protectionism in the 1930s: Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act). * Currency devaluation: an individual state with own currency can achieve to lower overseas prices of its export goods by means of currency devaluation. All countries together in total cannot do so.Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft. Aalen 1979. p. 403. If countries undersell each other with devaluations, the danger of currency war grows, consequence of which is a spiral of devaluation.  Partial sentence, Global sentence, lead and lag effect  Wolfgang St√ºtzel analyses paradoxes of competition using the concept of Balances Mechanics (). Specifically he defines and distinguishes validness which is valid for individual economic entities respectively individual groups (Partial sentence), and validness which counts for the totality of economic entities (Global sentence). Concerning the pursuit of export surpluses he distinguishes as follows:Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft. Aalen 1979. p. 404. * Partial sentence: Every country can achieve export surpluses by expanding its export. Every country can achieve export surpluses by reducing its import. * Global sentence: The sum of export always equals the sum of import. On overall economy examination (macroeconomics, aggregation problem) the benefit which individual economies want to achieve for themselves (legitimately) often appears as so called lead effect as against an inevitable lag effect of others. When lag effects are condoned, no paradox of competition arises. Solely because individual supply and individual demand turn out to be more elastic than overall supply and overall demand the classical paradox of competition can occur.Wolfgang St√ºtzel: Paradoxa der Geld- und Konkurrenzwirtschaft. Aalen 1979. p. 369.  See also  * Paradox of saving * Market failure * Balances Mechanics * Tragedy of the commons  Literature  *Peter Bofinger: Grundz√ºge der Volkswirtschaftslehre.

It mainly houses the regalia of the Sultan and the royalty, as well as exhibits related to the commemorations of the Silver and Golden Jubilee celebrations of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's rule of Brunei. It was officially opened on 30 September 1992 by the Sultan himself. History The building, was originally called \\"Churchill's Memorial Building\\", which had been established by the Sultan Omar Ali Saiffudien III, that present the Sultan's father, as he admired Winston Churchill,it was replaced in the late 1992 by the Royal Regalia Exhibition Hall. It was established to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of His Majesty's coronation as Brunei's 29th king. A historical review of the present Sultan's life is narrated through family pictures with detailed narrative texts in which he is highlighted through many of his portraits and a hologram. On 2 December 2017, the building has been renamed to the Royal Regalia Museum, in conjunction with the Golden Jubilee Celebration of His Majesty's ascension to the throne. Description Front exhibit The museum building is a large gold-domed structure which is fitted with specially- designed mosaics. It has a semi-circular plan and is covered with plush carpets. Marble has been used extensively in its interior. The main display at the entrance hall is a huge chariot used for the parade carrying the Sultan through the streets of the city on the occasion of his 1992 silver jubilee celebration. A bevy of headless mannequins dressed in traditional attire are displayed in front of the chariot. There is also a second chariot which was used during the 1968 coronation and also during the 1972 Queen's visit to Brunei. Exhibits include the artifacts that were used for royal ceremonies in the country, the gold and silver ceremonial weaponry, crowns embedded with jewels, and other paraphernalia that formed part of the coronation ceremonies, and ceremonial costumes. A particular photograph of interest shows the Sultan smiling at his circumcision ceremony. There is an exhibit of a golden hand and forearm that the Sultan used as a prop for his chin at his coronation and an ornate crown, as well as exhibits of \\"documents and treaties\\" in the Constitutional Gallery.

It is a spin-off of Avery's previous creation, Droopy, and stars his unnamed Southern-accented wolf, who previously appeared opposite Droopy in The Three Little Pups and in Blackboard Jumble and Sheepwrecked. Plot The Southern-accented Wolf is having breakfast on his farm when there is a knock on his door. A letter is pushed under it, which reads: ::Please take care of my little Billy goat. P.S. You will have no trouble feeding him ‚Äî _HE EATS ANYTHING_. True to the letter's contents, the wolf opens the door and finds a basket with a baby goat, Billy, who walks around inside the wolf's house, eating anything in his path, such as the carpet, part of the sofa, the wallpaper, the calendar, the globe, the curtains, and the wolf's trousers. The wolf, here presented with palilalia, addresses the audience: \\"You know? Now there's a pretty hungry little billy goat-goat-goat-goat-goat-goat.\\" Oblivious to Billy's limitless hunger, the wolf gives him a bottle of milk, but Billy spills the milk and eats the bottle, the pacifier, the cutlery and crockery (like a sandwich), the coffeepot (along with all the coffee inside it), and the napkin. Realizing that Billy will be more than a handful to deal with, the wolf tries to tie him in the garden to a hook hammered into the ground, but Billy eats the rope and comically eats the top part of the wolf's shoe when he tries to stop him. The wolf checks his foot and finds all ten of his toes still there, to his relief. Billy then tries to eat the wolf's spare tire, but is unable to chew the rubber and ends up shaped like the tire as soon as he swallows it whole. The wolf then tries tying Billy to the windmill, but once again, Billy eats not only the rope, but the entire windmill, leaving the blades spinning at the top even with no support. He then attempts to take him away in a wheelbarrow and release him into the wild, but Billy eats the wheelbarrow and the wheel. The wolf ties Billy to a kite and releases him into the sky, but Billy eats the kite, the string and starts chewing on the wolf's arm. Unaffected, the wolf merely tells him to stop. He wraps Billy in chains and tries to tie him to a tree on a small island, but Billy proceeds to eat some of the film itself. Next, the wolf places Billy in the trunk of his car and tries to drive him somewhere, but Billy somehow eats his way through the car and ends up devouring the motor. The wolf then ties Billy to a horse and hits it on the bottom to make it run away and take Billy with it. However, Billy eats the horse's hair, and the angry horse repeats the same tactic with the wolf, whose hair Billy eats as well. The wolf looks irritably at the horse and says \\"Copycat\\". As a final attempt to rid himself of Billy for good, the wolf places pepper on a railroad track and has Billy eat the railway, following it all the way to California, which is 2360 miles away. With Billy gone, the wolf tucks himself into bed. That night, Billy returns, eating the other side of the railway and covered in stamps of all the States he crossed eating the railway. The wolf suddenly awakens to see that Billy has eaten his entire house. Feigning joy, the wolf welcomes Billy back but ties him to a rocket, which the wolf sends to the moon. Even this isn't enough to satisfy the little goat, as Billy then eats the moon, taking the moonlight along with it and leaving the Earth in darkness. The wolf lights a match and says \\"Goodnight, y'all-y'all-y'all-y'all\\" as the cartoon closes. The recurring melody played by woodwinds and/or whistled from 2:21 onward is the Civil War tune \\"Kingdom Coming\\" or \\"The Year of Jubilo\\".

Life  He was born in Nafplio on 1 November 1860. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy, graduating as an Ensign of the Engineer Corps on 24 March 1881. He pursued further studies for four years in France, and fought in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 with distinction, which earned him promotion to Major. He then served as a member of the international committee that supervised the evacuation of Thessaly by the Ottoman army. In the next years, he served mainly in staff positions, and in the early phase of the First Balkan War held the post of Deputy Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff, with responsibility for the rear areas. On 28 October 1912, he assumed command of the newly raised 7th Infantry Division guarding the demarcation line with the Bulgarian Army near Thessaloniki and the Pangaion Hills. Although allies in the war, Greece and Bulgaria were rivals over possession of Macedonia, and Sotilis forces were involved in clashes with the Bulgarians along the demarcation line. With the outbreak of the Second Balkan War between the former allies in June 1913, he led his division to victories against the Bulgarians at Sulovo, Nevrokop, Kremenska, Djumaya, and Prendel Han. On 19 July he became commander of the temporary Nevrokop Army Detachment, comprising the 7th and 8th divisions. After the Balkan Wars he continued in command of 7th Division at Kavala, and in 1915, with the mobilization of the Greek army, he assumed command of V Army Corps, and of II Army Corps in 1916. As a royalist, he was dismissed from the Army in 1917‚Äì1920 during the National Schism. He was reinstated with the electoral defeat of Eleftherios Venizelos in November 1920 which brought the royalist opposition to power, and assumed the post of Superior Military Commander of Macedonia. He retired on 17 December 1922. He died in 1953.

Walter grew up among idyllic vineyards with a brother and a sister. His home was located quite near to the Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant which was built in an old quarry at that time. He was trained as a stonemason in a quarry and after that studied sculpture at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe from 1990 to 1996. Walter was awarded a DAAD -scholarship to Japan and worked at Tama Art University in Tokyo from 1997 to 1998.http://www.holger-walter- atelier.de/Englisch/index.html He gave lectures at the HafenCity University Hamburg and the Tama Art University Tokyo. He married the Japanese pianist Tomoyo Okamoto in 2001. They have three children.Hans Gercke, Ursula Merkel: Holger Walter Ex_Cavations, Karlsruhe 2009 Work His works are rooted in complex perceptions. These include observing topographic and geological events and experiencing the forces of nature, such as water and ice, as well as their uncontrollable power represented by earthquakes and volcanoes.Hans Gercke: Der Berg, Heidelberger Kunstverein, Kehrer Verlag Heidelberg 2002, p. 528,529 His works are also influenced by issues related to Heimat and identity, digital revolution and poetry.Martin Zuska: Holger Walter/ √ºber das Geformt werden und Formen, Schloss Bruchsal, Staatliche Akademie Karlsruhe 1996 Having grown up in the same town as H√∂lderlin, his childhood experiences were similar to the poet's, sharing images and impressions. Many of his works can be considered a sort of dialogue with H√∂lderlin. Holger Walter works with resistant materials which he transforms through clear-cut radical interventions. Stone sculptures preserve their natural skin and crust, so that they look like sections hewn out of a bigger framework. He employs different types of stones from various regions around the world and sometimes even other materials such as glass and steel.Chantal Prod'Hom: Le verre vivant, MUDAC, La Biblioth√®que des Arts, Lausanne 2013, p.24 His creative output extends beyond sculpture and includes drawing and frottage whose essence is similar to that of his sculptures: soaring motifs break free from the ground thus bringing a poetic element into his work. A decisive attitude and a peculiar formal language are typical of all his artistic expressions.Kirsten Voigt: aussichtkunst,Skulpturen und Objekte auf dem Freiburger Schlossberg,modo Verlag Freiburg,2012,p.66-69 In recent years he has created drifting sculptures (1997‚Äì2002) in Japan / Germany and works exploring different themes such as tunnel, cave, section (2003‚Äì2008), excavations, hidden spaces (2009‚Äì2010), waves, currents, rhythms, ice age stones and inner dimension (since 2011).officialhttp://www.holger- walter-atelier.de/Englisch/index.html Approaches to H√∂lderlin's imagery In 2013 he exhibited the outcomes of his artistic dialogues with H√∂lderlin's poems and their common birthplace in Lauffen am Neckar at the Goethe-Institut Nancy, France. Through visual means he tries to connect with H√∂lderlin's poetry and pay tribute to his highest artistic achievements. In this connection, senses are essential to approach the poet's thought and imagery. In 2013 he created works inspired by fragments of H√∂lderlin's river poems, such as the enchained current and the rage of currents.

The village of Steinfeld was established in the 19th century. It was renamed to Stonefield in 1918 as many places with German or German-sounding names were changed around World War I. The name reverted to Steinfeld in 1986. The Steinfeld Lutheran congregation was established in 1882, and met in a home until it built its own building in 1890. The congregation met in this building until November 2016. A Lutheran school existed from the 1880s until 1917, when it was forcibly closed by the state government as a result of World War I. It was replaced by a public school in 1917, which operated until 1969.

Cytochrome c oxidase 5A is a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, also known as Complex IV, the last enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.  Structure  The COX5A gene, located on the q arm of chromosome 15 in position 24.1, is made up of 5 exons and is 17,880 base pairs in length. The COX5A protein weighs 17 kDa and is composed of 150 amino acids. The protein is a subunit of Complex IV, which consists of 13 mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits.  Function  Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is a multi-subunit enzyme complex that couples the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and contributes to a proton electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive ATP synthesis via protonmotive force. The mitochondrially-encoded subunits perform the electron transfer of proton pumping activities. The functions of the nuclear-encoded subunits are unknown but they may play a role in the regulation and assembly of the complex. Summary reaction: : 4 Fe2+-cytochrome c + 8 H+in \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 4 Fe3+-cytochrome c + 2 H2O + 4 H+out  Clinical significance  COX5A (this gene) and COX5B are involved in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism by Bcl-2. COX5A interacts specifically with Bcl-2, but not with other members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-xL, Bax or Bak.

Early life  Cheung grew up in a small town in South Carolina and earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Clemson University. She received a masters degree in Economics from the University of Rochester. While working on her PhD, a friend asked for programming help with his startup, so she left her PhD program to help him. When that didn't follow through, she moved to Silicon Valley. Cheung worked at Slide.com as a group project manager, overlooking multiple projects such as FunWall, SuperPoke!, and SuperPoke! Pets.  Homejoy  Cheung and her brother joined Y Combinator after she left Slide, Inc. Together they brainstormed several startup ideas, including Pathjoy, a platform to connect customers with life coaches and therapists, but soon abandoned the idea. Instead Cheung started to focus Pathjoy on finding house cleaners instead of therapists. The idea came when Cheung was looking for a cleaning service for her brother's apartment, but all offerings were either from expensive cleaning agencies or untested cleaners from Craigslist, and she decided that there needed to be an easier, cheaper way to provide home cleaning services. To further reinforce the company's new direction, the name Pathjoy was changed to Homejoy.

The club was bought out by Manchester United after settling down in Manchester following a series of relocations. The club had several mergers, creating a complicated overlapping history with Manchester Giants, the last of which de facto ended its existence in 1989 and reinstated the Giants. History =Stockport Belgrade= Stockport Belgrade were based at Peel Moat in Heaton Moor, they were created in 1975 and had, in Bill Beswick, one of the best coaches in the history of the sport in the UK. After finishing second in Division 2 that inaugural season, Coach Beswick led Belgrade to promotion in 1977, compiling an impressive 18‚Äì2 record in the process, the best in franchise history. Amongst their US players they had Bob Martin, one of the best shooting guards ever to play in the league who once scored 52 points in a losing game against ATS Giants. The next four years proved to be a period of consolidation for the team in the top division of British basketball with a first trip into Europe, in the Korac Cup, part of that learning curve. =Warrington Vikings= But by the 1981‚Äì82 season, the Stockport club took the decision to move away from their fan base to the new Spectrum Arena in Warrington. During the 1982‚Äì83 season, Coach Beswick left the club, replaced on an interim basis by Craig Lynch, who was still prominent in the Budweiser League in the late 1990s as coach of the Newcastle Eagles. But it was the arrival of Joe Whelton at the start of the following season that proved the turning point in the team's history. With players like Jeff Jones, Wil Brown, Ed Bona, Steve Latham, Phil Brazil, Paul Gervais, David Lloyd; an assistant on the 1997‚Äì98 team ‚Äì and Kevin Penny, the team finished third in the League and lost the Championship Final 70‚Äì64 to Solent. =Manchester United= Halfway through the following season, another major turning point occurred in the Vikings' eventful history when Manchester United F.C. bought the team. Coach Whelton also played a part in Manchester's sudden upturn in fortunes, making the shrewd signing of Colin Irish who was brilliant in the 1985 Championship Final win over Kingston, scoring 47 points in a 109‚Äì97 victory. Manchester United then took control of the other Manchester Club the Giants. Players of the calibre of Tom Brown and Dave Gardner, who started the 1998‚Äì99 season as an assistant to Coach Nurse, were added to the roster for the start of the 1985‚Äì86 season in which a club record 23 straight wins helped Manchester United recover from a shaky start to storm to the National League title and the professional era. =Merger with Manchester Giants= Manchester United wanted to develop the continental idea of sporting clubs and to set up a dominant basketball club. The United side failed to attract fans in large numbers and so, despite strong opposition from their fans, the Giants were \\"merged\\" with them. Two barren seasons followed the United title win and the United experiment having failed, the franchise was bought by a group of local businessmen in 1988, who changed the team name to the Manchester Eagles. Jeff Jones returned to coach the team, the start of a reign (1988‚Äì94) that would make him the longest-serving coaching in franchise history. Coach Jones finished fifth in his first season as well as taking the team to the National Cup Final where they lost 87‚Äì75 to Bracknell. A year later, he led Manchester to a second-placed finish in the League and the Final of the Trophy. On both occasions, the all-conquering Kingston team edged out Manchester. That 1989‚Äì90 team included memorable players such as Jason Fogerty, Tony Penny, Jerry Johnson, Dave Gardner, Kris Kearney, Keith Ramsey and Kevin St. Kitts ‚Äì the last four of whom are among the dozen players to have hit 1,000 career points for the franchise over the past 14 years. =Stockport Giants and Olympic City Giants= The supporters of the Giants set up Stockport Giants, an all English club, who played successfully for four years winning the English Central League, the North West Counties League before securing a place in the lower divisions of the National League, and reaching the National League cup quarter finals. Meanwhile, in an attempt to promote Manchester's Olympic bid a team called Olympic City Giants was formed but in 1989 after encountering several financial difficulties, the Olympic City Giants (as was their official name) formally merged with Manchester Eagles to become Manchester Giants, marking a return of the famous name after a three-year absence, following a merger between the original Manchester Giants and Manchester United in 1986.

After NABWMT was founded in May 1980, Boston became one of the early adopter cities to create a chapter within the year along with New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Memphis, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, and Milwaukee.Black & White Men Together: Milwaukee Chapterurl=http://www.mkelgbthist.org/organiz/social/bwmt.htmwebsite=Wisconsin GLBT History Project Naming the Chapter In December 1987 the group elected to change the name of their chapter from Black and White Men Together, to Men of All Colors Together. After having originally chosen the name for the shock value the name began to become less reflect of their mission. They felt that the BWMT name was not inclusive enough and may discourage men of other races from joining. Nor did the name challenge discriminatory norms of society other than black-white racism. They arrived at the conclusion that MACT embodied their organizations main focus of encouraging interactions between all races and fighting discrimination and homophobia in all forms. By this time chapters in New York, Connecticut, and Cincinnati had already adopted the MACT name. Other NABWMT chapters also chose to change their name adopting People of All Colors Together or PACT. Goals and impact The Boston chapter of MACT engaged in activities, both internally and within the community at large, that aimed to promote racial equality in the LGBT community and to aid the LGBT community as a whole. In 1989 the chapter began to publish their aims in their newsletters; they were: * To offer an opportunity for socializing between gay men of all colors and an atmosphere which is conducive to forming friendships and which provides support for ongoing relationships * To encourage the examination of our personal feelings regarding race and to provide a supportive forum for exploring them together. * To actively engage in the struggle for racial understanding in Boston and the New England area, especially in the gay community.Men of All Colors Together News Letter, Vol. 8 No. 7, 1989 Men of All Colors Together Boston Records (M 68) University Libraries Archives and Special Collections Department Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts Box 3, folder 9 MACT Boston established an \\"AIDing Task Force\\" in order to educate on and combat the AIDS epidemic affecting the gay community. The task force was led by Boston MACT member Tom Ferrick. Their efforts included entering a wide variety of medical pamphlets into their newsletters, inviting members of the medical community to come and speak in open forums, and outreach to help inform the LGBT community about HIV/AID transmission on and stem the stigmatized association between the disease and the LGBT community. They were particularly active in their educational programs within the African American community as well. Social & Community The members of MACT created several traditional social events that allowed members to gather outside the formalities of meetings. These included educational, cultural, and political activities ranging from annual holiday parties for Halloween and Christmas, to community outreach programs in which they would hand out flyers informing the public about the LGBT lifestyle. In attempts to foster a sense of community amongst its members MACT frequently engaged in excursions designed to allot time for members to bond. Activities often included engaging in the culture of Boston with trips to restaurants, movies, and museums. MCAT focused on adding racial harmony to the LGBT community at large. \\"To attain these ends, its local chapters organized social gatherings and engage in educational, cultural, and political activities. NABWMT's goals consist of two major themes: combating racism within the LGBT community and combating homophobia in general society.\\" Conventions NABWMT holds a convention annually in which all chapters are invited to attend and discuss the years events and engage in seminars that aim to help improve the effectiveness of the individual chapters. The eighth annual NABWT convention was held in the City of Boston in July 1988 at the Park Plaza Hotel. The Boston chapter created the symbol for the convention of two pandas holding hands. The convention was attended by 23 NABWT chapters from across the country.

The Jayatu Sanskritam movement begin in 1947 AD(BS 2004), started by students of the Tin Dhara Pakshala Sanskrit School in Nepal. They demanded democracy, basic welfare, and the inclusion of modern subjects in their curriculum. It was the first student uprising in Nepal's history, and led to the Revolution of 1951 and the fall of the Rana dynasty. Started by students of the Tin Dhara Pakshala hostel, and later also included students at a Rajkiya Sanskrit Vidyalaya school near the Ranipokhari; the protests centred around restrictions on education, as the only subject allowed in the Sanskrit schools was the study of Sanskrit. This contrasted with the wider educational opportunities and higher status of students related to the ruling Rana clan. The protestors became known for the slogan they would call, jayatu Sanskritam (\\"victory to the cause of Sanskrit\\"). On 1 June 1947, the students submitted a written demand to Prime Minister Padma Shumsher requesting courses in geography, history, economics and political science. When the government ignored their demands, the students went on strike. The students continued to agitate for educational and social equality, including waving anti-Rana flags in protest. The strike lasted until 15 June, when the government agreed to expand the curriculum offered to the students. Although the protests were placated by promises from Prime Minister Padma Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana, his military commander-in-chief Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana ordered arrests and imprisonments, and forcefully deported forty-two students, who were identified as leaders of the movement. From India, many of these exiles joined Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala and others agitating for the establishment of democracy in Nepal, which led to the 1951 revolution and the overthrow of the regime. Leaders of the movement Ram Prasad Neupane was born in the Ramechhap District of Nepal. He studied Sanskrit in Sanskrit Pradhan, Paathsaala, Ranipokhari and stayed at the Tin Dhara Paakshala hostel in Durbar Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal.

She lives in Berlin, Germany. She was said to be the only international top model from Afghanistan in 2014.  Biography  = Early years = Esmaeli was born and raised in Kabul as the youngest of seven children. Her mother, who was her father's second wife, died in a traffic accident when she was two years old. She was raised by her dad's first wife and has four brothers and two sisters. Like her sisters, as a girl, she could not attend a public school, but after pleading with her father he agreed to her being home schooled by private tutors. = Escape from Afghanistan = When Esmaeli was thirteen years old, her parents sold all their belongings and decided to leave Afghanistan to escape from the war and the Taliban regime. Her father left Kabul with three of his children and his second wife on the load bed of a truck. They paid a Russian people smuggling gang to bring them to Germany to join her brothers who already lived there. Their difficult and 10000 km long journey took six months, via Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic, but in 1999, they finally crossed the border to Bavaria. During the dangerous journey with long wintry walks through woods, and rides hidden in train waggons and car boots, Zohre Esmaili nearly drowned crossing a border river in Slovakia. The family were imprisoned for several days in the Ukraine where Esmaili became seriously ill due to malnutrition and bad hygienic conditions. After arriving in Germany, the family first stayed in three asylum seekers' hostels in Darmstadt, Schwalbach, and Calden, before moving to their own flat in Vellmar near Kassel. = Life in Germany = Zohre Esmaeli presenting Afghan fashion at the fashion show \\"Afghanische Nacht\\" in Bad Kreuznach on 5 November 2011 in support of the charity Afghanistan - Hilfe die ankommt (photo: S.Herler) Zohre Esmaeli attended a comprehensive school and after an internship she wanted to pursue the career of an airplane electronics engineer. Her school years were difficult for her as she and her brother were the only foreigners in the class at her first school and also after moving to Vellmar she was bullied at her school in Ahnatal. Although now staying in Germany, her father and older brothers insisted on her living according to the Afghan tradition and had chosen a husband for her to marry. In order to escape from the family pressures and live according to her own wishes Zohre Esmaeli left at age 17 her family in spring of 2003 and moved into a children's home. After 12 days she ran away and went into hiding in Zuffenhausen near Stuttgart living with the family of her then boyfriend. During her first year living there she did not have any contact with her family. Later Esmaeli established again a normal relationship with her father although she does not discuss her work at home. Esmaeli speaks four languages, Dari (her mother tongue), Persian, English, and German. During three weeks in July 2013 a 4x5 meter large picture of Esmaeli could be seen by S-Bahn travellers in D√ºsseldorf on an empty windowless house wall which was painted by airbrush artist Andi Ponto. It was a birthday present of her boyfriend who lived in a house opposite of the wall. By order of the house owner the painting had to be whited out by the artist. Her brother, Abdul Gharfour Esmaeli, is a cruiserweight boxer who started his professional career at the Internationale Box-Gala in Kassel in November 2012.  Career  When Zohre Esmaeli was 16 years old the then current Miss Hessen approached her during a shopping trip in a H&M; store in Kassel and asked if she was a model and wanted to have photos taken. She agreed and two days later she went to a model agency and started to do secret shootings without telling her parents. Her first shooting took place in Frankfurt. This, however, soon came to an end when her family found out and forbade her to continue. About a year after she had left her family and moved to Stuttgart she resumed her modeling career. Her first big clients were the furniture manufacturer Bretz who made her the centre of a large advertising campaign from 2003 until 2007 and the German designer Manfred Bogner who featured her from 2007 in many adverts for his fashion line BONNIEBONNIE advert which were published in magazines like Vogue. Soon she appeared in other fashion and lifestyle journals as Elle, Cosmopolitan, Madame, Zink, Lounge, InStyle and Marie Claire.

Fessler combines the voices of the women with footage from educational films and newsreels about dating, sex, ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù pregnancy and adoption. The women's stories unfold over footage of life in post-World War II America. Educational films offer guidance about dating and sex, and scripted newsreels shed light on adoption in an era when secrecy prevailed and adoptable babies were thought to be ‚Äúunwanted‚Äù by their mothers. As the footage illuminates the past, the women's stories form a collective narrative as they recount their experiences of dating, pregnancy, family reaction, banishment, and the long-term impact of surrender and silence on their lives.  Production  Fessler, a documentary filmmaker, installation artist, and author, began working with the subject of adoption in 1989 after being approached by a woman who thought Ann was the daughter she had relinquished 40 years earlier. Though the woman was not her mother, Fessler, an adoptee, was deeply moved by the woman's story. She subsequently produced several autobiographical installations on adoption; two featured her previous short films Cliff & Hazel about her adoptive family, and Along the Pale Blue River (2001/2013) about her search for a yearbook picture of her mother. At each installation site, Fessler invited audience members to write and post their own adoption stories and based on the anonymous stories left behind by first mothers, she initiated an oral history project to collect the women's stories. In 2002, Fessler began interviewing women who lost children to adoption between 1945-1973, when an unprecedented 1.5 million babies were surrendered under tremendous social pressure. In 2003 she was awarded a Radcliffe Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to continue her academic research, interviews, and archival footage research. A Girl Like Her ultimately took 10 years to complete. While at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard, Fessler also began writing a non-fiction book based on her research and the oral histories she was collecting. By 2005 she had collected 100 stories from women living in every region of the United States. The Girls Who Went Away: the Hidden History of WomenWho Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

Keeney (born July 2, 1937) is an American scientist in soil science and water chemistry. He was the first director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture in Ames, Iowa. Early life and education Keeney grew up on his family's dairy farm near Runnells, Iowa not far from Des Moines. He graduated from Iowa State University (ISU) with a B.S. in agronomy. He studied soil science at University of Wisconsin and obtained an M.S., followed by a Ph.D. in agronomy and biochemistry from Iowa State University. Career Keeney became a professor of agronomy, and stayed on as faculty member in soils and water chemistry for more than 20 years. In 1987, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture was established at ISU, and in 1988 he became its first director. The Leopold Center developed research studies and teaching about the environmental impacts of farming, sustainable agriculture, preservation of natural resources, including soil and water quality, and rural community development. Keeney defined sustainable agriculture as > \\"It means using the resources we have wisely. Probably number one to > conserve the soil resource, the water resource, and the land resource. It's > a Leopold concept really, because Leopold talked about land as the water, > the air, the soil, and the animals living on it.\\" Already in 1988 Keeney examined the energy balance of ethanol fuel as a \\"renewable\\" fuel and concluded, that more energy was required to produce ethanol than was retrieved from it then.

Early life and education  Helen Brewster Owens was born April 2, 1881 in Pleasanton, Kansas to Clara (n√©e Linton) and Robert Edward Brewster. Her mother, who was a teacher and president of the Lincoln County Women's Suffrage Association, prompted Brewster's interest in the movement from a young age. As a girl, she attended the 1893 County Fair with her mother where she helped distribute flyers of Frances Willard. Brewster Owens received a B.A. degree in mathematics from the University of Kansas in 1900 and her master's degree one year later from the same institution. Her master's thesis was titled \\"Collineations of Space which Leave Invariant a Quadric Surface,\\" and it built off of the work of Ruth G. Wood, a groundbreaking woman in mathematics in her own right. She continued her graduate studies at the University of Chicago, but she and her family moved to Ithaca, New York before she could complete a PhD. She finally received her doctorate in mathematics in 1910 at the age of 29 from Cornell University, advised by Virgil Snyder.  Mathematical career  Brewster Owens taught math at the University Preparatory School in Ithaca, New York from 1910 to 1912. In 1914, she was hired as an assistant professor of mathematics at Wells College in Aurora, New York. Next, she served as a mathematics instructor at Cornell University from 1917‚Äì1920. After several more interruptions to her profession due to moves for her husband's career, she reached the next stepping stone in her career when she was appointed an associate editor of the American Mathematical Monthly. In 1936, Brewster Owens began a major research project on the history of women in mathematics. From 1941‚Äì1949, she taught at Penn State University as an assistant professor.  Suffrage activism  Brewster Owens kept up her suffrage career from that first visit to the 1893 County Fair with her mother throughout her life. In 1910, she was elected to the board of the Resolutions Committee of the New York State Woman Suffrage Association. In 1911, she returned to Kansas for a spell to continue the fight for suffrage there. Soon after, Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman's Suffrage Association asked Brewster Owens to return to Kansas as her personal representative. Working there throughout 1912, Brewster Owens bore witness to the state's ratification of the suffrage amendment - by 16,000 votes, the greatest majority of any state up until that point. She then returned to New York to fight for suffrage there. Personal life Brewster Owens married her classmate, Frederick William Owens, in 1904. She gave birth to her first daughter, Helen, upon their move to Chicago one year later.

Early life Born August 21, 1905 in New York City, Helen Meriwether Lewis Thomas is the daughter of Helen Burdick Lewis and Charles Hengry Lewis Jr. She attended the St. Catherine's School in Westhampton, Richmond, Virginia through 1924 before attending Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At Radcliffe, she studied astronomy and government and graduated cum laude from Radcliffe 1928. While studying at Radcliffe, she began working part-time at the Harvard Observatory under Dr. Willem Luyten. Luyten's major field of research was devoted to the discovery of white dwarf stars. Her graduate studies began in 1937 at Harvard University in the department of History of Science. Her dissertation was entitled, The Early History of Variable Star Observing to the 19th Century. Career Lewis was employed at Harvard's Radio Research Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory during World War II.

Biography  Bernardino was born in El Seibo in 1907 to an \\"unusually liberal\\" family. She was orphaned at age 15 and moved to Santo Domingo, where she finished secondary school as part of a new generation of Normalistas‚ÄîLatin American women pursuing education beyond primary school‚Äîand began a career in the Dominican Republic's civil service. Bernardino's attention was drawn to issues of inequality and women's rights when she received a promotion within the civil service but no increase in pay because the government refused to pay any woman more than it paid her male co-workers. In her autobiography, she says \\"fue √©ste el impacto que me lanz√≥ a la lucha por los derechos de la mujer.\\" This background in the civil service which launched Bernardino's fight for women's rights distinguishes her from many of the feminists of her time: she was not a member of the elite or professional class, but a single woman who had worked part-time jobs, and would continue to work similar jobs even as she became more involved in activism and diplomacy. In the early 1930s Bernardino struggled with the ascendant dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, retreating for a short period to the United States to work with the Inter- American Commission of Women with who she had become familiar during her work as representative to the 1927 meeting of the Pan American Union in Montevideo. However, by late-decade she returned to the country in order to pressure the solidifying regime to grant suffrage to women which it ultimately did in 1942. One of the key public moves toward women's rights made by the regime occurred when the regime granted an invitation to the suffragist Doris Stevens, with whom Bernardino was close, to visit the country in 1938 and speak to the Senate. Bernardino continued to work with the dictatorship through its demise in 1961. She similarly supported the 12-years of continuismo of his successor Joaqu√≠n Balaguer. In her advocacy for women's rights, Bernardino was admired for her bravery and honesty, often pioneering women's rights not only in official documents, but also in her everyday interactions. Kathleen Tesch highlights these traits in an anecdote included in Akmaral Arystanbekova's article \\"Diplomacy: Too important to be left to men?\\": > Once, the person presiding a General Assembly session addressed the women > delegates as 'Dear Ladies', instead of 'Distinguished Delegates'. Before he > could finish what he was saying, Ms. Bernardino had asked for the floor on a > procedural motion. 'You can call us ladies when you offer us a cup of coffee > or tea, or ask us out to lunch; here, in this room, we are not ladies, we > are delegates, and should be addressed accordingly.' At the end of her life, Bernardino reflected on her fight for the rights of women with some satisfaction, but admitted to having wanted more change more rapidly: \\"Fue una √©poca, que parece que no se va repetir. Pero me siento contenta, porque se avanz√≥ bastante; sembr√© buena semilla, y ha ido dando sus frutos, aunque no con la celeridad que me hubiera gustado.\\"  Key ideas and contributions  Bernardino worked mainly to advance political rights, and especially to improve women's suffrage in Latin American states. Her achievements include the 1954 Convention on the Political Rights of Women, which asserted women's rights to vote, run for office and hold office. Bernardino also supported international law that would ensure the equality of women in marriage and divorce, such as the Montevideo Convention on the Nationality of Married Women of 1933. Of all her contributions, Bernardino is best known for arguing in favor of gender-inclusive language in the early stages of the UN's development. At the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, although she was technically a delegate of the Dominican Republic‚Äîsent by dictator Rafael Trujillo as a \\"low-risk opportunity to appear progressive\\"‚ÄîBernardino entered the conference with her own agenda, representing the interests of the Inter-American Commission of Women (IACW). Bernardino and her colleague Berta Lutz were acknowledged as \\"instrumental\\" in the inclusion of the phrases \\"equal rights of men and women,\\" \\"faith in fundamental human rights\\" and \\"the dignity and worth of the human person\\" in the preamble to the UN's charter. She is also credited with the wording \\"equal rights of men and women\\" in the preamble for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights‚Äîshe believed that omitting \\"and women\\" would have seemed intentional and invited discrimination. Bernardino was also involved in creating and later chairing the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which was established in 1946. Although subordinate to the Commission on Human Rights, the CSW was known for exercising independence and initiative. This commission's accomplishments include the gender-inclusive language in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the creation of the 1967 Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Commission also promoted women's rights through studies of the treatment of women, and used their findings to call for more change.  Positions  Bernardino began her fight for women's rights as one of the leaders of Acci√≥n Feminista, an organization she became involved in while she was still living in the Dominican Republic. In 1935, she moved to Washington D.C. to work for the IACW. She maintained connections with Dominican Republic stayed away for several years because of her initial opposition to Trujillo's dictatorship. By the 1940s, she was serving as the nation's official representative to the IACW, becoming vice chair and then chair of the commission. She attended conferences as a representative of the Dominican Republic, including the 1945 San Francisco Conference, where she signed the original charter for the United Nations. As her career progressed, Bernardino continued to work at the UN in many different capacities. Not only did she participate in fifteen General Assemblies as the Dominican Republic's permanent representative (appointed in 1950), she also held many different leadership positions within the organization. She was elected vice president of the Commission of the Status of Women in 1951 and president of the commission 1953. She was also the first vice president of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the first vice president of UNICEF. Later, Bernardino extended the scope of her work to include giving lectures at universities, writing a biographical archive of influential American women, and creating the Fundaci√≥n Bernardino which would continue the fight for women's rights in the Dominican Republic after her death.

She was known for expanding access to nature for New York City's public school children. Northrop traveled extensively to regions of the world where women did not usually venture, including Central America, the Caribbean, and Western North America. On a trip to the Bahamas, she and her husband, John Isaiah Northrop, discovered 18 new species. Her husband was killed in a laboratory accident in 1891, a week before their son was born. Northrop became a professor of botany at Hunter College. Many of her students went on to teach in New York City public schools and reported to her that their students had very little access to nature. Northrop labored to increase education about the natural world, including installing terrariums and preserved plants in classrooms across the city. One lasting legacy of Northrop's life's work is the Alice Rich Northrop Memorial Camp in the Berkshire Mountains, which was established to allow children from the city to spend two weeks at a time on the farm. The first group of children came in 1923, and the camp continues to host school groups each summer. Her son, John Howard Northrop, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946.

It is a small tree or shrub growing in arid areas, often in creek beds and shallow depressions. Description Melaleuca glomerata is an erect, spreading small tree or shrub growing to with spreading or straggly branches and white, papery bark. The leaves are mostly linear, tapering to a point, flat, long and wide. They are also grey-green and slightly hairy to very densely covered with flattened hairs. As with many other melaleucas, the bark is white and papery. Desert honey-myrtle flowers profusely in dense white to yellow heads in leaf axils and at the ends of branches. There are five groups of stamens arranged around the flower, each containing four to nine stamens. Flowering occurs in late spring to early summer but can occur at other times in its natural habitat. The fruit are about in diameter and clustered. M. glomerata habit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca glomerata was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller in \\"Report on the Plants Collected During Mr. Babbage's Expedition into the North West Interior of South Australia in 1858\\". The specific epithet (glomerata) is from the Latin glomeratus, meaning \\"collected into a head\\", referring to the clustered fruit. Distribution and habitat Desert tea-tree occurs in the arid parts of Australia including the far north west of New South Wales, South Australia including the Flinders Ranges, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. In the latter state it has been recorded from the Carnarvon, Central Kimberley, Central Ranges, Dampierland, Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Murchison, Ord Victoria Plain, Pilbara and Tanami biogeographic areas. It grows in red sand, clay and sandy loam in rocky river beds, shallow depressions and sandy flats. Conservation status Melaleuca globifera is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This melaleuca is a hardy and adaptable shrub or tree in cultivation. It can be grown in most areas of Australia, from dry to temperate and in most soil types, including those that are moderately saline. It has been used as a street tree in Port Augusta.

It is known for having had the first South Asian vicar of any Church of England parish, Shapurji Edalji, and for its association with Edalji's son George, who was falsely convicted on a charge of injuring a pony, and cleared after the intervention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  History  The stone church, in early English style, its vicarage and an adjacent school were built in 1845 to designs by the architect Thomas Johnson of Lichfield and consecrated on Tuesday 22 July 1845 by John Lonsdale, Bishop of Lichfield. The church's early baptism, marriage and burial registers are held by Staffordshire Records Office, the Bishops' transcripts at Lichfield Records Office. = The Edaljis = Shapurji Edalji was given the 'living' as vicar of St Mark's by Lonsdale's successor George Selwyn. Edalji obtained the position though the previous incumbent, his wife's uncle, who arranged it as a wedding present.

Michael Risinger Edalji moved into the vicarage, a large house with its own grounds, in late 1875; George, the first child, was born there soon after. The Reverend Edaji was more assertive than his predecessor and was sometimes involved in controversy about parish business. Edalji senior died at the vicarage in 1918 and is buried in the churchyard.  Current activity  The church and its neighbour, the parish's other CoE church, St Andrew's, Landywood are managed in tandem. There is a church hall adjacent to the church. As of March 2015 the vicar is the Revd. Graham Horner. Organ The church has a pipe organ by Nicholson dating from 2000, an earlier organ having been damaged by fire.

A complex arrangement, parts of the Manor House date to the 16th century, but they were extended with the addition of the Georgian Rhodes House and later Gothic-Revival work. It was a private residence until the 20th century, and is now divided into commercial properties and residential apartments. The house was owned by a number of families and individuals, including local banker and businessman Benjamin Handley and Sophia Peacock, whose nephews, Cecil and Frank Rhodes, spent their summers at the estate as children. The building is divided into two plots: The Manor House (No. 31) and Rhodes House (No. 33). The former is a complex of buildings, mostly in stone. It is accessed through a cobbled courtyard, with a 19th-century Gothic west front, including a small tower; part of the north side of the yard is a 17th-century gabled building. The brick-built Rhodes House faces directly onto the street. Described by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris as \\"a jigsaw puzzle\\", the Manor House is notable for its re-use of medieval masonry, some dating 14th century and others likely being removed from Sleaford Castle. In 1949, it was recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, recognising it as \\"particularly important ... of more than special interest.\\"\\"Listed Buildings\\", Historic England. Retrieved 18 February 2015.  History  = Origins = The origins of the Manor House and its early history have not been fully studied. In 1872, Edward Trollope mentioned it in his history of Sleaford, writing that \\"all its details are not honestly known\\". English Heritage and the architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris date parts of No. 31 to the 17th century and categorise most of No. 33 as mid-18th century and \\"mid-Georgian\\" respectively; however, local historian Dr Simon Pawley, states that No. 33 is 19th century. An estate map of 1766 shows that the plot was not part of the open field system around Sleaford., figure 5. The map was drawn by W. Fillingham for Lord Bristol. A more detailed map, dated to c. 1770, has a building on a plot owned by Robert Banks, corresponding to the location of Rhodes House.This is the \\"Cragg Map\\" from the Lincolnshire Archives Office, catalogued as 2 Cragg 2/2/65. An extract is printed in , and a digital scan is available in , figure 6. An enclosure map completed in 1794 shows a small building at the site, set back slightly from the road and adjoined by a larger one to the north, which faced onto the street; the location and layout also correspond closely to the arrangement of the older parts of Nos. 31 and 33.. The map belongs to the Suffolk Record Office, Bury St Edmund's Branch, and is catalogued as HA 507/3/208. = Nineteenth century = By the 19th century, the house was occupied by the banker, businessman and solicitor Benjamin Handley (1754‚Äì1828).The Lincolnshire Magazine. 2. 1934 (Lindsey Local History Society). p. 81 He was Treasurer of the Sleaford Navigation and solicitor to the enclosure commission for Sleaford and several fenland villages, through which service he \\"amassed a great fortune\\".\\"Benjamin Handley\\", Sleaford Navigation Trust. Retrieved 24 March 2015. It is not clear when ownership of the house changed, but Maurice Peter Moore (1809‚Äì1866), clerk of the peace for Kesteven, lived there from at least 1851 until his death. The son of Rev. Dr William Moore, vicar of Spalding, he was admitted as a solicitor in 1831. Moore was living in Sleaford by 1834, when he is recorded as owning as property on North Street, and was in partnership with William Forbes by 1841.The Register of Voters for the Parts of Kesteven in the County of Lincoln, 1834, p. 19 Moore married Ann Gardiner Peacock in 1834. Their first daughter, Florence, died an infant in 1838 and Ann Moore died giving birth to their only surviving child, Anne Louisa Russell (known as Russell), in 1839. Moore considered disinheriting his daughter, writing that \\"Russell's conduct towards me continues to be cold and heartless ... and I must look on her as not deserving to inherit from me\\". Sophia Peacock, a sister of his wife, was closely involved in Russell's up-bringing and Moore developed romantic feelings for her; in 1858, he changed his will to give her his property instead of Russell, but Sophia rejected his marriage proposal and he disinherited her the following year. Despite Moore's \\"vehement objections\\", his daughter married George Edward Corrance in 1860. After a year she eloped with Colonel Edward William de Lancy Lowe; they married in 1866, after Corrance divorced her on grounds of adultery. Her father \\"had always reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct\\" and, three months before his death, he made a new will and bequeathed all of his property to Peacock. After Moore's death, Russell Lowe and her paternal uncle, Rev. Edward Moore opened a court case to contest the will. In March 1868, the courts found that the will was legal. Sophia Peacock inherited nearly all of Moore's estate. Sophia and Ann Gardiner Peacock's father, Anthony Taylor Peacock of South Kyme, was a wealthy banker and his father, Anthony Peacock, was a land-owner, who had worked closely with Benjamin Handley as a sponsor of the Sleaford Navigation and commissioner of enclosures in the 1790s. Among the younger Peacock's other daughters was Louisa, who married Rev. Francis William Rhodes in 1844. Louisa and Francis Rhodes's nine children included Cecil Rhodes and Frank Rhodes; they spent their childhood summers with their aunt Sophia at the Manor House in Sleaford and in the Channel Islands. Frank and Cecil learnt to ride at the Manor and it was during these visits to Sleaford that Cecil began his long friendship with Robert Yerburgh, a son of the town's vicar. On Sophia Peacock's death in 1892,National Probate Calendar, 1893, p. 111 Frank Rhodes inherited the Manor House. He was still living there in 1897. = Later history = In 1897, Elizabeth Cross rented the Manor House from Rhodes, remaining there until her death in 1923.

John Edward Cross (1821‚àí1897), a prebendary of Lincoln.Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer. 19 October 1923. p. 9 and She purchased \\"ancient buildings\\" around Lincolnshire so that their old stonework could be incorporated into the house. It was put up for sale in 1924 and James Gordon Jeudwine and his wife were resident at the house the following year. Jeudwine was a son of Canon George Wynne Jeudwine; a solicitor, he became a partner in the firm Peake, Snow and Peake in 1937, the same year that he was appointed Clerk to the Justices of the Sleaford petty sessional division. He lived at the house until his death from injuries received in a car accident in 1941.\\"Jeudwine, James Gordon of The Manor and 5 Market-street both in Sleaford Lincolnshire\\", Calendar of the Grants of Probate and Letters of Administration made in the Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice in England, 1942, p. 587 The buildings were divided so that the old Manor House became No. 31 and the 18th century part became No. 33 (known as Rhodes House). By the 1960s, ownership had changed hands again: the Manor House was sold by C. B. Cliff to H. A. Mills of Newark in 1967.Lincolnshire Life, vol. 7, No. 10, December 1967, p. 5 Mills became headmaster of the William Alvey School in Sleaford. In the 1970s, the owner of No. 31, R. W. Edgely, submitted an application for planning permission to demolish the stables at No. 31 and build a house to its rear; Mills, along with Sleaford and District Civic Trust opposed the plans.\\"Storm brewing over threat to old stables\\".

As of 2015, the building is divided into residential apartments.  Architecture  Rhodes House The Manor House is a complicated group of buildings. Its earliest part dates from the 16th century, although it is built with stone-work from two centuries earlier. No. 31 is largely 19th century, incorporating older buildings and inset with medieval elements. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner summarised that \\"it is hard to discriminate between what is genuine and what is 19th century fancy\\". No. 33 is mid- Georgian. No. 31 is accessed through two 18th century gate-piers adorned with pineapple finials which open onto a cobbled courtyard in front of the house. The western fa√ßade is 19th century and stone; a single-storey, it incorporates a tower, in the centre of which is a 14th-century door, beneath a small pointed window. The rear contains a blend of medieval features, including a 14th-century head of a king, set into a chimney. The north side of the courtyard contains a projected square bay dated to 1637 and incorporates an octagonal 14th century chimney piece, reckoned to have belonged to the Old Deanery in Lincoln. This joins to an 18th-century brick section, which is connected to the right with a 17th-century crow-stepped gabled stone house. A stone wall attached to that section is inset by a blocked door, the base of which forms a dog's drinking fountain. The doorway, along with some of the other imported stonework, was probably taken from the decaying Sleaford Castle, now ruined. The interior includes a room dated to the early 17th century, with panelling and Tudor Revival motifs. Rhodes House, No. 33, dates to the mid-18th century. A three-storey brick building with five bays and a classical stone door-case, with Doric columns and an entablature. To the north is a two-storey mid-19th century extension, also in brick, and an adjoining former garden wall. The rear has seven bays and two projecting wings, dating to the 18th century. Internally, one room has 17th century panelling of a Tudor design.

The third limited series entitled Orphan Black: Deviations was announced on December 20, 2016 and contains six issues, starting with a 40-page premiere issued in March 2017. The series is part of IDW's \\"Deviations\\" series, which focuses on reinventing familiar stories by changing a significant event within their mythology. Orphan Black: Deviations explores an alternate story line where Sarah prevents Beth's suicide and does not subsequently take over her identity, as the first episode of the television series portrays. Heli Kennedy and Wayne Nichols resumed their creative roles from the second series, serving as author and artist, respectively. Publication history The first issue of the series was released on February 25, 2015.

It contains six issues written by Heli Kennedy and illustrated by Wayne Nichols. Issue #1  Released March 29th 2017. The train arrives 5 minutes early and Sarah is able to pull Beth away from the train tracks. Beth flees to Alison and Cosima, telling them her suspicions of Paul being a monitor while trying to hold it together for when Katja arrives; and promises Alison equipment to watch Donnie's actions. Sarah and Felix follow Beth for a few days, seeing Beth & Alison practice shooting together and assuming triplets. They witness Art following Beth as they break into her apartment and learn Beth is a cop. Sarah has sex with Paul to distract him, making him suspicious and call Oliver. Vic harasses Felix for the cocaine. Sarah considers and decides against visiting Siobhan and Kira, while MK follows and then captures her. Sarah wakes up in MK\\"s trailer with her and Beth. MK reveals the reason she is in Canada is to hunt down the people that helped execute her friends from Helsinki; including the British clone Rachel Duncan. Believing the punk look to be Rachel in disguise, MK prepares to torture Sarah. Issue #2  Released April 26th 2017. Sarah is able to stop MK by saying she has a daughter. Unsure of her story and demanding genetic proof, Beth forcibly takes Sarah to Felix's along with Alison and Cosima. Revealing the nature of the clones, Beth still hides MK's existence from the others but tells them of the lead on Rachel Duncan of the Dyad Institute. Felix and Beth-as-Sarah take a medical swab from Kira but are caught by Mrs. S who bans \\"Sarah\\" from seeing Kira. Alison is forced to harbor Sarah in her craft room; Donnie sees Sarah but doesn't notice the difference, furthering Alison's suspicions. MK further researches the bots, telling Beth of the clone killer Ferdinand. Beth theorizes he and Rachel are lovers; MK wonders if Ferdinand would come running for Rachel. Beth begins snorting the cocaine. Katja arrives the next day and is spotted by Vic who thinks she is Sarah and demands the cocaine. Katja flees and is picked up by Beth, who hits Vic with her car. Beth and Katja are chased by a motorcyclist; Helena. Issue #3  Released July 12th 2017. MK directs Beth and Katja to a wooded area and shoots the motorcyclist with arrows. Beth has a shot but sees Maggie instead, giving Helena the chance to flee. Katja and MK reunite as survivors of Helsinki but Katja promises not to reveal MK. Katja tells the rest of the clones that her friends died in 2001. The clones initially suspect the motorcyclist and Helsinki murders are the same killer, possibly Vic; though Sarah says he is too stupid for that. Beth leaves Katja with MK and goes to the shipyard where Helena is staying but is caught by Art. Tomas repairs Helena and sends her out again to kill the others. Beth missed her hearing about the Maggie Chen shooting and sneaks away from Art to go on a five day bender, ignoring the clones. Still captive at Alison's, Sarah sees a bunch of lab technicians sneak into the house, making Alison fear Donnie is in on it. Cosima researches Katja's samples with Scott and while distracted by a call from Alison, misses Delphine's initial bait to introduce herself. Cosima instead looks towards Leekie and Neolution. Beth is knocked out by Detective Duko and wakes up in BrightBorn with Evie Cho. Issue #4  Released August 30th 2017.

To get freedom from Alison, Sarah goes to Beth's apartment to let Alison have the hidden camera to spy on Donnie. She and Felix go to Mrs. S's house where S agrees to let Sarah walk Kira home from school. Paul and Helena both follow and realize it isn't Beth. Delphine sleeps with and betrays Cosima, giving the full list of clone names to Leekie, including Rachel and Kira. Rachel demands the child be brought in as an anomaly. Evie Cho intends to implant Beth with a maggot-bot but is stopped by Leekie. Leekie tells Beth to lure Sarah and her daughter into a trap or Dyad will use the other sisters and may harm them. Beth returns to MK and Katja. While Beth is showing Cosima the video of the man killed by the maggot-bot; MK is shocked Beth told them about Rachel, fearing Helsinki will repeat. Evie Cho has her own plans to get to the Ledas and has Vic captured by Frank and Roxie while on his way to Felix's apartment; implanting Vic with a maggot-bot to make him comply.

MK hacks into Ferdinand's phone and poses as a seductive Rachel to lure him out. Issue #5  Released October 11th 2017. Sarah and Alison use the camera to see Donnie sneak away at night; but on the day of the potluck an intoxicated Beth prevents Alison from confronting Donnie. Beth tries to warn Sarah but once she sees the footage of Sarah having sex with Paul she wants to fight her, with Felix caught in the middle. While the potluck goes on Felix is pulled in as a bartender and Alison shoves Donnie down the stairs in anger. Meanwhile, Cosima realizes Delphine works with Leekie but doesn't confront her, instead secretly flying to Toronto to join the others. Vic crashes the potluck demanding Sarah and Kira come with him to the people that put an implant on his cheek; but Paul shows up. In the struggle, Paul unintentionally hits the Maggot-Bot in Vic's cheek which kills him in front of Sarah, Alison, Beth, Paul, Donnie and Felix. As Alison goes to talk with Donnie, and Paul offers to cover up Vic's death: he says he doesn't know why he was paid to monitor Beth. Helena is watching the house from afar, proud that she is being led to the sheep. MK lures Ferdinand to Toronto, but he gets suspicious and calls the real Rachel before he is in range of MK's bomb.

Issue #6  Released December 20th 2017.

Helena attacks Beth again, but MK saves her and agrees to help. Delphine apologizes to Cosima and helps her escape with Kira; running into MK. While Rachel meets with \\"Sarah\\" and \\"Beth;\\" \\"Beth\\" threatens to shoot them both if Kira isn't given to her. With Kira already gone, \\"Sarah\\" is able to distract Rachel by saying Susan Duncan is alive at BrightBorn. Donnie meets with Leekie in anger, accidentally crashing the car and killing Leekie. Rachel meets with Ferdinand at her office and they see a present near the desk. Helena waits on the roof with a rifle, watching as Delphine, Cosima and Kira run out to Felix, Siobhan and Katja. MK's bomb destroys part of the building, killing Rachel and Ferdinand. As MK slips away Sarah and Beth run outside. Helena gets revenge for Maggie by shooting the one who looks like Beth; but is horrified when she realizes she killed Sarah instead, right in front of Kira and her family. Later at Siobhan's house Cosima says Delphine will protect them as the new Dyad CEO. Upstairs, Kira wants revenge on those who hurt her mother and sisters and Helena offers to teach her. Beth goes upstairs to find the bedroom empty, screaming Kira's name out the open window. = Series 04: Crazy Science = Crazy Science would have taken place after the end of the fifth season of the TV series. It would have starred Cosima and Delphine traveling around the world to cure 274 Leda clones while also falling even more in love. However, the series was cancelled in June 2018 due to low orders from comic shops. Due to an early printing deadline, the first issue was still released in July. https://www.newsarama.com/40350-orphan-black-crazy-science-cancelled-due-to- low-orders.html Characters The characters presented in the first issue of the comic book series are the first season's prominent regular and recurring characters. Orphan Black #1 presents four clones‚ÄîSarah Manning, Elizabeth Childs, Katja Obinger, and Helena‚Äîin addition to non-clone characters such as Siobhan Sadler, Kira Manning, Felix Dawkins, Paul Dierden, Detective Arthur \\"Art\\" Bell, Lieutenant Gavin Hardcastle, and Amelia. Tie-ins to the television series The comic book miniseries was conceived as a way to convey information about the clones' pasts and childhoods without interrupting the fast pace of the television series. It is presented as an expanded universe that offers off-screen events not shown in the episodes. The comic books tie directly into the events of the show's first season in order to ground the comics into the already-established universe. The miniseries presents the audience with the opportunity to better understand the emotions, thoughts, and feelings that underlie the characters of the television series.

Club career =Early career= Born in Tripoli, Tasoulis began his football career with local side Asteras Tripolis, youth teams. In the summer of 2010 he transferred to Athinaikos, where he played for one season. He moved to Fostiras in 2011. In his first year in Fostiras he contributed the club's championship in the 8th Group in Delta Ethniki, which led to the renewal of his contract for another year. Continuing his excellent performances with the club in Gamma Ethniki, signed a new two-year contract as a personal choice of the coach of the club Jacky Mathijssen. During the 2013‚Äì14 season he made the best year with the club, while scoring the winning goal in the delays of the last game that led the club to the playoffs for the rise in the Superleague Greece. =Panionios= In 2014 Panionios announced the agreement with Tasoulis for three years. On 25 August 2014, he made his debut with the club, playing for first time in the Superleague Greece in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Ergotelis. His remarkable season, except his first call in the Greek national team was the cause that the left- back is very high in the transcriptional list of many clubs including AEK. On 11 December 2016, he scored his first goal with the club, in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Kerkyra. Loan to Lens On 7 July 2017, French Ligue 2 club RC Lens signed Tasoulis on a season-long loan contract from Panionios, and they intend to put a purchase option on the contract. The French club was among the favourites after a struggling season in order to be promoted to Ligue 1. Panionios earned ‚Ç¨200,000 as a rent fee for the 26-year-old defensive, and the market clause set for next summer is expected to be around ‚Ç¨300,000. Before signing with Lens, he extended his Panionios contract which would have expired in 2018 until 2019, since otherwise the Greek left-back would be free to negotiate the next step in his career as his own. Return to Panionios On 8 January 2018, Tasoulis returned to Panionios after lacking playing time at Lens. =Asteras Tripolis= On 20 June 2018, Asteras Tripolis officially announced the signing of the Greek defensive on a two years' contract for an undisclosed fee. International career After his impressive performances with Panionios, Claudio Ranieri gave him his first call up for the national team in 2014.

Anderson was principally known for the series of highly detailed engravings of traditional British crafts that he completed over a twenty-year period beginning in 1933. Early life and education Anderson was born in Bristol on 11 May 1884,\\"Mr. Stanley Anderson.\\" Paul Drury, The Times, 14 March 1966, p. 12. the son of Alfred Ernest Anderson, a silver engraver. He was educated at Merchant Venturers' Technical College, Bristol, and took evening classes at Bristol School of Art. Against Stanley's wishes, his father arranged for him to begin a heraldic engraving apprenticeship during which he learned to etch on metal.Stanley Anderson (1884‚Äì1966). Tom Overton, 2009. British Council. British Pavilion in Venice, 2013. Marriage Anderson married Lillian Phelps in 1910. They had children, Ivan (1911) and Maxim (1914‚Äì1959). Maxim became a documentary director and producer. Career Anderson's artistic career began in earnest in 1909. He won an engraving scholarship of ¬£50 per year from the British Institution and studied at the Royal College of Art under Frank Short, and at Goldsmith's College, New Cross. Anderson claimed, however, to be mainly self-taught from visits to the National Gallery and the British Museum. He joined the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers as an associate in 1910, becoming a fellow in 1923. He was one of a number of young artists associated with the Painter-Etchers during the war years and immediately afterwards that were credited with reinvigorating that institution. During the First World War Anderson did munitions work in Woolwich. He did not see active service due to a heart condition. In 1925, he became the engraving tutor at Goldsmiths' where he taught Graham Sutherland.\\"Mr. Stanley Anderson\\". Humphrey Brooke, The Times, 18 March 1966, p. 14. From 1930 to 1952 he was a member of the Engraving Faculty at the British School at Rome. He became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1934 and a full member in 1941. His diploma work for the Royal Academy was The Wheelright (1939).The Wheelright, 1939. Royal Academy. Retrieved 24 March 2015. He participated in the Venice Biennale as a main artist in 1928 and as part of group shows in 1924, 1926, 1928, 1930 and 1938. He exhibited at the annual exhibitions of the Chicago Society of Etchers and the California Society of Etchers. Social comment What a piece of work is Man, Stanley Anderson. Engraving, 1936. In the early inter-war years Anderson's work was mainly composed of portraits, landscapes and street scenes. From the 1920s he began to add social comment and ironic commentary, which increased in the 1930s as his work became more mature and began to reflect his growing disillusionment with modern life. This can be seen in Wreckage (1922),Wreckage. Stanley Anderson, 1922. By-Products (1922),By- Products.

Stanley Anderson, 1925. and in the flute playing busker in Pan in Fulham (1932).Pan in Fulham. Stanley Anderson, 1932. In What a piece of work is Man (1936), Anderson deployed ironic humour in commenting on Hamlet's musing about the nature of man. The scene depicts two men having a discussion in a library reading room, where newspapers may be consulted for nothing by those that cannot afford to buy their own copy. The woman behind them has a hole in the heel of her stocking. The stands on which the newspapers are displayed have the labels Weekly Blurb, Fleet St. Slush and Frycassee. One has the headline \\"Art Today by Blurbert Wede\\" in mocking reference to Sir Herbert Read, the influential critic of the day and his book Art Now (1933). On the facing page is an image of a child's stick drawing, referring to Read's interest in the art of children, and a crude Picassoesque portrait. Both reflect Anderson's disdain for modern tendencies in art and ask whether such things can even be art. The newspaper on the right has an article titled \\"Hollywood Divorce\\" on one page and a picture feature titled \\"CIVILIZATION!\\" on the other. This page includes images of weapons of war, people in gas-masks, a bishop blessing soldiers, a worker and a top-hatted boss on their knees praying before machinery in the shape of a ¬£ sign, and a march of the unemployed.Zoomable version.

Country crafts series In 1933, Anderson bought a cottage (\\"Old Timbers\\") in Towersey, near Thame, Oxfordshire, and began producing the engravings of country crafts for which he is best known. Each was based on detailed preliminary sketches and sold in a limited edition of around 40 or 60, at the Royal Academy or other exhibitions. In many cases, background biographical information is known about the craftsmen featured and their tools and techniques. Anderson often knew them personally and saw them as his equals. His depictions are of real people carrying out their day-to-day work with the actual tools they used.\\"Stanley Anderson\\" by R.J.E. Inglis, Tools & Trades, Vol. 6, pp. 23‚Äì42. The Lacemaker, for instance, was based on studies of Dorcas Ing (aged 87 at the time) of Long Crendon near Thame made in 1939. Ing had died by the time the engraving was published the following year. She was the only woman featured in the series, though not the only woman in Anderson's work generally. By 1939, the hand making of lace, once common in the village, was very much in decline. The Thatcher (1944) shows Arthur Ing of Long Crendon, son of Dorcas Ing, using his bat on the hip of a cottage as he repairs or renews a thatched roof. Making the Gate (1948) depicts Rupert Timms who was born 1912 in Aston Clinton near Thame. He came from a long line of farriers and worked with his father Ralph until Ralph's death in 1960. Work for the Timms began to decline after World War Two so in 1947 they entered a competition for blacksmiths run by the Royal Agricultural Society of England who aimed to revive rural crafts. The task was to create a wrought iron gate. The Timms built the gate to a design by Anderson and won first prize in the competition which was held at the 1947 Royal Show at Oxford. They won again at York in 1948. The engraving shows Rupert Timms making the gate with Anderson's design pinned up on the wall behind him. The Timms developed a business as ornamental blacksmiths based on Anderson's original design and they made gates St. Mary's Church, Thame, and Elm Park Recreation Ground, also in Thame.

Anderson was a traditionalist in his working methods, in his taste (he disliked modern art) and in his concern for the threat to rural crafts, and critics have identified in this series a high level of consistency between the laborious craftsmanship of the men Anderson depicted and the painstaking methods that he used in his engravings, making both subject and method examples of traditional English craft. It was for this body of work that Anderson was awarded his CBE in 1951. The country crafts series was unnumbered and a large number of other works were completed on similar countryside subjects, depicting characters such as The Farm Hand (1933) or The Country Pedlar (1943), other countryside activities, horses and other subjects. Watercolours After developing neuritis in his right hand and arm, line engraving on copper became increasingly painful for Anderson. He engraved his last plate in 1953 and thereafter concentrated on watercolour paintings of country scenes which were sold at the annual exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts. Humphrey Brooke, secretary to the Royal Academy until 1968, recalled in The Times that there was a \\"stampede\\" each year to buy Anderson's paintings which often sold out within minutes of the opening, one collector being seen in running shoes to beat the competition. Death Anderson died at his home at Darobey, Church Lane, Chearsley, Buckinghamshire, on 4 March 1966.Acknowledgements. Gordon Forster, Stanley Anderson CBE RA RE. Retrieved 24 March 2015.

It is formed when hydrogen containing substances combust, and exists in the ionosphere, and in plasmas that contain oxygen and hydrogen. Oxidation by O2 in superacids could be by way of the production of protonated molecular oxygen. It is the conjugate acid of dioxygen. The proton affinity of dioxygen (O2) is 4.4 eV. Significance Protonated molecular oxygen is of interest in trying to detect dioxygen in space. Because Earth's atmosphere is full of O2, its spectrum from a space object is impossible to observe from the ground. However HO2+ should be much more detectable.

The reaction of the trihydrogen cation with dioxygen is approximately thermoneutral: O2 \\\\+ H3+ ‚Üí HO2+ \\\\+ H2 When atomic hydrogen, created in an electric discharge is rapidly cooled with oxygen and condensed in solid neon, several reactive ions and molecules are produced.

Originally established as the Federation of Irish Societies and rebranded in 2013 as Irish in Britain, the organisation has a membership of over 100 Irish charities, societies and groups. The activities of the membership range from welfare, housing, support and advice services to cultural activities, sports, arts, music, theatre and language. Irish in Britain provides member support services and has a strategic role in representing issues common to its membership and the wider diaspora. Irish in Britain works closely with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ireland and the Irish in Britain. It also coordinates campaigns, including Green Hearts, which raises awareness about heart disease in the community, and Cuimhne - the Irish memory loss campaign.  History  At the Irish Centre in Camden in June 1973, two community networks ‚Äì the Federation of Irish Societies Northern Region and Southern Region ‚Äì agreed to amalgamate into one Federation. The Southern Region group had its roots going back to 1950 and was first proposed by Portsmouth Irish Society. The Northern Region group represented organisations from Manchester, Merseyside and Tyneside. Tommy Walsh of the Liverpool Irish Centre was elected the first national chairman.  All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ireland and the Irish in Britain  The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Ireland was founded in the late 1990s in the context of the Northern Ireland peace process by parliamentarians with an interest in Irish affairs. Since its establishment, the APPG has worked closely with Irish in Britain. The APPG's current chair is Labour MP Conor McGinn, who represents St Helens North and is originally from County Armagh. The Vice-Chairs are Maria Caulfield (Conservative), Martin Docherty- Hughes (SNP), Baroness Harris of Richmond (Liberal Democrat) and Chris Ruane (Labour). Former chairs include Ruane and Kevin McNamara.  Campaigns  = Census = The organisation led the successful campaign to secure 'White Irish' as a category in the 2001 UK census, as previous censuses estimated the size of the Irish community solely on those born in Ireland. The Office of National Statistics was urged to introduce an Irish category and the Federation won the support of many parliamentarians. To advertise the new category in the community, the Federation launched a 'Be Irish, Be Counted' campaign. This was followed in the lead up to the 2011 census with a 'How Irish Are You' initiative. = Cuimhne - the Irish memory loss alliance = Cuimhne, the Irish for 'memory', supports family carers and individuals who may have some form of memory loss or dementia. = Green Hearts = The Green Hearts campaign was originally developed in response to the higher than average cardio‚Äìrelated mortality rates experienced by Irish people in Britain. The campaign is centred on a collaborative community approach towards improving health outcomes and the well-being of the Irish community and promoting a positive message around prevention and early detection.

However, he died of smallpox on 27 December 1784, some six months after his arrival in London. He was 20 years old. He was buried at St Mary the Virgin Rotherhithe. Prince Lee Boo's story appeared in a book by George Keate (1729‚Äì97), titled: An Account of the Pelew Islands, Situated in the Western Part of the Pacific Ocean. Composed from the Journals and Communications of Captain Henry Wilson, and some of his Officers, who, in August 1783, were there Shipwrecked, in the Antelope, a Packet belonging to the Hon. East India Company. The author's daughter, Georgiana Jane Keate (1770‚Äì1850, later Mrs. Georgiana Henderson), painted the portrait of Prince Lee Boo in the book. It was painted from memory, fifteen months after Prince Lee Boo's death. This book was quite popular. It was translated into over 20 languages between 1789 and 1850. An abridged version, titled: The Interesting History of Prince Lee Boo, Brought to England from the Pelew Islands, is available online.

He assumed the leadership of the Hasidut at the age of 28 upon the death of his father, Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, founder of the dynasty. He was also a member of the rabbinical court of the Edah HaChareidis for over 40 years, completing his tenure as the seventh chief rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis from 1996 to 2003. Early life Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, founder of the Dushinsky Hasidic dynasty Yisroel Moshe Dushinsky was the only child of Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky and his second wife, Esther Neuhaus. His father was over 50 years old at the time of his birth. Yisrael Moshe was born in Chust, Ukraine, shortly after his father began serving as Rav of that city. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Yisroel, and his great uncle, Rabbi Moshe Schick (the Maharam Schick). His father was very attached to him and brought him along when he visited Torah leaders of the era. During Adar 1932, the ten-year-old Yisroel Moshe accompanied his father on a visit to Mandatory Palestine, where they brought mishloach manot to the Jerusalem sage, Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, who was on his deathbed. Sonnenfeld, who died a few days after this visit, blessed Yisroel Moshe with arichas yomim (long life). The next year, Yisroel Moshe, his parents, and 25 of his father's students immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, arriving in the port of Jaffa on the ship Italia on August 28, 1933. Yisroel Moshe attended Talmud Torah Shomrei Hachomos. After his bar mitzvah, he began studying at his father's yeshiva, Yeshiva Beis Yosef Tzvi, which the latter had established on Shmuel HaNavi Street in Jerusalem. He later studied for rabbinical ordination under Rabbi Hanoch Padwa and Rabbi Eliezer Brand. He married the daughter of Rabbi Dovid Yehoshua Gross. The couple had two sons, Yosef Tzvi and Mordechai Yehuda, and two daughters. Rosh yeshiva and rabbinical leader After his marriage, his father asked him to begin delivering shiurim (Torah lectures) in the yeshiva. He was 28 years old when his father died in 1948. He took over the administration of the yeshiva and built it into a large Torah institution enrolling thousands of students. Every day after the conclusion of the morning prayers, still wearing tallit and tefillin, he would deliver a shiur on the Shulchan Arukh and its commentaries. Following his father's death, he was also appointed to the Edah HaChareidis rabbinical court. In 1967 he became a regular member of the court, a position he held for over 40 years. In 1989 he was appointed Ravad (Rav Av Beit Din), and in 1996, Gaavad (Gaon Av Beit Din, or Chief Rabbi) of the Edah HaChareidis. He was the seventh chief rabbi in that organization's history. On a day that the court adjudicated a get (divorce) or chalitza (ceremony allowing a childless widow to remarry), he would fast. He was widely respected for his Torah knowledge, refined character, and caring personality. Death and legacy Graves of Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (foreground) and Rabbi Yisroel Moshe Dushinsky (background) in the Shaare Zedek Cemetery Dushinsky suffered from ill health during his final years and underwent several surgeries. In February 2003 his health declined further and he was hospitalized. He was unable to attend the wedding of his grandson, son of Rabbi Mordechai Yehuda, on March 25; he died the next morning at 3:15 am in the presence of family and close students. He was buried next to his father in the Shaare Zedek Cemetery in Jerusalem. This cemetery had been opened as a temporary burial ground during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war; most of the graves had been moved to other, permanent cemeteries in the early 1950s. However, the grave of his father, who had died at the old Shaare Zedek Hospital in 1948, had not been moved. Since the cemetery had long been closed to burials, Dushinsky was forced to pay a huge sum of money for the right to be buried next to his father. At the funeral, it was announced that his son, Yosef Tzvi, would succeed him as Grand Rabbi and head of the Dushinsky yeshiva. Rabbi Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss succeeded him as chief rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis. His Torah writings were published under the title Toras Maharim.

This resulted in Terowie becoming an important transshipment point on the South Australian Railways network.Terowie National Railway MuseumDeputations: The Break of Gauge: A Protest Adelaide Chronicle 6 August 1898 The opening of the Trans-Australian Railway in 1917 further increased the amount of traffic, this ceased operating via Terowie in 1937 when the Adelaide to Redhill line was extended to Port Pirie. With the opening of the Leigh Creek Coalfield in the 1940s, the volume of freight transhipped increased again. This ceased with the opening of the Stirling North to Marree line on 27 July 1957. As part of the conversion of the Port Augusta to Broken Hill line to standard gauge, the line north of Terowie to Peterborough was converted to broad gauge on 12 January 1970, thus making Peterborough the break of gauge point.

He has worked with the Congress of Racial Equality, Newark Community Union Project, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Black Panther Party, the United Automobile Workers (including eight years on auto assembly lines) and the New Directions Movement. He was also active as a leader of SDS faction the Weathermen, which later became the terrorist organization Weather Underground. He was arrested in September 1969 for participation in a direct action against the Harvard Center for International Affairs and sentenced to two years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit murder after two bullets were fired through a window of the Cambridge police headquarters on November 8, 1969. He was also instrumental in the labor and community alliance that kept General Motors‚Äô assembly plant in Van Nuys, California open for ten years. Mann has been identified as instrumental in shaping the environmental justice movement in the U.S. He is also founder of the Labor/Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles, California and has been its director for 25 years. In addition, Mann is founder and co-chair of the Bus Riders Union, identifying what is now called ‚Äútransit racism‚Äù and resulting in a precedent-setting civil rights lawsuit, Labor Community Strategy Center et al. v. MTA. In addition, Mann is the author of books published by Beacon Press, Harper & Row and the University of California, which include Taking on General Motors, The Seven Components of Transformative Organizing Theory and Playbook for Progressives: 16 Qualities of the Successful Organizer and is known for his theory of transformative organizing and leadership of popular movements. Mann is host of the weekly radio show Voices from the Frontlines: Your National Movement-Building Show on KPFK Pacifica Radio 90.7 in Los Angeles. Early life Eric Mann was born December 4, 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, into a Jewish home rooted in ‚Äúanti- fascist, working class, pro-union, pro-‚ÄòNegro‚Äô, internationalist, and socialist traditions.‚Äù Both sides of his family were Jews who fled the Russian Empire during the anti-Semitic pogroms of the early 1900s. His grandmother, Sarah Mandell, a garment worker and member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, was a role model. His father, Howard Mann, was a field organizer for the Textile Workers Union of America and went south to organize black and white sharecroppers. His mother, Libby, was a department store worker, an early feminist, and shaped his ethical worldview. The decisive experience of his early life was antisemitism; within the context of the United States he observed virulent racism and developed a lifelong commitment to the black liberation movement. Background in social movements Eric Mann is acknowledged as a gifted and innovative organizer who has been organizing for more than 50 years and continues his work today. He is credited with raising organizing practice to the level of theory, generating well-known formulations to guide other organizers, a long history of involvement in the most militant, radical, revolutionary Black and Latino-led organizations, and his success in winning high profile, big-picture campaigns that have won major structural victories and illustrated his dictum \\"the left choice is the best choice.\\" Mann wrote Seven Components of Transformative Organizing Theory and Playbook for Progressives: 16 Qualities of the Successful Organizer. His theory of transformative organizing is when organizers work to radically transform the system, to transform the consciousness of the people they are organizing, and are transformed in the struggle to change the society. In 1964 Mann graduated from Cornell University with a BA in Political Science and a minor in Industrial and Labor Relations. Organizers from the Student Non- Violent Coordinating Committee traveled to Cornell to recruit students into the civil rights movement and at 21 Mann went to work for the Congress of Racial Equality. =Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)= At CORE, Mann worked as field secretary for the Northeastern regional office on an anti- discrimination campaign against the Trailways Bus Company. Longtime Black and Latino porters had been refused job promotions; the workers were willing to lead the fight but needed CORE's organizational support. The campaign included a regional boycott of Trailways, sit-ins at Trailways terminals, a demonstration at New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal and filing a civil rights complaint. According to The New York Times: ‚ÄúEric Mann, the field secretary of CORE‚Äôs Northeastern regional office, said he and Miss Joyce Ware, another officer, had organized the demonstration ‚Äòto bring attention to our demands that the harassment of Negro and Puerto Rican employees be stopped‚Äô.‚Äù After six months Trailways agreed to promote Black and Puerto Rican porters to positions as ticket agents, information clerks, and bus drivers. =Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Weathermen, Incarceration= In 1965 Mann joined the Newark Community Union Project (NCUP). Mann worked with organizers Bessie and Thurman Smith, Tom Hayden, 100 community members, and 10 students in door-to-door organizing in Newark‚Äôs Black South and Central wards where they engaged low-income people in movement-building, challenging slum housing and police brutality. He worked as a public school teacher at the Peshine Avenue School and was fired for demanding that Stokely Carmichael challenge a campus speaker from the Virginia Military Academy, for refusing to enforce what he described as repressive discipline on Black children and for teaching sex education to eighth graders. The World Journal Tribune wrote that Mann put the school system on trial with 500 parents rallying to his defense. Convinced by the Black Power movement to organize white students to support the civil rights and anti-war movements, Mann moved to Boston in 1968 to become New England Coordinator of SDS. In the spring of 1968, Mann played a leadership role in the Columbia University student strike led by SDS and the Black Student Union, demanding that Columbia shut down its Institute for Defense Analysis, and that it ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù the gymnasium, which only gave Blacks and Puerto Ricans limited access and a separate entrance. As a regional coordinator for SDS, Mann organized and spoke at rallies at Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and other New England colleges. ‚ÄúThe Columbia strike more than any other event in our history,‚Äù Mann said, ‚Äúhas given the radical student movement the belief that we can change this country.‚Äù Mann was elected to SDS national committee in 1968. He told the Associated Press that he believed in \\"continuous resistance\\" against \\"institutions and policies of corporate capitalism\\" and that SDS chapters transition from campus protests groups to community groups that would guide students as a \\"de facto government.\\" When SDS splintered into three groups in 1969, Mann, then a leader in the SDS faction, the Weathermen (Weather Underground), adopted the Revolutionary Youth Movement‚Äôs belief that violent \\"direct action,\\" a euphemism for terrorism, should be used as a tactic to dismantle the group's perceived power centers of ‚ÄúUS imperialism‚Äù. Mann and 20 others were arrested in September 1969 for participation in a direct action against the Harvard Center for International Affairs (CFIA), which the Revolutionary Youth Movement saw as a university-sponsored institution for counter-insurgency. Mann and 24 other Weathermen were charged with conspiracy to commit murder after two bullets were fired through a window of the police headquarters on November 8, 1969. Mann surrendered to the police on four counts stemming from the November 8 incident: conspiracy to commit murder, assault with intent to commit murder, promotion of anarchy, and threatening. Mann was sentenced to two years in prison of which he spent 18 months in Billerica, Deer Island, and Concord State Prison (with 40 days in solitary confinement). From 1972 to 1974 Mann was a full-time journalist, writing for Boston After Dark, the Boston Phoenix, and The Boston Globe. He traveled to California to cover the prison movement and political trials; a three-part series in the Boston Phoenix led to his first book published by Harper & Row in 1974, Comrade George: An Investigation into the Life, Political Thought, and Assassination of George Jackson. At the Boston Globe, Mann initiated the column, \\"Left Field Stands\\", in which he partnered with Boston University professor Howard Zinn. =United Auto Workers (UAW) Labor/Community Coalition to Keep GM Van Nuys Open= In 1975 Mann joined the Chicano-led August 29th Movement (ATM). ATM merged with Chinese-American organization I Wor Kuen (IWK) and the Black Revolutionary Communist League (RCL) to form the multi-racial, multi-national League of Revolutionary Struggle (LRS) in 1978. Mann worked on automobile assembly lines as an active member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) and ‚Äòtransformative organizer‚Äô from 1978 to 1986, moving from the Ford assembly plant in Milpitas, California, to the General Motors assembly plant in South Gate, Los Angeles, California, to the General Motors plant in Van Nuys, California. With plants facing imminent closings, Mann, with Mark Masaoka, and UAW Local 645 president Pete Beltran initiated a coalition between labor, the community and the Campaign to Keep GM Van Nuys Open, which Mann chaired for ten years. Five thousand workers (50 percent Latino, 15 percent black, and 15 percent women) built the coalition in Black and Latino communities, where the members lived. Threatened with a boycott, GM kept the plant open for ten years. Reverend Frank Higgins Sr. described the negotiation of the labor/community coalition with GM president F. James McDonald, ‚ÄúFor the first time they have seen a coalition form in this nation that would make them come to the table. They didn‚Äôt come to bargain; they came to deal with us as though we were children. They wound up leaving knowing they had a tiger by the tail!‚Äù While at GM, Mann was active in the New Directions Movement, a national UAW reform group founded by Jerry Tucker in 1986. New Directions aimed for a more democratic union and opposed the UAW's collaboration with Ford, GM and Chrysler, its support of anti-Japanese protectionism and its support of ‚Äúlabor-management cooperation‚Äù. Mann continues to contribute significantly to organizing and redefining the union movement in the United States. =Environmental Justice and the Labor/Community Strategy Center (LCSC)= In 1989 Mann, Father Luis Olivares, Reverend Frank Higgins, Rudy Acu√±a and other Black and Latino leaders initiated the Labor/Community Strategy Center (LCSC) as a ‚Äúthink tank/act tank‚Äù that would train organizers and organize labor, environmental justice, mass transportation, and civil rights campaigns. In the early environmental work of the LCSC, Mann's approach distinguished environmental justice organizing from the approach of the mainstream environmental movement. Mann's 1992 book L.A.‚Äôs Lethal Air, documents how class, race, and gender were the unspoken categories of environmental injustice. By 1993, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots Mann, as principal author with the Urban Strategies Group, wrote Reconstructing Los Angeles and U.S. Cities from the Bottom Up. That document linked transportation, the environment, and unemployment, advocating for rebuilding the manufacturing sector through ‚Äúenvironmentally-sound production of technologies, focusing on solar electricity, non-polluting, prefabricated housing materials, electric car components, and public transportation vehicles, both buses and trains‚Äù‚Äîand called for ‚Äúthe social justice state not the police state.‚Äù Through the LCSC's efforts, the South Coast Air Quality Management District implemented a ‚Äúright to know‚Äù statute in which community residents were given information about the chemicals they were exposed to and the corporations that were producing them. In 2001, Mann was a delegate to the U.N. World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa and returned to South Africa in 2002 as part of a Strategy Center NGO delegation to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. In 1992 Mann and the Strategy Center founded the Bus Riders Union (BRU) with a group of Black and Latino bus riders and started organizing on the buses of Los Angeles. Working with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Educational Fund (LDF), with Mann as chief negotiator, the BRU crafted a civil rights lawsuit based on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which prevents discrimination by government agencies that receive federal funds). The BRU charged the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority with ‚Äútransit racism‚Äù‚Äîsetting up a separate and unequal transit system in which Latino and Black bus riders were subject to ‚Äòa third class bus system for Third World people‚Äô while wealthy contractors built rail projects for a whiter, more affluent ridership. The BRU's ‚Äúbillions for buses‚Äù campaign was initiated in 1992. It was initially accused of hyperbole and excessive aspirations but ended up winning $2.7 billion in improvements for 500,000 bus riders. Sit-ins, grassroots organizing, a ‚Äúno seat, no fare campaign,‚Äù court orders, and negotiations with the MTA led by Mann, resulted in a ten-year civil rights consent decree committing the Los Angeles MTA to revamp and improve its bus system. The BRU was designated the class representative for LA's 500,000 bus riders (of whom 50 percent were Latino and 25 percent were Black). A BRU team of Eric Mann, Chris Mathis, Norma Henry, and Della Bonner worked in a ‚Äújoint working group‚Äù with MTA representatives that led to replacing 2,000 dilapidated diesel buses, with 2,500 new compressed natural gas buses‚Äîthe largest clean fuel bus-fleet in the United States. This story is documented in the Haskell Wexler film Bus Riders Union. Mann attended the 2001 U.N. World Conference Against Racism held in Durban, South Africa. Upon his return to the U.S., the Strategy Center launched a campaign in support of the international demands for ‚ÄúReparations for the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade‚Äù; this campaign was a predecessor to the Community Rights Campaign. The Community Rights Campaign took up the cause of serving the transportation needs of minority students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which it linked with \\"transit racism\\". It took up the slogans of \\"1,000 more buses, 1,000 more schools and 1,000 fewer police\\", addressing what it saw as the impacts of structural racism on minority students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Led by the Strategy Center's organizer Manuel Criollo, community rights organizers built a student pass campaign that resulted in a major victory in 2005, with the LA MTA to eliminate the application process which had been limiting students‚Äô access to low cost student passes. This laid the groundwork for the current student organizing project, ‚ÄúStop the Schools as Pre-Prisons.‚Äù This popular campaign has produced numerous reports and won significant victories‚Äîrolling back truancy tickets and charges of willful defiance, as reported in Black, Brown, and Overpoliced in 2014. Since 2012 the work of Mann and the Strategy Center has focused on the \\"Fight for the Soul of the Cities\\" campaign. It is a political program for international urban organizing built on the Strategy Center's Bus Riders Union and Community Rights Campaign. It opposes privatization, pollution, policing and corporate interests and proposes cities putting the Black and Latino working class as its core. The Fight for the Soul of the Cities campaign has five core demands‚Äî‚ÄùNo Cars in LA‚ÄîStop the U.S.‚Äôs and L.A.'s War on the Planet‚Äù; ‚ÄúFree the U.S. 2.5 million prisoners‚ÄîStop the Mass Incarceration of Black and Latino Communities‚Äù; ‚ÄúAmnesty and Open Borders for Immigrants‚ÄîImmigrant Rights are Human Rights‚Äù; ‚ÄúStop U.S. Drone Attacks‚ÄîSupport Sovereignty and Human Rights‚Äù; ‚ÄúFight for the Right to Protest and Organize‚ÄîStop the Police and Surveillance State‚Äù. Mann led the founding of the National School for Strategic Organizing that educates and trains a multi-racial class of future leaders. The school has recruited and trained more than 100 young organizers, who are active in social movements. Based on his years of organizing and 20 years of teaching organizers exchanges, Mann's wrote Playbook for Progressives, the book that presents Mann's theory of transformative organizing.

In 2014, he was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing an Omaha district. Early life and professional career Hilkemann was born in Norfolk, Nebraska. He grew up near Randolph, and graduated from Randolph Public High School in 1965. In 1969, he obtained a B.S. in biology from Nebraska Wesleyan University. From 1969 to 1972, he worked as a high-school science teacher and football coach in Table Rock. In 1970, he married Julie Beth Bryngelson; the couple eventually produced three children. Wishing to pursue a career in podiatry, Hilkemann attended the Illinois College of Podiatric Medicine, receiving his D.P.M. in 1976. He returned to Nebraska, where he began practice in Omaha in 1977. In 1984, he founded the Foot and Ankle Center of Nebraska. He retired from practice in 2013. Legislature Upon launching his practice in 1977, Hilkemann had found Nebraska's laws concerning medical practice \\"antiquated and overly restrictive\\". He brought three initiatives to the Legislature, where he worked with state senators on changes in the laws. In the 1980s, he served on the Nebraska State Board of Health, including two years as chairman. =2014 election= Upon his retirement from practice, Hilkemann decided to run for a seat in the Legislature in District 4, located in northwest Omaha. Under Nebraska's term-limits law, incumbent Pete Pirsch, a Republican, was ineligible to run for re-election. Five candidates sought to succeed him: Hilkemann, a Republican; Matt Butler, an Omaha entrepreneur and a Republican, who had unsuccessfully run for lieutenant governor in 1998; Stacy Ryan, a Republican described as a \\"judicial reform activist\\"; Steve Howard, an Omaha attorney and a Democrat; and Nicholas Pestello, a 23-year-old independent, whose principal issue was the decriminalization of marijuana. In the nonpartisan primary election, Hilkemann led, with 2357 of the 6133 votes cast, or 38.4% of the total. Ryan came in second, with 1513 votes, or 24.7%. Howard and Butler nearly tied for third, with 1070 and 1068 votes respectively (17.4%); and Pestello received 125 votes, or 2.0%. Both candidates' websites described them as \\"conservative\\". Hilkemann described himself as \\"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, pro-marriage, pro-family, pro-business\\". Ryan described herself as \\"pro-life, pro-family, pro-second amendment\\". Both candidates opposed the proposed expansion of Medicaid in Nebraska under the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The two differed on the question of capital punishment: Ryan stated, \\"I do not support the death penalty\\", while Hilkemann declared that it was \\"still necessary for the more heinous crimes\\". With little ideological difference between the two candidates, each maintained that their life experience would make them the better legislator. Hilkemann stated that his medical background would enable him to make informed decisions on health-care issues, and that his early history as a teacher would give him a stronger understanding of educational issues. Ryan stated that her legal training and research skills would make her the better choice, and that more female voices were needed in the Legislature. Over the course of the entire campaign, Hilkemann raised nearly $152,000 and spent nearly $124,000. Major contributions included $20,000 from the Nebraska Podiatric Medical Association, $8000 from the Nebraska Hospital Association PAC, $5100 from the Nebraska State Educational Association PAC, and $5000 from the Nebraska Realtors PAC. Ryan raised over $106,000, and spent the same. Nearly $83,000 of this was her own money; the single non-individual contributor was Wayne L. Ryan, Trustee, who gave the campaign $10,000; the rest of the money came from individuals, several of whom shared her surname. Turnout in the general election was nearly twice as high as in the primary. Hilkemann won, with 6698 of the 11,681 votes cast, or 57.3% of the total. Ryan received 4983 votes, or 42.7%. =Legislative tenure= 2015 session In the 2015 session of the Legislature, Hilkemann was appointed to the post of vice-chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Among the \\"most significant\\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over vetoes by governor Pete Ricketts. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges. Hilkemann voted in favor of the death-penalty repeal, and to override Ricketts's veto of the measure; he abstained in the vote to pass LB623, and voted to sustain the gubernatorial veto; and he abstained in the vote on the gas-tax increase, then voted to sustain the veto. 2016 session In its 2016 session, the Nebraska legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \\"an unelected and unaccountable board\\". Hilkeman voted against the bill in its 29-15 passage. Sponsor John Murante opted not to seek an override of the governor's veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures. The bill passed by a margin of 37-8, with 4 present and not voting; Hilkeman was among those voting in favor. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill passed over Ricketts's veto. LB947 made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33-11-5; the veto override passed 31-13-5\\\\. Hilkeman voted for the bill, and for the override of Ricketts's veto. The legislature failed to pass LB10, greatly desired by the Republican Party, which would have restored Nebraska to a winner-take-all scheme of allocating its electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections, rather than continuing its practice of awarding the electoral vote for each congressional district to the candidate who received the most votes in that district. Supporters were unable to break a filibuster; in the 32-17 cloture motion, Hilkeman was among those who voted in favor of the bill.

Overview In the context of biochemistry and drug development, a hybridization assay is a type of Ligand Binding Assay (LBA) used to quantify nucleic acids in biological matrices. Hybridization assays can be in solution or on a solid support such as 96-well plates or labelled beads. Hybridization assays involve labelled nucleic acid probes to identify related DNA or RNA molecules (i.e. with significantly high degree of sequence similarity) within a complex mixture of unlabelled nucleic acid molecules. Antisense therapy, siRNA, and other oligonucleotide and nucleic acid based biotherapeutics can be quantified with hybridization assays. Signalling of hybridization methods can be performed using oligonucleotide probes modified in-synthesis with haptens and small molecule ligands which act homologous to the capture and detection antibodies. As with traditional ELISA, conjugates to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) can be used as secondary antibodies. Sandwich hybridization assay Sandwich hybridization assayIn the sandwich hybridization ELISA assay format, the antigen ligand and antibodies in ELISA are replaced with a nucleic acid analyte, complementary oligonucleotide capture and detection probes. Generally, in the case of nucleic acid hybridization, monovalent salt concentration and temperature are controlled for hybridization and wash stringency, contrary to a traditional ELISA, where the salt concentration will usually be fixed for the binding and wash steps (i.e. PBS or TBS). Thus, optimal salt concentration in hybridization assays varies dependent upon the length and base composition of the analyte, capture and detection probes. Competitive hybridization assay The competitive hybridization assay is similar to a traditional competitive immunoassay. Like other hybridization assays, it relies on complementarity, where the capture probe competes between the analyte and the tracer‚Äìa labelled oligonucleotide analog to the analyte. Hybridization-ligation assay In the hybridization-ligation assay a template probe replaces the capture probe in the sandwich assay for immobilization to the solid support. The template probe is fully complementary to the oligonucleotide analyte and is intended to serve as a substrate for T4 DNA ligase-mediated ligation. The template probe has in addition an additional stretch complementary to a ligation probe so that the ligation probe will ligate onto the 3'-end of the analyte. Albeit generic, the ligation probe is similar to a detection probe in that it is labelled with, for example, digoxigenin for downstream signalling. Stringent, low/no salt wash will remove un-ligated products. The ligation of the analyte to the ligation probe makes the method specific for the 3'-end of the analyte, ligation by T4 DNA ligase being much less efficient over a bulge loop, which would happen for a 3' metabolite N-1 version of the analyte, for example. The specificity of the hybridization-ligation assay for ligation at the 3'-end is particularly relevant because the predominant nucleases in blood are 3' to 5' exonucleases. One limitation of the method is that it requires a free 3'-end hydroxyl which may not be available when targeting moieties are attached to the 3'-end, for example. Further, more exotic nucleic acid chemistries with oligonucleotide drugs may impact upon the activity of the ligase, which needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Dual ligation hybridization assay Dual Ligation Hybridization AssayThe dual ligation hybridization assay (DLA) extends the specificity of the hybridization-ligation assay to a specific method for the parent compound. Despite hybridization-ligation assay's robustness, sensitivity and added specificity for the 3'-end of the oligonculeotide analyte, the hybridization-ligation assay is not specific for the 5' end of the analyte. The DLA is intended to quantify the full-length, parent oligonucleotide compound only, with both intact 5' and 3' ends. DLA probes are ligated at the 5' and 3' ends of the analyte by the joint action of T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The kinase phosphorylates the 5'-end of the analyte and the ligase will join the capture probe to the analyte to the detection probe. The capture and detection probes in the DLA can thus be termed ligation probes. As for the hybridization-ligation assay, the DLA is specific for the parent compound because the efficiency of ligation over a bulge loop is low, and thus the DLA detects the full-length analyte with both intact 5' and 3'-ends. The DLA can also be used for the determination of individual metabolites in biological matrices. The limitations with the hybridization-ligation assay also apply to the dual ligation assay, with the 5'-end in addition to the 3'-end requiring to have a free hydroxyl (or a phosphate group). Further, T4 DNA ligases are incompatible with ligation of RNA molecules as a donor (i.e. RNA at the 5' end of the ligation). Therefore, second generation antisense that comprise 2'-O-methyl RNA, 2'-O-methoxyethyl or locked nucleic acids may not be compatible with the dual ligation assay. Nuclease hybridization assay Nuclease hybridization assay The nuclease hybridization assay, also called S1 nuclease cutting assay, is a nuclease protection assay-based hybridization ELISA. The assay is using S1 nuclease, which degrades single-stranded DNA and RNA into oligo- or mononucleotides, leaving intact double-stranded DNA and RNA. In the nuclease hybridization assay, the oligonucleotide analyte is captured onto the solid support such as a 96-well plate via a fully complementary cutting probe. After enzymatic processing by S1 nuclease, the free cutting probe and the cutting probe hybridized to metabolites, i.e. shortmers of the analyte are degraded, allowing signal to be generated only from the full-length cutting probe- analyte duplex. The assay is well tolerant to diverse chemistries, as exemplified by the development of a nuclease assay for morpholino oligonucleotides. This assay set-up can lack robustness and is not suitable for validation following the FDA's guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. This is demonstrated by an absence of published method that have been validated to the standards outlined by the FDA for bioanalytical methods.

Subsequently, the Syrian Armed Forces also launched an assault against the jihadists, without coordinating with the YPG. Background In February 2014, multiple towns and villages in the eastern part of the Jazira Canton came under ISIL control. On 23 June 2014, ISIL expanded into Tell Brak and the surrounding area, as well as the eastern outskirts of the city of Al-Hasakah. In early October 2014, ISIL launched a massive offensive, capturing some villages in the eastern Jazira Canton, with subsequent campaigns expanding ISIL control in the region into December 2014. In mid-December, the Syrian Army and the YPG engaged ISIL forces to the south of Qamishli, capturing a number of villages, but ISIL responded with a counter-offensive that resulted in them capturing multiple villages to the south and southeast of Tell Ma'ruf. In late December 2014, YPG forces retook control of some of the villages near the Yarubiyah-Rabia border crossing and to the southwest of the region, in support of Peshmerga forces launching the Sinjar offensive. By the end of the offensive on 21 December, some of the ISIL-occupied villages near Jaz'ah had come under YPG assault. The offensive Syriac Military Council fighters near Tell Tamer, February 2015 The offensive started on 21 February 2015, and by the next day, the Kurds quickly advanced within five kilometers of Tal Hamis, after capturing 23 farms and villages near the Abo Qasayeb area. Their assault was backed up by U.S. and allied Arab air support. Also, near the border with Iraq, the YPG captured two villages. The Kurdish Peshmerga forces in Iraq shelled ISIL positions across the border, in coordination with the YPG during their advance. In response to the Kurdish offensive, on 23 February, ISIL launched a massive attack on a cluster of villages along the southern bank of the Khabur River around the town of Tell Tamer, using around 3,000 fighters and multiple tanks, seizing 11 villages and kidnapping 220 Assyrian Christians by 26 February, according to the SOHR. Local sources stated that 33‚Äì35 villages were captured and put the number of abducted Assyrians at 287‚Äì400. ISIL was reportedly withdrawing militants from other fronts in Syria, including the front at Homs, to boost their assault at Tell Tamer. The Kurds managed to recapture several of the villages, but the fate of the Christians remained unknown. It was also reported that Abu Omar al-Shishani, ISIL's field commander in Syria, was leading the assault at Tell Tamer. Map of the Al- Hasakah offensive in progress, on 24 February 2015, showing the YPG and ISIL offensives on both sides of the Governorate. On 23 February, the YPG captured Tell Brak, during a pre-dawn raid On 25 February, the YPG cut the road between Tal Hamis and al-Hawl, which was a main ISIL supply line from Iraq. By 27 February, Kurdish fighters managed to capture 103 villages and hamlets around the town of Tal Hamis, as well as Tal Hamis itself while on 1 March, Kurdish fighters reportedly burned a number of houses that belonged to ISIL militants or ISIL-allied fighters in two dozen Arab villages around Tal Hamis that they recaptured from ISIL. On 28 February, ISIL executed 15 Assyrian Christians, 14 of them fighters. Another 13 Christian fighters were being held. By 28 February, since the start of the offensive, the fighting had left at least 175‚Äì211 ISIL militants and 75 Kurdish and allied fighters dead. In the period during the offensive, between 21 February and 1 March, the US-led coalition conducted 24 airstrikes, striking 18 ISIL tactical units and destroying seven ISIL vehicles. Kurdish forces were reportedly planning to build on their advances and capture Tell Abyad, thus connecting the Koban√Æ Canton to the Jazira Canton. In the meantime, on the same day that the Kurds captured Tal Hamis, Syrian government forces launched their own offensive against ISIL, and by 2 March, had captured 23‚Äì31 villages, with their ultimate aim being to take control of the main road linking the provincial capital of Al-Hasakah to the city of Qamishli. Another report put the number of captured villages at 33. 13 of the villages were seized within 24 hours of the start of the assault. Meanwhile, Kurdish-Arab allied forces were continuing to fight ISIL outside Tell Tamer. By 3 March, 24 of the kidnapped Christians were released by ISIL after ransoms were paid. On 4 March, Syrian government forces advanced further and captured several villages, while ISIL continued shelling Kurdish fighters near Tell Tamer. After the losses suffered in the previous days, ISIL forces retreated towards the areas of al-Hawl and Shaddadi. On of 6 March, the Syrian Army advanced down Highway 7 up to 15‚Äì20 kilometers from Tell Brak and stopped. It was also reported that fierce clashes between ISIL and the YPG had erupted to the east of Al-Hasakah city, as ISIL was trying to prevent Kurdish forces from reaching one of its last remaining strongholds in al-Hawl. The clashes from 5‚Äì6 March resulted in the deaths of 11 more YPG fighters. On 7 March, ISIL launched a massive attack on villages around Tell Tamer, with fears ISIL militants would use the kidnapped Assyrians as human shields. The attack began around dawn and targeted at least three villages on the northern bank of the Khabur River, with ISIL's aim being to capture Tell Tamer and secure a corridor to the Iraqi border. The next day, ISIL advanced close to the town and heavy fighting ensued, but Kurdish reinforcements arrived and they managed to repel the militants. The clashes left 40 dead on both sides. At the same time, ISIL launched an assault in an attempt to recapture several villages between Tell Brak and al-Hawl, which was also repelled, with the YPG claiming to have killed 67 ISIL militants. Meanwhile, Syrian government troops advanced further and captured five to nine villages. By this point, among Kurdish fighters killed in the offensive, there were three foreigners as well: an Australian, a Briton and a German female volunteer. On 10 March, the YPG announced that their campaign had ended successfully after securing the Jazira Canton. However, on the same day, ISIL launched a surprise attack on Tell Khanzir, about 30 kilometers to the west of Ras al-Ayn, near the Turkish border in west Hasakah, capturing the town along with several other villages. It was reported that ISIL had deployed hundreds of battle-hardened Chechens from its Khorasan Battalion to carry out the assault. Fierce clashes also erupted in and around Manajir, to the west of Tell Tamer, as ISIL sought to strike northward. ISIL launched the assault to prevent Kurdish forces from reaching their stronghold of al-Hawl, by occupying the Kurds on multiple fronts, attempting to seize another border crossing with Turkey, and due to fears that the Kurds would use Ras al-Ayn as a base to seize control of Tell Abyad, and link the Koban√Æ and Jazira Cantons. ISIL also wanted control of Ras al-Ayn and Tell Tamer to control additional key routes that would link the ISIL-held Iraqi city of Mosul with other ISIL-controlled territory in northeastern Syria. On 12 March, the Kurds managed to repel the ISIL advance on Ras al-Ayn resulting in dozens of casualties on both sides. However, ISIL advanced towards Tell Tamer and captured the village of Tal Nasri, bringing the militants to within 500 meters of the town. The fighting near Tell Tamer left 22 Kurdish and 18 jihadist fighters dead. Two days later, the Kurds recaptured the village of Tal Maghas, near Tell Tamer; however, according to another report, ISIL managed to capture several more villages and crossed the Khabur River, in the area just northwest of Tell Tamer. The YPG demanded more Coalition airstrikes in the region, due to the fact that ISIL was deploying more reinforcements while the US-led Coalition had not conducted any airstrikes near Tell Tamer since 10 March. By this point, since the ISIL counterattack started on 10 March, the clashes in the Tell Tamer and Tell Khanzir areas had left at least 105 ISIL militants and 63 YPG fighters dead. On 13 March, the US-led Coalition resumed airstrikes in the region. On 16 March, the YPG advanced and captured some ISIL positions in the countryside around Tell Tamer. The same day, 100 Hezbollah fighters arrived in Ras al-Ayn from Qamishli to support Kurdish forces, according to the pro-opposition Al- Hasakah Youth Union, and were soon after sent to the battlefield where they were outfitted with Kurdish uniforms. The next day, the Iranian Fars News Agency reported that the Syrian Army advanced and captured the town of Malaha, as well as its surrounding farm areas. Aftermath Map of the maximum gains made by ISIL advances during the Al-Hasakah offensive, by mid-April 2015. From 18 to 19 March, US-led Coalition airstrikes struck 3 ISIL tactical units, an ISIL fighting position, and an ISIL tunnel system in the area. On 20 March, more than 100 people were killed and wounded when an ISIL militant blew himself up at a celebration held by the Kurds for the festival of Nowruz, in the al-Mofti neighborhood of Al-Hasakah city, in addition to an IED explosion at another celebration in the city. Over the next several days, clashes erupted in the vicinity of Tell Khanzir, Tell Brak and Tell Tamer, killing dozens of ISIL militants, while fighter jets bombed ISIL positions in the city of Al-Shaddadeh. On 30 March, the National Defense Forces (NDF) reportedly captured 33 villages near the village of Tal Brak in rural Al-Hasakah, after fierce clashes with ISIL militants on 28 and 29 March. On the same day, Kurdish commander Jiwan Ibrahim, Chief of the Kurdish Asayish forces in Rojava, issued a warning to civilians in the recently regained towns of Tel Brak and Tel Hamis regarding Syrian government forces in the region: ‚ÄúTo our people in Tel Brak and Tel Hamis, the Baathist regime (Assad‚Äôs regime) in Qamishli and Hasakah is spreading baseless news that it took entire control of both towns and handed them over to Kurdish forces. However, Kurds have fought against the radical group of the Islamic State (IS/ISIL) and forced the militants to withdraw from the towns, and Kurds are the ones who protect these towns. The regime militias weren‚Äôt engaged in the fighting against the IS group and they won‚Äôt provide any security assistance to the civilians‚Äù. On 3 April, ISIL reportedly lost another 21 villages to Syrian government forces, to the south of Qamishli.

The resort is very popular with residents of the valley, as well as families and tourists from the Washington, D.C. area, some 115 miles (185 km) away. The ski area was opened as a year-round resort by Pete and Julie Brice in 1965, seeking to attract visitors drawn to the nearby Orkney Springs, and has been in operation ever since. Due to the relatively temperate climate of northwestern Virginia, the resort relies considerably on artificial snowmaking, and was one of the first and only resorts in North America to introduce grass skiing during summer months. The resort was managed by brothers Horst and Manfred Locher until 1997, and they and their families are still involved in many day-to-day operations today.  Facilities  Facilities at Bryce include a day lodge with grill restaurant, a full-service ski rental operation and a ski shop. While alpine skiing and snowboarding are the most popular activities, the resort also offers an 800-foot-long (244 m) snow tubing run. Summer activities include ziplining down the slopes, golf, and an artificial lake, named Lake Laura. The resort also features an airstrip with a 2,240-foot (683 m) runway, with the FAA identifier VG18.  Mountain lifts  Bryce Resort has two lifts, including a quad-chair (installed in 2012, replacing one of the original double lifts) and a double-chair, which operates less frequently. The entire mountain is accessible from the quad, while the double terminates several hundred feet lower down, near the top of Bootlegger and Revenuer's Run. Additionally, there are five carpet lifts on the lower slopes to cater to beginners.

He is a co-founder and chief product officer (CPO) of Airbnb. In 2009, Gebbia was listed in BusinessWeek's Top 20 Best Young Tech Entrepreneurs. In 2010, he was named in Inc. Magazine's Thirty under Thirty, and 2013, he was named in Fortune Magazine's Forty-under-Forty. Early life Joe Gebbia was born August 21, 1981, in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Eileen and Joe Gebbia.Joe Gebbia - Brookhaven City Councilman retrieved May 8, 2016 He has one sister, Kimberly. He attended Brookwood High School in Snellville, Gwinnett County, Georgia where he idolized Chris Allen, Adam Johnson, Mark Dugger and Kyle Wiggins. He graduated in 2005 from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in Providence, Rhode Island, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphic Design and Industrial Design. It was at RISD that he met Brian Chesky, who would later become his roommate and co-founder of Airbnb. While studying in the Northeast, Gebbia complemented his creative pursuits and studies at RISD with business coursework at Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Career After graduating from RISD, he overstayed at a friend's place in San Francisco for many months. Gebbia got a job at Chronicle Books in San Francisco, while Chesky moved to Los Angeles. Gebbia convinced his friend Brian Chesky to move to San Francisco in 2007 to start a business together. When they both quit their jobs, their landlord raised their rent and so they were in need of money. Knowing the Industrial Design Society of America conference was coming to San Francisco and many hotels were booked, Gebbia believed they could rent out airbeds in their apartment to conference goers. They marketed this idea by creating a website called \\"AirBed & Breakfast.\\" This was the foundation of Airbnb. Another of Gebbia's roommates, Harvard graduate and technical architect Nathan Blecharczyk, became the third co-founder in February 2008. After failing to get the funding for the new company, the team designed cereal boxes, \\"Obama O's\\" and \\"Cap'n McCains,\\" based on the 2008 presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain and sold them at the conventions. When Gebbia shared their work with Paul Graham, founder of Y Combinator, he was impressed with the tenacity involved in the endeavor, admitting them to the program as a result. He gave them their first round of seed funding in 2009. In May 2017, Gebbia launched a modular office furniture business called Neighborhood. The furniture was created for Bernhardt Design, a furniture company that has worked with emerging designers. He currently holds board and advisor roles as Member of the Board of Directors at Airbnb, Member of the Board of Trustees at Rhode Island School of Design, and Investor at Nebia. Gebbia ranks 437 on Forbes‚Äô 2020 billionaires list with a net worth of $4.1 billion dollars alongside his cofounders Brain Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk. Philanthropy Gebbia serves on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). In 2014, he donated US$300,000 to RISD to establish a US$50,000 term scholarship and an endowed fund. On June 1, 2016, Gebbia joined Warren Buffett and Bill Gates' 'The Giving Pledge', a select group of billionaires who have committed to give the majority of their wealth away.

When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator- restorer. Furniture conservation and restoration can be divided into two general areas: structure and finish. Structure generally relates to wood and can be divided into solid, joined, and veneered wood. The finish of furniture can be painted or transparent.Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections, (Pg. 125). London, University Press. Furniture has existed throughout all the years of human existence. Furniture that is very dated or is an antique can be conserved or restored so that future generations may also enjoy them for cultural, educational and personal benefit. There are many organizations and guidebooks that can be used to understand the techniques that are used to conserve and restore furniture.http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a- conservator#.VTkUSiFViko \\"Guide to Finding a Conservator\\" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 Conservation The conservation of furniture is the synthesis of three major endeavors, according to the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute: # The minimization of deterioration (preservation); #The consolidation (stabilization) of artifacts as they currently exist; #Repair/replacement (compensation or restoration) of existing damage. American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1 Preventive conservation is the form of conservation recognized here with furniture care. The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works declares that stripping and refinishing furniture is no longer standard practice. An early finish is as important to historic furniture as are any of the other original elements. The finish coating offers important data to researchers and is part of the history of the object and once it is removed, it cannot be recovered. The removal and replacement of a surface finish is considered a last ditch effort after other conservation methods have failed.http://www.conservation- us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 \\"Caring for Your Treasures\\" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. accessed 4/28/2015 = The Institut national du patrimoine = In France, conservators specialized in furniture are trained at the Institut National du Patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration. Restoration Antiques restoration can be an arduous process if the goal is total and complete authenticity. For conservators, authentic material is the actual original material of the object. For example: A chair with its original upholstery, even if it is faded and shredded, is authentic for the conservator and possesses historic value even though it may not be exhibitable. The same chair can be \\"restored\\" and looking as it did when new, with replacement fabric copied from the original weave and colors, and upholstered according to the known design of that particular piece of furniture; this would represent the other kind of authenticity.Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) Conservation Treatment Methodology (Pg. 97). Original material Furniture can be divided into periods dominated by the use of a particular wood.Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses (Pg. 363). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books. *Until the late 17th Century oak was dominant. *From the mid-17th Century, walnut gradually became the main wood for the outside and drawer sides in the best quality pieces with oak still used for the underlying part. *In the second quarter of the 18th Century the first mahogany was imported from the West Indies and eventually replaced walnut. *By the 1790s, satinwood was popular as a decorative exotic timber for top quality pieces. *During the Regency period rosewood was predominant. *Since then no one species has dominated.

Treatments can produce objects that appear indistinguishable from furniture upholstered in traditional ways, but the actual means of attachment does not include any nails or staples that pierce wood. Velcro makes it possible to examine the carcass of the furniture without undoing any part of the treatment. When furniture is treated using these techniques, stuffing is typically replaced by Ethafoam carved to the appropriate shape. The resulting object has a seat that looks like the original one, but is not \\"sittable.\\"Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) Conservation Treatment Methodology, (pg. 360‚Äì361). American furniture from the mid-nineteenth century probably received new upholstery about every thirty years. Sometimes new fabric was placed on top of the old, and at other times worn upholstery was entirely removed before the new covering was applied. Conservator-restorers can sometimes find threads of original fiber evidence on the chair frame, usually around tack holes. This can guide them to the creation of a reproduction of the original upholstery if an original fabric is not available.Newman, Richard. (2009) Conservation: MFA Highlights. (pg. 50‚Äì53) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. =Marie Antoinette's chair= The Victoria and Albert Museum has a case study on their website that describes the conservation treatment that was carried out on Marie Antoinette's chair in preparation for its display in the new Europe galleries due to open in 2015. The chair was made in 1788 by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sen√© (1748‚Äì1803). The chair has been re-upholstered several times, re-gilded and over-painted. The last intervention was in the 1970s when it was upholstered in blue swagged fabric and partially painted a greyish blue. Varnish Wooden furniture is taken apart when renewing varnish to improve the finish A synthetic varnish, cellulose nitrate, was developed in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation suitable for commercial furniture until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, cellulose nitrate discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems. In a case study of an armoire with this condition from the 1930s from The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts: \\"Conservators used a more stable synthetic resin, a type of acrylic copolymer dissolved in a solvent, to consolidate weakened areas of the original varnish without significantly changing the glossiness of its finish or its color. To provide a consistent overall finish, they tinted a portion of that solution the same color as the aged cellulose nitrate to fill some of the more jarring losses. In the future, the new varnish will not be easy to remove, if it can be removed at all, but the synthetic resin used by the conservators is known to have good aging properties.\\" Newman, Richard.

Alligatoring: Series of hairline cracks in old varnish, creating the appearance of alligator hide. Checking: Slight gapping between wood cells that creates a checkerboard-like pattern. Found where wood is cut straight across the grain for carving, such as in a ball-and-claw foot. Dry rot: Decay of seasoned timber caused by fungi that consume the cellulose of wood, leaving a soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder. Shrinkage: A loss of mass or size in response to dry relative humidity conditions.  Preventable damage  Preventive conservation is the best form of conservation that you can do for furniture without a scientific conservation degree. =The impact of the environment= A poorly controlled environment can cause detached veneer, cracks, and flaking paint.http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 \\"Preventive Conservation\\" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 Light Light easily causes color fading. Light is a major concern for furniture because the stains and color of wood are very susceptible to both natural and artificial light.Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections, (pg. 131). London, University Press. Temperature and relative humidity  To prevent cracks and veneer cleavage, avoid placing furniture near radiators, heat vents or other areas where temperature and relative humidity (RH) fluctuate widely. A stable relative humidity is particularly important to furniture since rapid changes cause different parts of the object to expand and contract at different rates and to different degrees.http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 \\"Furniture and Wooden Objects\\" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 If the relative humidity is over 60% fungi, such as molds and mildews, will become rampant on wooden furniture.http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html \\"Biological Deterioration & Damage to Furniture & Wooden Objects\\" Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute accessed 4/23/2015 The recommended range for wooden furniture is 45%‚Äì55% RH.Klim, Susan.

Pests Powderpost Beetle A common furniture pest is the powderpost beetle, less than a quarter-inch long, which lays its eggs in small crevices. The insect larvae burrow into the wood, creating networks of tunnels as they eat their way along the grain. As they mature to adults, they bore out of the wood leaving an \\"exit\\" or \\"flight\\" hole and fly off to lay their eggs, completing the cycle.http://www.conservation-us.org/about- conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp \\"Insect Activity,\\" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 Photo to the right‚Äî The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, presented a case study of an early 19th-century bed with an infestation of woodworms: \\"To protect the bed from damage and prevent pests from spreading to other works of art, it was critical to treat the new acquisition before it entered the building. Conservators completely sealed the bed in a giant impermeable bag and placed an oxygen scavenger inside. In this case, the scavenger was made of fine iron particles. Iron reacts rapidly with oxygen, binding the gas itself and thereby removing it from the air. With the appropriate amount of scavenger in the sealed environment, the conservators brought the oxygen down from normal air levels of 20 percent to less than 0.1 percent. After about four weeks in containment, all of the bed's woodworms in all life stages suffocated. Then the object could be safely brought into the Museum. No toxic chemicals were involved in the treatment, and the conservators disposed of the spent scavenger safely.\\"Newman, Richard. (2009) Conservation: MFA Highlights.(Pg. 132) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Handling and moving furniture Perhaps the greatest cause of damage to furniture is people due to misuse and mishandling, creating physical damage.Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books. Always wear clean cotton gloves and handle objects as little as possible. Check furniture for damage or loose joins before moving it. Remove objects from the surface and then remove drawers, shelves, and doors. Elements that cannot be removed should be secured with soft cloth (cotton) straps.http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources- ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, \\"How to Care for Wooden Furniture,\\" 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 As well as structural damage, dents, surface wear, scratches, stains and wax from candles are all evidence of past use. Water splashed from repeated floor washing, or spilt from flower displays damages bare or polished surfaces, most commonly leaving white marks. Cups and glasses leave 'rings' on polished surfaces. Alcohol spilt will remove the polished surface almost instantly.Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.

Other furniture polishes contain non- drying oils such as lemon oil, but attract and entrap dirt and grime. Silicone polishes are also not recommended as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future finish treatments.http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your- treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp \\"Caring for Your Treasures,\\" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 =Tools for furniture care= The Hammond-Harwood House and City of Bowie Museums Collector's Corner Workshop Series provides a resource on Furniture Cleaning and Care which addresses the tools and techniques of furniture cleaning.https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture- cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf Hammond-Harwood House, City of Bowie Museums. \\"Furniture Cleaning and Care,\\" Pages 1‚Äì2, accessed 4/23/2015 *Petroleum-free nitrile gloves *Cotton cloths *Synthetic cloths, \\"Pel cloth\\" and \\"Preserve-It\\" *Brushes, \\"Hake\\" or \\"Windsor-Newton\\" brushes *Distilled water *Liquefied hide glue, \\"Titebond Liquid Hide Glue\\", \\"Old Brown Glue\\" *Cotton swab, balls, or wool *Brush cleaner, \\"The Master's\\" *Paste or butchers wax, \\"Butchers\\", \\"Johnson\\", \\"Goddard's\\", and \\"Trewax\\" The Canadian Conservation Institute recommends that Micro-crystalline wax (a scent- and colour-free white paste wax that is available at specialty tool supply stores) can be used to increase the gloss of the finish, which will make it easier to remove fingerprints.

Physical geography Bridgeport Harbor is bordered by Long Island Sound and is formed by the estuary of the Pequonnock River and Yellow Mill and Johnson's Creeks, both tidal inlets. Between the estuary and Yellow Mill Pond is a peninsula, East Bridgeport, also known as the East Side, which was once the site of some of the largest manufacturing establishments in Connecticut, most of which no longer exist. On the far side of the Yellow Mill Pond inlet is the East End of Bridgeport, which is the easternmost portion of the city, which includes Pleasure Beach. Above the East End is the Mill Hill neighborhood and the border with Stratford, Connecticut. West of the Harbor and the Pequonnock River is the main portion of the city, with Downtown Bridgeport lining the river, the South End fronting on the lower harbor and Long Island Sound, the West Side between Fairfield, Connecticut and Downtown, and the North End extending from Downtown and the West Side to the border with Trumbull, Connecticut. Numerous factories, some of which are no longer in operation, line western sections the Metro North/New Haven Railroad line from the Bridgeport Station in Downtown, under Interstate 95 in the South End, and through the West Side and into Fairfield. The city is surrounded by hills up to 300 feet in height in the North End, the Upper East Side, and Mill Hill. There are two major parks in Bridgeport, the \\"Park City.\\" Beardsley is in the northeasterly part of the city and also contains Connecticut's only zoo, the Beardsley Zoo. It borders Bunnell's Pond, a 33-acre lake. Seaside is west of the harbor entrance and along the Sound in the South End. It has statues in honor of Elias Howe, who is credited with the invention of the sewing machine and who built a factory to manufacture his invention in the city 1863; and of P.T. Barnum, the showman, who lived in Bridgeport after 1846. He contributed much to the city, including the development of the East Side, Mountain Grove Cemetery, and Seaside Park. Seaside Park also has a soldiers' and sailors' monument. In the vicinity were located many upscale residences, now mostly demolished or converted to institutional use. Aside from the Pequonnock River and Yellow Mill Pond, there is Cedar Creek, a canal-like tidal creek that lies between Black Rock and Seaside Park. Black Rock Harbor lies at the mouth of the creek. Downtown Bridgeport The principal municipal buildings in Bridgeport are the city's two hospitals (St. Vincent's Medical Center and Bridgeport Hospital), the Barnum Museum, the Klein Memorial Auditorium, City Hall, the Fairfield County Courthouse, and the Main Post Office. =Bays and creeks= *Bridgeport Harbor is one of three (with New Haven and New London) major ports in Connecticut. It is formed by the confluence of Johnson's Creek, Yellow Mill Pond, and the Pequonnock River, and is the main outlet for the Great Meadows salt marsh in Stratford. In Colonial times it was known as \\"Newfield Harbor.\\" Its large size‚Äîrelative to the volume of the three small streams that empty into it‚Äîis attributable to the fact that, prior to the Wisconsin glaciation, it formed the mouth of the Housatonic River. *Lewis Gut is a tidal strait that separates the Great Meadows marsh from Long Beach/Pleasure Beach. It takes its name from Benjamin Lewis, who cultivated oysters in its waters in the 19th century. *Johnson's Creek is the estuary of Bruce Brook, at the easterly edge of the city and the westerly limit of the Great Meadows. It is named for the Johnson family, who assembled two large farms on either bank from the small holdings of the \\"New Field\\" in the early 19th century. A tide mill was built here shortly after the settlement of Stratford in 1639 (the mill pond backed up waters all the way to Stratford Avenue). In Colonial times it was known as Nessumpaws Creek, Neesingpaws Creek, or even Knees-and-Paws Creek. * Walker's Creek (aka Power House Channel) was a tidal outlet from a salt marsh that was filled in to form Newfield and Jessup Parks. It survives today in truncated form as the outlet of the East End Sewage Treatment Plant. *Yellow Mill Pond forms the estuary of Old Mill Brook. In 1792 its waters were dammed for the construction of a major tide mill, four stories in height, that was painted yellow. It burned in 1884 (the foundation can still be seen on the southwest side of the Stratford Avenue Bridge) and the dam was deconstructed shortly afterwards. *Berkshire Mill Pond was the site of another tide mill at the confluence of the Pequonnock River and Island Brook. The milldam was constructed in 1786 just to the south of the Berkshire Avenue Bridge. The pond was largely filled in the 1940s and '50s for the construction of a shopping center, two drive-in movie theaters, and a collection of automobile junk yards. A small remnant remains. * Black Rock Harbor is the located in the westerly portion of the city between Seaside Park and Black Rock. Its upper reaches penetrate the West End. In Colonial times this was considered the deepest and best port in Connecticut west of New London. It was able to accommodate ships of up to 1000 tons right up to the main wharves at the foot of the present Brewster Street. The harbor was protected on its south and east flanks by a Fayerweather Island that then included what is now the west end of Seaside Park. To the west and south was another landmass known as Lewis Island, which washed away during the course of the 18th century leaving only the treacherous shoal known as Penfield Reef. After the bar across the mouth of Bridgeport Harbor was dredged in the mid-19th century, Black Rock Harbor slipped into secondary importance. *Cedar Creek is a navigable waterway through the city's West End that connects with Black Rock Harbor. In its natural state it was very similar to Lewis Gut in the East End and separated a salt marsh from a barrier beach (the present Seaside Park). Beginning in 1878, dikes were constructed and the marshlands drained and filled and the waterway turned into a virtual canal to create a second harbor for a new factory district, under the auspices of P.T. Barnum. *Burr Creek was a northerly arm of Cedar Creek that extended as far as Fairfield Avenue. In the 1940s the portion above Yacht Street was filled, and the P.T. Barnum and Evergreen apartment complexes were constructed on the new land. The creek took its name from a 17th-century settler; Burr Road (which formerly included the present Dewey Street and Briarwood Avenue) ran down to its headwaters. A westerly embayment that abuts Ellsworth Field is known as \\"Brewster's Cove\\" after Captain Caleb Brewster, whose homestead it adjoined. *Ash Creek forms the western limit of the Black Rock neighborhood and separates it from Fairfield. In Colonial times it was known as the \\"Uncoway River\\" and formed the main harbor of Fairfield, until the construction of a causeway across it permitted access to the deeper harbor at Black Rock in the 1760s. Although numerous theories have been advanced by historians as to the origins of the name, it is likely that it comes from the red ash trees (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) that are common to this day along its banks. *Bridgeport Bight is the collective name for that portion of Long Island Sound offshore from the city between Stratford Point in Stratford and Penfield Reef off Fairfield. In former times these waters were known to have the largest natural-growth oyster beds on the East Coast north of the Chesapeake, source of a major industry in Bridgeport in the 19th and early-20th century. Islands *Fayerweather Island is a 7 1/2-acre wooded island in Long Island Sound connected to Seaside Park by a seawall and forming a natural adjunct to it. The island is the site of the Black Rock Harbor Light. *Pleasure Beach (formerly known as Steeplechase Island), is a 71-acre (sometimes) island located in Long Island Sound, to the south of city's East End, and is connected by the Long Beach sandspit to Stratford, Connecticut. * Great Marsh Island is a 14-acre island located near the mouth of Ash Creek in the Black Rock neighborhood. * South Island (aka 'Lovers Island')is a half-acre island in Bunnell's Pond created by dredging in the 19th century, connected to the mainland by the stone Henry Setzer Memorial Bridge. A corresponding \\"North Island\\" became a peninsula with additional dredging in the early 20th century.  Bodies of water  * Lake Forest (aka Island Brook Reservoir, elevation 165 feet) was created for municipal water supply in 1866 by damming Island Brook. In 1937, after the creation of Easton, Aspetuck, and Hemlock Reservoirs, the 71.4-acre lake had become surplus property, and the watershed lands surrounding it were laid out as a suburban housing development. * Charcoal Pond (aka Island Brook Lagoon, elevation 154 feet) lies just below Lake Forest and was created at the same time for purposes of filtering the city's drinking water. Its surface area covers 4.5 acres. * Bunnell's Pond (elevation 34 feet) was created in 1828 by damming the Pequonnock River to supply water power to a woolen mill that manufactured carpeting. To the south and west was a mill village that was named Thatchersville, after its progenitor, Daniel Thatcher (the Bunnell family succeeded him). It became the first source of municipal drinking water in 1854. The dam gave way in a flood in 1905 and was replaced by the current structure. It covers 33.4 acres. * Lake Success (elevation 47 feet) came into being in 1906 as part of \\"Powder Park,\\" a 422-acre forested area (known today as 'Remington Woods') that was used to store gunpowder and munitions of the Remington Arms Company a safe distance away from the city's residential areas. The 25-acre lake impounds the water of Old Mill Brook. * Stillman's Pond (elevation 21 feet) was made by damming Old Mill Brook in 1812 to power a mill operated by Wyllis Stillman that manufactured shirts for the New York City market. The dam and seven-acre pond were reconfigured when the Remington Arms Company Russian Rifle Plant was erected adjoining it in 1915. The water power at this location powered a grist mill beginning in 1652, the \\"old mill\\" commemorated in the names of Old Mill Green and Old Mill Hill. * Pembroke Lake (elevation 8 feet) was created by P.T. Barnum in 1862 as part of his real estate development in East Bridgeport. He erected a dam across the upper reaches of the tidal, salt-water Yellow Mill Pond, causing it to fill with fresh water as a pleasant adjunct to \\"Lake Village,\\" a suburban community that was laid out along Seaview Avenue between Huron Street and Ogden Street Extension. Much of this lake has been filled in for industrial development. * Bruce Pond (elevation 16 feet) was created by damming Bruce Brook (aka Stony Brook) at the Bridgeport-Stratford line in 1889. Its main purpose was as a source of ice, cut during the winter months to cool the city's iceboxes. It formerly extended north as far as Barnum Avenue. * Asylum Pond (elevation 26 feet) was dug out of a swampy area in the late 1860s to water cattle on what was the Town Poor Farm. * Lily Pond (elevation 16 feet) was one of two ponds dug out of marshy ground to provide drainage with the creation of Mountain Grove Cemetery in 1849. * Mirror Lake (aka Mummy or Mummichaug Pond‚Äîelevation sea level) was created with the first expansion of Seaside Park in 1872. It provides essential drainage to a below-sea-level portion of the park, diked and drained in the manner of a Dutch polder. Originally it was surrounded by a trotting park or racetrack for horses. The colloquial name comes from a type of minnow that could be gathered here in abundance and used for bait. * Horse Tavern Reservoir, aka Frenchtown Reservoir, survives as an intact earthen dam and dry lake bed in Elton Rogers Park, off Kaechele Place. A similar dry lake bed (constructed by the WPA in 1933) survives in Ninety Acres Park. Waterways *The Pequonnock River, the most significant of Bridgeport's watercourses, is a 16.7 mile waterway that has its headwaters in the town of Monroe and, like all the city's waterways, flows downslope and south toward Long Island Sound. It is dammed above Boston/North Avenues to form Bunnell's Pond. Below the Berkshire Avenue bridge it becomes a tidal salt-water estuary. South of Stillman Street it is a navigable waterway with a dredged channel. *The Rooster River is a stream in the western part of the city that forms part of the border between Bridgeport and Fairfield. Technically, the \\"Rooster River\\" is formed by the confluence of London Brook and Horse Tavern Brook at the rear of the Unquowa School property in Fairfield. Horse Tavern Brook, the larger of the two streams, has its source to the north of Canoe Brook Lake in Trumbull (which is formed by its waters). After flowing beneath the Trumbull Shopping Park, Horse Tavern Brook becomes known for a short stretch in the vicinity of Ox Hill in Bridgeport as \\"Ox Brook.\\" Above Interstate 95, the Rooster River enters a salt marsh, becomes tidal, and becomes known as Ash Creek. In Colonial times the entire watercourse was known as the \\"Uncoway River;\\" the present name is thought to be a corruption of \\"Rossiter,\\" the name of an early landowner. *Island Brook is a stream that flows through the North End of Bridgeport that originates in Island Brook Park in Trumbull. It is dammed to impound both Lake Forest and Charcoal Pond. It flows into the Pequonnock River between Island Brook Avenue and River Street. The name is a corruption of \\"Ireland's Brook,\\" so named from an early settler who resided along its banks on North Avenue. *Old Mill Brook is formed by the confluence of two streams that flow down from the Nichols section of Trumbull. It is dammed into Success Lake, Stillman's Pond and Pembroke Lake. In its original state, it formed a tidal estuary from Boston Avenue south. It flows into Yellow Mill Pond. It takes its name from a water-powered gristmill erected on the north side of Boston Avenue in 1652. *Bruce Brook has its source in the North End of Stratford, and forms a portion of Bridgeport's border with the Town of Stratford. It is dammed into Bruce Pond just above the New Haven Railroad tracks. It flows into Johnson's Creek immediately to the south of Lordship Boulevard. The stream takes its name from a Scottish settler who resided on the site of St. Michael's Cemetery in the early 19th century; prior to that time the stream was known as \\"Stony Brook.\\" Parks The \\"Park City\\" now has these parks: * Alice Street Lot, located on Alice Street * Baldwin Plaza, on Broad Street * Beardsley Park, located between East Main Street, Noble Avenue, and the Pequonnock River, an idealized rural landscape designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1878 * B.J.

Phillips Park, includes baseball diamond, basketball courts and playground at Trumbull Gardens on Trumbull Avenue Neighborhoods Historical postcard showing Bridgeport Harbor 1941 postcard showing Fairfield County Courthouse in Bridgeport Bridgeport comprises eight major subdivisions, most of which are divided into smaller neighborhoods: * Downtown Bridgeport is the site of the original seaport village of \\"Newfield\\" that began to develop in the 1760s and became an important regional center of commerce in the post- Revolutionary period (‚ÄòNewfield' was renamed ‚ÄòBridgeport' in the year 1800). Downtown is bounded on the east by the Pequonnock River and Bridgeport Harbor; on the north and west by the Route 25-8 Expressway (Col. Henry Mucci Highway); and on the south by Interstate 95 (Connecticut Turnpike). * The East Side, known in the 19th century as East Bridgeport, is the area between Yellow Mill Pond/Old Mill Brook and the Pequonnock River. In the pre-Revolutionary times the portion south of the railroad tracks was Newpasture Point (like Newfield, one of the common fields of the town of Stratford), and the area north of the tracks up to Boston Avenue (developed by P.T. Barnum and William H. Noble beginning in 1850) was Pembroke City, ‚ÄòPembroke' being a corruption of ‚ÄòPann Brook,' after the Pann family of Indians (also dating back to 17th-century deeds). \\"Pann\\" in the Quripi language refers to the waterfall located where Boston Avenue crosses Old Mill Brook. From Boston Avenue north to Beardsley Park and the intersection of Huntington Turnpike and East Main Street was laid out in the first years of the 20th century as Beardsley Park Slope, a calculated reference to the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, at that time the most exclusive residential precinct in America. The territory from the Huntington/East Main intersection north to the Trumbull line was known for generations as Briarwood, after the 325-acre farm of the Thompson family that fronted on Huntington Turnpike. In recent decades the name Treeland (after the garden center that was one of the neighborhood's first businesses) has come into common use. Collectively, these last two neighborhoods comprise the Upper East Side. * The East End is that part of the city to the east of Yellow Mill Pond and Old Mill Creek, the territory annexed from Stratford in 1889. It is subdivided into Newfield (south of Stratford Avenue and west of Blackman's Creek [an arm of Johnson's Creek that adjoins Central Avenue]); East End Proper (north of Stratford Avenue and east of Blackman's Creek up to the New Haven railroad tracks); Old Mill Hill (north of the railroad tracks to Granfield Avenue/Stewart Street); and Success (north of Granfield/Stewart and including much of the present Remington Woods), which is a Native American name in use since the 17th century. * The South End is that section of the city south of State Street and east of Went Field that abuts Downtown. Since the filling in of a salt marsh and tidal flats to the west of Barnum Dyke after 1919, Fayerweather Island was more-or-less annexed to the South End from Black Rock, with which it was historically associated. The exclusive residential district south of Atlantic Street (now the University of Bridgeport campus) was long known as Marina Park (named for P.T. Barnum's palatial residence) to distinguish itself from the working-class blocks to the north. The blocks around the intersection of Main and Whiting Streets once comprised a village of free people of color called in its early days (1821‚Äì47) \\"Ethiope,\\" and, later (1847-late 1800s) \\"Liberia.\\" Today this historic community is widely known as Little Liberia. * The area now known collectively as The Hollow is an amalgamation of several historic communities. Golden Hill was the well-to-do neighborhood (largely obliterated by highway construction and commercial development) that occupied the hill to the west of Pequonnock and Congress Streets. Sterling Hill was an early-19th-century Irish settlement on the north and east slopes (named not for the less-expensive metal but for its progenitor, Daniel H. Sterling). The area north of Harral Avenue to North Avenue, the Hollow Proper of the present day, was known in the 19th century by the bucolic name of Golden Valley. From Madison Avenue west to the Pequonnock River is a section still known as Bull's Head, after a tavern of that name that stood at the corner of Main and Frank Streets that was a favorite stop of cattle drovers from Monroe and Newtown in the 1790s. Island Brook is an area located to the south of North Avenue between the Pequonnock River and Housatonic Avenue. Beginning in 1786 it was the site of a village built around a grist mill that was known prior to the 1850s as \\"Berkshire.\\" * Like the East End, the West End was annexed from a neighboring town, in this case Fairfield, in 1870. It occupies that entire portion of the city between Park Avenue and the Rooster River, except for Black Rock and the upper part of the South End. Traditionally, the area to the east of Clinton Avenue was known as the West Side, while to the west of it was the West End Proper. The neighborhood bounded by North, Laurel, Capitol, and Park Avenues (and up to the present Central High School) was laid out as another elite development beginning in 1914 and was called Beach's Woods, site of the Beach family's farm that dated back to the Revolutionary War era. The part to the south of the railroad tracks and turnpike, reclaimed from salt marsh in the 1880s and '90s and demolished in the 1960s, was called Hunktown by virtue of its homogenous Hungarian-American population. Brooklawn was, historically, entirely within the bounds of Fairfield (laid out as an expensive estate district surrounding Brooklawn Country Club in 1892). That portion of Stratfield Road that extended into Bridgeport was renamed Brooklawn Avenue as part of the development scheme. The name has come into common use in recent years to designate that section north of North Avenue and east of Park Avenue that was known in the 19th century as \\"Goosetown.\\" * Black Rock is a peninsula that extends southwesterly from the West End between Black Rock Harbor and Ash Creek. Its boundaries made it even more insular prior to the 1940s, when the filled land that now contains the P.T. Barnum housing project was a saltwater inlet known as Burr Creek. Black Rock was a part of the Town of Fairfield until 1870, and before the Civil War was one of the state's most important seaports and shipbuilding centers (the historic village became the city's first historic district). The elite enclave at the tip of the peninsula was generally known as Grover's Hill until 1926, when the Black Rock Land & Improvement Company felt that St. Mary's by-the-Sea had a better ring to it. * The North End is bounded by Park and North Avenues, the Trumbull town line, and the Pequonnock River. Starting on the east, the hill that is bisected by Sylvan Avenue was known to previous generations as Rocky Hill. Real estate developers of the 1940s and '50s promoted it as Sylvan Crest. To the west, the next hill over, bisected by Reservoir Avenue and westerly to Island Brook, was known from the late-18th century as Chopsey Hill (after ‚ÄòJohn Pork Chop,' an Indian who occupied a Paugussett Indian reservation where the Trumbull Gardens housing complex is now located). During Prohibition it was still quite rural, and building lots could be procured for as little as $75. After a number of raids on illicit distillery operations the Bridgeport Herald dubbed it \\"Whiskey Hill.\\" The hill to the west, extending from Island Brook to the vicinity of Wayne Street (with Summit Street appropriately at its summit), has no name in common parlance today. In the 18th and 19th century it was known as Cow Hill, an appropriate mate to Ox Hill located along Main Street above Anton Street. To the south of Cow Hill, from Salem Street down to North Avenue and west to Beachwood Park, is an area commonly known as the Old North End. Two more hills define the North End, Toilsome Hill (approximately bounded by Wayne Street, Park and Capitol Avenues and Rooster River Boulevard; and Chestnut Hill (north of Toilsome Hill to the Trumbull line). And completing the circle is Lake Forest (a late-1930s suburban development of the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company's outmoded Island Brook Reservoir, which dates back to 1866), and Charcoal Pond (where the city's drinking water was once filtered). Climate Bridgeport is located along Long Island Sound at the mouth of the Pequonnock River, named for the Native American tribe who historically lived along it. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 17.53%, is water. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, Bridgeport straddles the humid subtropical (Cfa) and a humid continental (Dfa), with some maritime influence; it is part of USDA hardiness zone 7a. The normal average monthly temperature ranges from in January to in July; on average, there are 20 days where the temperature remains at or below freezing and 7.6 days with a high at or above annually; the last year to not reach the latter mark was 2004. Temperatures reaching or are rare, and were last seen respectively on February 24, 2015 and July 22, 2011. The record low is , set on January 22, 1984, while the record high is , set on July 22 in 1957 and 2011. Precipitation averages annually, and is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, though March and April are the wettest months in terms of total precipitation. Snowfall averages per winter, falling almost entirely from December to March. As is typical of coastal Connecticut, snow cover does not usually remain for long, with an average of 29 days per winter with snow cover of at least .

It is also one of the most widely cultivated of the genus because of its attractive flowers which occur over a long period and for its adaptability to a range of climates. It is a medium-sized shrub normally high with coarse, fibrous bark. Description Melaleuca lateritia is an erect shrub growing to about high, to wide. The leaves are light green, thin, linear, concave and glabrous, long, wide and with a pointed tip. They are spirally arranged around the stem. The flowers are bright-orange red, in spikes to long and in diameter on lateral branches from old wood, the stem continuing to grow beyond the flowers. Flowering occurs over an extended period from August to April and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules about in diameter which last for many years without releasing their seeds. M. lateritia fruit M. lateritia growing in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca lateritia was first formally described in 1859 by Albert Gottfried Dietrich in Allgemeine Gartenzeitung, published by Christoph Friedrich Otto and A.G. Dietrich. The specific epithet (lateritia) is from the Latin lateritius, meaning \\"of bricks\\" referring to the brick-red colour of the flowers. Distribution and habitat Robin redbreast bush occurs in the Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It grows in sandy soil in swampy areas. Conservation status Melaleuca lateritia is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Melaleuca lateritia is widely cultivated and it is well established in general horticulture. Although native to a dry summer climate it is one of the more adaptable to the wetter summer conditions of Australia's east coast.

Clemson has set both short- and long-term goals, on a scale of up to 15 years. Known as the Solid Green campaign, Clemson has a mission to reduce total energy used by 20% in the year 2020, reach a goal of becoming net-zero in carbon emissions, and replace the coal-fired boiler in 2015. Clemson has the long-term desire to become much more energy efficient, climate considerate and recycle more. One way of funding these initiatives is the Student Sustainability Fee, also known as the Green Fee, which students can elect to pay $10 with their tuition each semester.  Recycling Initiative  Starting out as a campaign to eliminate litter on campus in 2006, the Solid Green initiative has progressed to achieve other goals. One such example is Gameday Recycling, which was started in 2009 and has exponentially increased in tonnage recycled. This project involves over 80,000 people on any given home weekend, a way for Clemson University to educate the public about the Solid Green campaign. Trash bags are placed at each parking spot and volunteers go around after the games collecting the trash and taking it to the recycling center. Recycling bins are placed in each dorm room with recycling containers at the base of each dormitory. Offices and classrooms on campus have completely replaced regular waste bins with recycling bins. There is also a massive recycling center at Kite Hill, which is open to anyone. Clemson students compete in RecycleMania each year, a nationwide event in which college campuses compete to recycle the most waste. At Cherry Crossing Research Facility, the community can drop off unused food for compost, or yard waste to be recycled as mulch, an extra effort by the university to decrease their carbon footprint. University faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities around campus to recycle and to educate their students about the importance of conserving our valuable resources. The importance of recycling is evident anywhere on campus with the display of recycling bins, reminders to conserve energy, and Solid Green paraphernalia.  LEED Certification  Clemson University hopes to achieve their goal of obtaining the LEED silver rating for all newly constructed buildings. LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is a program that awards the buildings with the best building strategies based on a point system in order to achieve different levels of certification. ‚ÄúThe LEED¬Æ green building certification program is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of green buildings. It contains prerequisites and credits in five categories: sustainable site planning, improving energy efficiency, conserving materials and resources, embracing indoor environmental quality, and safeguarding water‚Äù (LEED projects). Clemson has numerous projects through which they aim to achieve LEED certification. The Baruch Institute, the Duke Energy Innovation Center, and the Fraternity Quad are just a few examples of the projects that will be completed. Clemson University chose to participate in this project because they believe the LEED projects will allow them to be considered environmentally friendly. This certificate show that they have satisfied the qualifications that the LEED claims to be environmentally friendly.  Energy Reduction and Carbon Emissions  Clemson has made their plan to become sustainable publicly by creating specific goals that they hope to achieve. One goal is described by the 20/20 plan. This means that Clemson is striving to reduce energy use on campus 20% per gross square foot of building space by the year 2020. The most significant way they are doing this is installing solar panels on two pre-existing buildings, the Fluor Daniel Engineering Innovation Building and the Life Sciences Building. Another way they are implementing this goal is by replacing old lightbulbs to LEDs throughout campus. So far, they have changed half of the campus from the old lightbulbs to the new lightbulbs. Another goal Clemson is trying to reach through the Solid Green campaign is for Clemson to become carbon neutral. The main way they are trying to do this is by having the CATbus system. This is lowering carbon emissions because many students are riding the bus to and from classes instead of driving. There are buses that go to a number of off campus housing complexes along with around campus. They believe that this allows students to appreciate the convenience of not having to find parking on campus along with not having to walk as far to class.  Other Notable Accomplishments  In addition to the specific goals of the Solid Green initiative, Clemson also offers several organizations in which students and faculty can take part in. Students for Environmental Action began in 1992 and the club works on several different environmental projects each year, their most successful being the founding of the Student Sustainability Initiative, supported by the Green Fee. Clemson also has a student-led organic farm, which is dedicated to ‚Äúresearch, education, and public outreach programs.‚Äù Sustainability Week will be February 18-22, 2015.

The shop and affiliated Kalo Arts and Crafts Community House, a training school and workshop noted for silver and jewelry in nearby Park Ridge, Illinois, were founded in 1900 by a group of six young women who had trained at the Art Institute of Chicago. Clara Pauline Barck Welles (1868-1965) was the group's leader and most notable member. The other founders were: Bertha Hall, Rose Dolese, Grace Gerow, Ruth Raymond, and Bessie McNeal. The group, at first, worked in a variety of materials and media including burnt wood and leather but by the time the Chicago shop was opened in 1914, it was focused on silver, copper, and jewelry, though it rapidly transitioned to hand wrought silver flatware and hollowware, and gold and silver jewelry. In 1959, Barck Wells transferred the shop to four of the craftsmen; Robert Bower, Daniel Pederson, Arne Myhre, and Yngve Olsson. Barck hired women designers almost exclusively, although the immigrant Scandinavian craftsmen were male. At its peak, Kalo employed 25 silversmiths. After Barck's retirement, the firm continued to produce the pieces designed under her leadership until 1970, when it closed, due to the difficulty of finding young people willing to apprentice as silversmiths. In the summer 1992 issue of American Silversmith, Bower, the last, surviving Kalo silversmith, explained to an interviewer that, \\"We ran out of silversmiths. In the last year we lost our three top silversmiths; men who could not be replaced.

According to NSR's website, \\"NSR promotes world healing by broadcasting inspirational and educational voices of peace and social justice, using the language of personal story, music, and spirituality.\\" History =Creating the show= The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened a filing window for obtaining low power FM (LPFM) radio licenses in January 2000. An environmental and activist organization by the name of Northern Thunder in Eau Claire, Wisconsin applied for an LPFM for the local station called WHYS Radio. The FCC granted the license, and, once the headquarters for the station were completed, they began broadcasting in spring 2005. During discussion about potential programs to be included in the station's schedule, the possibility of a Sunday program related to spirituality and social action was raised, and local Quaker activist Mark Helpsmeet's name was suggested as a potential host. He was invited to submit a proposal, but Helpsmeet declined their invitation, stating that he was too busy at that point to pursue a future in broadcasting. Shortly thereafter, Helpsmeet had asked for and began meeting with a clearness committee to help discern his future work. A second invitation to create programming for WHYS Radio came, so with the clearness committee's support, and with support from the general community, the WHYS Radio programming committee eventually agreed to the offer of two one-hour-long weekly programs by Helpsmeet. On July 26, 2005, Eau Claire Friends Meeting (ECFM), a local monthly meeting that Helpsmeet had been part of, united in creating a support committee for NSR and in taking the work under the care of ECFM. =Early stages= Helpsmeet first created NSR's first program, \\"Spirit in Action\\", which aired on July 31, 2005. His next program, \\"Song of the Soul\\", followed and aired on August 14 of the same year. The shows respectively feature a variety of people who dedicate themselves to lives \\"of fruitful service, of peace, community, compassion, creative action and progressive efforts\\" and songs that describe people's spiritual journeys through life that have truly spoken to them in their depths. For the first year of NSR programming, a support committee was provided by ECFM. ECFM then requested a support committee (which is also known as an \\"anchoring committee\\") from the regional association of Quakers with which ECFM is affiliated, Northern Yearly Meeting. Northern Yearly Meeting's Ministry and Nurture Committee appointed a support committee, which Helpsmeet met with regularly until the anchoring function shifted back to ECFM in 2013. After two years of making programs, Helpsmeet made NSR programs available for syndication. WDRT and WIDE-LP were among the first stations to start carrying the shows, with KLOI-LP Lopez Island Community Radio and WKNH of Keene State College following close behind. Several more stations began carrying NSR programs when the shows started being shared on The Pacifica AudioPort in 2008. =Incorporation and nonprofit status= In 2012, the anchoring committee and Helpsmeet met and decided that it was time for NSR to move forward and become incorporated. A board of directors was established and Northern Spirit Radio was incorporated in Wisconsin on May 17, 2013. Following its incorporation, the NSR board of directors prepared and submitted an application for 501(c)(3) status, which the IRS approved in July 2014. Broadcasting locations As of February 2015, NSR airs on approximately 20 stations across the United States, including three in California and Wisconsin, two in Iowa, Vermont, and Washington, and others in Colorado, Missouri, New York, and Virginia. International connections While NSR is based in Wisconsin, the station follows stories of social justice and peace from across the world. Helpsmeet has interviewed people from Australia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, England, Estonia, Israel, and Rwanda. Since the broadcasts are made available online via NSR's official website and podcasts, its following is worldwide. Activism NSR has featured many guests on \\"Spirit in Action\\" that focus on current social issues faced by people across the United States and around the rest of the world. Education, racial and gender equality, equal marriage, environmentalism, and the conflicts in the Middle East only encompass a few topics that the show covers. Some examples of interviews that include these themes are \\"Fruitful Lesbian Lives\\", \\"War Taxes, Injustice in Palestine, Racism - A Life of Faith, Joy, & Service\\", and \\"Protecting Oklahoma from the Keystone XL Pipeline\\". Musicians The Song of the Soul program typically features interviews with a wide range of musicians, some nationally known, some known primarily within limited circles. Nationally known performers have included Cris Williamson, Peggy Seeger, Red Grammer, Gordon Bok, Kim and Reggie Harris, Peter Alsop, Bob Franke, Fred Small, David Rovics, Charlie King, Susan Werner, Magpie, Sonny Ochs, Carrie Newcomer, among many others. Spirituality NSR programs highlight, in addition to the activism or musical aspects of the guests, exploration of their religious or spiritual beliefs, motivations, or practices. Occasionally this has included guests who are especially known for their theological studies and writings, like John Shelby Spong, Marcus Borg, Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, Gary Dorrien, Philip Gulley, Ken Stone, and others.

Verae alchemiae artisque metallica Verae alchemiae artisque metallica relied heavily on the earlier printed alchemical collection De Alchemia and was in turn heavily relied upon for the Theatrum Chemicum. Gratorolo omitted only the Tabula Smaragdina and Ortulanus' commentary on it from volume 1; these had been published separately a year earlier in 1560, although falsely attributed to Johannes de Garlandia. Above all, Gratorolo wanted to publish the works of Pseudo-Lull and Pseudo- Geber. The contents of the 1561 edition are as follows:.As given in John Ferguson, Bibliotheca Chemica, vol. 1 (1906), 341.

It was written by Adam Ant & Marco Pirroni, and features the two drummer Burundi beat for which Adam and the Ants would become famous. Released as a 7\\" single on 3 October 1980, it was their first top ten hit. Top of the Pops Shortly after the single's release, the band performed \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" on Top of the Pops on 16 October 1980, helping launch the single to number 4 on the UK Singles Chart, and increasing anticipation from the forthcoming album Kings of the Wild Frontier (released 3 November 1980). Lyrics In his 2007 autobiography, Stand and Deliver, Adam said that \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" was inspired by a Margaret Thatcher quote he'd read in a newspaper. The expression refers to a situation of fierce competition in which people are willing to harm each other in order to succeed. The lyrics of this song are about bands in competition with each other, and doing just that. \\"Physical (You're So)\\" The B-side to the single was \\"Physical (You're So).\\" It was a rerecording of an old favourite among \\"Antpeople\\" which, up to this point, had been known as \\"Physical\\" or \\"You're So Physical.\\" The song was first recorded by Ant as a four track home demo in the Chelsea flat of Linda Ashby and was first played live in March 1978. Adam and the Ants performed the song at a John Peel session on 10 July 1978 and recorded a full band demo at Decca Studios circa August 1978. Originally a medium-fast song, the tempo was gradually slowed down until by late 1978 it was a slow song. Although used as a set opener on the Spring 1980 Ants Invasion UK tour, since late 1980 onwards it has been mostly used as a final encore with Ant removing his shirt during the opening chords. This particular version was recorded during the Kings of the Wild Frontier LP sessions circa August 1980. On this version, Ant can be heard saying, \\"Eat your heart out Do It,\\" during the track's opening riff in direct reference to Do It Records' unofficial release of an old version of the song which had been recorded during sessions for Dirk Wears White Sox and then discarded from the track listing, on the B-side of the Zerox single repress some months earlier. This version, along with two other Dirk out-takes, was reissued in March 1982 as The Antmusic EP. \\"Physical (You're So)\\" was not included on the UK edition of Kings of the Wild Frontier. However, when the album was released in the US, the track \\"Making History\\" was dropped in favour of \\"Physical (You're So)\\" & \\"Press Darlings\\" (the B-side of \\"Kings of the Wild Frontier\\") for the American release. \\"Physical\\" was covered by Nine Inch Nails, and appears as one of the two bonus songs on Broken.

A textile conservator's first task is to write a treatment proposal that includes an examination of the object and condition issues. A typical report includes a technical description of an object, historical data, information on the object's present state, recommendations for treatment, and expected results of treatment. Extensive written and photographic documentation is made. During treatment, photo documentation is also maintained, as well as after. After treatment, a final treatment report is completed and includes recommendations for continued care.Bachmann, Konstanze (ed.), Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators (1992). Smithsonian Institution: Washington, D.C. Textile conservators must be able to treat all types of media used. As textiles may include additional adornments, such as glass beads or metal fringes, conservators must have a wide knowledge of preservation techniques for all types of media and material. =Tools of the trade= For examination, handling and/or treatment, can include: gloves (cotton, vinyl, latex, or nitrile), a lab coat, a respirator, safety glasses, a magnifier; binocular microscope; magnifying glass; microscope; and other lab related equipment.

He was named Andrew and Erna Viterbi Early Career Chair in 2015, and was awarded the Google Faculty Research Award and the Okawa Foundation Research Grant the same year. Li won an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 2018 and was named to the DARPA ISAT Study Group in 2019. He is a member of the Global Future Council on Virtual and Augmented Reality of the World Economic Forum.  Biography  Li was born in 1981 in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany (then West Germany). His parents are both Taiwanese immigrants living in Germany. He went to a French-German high school in Saarbr√ºcken and speaks four languages (English, German, French, and Mandarin Chinese). He obtained his Diplom (eq. M.Sc.) in Computer Science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (then University of Karlsruhe (TH)) in 2006 and his PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich in 2010. He was a visiting researcher at ENSIMAG in 2003, the National University of Singapore in 2006, Stanford University in 2008, and EPFL in 2010. He was also a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University and Princeton University between 2011 and 2012. = Career = Li joined Industrial Light & Magic / Lucasfilm in 2012 as a research lead to develop the next generation real-time performance capture technologies for virtual production and visual effects. He has been on the faculty in the Computer Science department at the University of Southern California since 2013, where he is currently an associate professor. In 2014, he spent a summer as a visiting professor at Weta Digital working on facial tracking and hair digitization technologies for the visual effects of Furious 7 and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. In 2015, he founded Pinscreen, Inc., an Artificial Intelligence startup that specializes on the creation of photorealistic virtual avatars using advanced machine learning algorithms. In 2016, he was appointed director of the Vision and Graphics Lab at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies. = Research = He has worked on dynamic geometry processing and data-driven techniques for making 3D human digitization and facial animation. During his PhD, Li co-created a real-time and markerless system for performance-driven facial animation based on depth sensors which won the best paper award at the ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation in 2009. The team later commercialized a variant of this technology as the facial animation software Faceshift (acquired by Apple Inc. in 2015 and incorporated into the iPhone X in 2017). This technique in deformable shape registration is used by the company C-Rad AB and deployed in hospitals for tracking tumors in real-time during radiation therapy. In 2013, he worked on a home scanning system that uses a Kinect to capture people into game characters or realistic miniature versions. This technology was licensed by Artec and released as a free software Shapify.me. In 2014, he was brought on as visiting professor at Weta Digital to build the high-fidelity facial performance capture pipeline for reenacting the deceased actor Paul Walker in the movie Furious 7 (2015). Hao Li speaking at the World Economic Forum 2020 His recent research focuses on combining techniques in Deep Learning and Computer Graphics to facilitate the creation of 3D avatars and to enable true immersive face-to-face communication and telepresence in Virtual Reality. In collaboration with Oculus / Facebook, in 2015 he helped developed a facial performance sensing head-mounted display, which allows users to transfer their facial expressions onto their digital avatars while being immersed in a virtual environment. In the same year, he founded the company Pinscreen, Inc. in Los Angeles, which introduced a technology that can generate realistic 3D avatars of a person including the hair from a single photograph. They also work on deep neural networks that can infer photorealistic faces and expressions, which has been showcased at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2019 of the World Economic Forum in Dalian. Due to the ease of generating and manipulating digital faces, Hao has been raising public awareness about the threat of manipulated videos such as deepfakes. In 2019, Hao and media forensics expert, Hany Farid, from the University of California, Berkeley, released a research paper outlining a new method for spotting deepfakes by analyzing facial expression and movement patterns of a specific person. With the rapid progress in artificial intelligence and computer graphics, Li has predicted that genuine videos and deepfakes will become indistinguishable in as soon as 6 to 12 months, as of September 2019. In January 2020, Li spoke at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020 in Davos about deepfakes and how they could pose a danger to society. Li and his team at Pinscreen, Inc. also demonstrated a real-time deepfake technology at the annual meeting, where the faces of celebrities are superimposed onto the participants' face. = Awards = *DARPA Information Science and Technology (ISAT) Study Group Member. *Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award. * Andrew and Erna Viterbi Early Career Chair. * Okawa Foundation Research Grant. * Google Faculty Research Award. * World's top 35 innovator under 35 by MIT Technology Review. * Best Paper Award at the ACM SIGGRAPH / Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation 2009.

Its partners were Mary Gannon (1867-1932) and Alice Hands. In the firm's very short existence (1894‚Äìca. 1900), it became known for innovative approaches to low-cost urban housing. Founders' early lives Mary Nevan Gannon was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1867. With some prior experience in an architect's office, she entered the New York School of Applied Design for Women in 1892 as part of its first class. Her future partner Alice J. Hands was one of her classmates. Even less is known about Hands than about Gannon, apart from the fact that she had been studying at the New York City YWCA for a couple of years before entering NYSAD. Gannon and Hands thrived at the school, winning awards for their drawings as well as architectural commissions while they were still students, including the Woman's Building for the 1895 Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. Architectural work Right after graduating in 1894, the two women opened their own architectural practice, Gannon and Hands, and in that same year they won a large commission to design a hospital in San Francisco with a project budget in the neighborhood of $30,000‚Äì$40,000. After the Florence Hospital was opened, it received praise from physicians as a model of \\"sanitation, convenience, and architectural beauty.\\" Early in their career, Gannon and Hands joined a city task force, the Sanitary Investigations Committee, and went the extra step of living in a New York tenement in order to better understand urban living conditions for the poor. Calling New York's tenements \\"a reproach to the humanitarianism of this enlightened century,\\" they set to work to find better solutions to urban housing for the poor. The firm quickly became noted for designing innovative apartment buildings that were affordable, sanitary, well-ventilated, and practical. One of their model tenements was designed around a central court (for light and air), with balconies for each apartment, front and rear fire escapes, and ash chutes and garbage receptacles for refuse management. Some were specifically designed for the rising class of young urban working women, and the partners were elected to the Women's Health Protective Association of New York. Gannon and Hands were praised by the social reformer Jacob Riis in his book A Ten Years' War (1900) for their light and airy buildings; he credited them with solving \\"the problem of building a decent tenement on a twenty-five-foot lot\\"‚Äîa problem he admitted that he himself had thought insoluble. Similarly, philanthropist Sir Sidney Waterlow, who was chairman of the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company in London, called their work \\"the best plans for single tenements I have ever seen, the most clever and ingenious.\\" As late as the 1930s, their apartment designs were still being reproduced as models of low-cost housing. Other buildings Gannon and Hands designed include a hotel in New York, a women's club building in New York, a summer home for women students in Twilight Park, seaside cottages in New Jersey, and mountain cabins in the Catskills. There was also a lavish, $50,000 villa designed for a California client and modeled on the Russian tsar's Livadia Palace. They were known for overseeing the actual building work themselves (except when an engineer was needed). In 1897, Mary Gannon married John Walp Doutrich and that same year the firm moved to a more upscale neighborhood, indicating that it had achieved a degree of success. However, there is little information about Gannon and Hands post-1900, which is around the time that Gannon moved with her husband and new son to Spokane, Washington. It is likely that the firm disbanded early in the new century.

The Wisconsin Naval Militia served as a military reserve force for the state of Wisconsin, and was organized as a naval parallel to the Wisconsin National Guard. History The Wisconsin Naval Militia was first created on 28 April 1909 when the Wisconsin Legislature authorized a naval militia consisting of one battalion of four companies. The naval militia maintained units at Ashland and Bayfield until World War I. By 1914, the naval militia had reached a strength of 160 men organized into three companies. In 1916, the naval militia was temporarily disbanded due to the inability of the state to procure a ship to be used for training purposes; however, new units were immediately reorganized in different parts of the state, funded with money raised by private donors. The naval militia was reorganized in 1927 with units in Milwaukee and Madison. The Wisconsin Naval Militia was officially disbanded in 1955. Legal status The right of states to organize and maintain naval militias is recognized by the federal government of the United States under 10 U.S. Code ¬ß7851. Any naval militia may receive access to vessels, material, armament, equipment, and other facilities of the Navy and the Marine Corps which are available to the Navy Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve if 95% or more of the naval militia's manpower is recruited from the United States Navy Reserve or the United States Marine Corps Reserve. Reactivation effort In the spring of 2001, the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs announced the findings of a year-long study which found that reactivating the Wisconsin Naval Militia would likely prove to be a cost-effective enhancement to Wisconsin's emergency medical response capability. A bill which would have reactivated the naval militia passed the assembly of the Wisconsin Legislature by a wide margin but failed in the senate. Subsequent bills intended to reactivate the naval militia have also failed.

Raced only three times in her lifetime, her only win occurred in the Oaks. Despite being a daughter of two English Classic winners, Mirska was not favoured to win the Oaks and won the race at 33-1 odds against the Derby winner and favourite Tagalie. She made no impact as a broodmare in France. Background Mirska was bred by Douglas Baird. Mirska's sire St. Frusquin was an outstanding racehorse who won the 2000 Guineas and the Eclipse Stakes in 1896. As a stallion he was Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland on two occasions and sired the Classic winners Rosedrop (1910 Epsom Oaks), Flair (1906 1000 Guineas) and Quintessence (1903 1000 Guineas). Mirska's dam, Musa, won the Oaks in 1899 for her owner Douglas Baird. After Baird's death in April 1909, Musa was bought by Jean Prat (c. 1848 - 1940), a French turfman, for 4,000 guineas. Musa and her nursing foal Mirska were sent to Prat's Lessard- le-Ch√™ne stud in Saint-Julien-le-Faucon, France in 1909. Mirska's half-brother Montmartin was a sire in France and her full-brother Feramorz was a sire in New Zealand. Mirska was a bay filly with a narrow white strip and four white socks. She was trained at Newmarket by Tom Jennings, Jr. Racing career Mirska ran only three times in her racing career. As a two-year-old she was twice third and her only known race as a three-year-old was the Oaks. She was retired from racing immediately after the Oaks.

Scratched from the Coventry Stakes in June, her first engagement was in the Clearwell Stakes run at Newmarket on 10 October. Though noted to be \\"attractively-bred\\" by the press, she was not looked on favorably by the racing public despite her excellent pedigree. Ridden by the French jockey Georges Stern, she finished third in the race behind J. B. Joel colt Absurd and Khedive III. She was again third in the Maiden 2-year-old race at the Second October meeting at Newmarket won by Tidal Wave. In November, she was scratched for her last engagement, the Rangemore Plate. =The 1912 Epsom Oaks= On 5 June at Epsom Racecourse Mirska, ridden by Joe Childs started a 33/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field for the 134th running of the Oaks Stakes. The overwhelming favourite was Tagalie, who had won the 1000 Guineas and defeated male opposition to win the Epsom Derby. Racing on heavy ground Mirska overtook the weakening Tagalie in the straight and drew away to win by three lengths. Retirement Mirska was retired from racing immediately after her Oaks victory. She returned to Prat's stud in France and was covered by Rock Sand at the Haras de Villebon in 1913. There is no record of the Rock Sand foal racing or if Mirska was rebred.

It lay on an important trade route in the east‚Äìwest direction of Holland, and in the immediate vicinity of the major north‚Äìsouth connection from the Rhineland in the north and Friesland, Bremen, and also later L√ºbeck. As the principal market of rye, it was almost completely destroyed in the Second World War, and rebuilt thereafter to a large extent on the basis of the original.

Early life  Lavrinenkov was born on 17 May 1919 in the village of Ptakhino, at the time located within the Smolensky Uyezd of the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian SFSR before the formation of the Soviet Union. After completing his seventh year of secondary education on Peresna he attended a trade school in the city of Smolensk. Upon graduating from the trade school in 1935 he was employed at a local aircraft factory, and in 1939 he completed training at the Smolensk aeroclub before he entered the military in February 1940. After he graduated from the Chuguev Military Aviation School of Pilots in January the next year he served as a flight instructor at the Chernigov Military Aviation Pilot School, which had to evacuated to Zernograd in July due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In November, a regiment of the 102nd Fighter Aviation Division composed of the instructors from the school was formed for providing air cover in Stalingrad.  World War II  Lavrinenkov was first deployed in the war to Stalingrad as a pilot in the 651st Fighter Aviation Regiment. There he flew an I-15, on which he engaged in his first dogfight after attempted to attack an He-111. After the incident his plane was left with only one landing wheel intact, but he still managed to safely land his plane. After retraining to fly the Yak-1 he was reassigned in June 1942 to the 753rd Fighter Aviation Regiment as a flight commander, and on 8 July he scored his first aerial victory when he shot down an Me-109 during an intense counterattack. Later he and his wingman Pyotr Tilchenko dueled against a group of six Me-110; Tilchenko was killed in action after hitting down two of them, but Lavrinenkov survived. In August he was transferred to the 4th Fighter Aviation Regiment. As a deputy squadron commander piloting the Yak-7B on the Stalingrad front, he quickly increased his victory tally, gaining nine aerial victories in a span of three months. In October, Lavrinenkov and many of his colleagues, including Amet-khan Sultan and Ivan Borisov, were assigned to the newly formed \\"regiment of aces\\", the 9th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, which consisted of aces and pilots considered potential aces. Upon arrival to the new regiment he switched back to flying the Yak-1 as deputy squadron commander. During a mission with Yekaterina Budanova on 26 December 1942 he shot down an He-111; the fuselage and wing of his plane was badly damaged by enemy fire, but he was able to land safely. For having gained 16 solo victories and made 322 sorties he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 28 January 1943; the title was conferred on 1 May 1943. German forces captured Lavrinenkov on 24 August 1943 when he was forced to parachute out of his plane and landed in a German trench after he rammed an FW-190. Despite being captured in the Rostov oblast, he was flown to Dniprodzerzhynsk before he was placed on a train en route to Berlin. In hopes that the Germans would be less careful in watching him if he pretended to have no intentions of escaping, he initially made no attempts to resist his captors. While on the train to Berlin and under guard, he and another Soviet pilot waited for their guards to be in a moment of weakness before they both jumped out the train at high speed and hid under the cover of the darkness of night. On 9 September 1943 they met up with the partisan unit named after V.I.Chapaev; the two pilots participated in partisan activities on the ground until the Soviet infantry fully took over on 29 September 1943. Upon returning from being a prisoner-of-war, Lavrinenkov was warmly greeted by Lieutenant-general Timofey Khryukin, his medals were returned to him, and he was reinstated into the Air Force. His shoulder boards were personally presented to him by Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin. He returned to flying soon after his reinstatement, and on 1 November 1943 he scored his first aerial victory while flying the P-39. At the end of the year he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union again for having accumulated 28 solo victories, which he received on 1 July 1944. After the commander of his regiment was killed in June 1944 and with Arkady Kovachevich's appointment as acting commander being only temporary, Alexander Novikov promoted Lavrinenkov from squadron commander to regimental commander in September. As commander he led the unit through the Gumbinnen, K√∂nigsberg, and Berlin operations. During his tenure the regiment was placed on the 3rd Belorussian Front until April and on the 1st Belorussian Front until the end of the war, after which he remained in command of the unit until August 1945. Throughout the course of the war he gained 36 solo and seven shared confirmed shootdowns, flew over 500 sorties, and engaged in 134 dogfights.  Postwar  After being relieved of command of the regiment in August, Lavrinenkov attended the M. V. Frunze Military Academy, which he graduated from in November 1948. In March 1949 he became the commander of the 2nd Guards Fighter Aviation Division, which flew the La-5, Yak-9, and P-40. He was transferred to command of the 142nd Fighter Aviation Division which used the La-7 and Supermarine Spitfire in February 1950. In July 1951 he became the superintendent of the Fighter Air Defense Training Center in Nizhny Novgorod. There his flew the Yak-17, La-15, and MiG-15. In November 1952 he left the center to attend the Military Academy of the General Staff, which he graduated from in 1954. After attending the academy he became the deputy commander of Kiev Fighter Aviation Defense Directorate, and in July 1955 he was promoted to commander. In November 1958 he became the commander of the Separate Baltic Air Defense Corps, and in April 1962 he became the senior deputy commander of the 8th Separate Air Defense Army. In February 1966 he was placed in command of the 2nd Separate Air Defense Army and was made deputy commander of the Belarusian Air Defense District; from August 1969 to December 1977 he commanded the 8th Separate Air Defense Army in addition to being deputy commander of the Kiev Air Defense District, after which he became the chief of staff and deputy superintendent of the civil defense in Ukraine. In 1984 he became a consultant at a military academy in Kiev, where he lived until his death in 1988. In addition to his roles in the military he wrote several books and became a member of the Writers' Union of the USSR in 1976. Having been a member of the Communist Party since 1942, he held many high positions in the party, being a deputy the Supreme Soviet of the: RSFSR from 1947 to 1951, the Latvian SSR from 1959 to 1963, the Belarusian SSR from 1967 to 1971, and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine from 1971 to 1981.

He was twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union during the war and remained in the military afterwards, reaching the rank of General-major. Early life Mazurenko was born on on a farm in Yelisavetgrad to a Ukrainian family. For most of his upbringing he lived in Shakhty, Rostov oblast, where after completing his seventh grade of school in 1933 he was employed as a tram driver and later as an electrician at a mine. Before graduating from the Shakhty aeroclub in 1938 and entering the military in October that year, he trained at a glider school. After graduating from the Yeisk Naval Aviation School in December 1940 he was assigned to the 1st Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment, which flew the DB-ZF and was part of the Baltic Fleet. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1942. World War II From June to August 1941 Mazurenko flew 20 sorties in the DB-ZF with the 1st Mine-Torpedo Regiment before he was transferred to the 71st Baltic Fleet Aviation Regiment. However, he soon switched to the 57th Baltic Fleet Regiment in October, which used the Il-2 and I-153. By 28 December 1941 he had flown 43 sorties in the Il-2 during the Battle of Leningrad, taking out 10 tanks and over a dozen anti-aircraft guns in addition to a large quantity of enemy equipment; for this he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union along with several of his colleagues, but the nomination was not initially approved. On 23 June 1942 the Baltic Fleet requested that Mazurenko's nomination be approved. The telegram was ignored until early August, but in the end the award was approved and he received the title in October. Before receiving the title he had entered staff general improvement course at the Yeisk Naval Aviation School, which he completed in January 1943. He was then made a flight inspector in the directorate of combat training of naval aviation, a position he held for one year. When he was assigned to the Northern Fleet, he trained 32 pilots in addition to flying in combat. In June he flew five sorties, sinking a transport and a minesweeper in the Barents Sea. Later that year he was sent to the Black Sea Fleet, during which he gained two personal and nine shared sinkings of enemy vessels. In early 1944 he became commander of the 7th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment; there, despite his high position, he routinely flew sorties on an Il-2, and by 17 August 1944 he was nominated to receive a second gold star for flying 202 missions. During his tenure he sank multiple large vessels and many smaller ones; on 23 March 1944 while leading a group of seven aircraft he sank a ship with a displacement of 1,500 tons. On 16 May 1944 he led a formation of 22 planes in an attack that resulted in damage to one ship and the sinking of five more. On 18 June 1944, while leading a group of thirteen planes in an attack, he dropped two FAB-250 on a vessel with a displacement of 2,000 tons, causing the transport to burn all day. After receiving the title Hero of the Soviet Union for a second time he continued to fly in combat, totaling 257 combat missions by the end of the war (217 in the Il-2, 20 in the DB-ZF, and 20 in the I-153). Less than a week before the capitulation of Germany he sank a ship in Pomeranian Bay with a displacement of 8,000 tons. The pilots in the regiment under his command flew over 3,000 missions, resulting in the sinking of 152 enemy vessels, the shooting down of 24 aircraft, the destruction of 36 tanks and hundreds of vehicles, and the killing of many enemy personnel. Postwar Until December 1946 Mazurenko continued to command his regiment. From then until June 1947 he commanded the 60th Assault Aviation Regiment, after which he became deputy commander of the 15th Mixed Aviation Division; he left the position at the end of 1948. In 1949 he was promoted to the rank of colonel and graduated from the Higher Officers Flight Tactical Courses of Naval Aviation, and in 1952 he graduated from the Naval Academy in St.Petersburg. From then until November 1953 he commanded the 24th Guards Fighter Aviation Division, after which he was posted to the 601st Assault Aviation Division until November 1954. He then transferred to Marine Scientific and Technical Committee of the Navy, where he remained until 1961 when he was given a command post again - the 25th Training Squadron of the Pacific Fleet. There, he was promoted to the rank of general-major the next year. In 1964 he headed a department at the Leningrad Higher Naval Engineering School, where he remained until 1969 when he was made deputy head of material and technical supply for a naval academy. He left the military in 1972, died in St.Petersburg on 11 March 2004 and was buried in the Nikolsky Cemetery.

In the 1970s, he was an activist in the workers' movement (Autonomia Operaia) in Italy. Lazzarato was a founding member of the editorial board of the journal Multitudes. He is a researcher at Matisse/CNRS, Pantheon-Sorbonne University (University Paris I), and a member of the International College of Philosophy in Paris. Biography Lazzarato studied at the University of Padua in the 1970s, where he was active in the Autonomia Operaia movement. He left Italy in the late 1970s for exile in France to escape political prosecution, although the charges against him were abandoned in the 1990s. Thought Lazzarato is known for his essay \\"Immaterial Labor\\" that appeared in a collection of contemporary Italian political theory edited by Marxist philosophers Michael Hardt and Paolo Virno, called Radical Thought in Italy (1996). His research focuses on immaterial labor, the transformation of wage labor, and work, and cognitive capitalism. He is also interested in the concepts of biopolitics and bioeconomics. Works on debt Lazzarato has written two closely related works on the subject of debt, The Making of the Indebted Man and Governing by Debt. Both books were translated into English and published as part of the Semiotext(e) Intervention Series. In both works, Lazzarato uses continental philosophy and economic data to critique debt and neoliberalism from a left-wing perspective. =The Making of the Indebted Man= In The Making of the Indebted Man, Lazzarato examines debt as it is experienced by individuals, specifically the subject; he also presents a case that the debtor-creditor relationship is a central category of economics‚Äîmore important than money or finance, for example. In the modern economy, it is taken for granted that debts must be repaid, and much of economic activity is driven by lending with the expectation (or: promise) of future repayment. Lazzarato observes that in order for such an economy to function, its actors must first be socialized to accept the premise that debts must be repaid. This entails that they become capable of making promises (to repay a debt) and of feeling guilt (on failing to repay a debt). To illustrate this process, he refers to the second treatise of Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality, which deals with the concepts of guilt, debt, and socialization. Lazzarato refers to the socializing process of creating individual subjects as \\"subjectivation\\".The Making of the Indebted Man, p. 42. He also contrasts the Nietzschean view of credit/debt with those given by Marx and by Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus. The latter part of the book is a criticism of debt as used in European neoliberal governance, introducing ideas which are developed more fully in Governing by Debt. The Making of the Indebted Man has proved crucial for the application of the theorizing of neoliberal debt in relation to material culture and contemporary art. =Governing by Debt= In Governing by Debt, Lazzarato uses the vocabulary developed in Making of the Indebted Man to examine how debt is employed by states and private enterprise, as opposed to individuals. The book is a critique of neoliberalism and governmentality where the latter refers to a form of government which responds to economic demands, a notion closely related to ordoliberalism. Lazzarato characterizes American student debt as an ideal example of the credit/debt economy, and also uses history and anthropology to trace a cultural notion of \\"infinite debt\\" (e.g. life-debt, original sin) which he argues has informed the modern economy.Governing by Debt, pp. 61-79. The book's central idea is that basic categories of the economic and political spheres (which are commonly opposed, or spoken of as separate items) are in fact not distinct, but closely related and overlapping. For example, governments and businesses closely coordinate their policies, laws, business practices and expectations, and are therefore coupled with each other. Lazzarato cites the work of Carl Schmitt to illustrate the point. Lazzarato also cites Foucault's work The Birth of Biopolitics to illustrate the social experience of debt; however he criticizes the distinction that Foucault makes between states and economies, with classical liberalism as a mediator.Governing by Debt, pp. 91-92. Further, the distinction between industrial capitalism and financial capitalism is questioned; however Lazzarato retains the distinction in the sense that financial capitalism is the \\"purest\\" form of capitalism, because it simply transforms one form of money into another form of money through valorization (e.g. via the circulation and trade of financial products), without using a commodity as an intermediate step. In Marxist terminology, this is expressed as M-M' (money creating different money), as opposed to M-C-M' (money creating a commodity, which yields different money). Lazzarato also cites Lenin's work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism to indicate the primacy of financial capitalism, emergent during Lenin's period.Governing by Debt, pp. 213-222. Lazzarato concludes the text by proposing refusal of work as a technique for the disruption of the modern economy. He advocates for this goal because he attributes responsibility for human suffering during financial crises to capitalists and state actors, and not to any national population. However (in Lazzarato's account) national populations are nevertheless made to pay for such crises and socialized to feel responsibility for them, through taxation, austerity, and media messaging: Works * \\"Immaterial Labor.\\" In: Virno, Paolo, and Michael Hardt. 2010.

It is a local landmark featuring a substantial two storey building with white walls and an orange tiled roof in the Spanish Mission style. Over 2 hectares (5 acres) in area the site offers extensive views westwards over the Indian Ocean and is a popular venue for picnics, concerts, meetings and weddings. It includes the administration centre for the Town of Cottesloe, the War Memorial Town Hall and extensive walled and landscaped grounds with tall Norfolk Island pines. The Laurels was originally built in 1897-8 for Richard Pennefather. It was an elegant example of the Federation Queen Anne style. Claude de Bernales, a mining entrepreneur, bought the house in 1911 and renamed it Overton Lodge, after his birthplace in Brixton, London. In 1937 he redeveloped the house in the Spanish Mission Style. In 1950 it was bought by the Town of Cottesloe and remodelled again, this time for use as a civic centre. It is included on the State Register of Heritage Places for Western Australia and the Municipal Inventory for the Town of Cottesloe.  1898‚Äì1911 Pennefather Residence  Overton Lodge in original Federation Queen Anne style c1920 When the house was built in 1898 by Judge Richard W Pennefather there were few neighbouring properties and no proper road to the house. Broome Street did not extend north beyond Forrest Street and sand dunes and bush surrounded the house. The house was named \\"The Laurels\\" and built of limestone quarried from the nearby Briggs quarry (subsequently the Council depot). The arches and lintels to the doors and windows were of brick and the house was surrounded by large verandahs. A latticed tank stand housed the water tanks capable of holding 83,000 litres (22,000 gallons) and a summer house stood to the south. At the time Pennefather was the Attorney General for Western Australia having been elected to the West Australian Legislative Council in 1897 as the member for Greenough. His headstone lies at the south west corner of the building and was relocated from Karrakatta cemetery.  1911‚Äì1949 De Bernales Residence  Cottesloe Civic Centre (Overton Lodge) in Spanish Mission syle c1950 In 1911 Pennefather sold the house to Claude Aldo de Bernales, a mining entrepreneur, and his wife Bessie. De Bernales at this time had amassed a modest fortune by dealing in mine machinery in the Western Australian gold fields and was managing director of Kalgoorlie Foundry Limited. He would go on to become immensely wealthy, organising complex investment schemes in mining companies and attracting significant investment to Western Australia's mining industry. By 1913 he had renamed the house Overton Lodge after his birthplace in Brixton, England. In the 1920s de Bernales added garages, a billiard room and made changes to the interior. He also began to make improvements to the grounds, establishing a large rose garden in the south west corner and probably the tennis court below the summer house. In 1936 he entered into an agreement with the Cottesloe Municipal Council to transform the land west from his property to Marine Parade into a model garden estate. The Overton Gardens Estate was to comprise 25 houses designed according to the latest ideas from England and the continent. The land was endowed for municipal purposes and housed the original courts of the Cottesloe Tennis Club adjacent to Warnham Road. The Reserves Act (no 32 of 1935) allowed for the sale of the land providing the proceeds of the sale were used to extend Napier Street to the coast, improve the recreational reserve to the north and relocate the tennis courts to their current site on Broome Street. While the tennis courts were moved, economic conditions and the outbreak of the war in 1939 meant that the model estate did not eventuate. At the same time De Bernales commissioned Melbourne architect Bernard Evans to remodel the house. The plan involved a dramatic change in appearance from a Federation Queen Anne style to a Spanish Mission style. The alterations and additions included a study, library, dining room, kitchen and three new bedrooms with adjoining bathrooms. In the public rooms extensive use was made of French-polished jarrah panelling on the walls and ceilings and jarrah parquetry on the floors. Local architect Samuel Rosenthal is thought to have designed the jarrah panelling. The house was furnished with antiques and chandeliers featured in the reception hall. Surrounding sand dunes were levelled and soil trucked in from the Darling Ranges to establish expansive gardens and lawns to the west. A 3,600 foot Italianate balustrade wall designed by Rosenthal was also built and still surrounds the property. Massive water storage tanks holding 22,000 gallons that stood behind the house were retained and renovated in the Spanish style. The Spanish Tower became a landmark in Cottesloe. The building was completed by 1938. His daughter Mrs Daphne Faye and her husband returned to live in the house. De Bernales by this time had returned to London and was involved in disputes with shareholders and in 1939 the London Stock Exchange suspended his companies. De Bernales returned to Western Australia only once post-war and it appears he had no opportunity to live in his Spanish mansion. In 1949 the decision was taken to sell Overton Lodge.  1949+ Cottesloe Civic Centre  In June 1949 Harold Boas approached the Cottesloe Municipal Council with a proposal to sell Overton Gardens to the council. Mayor Laurence Gadsdon and Shire Clerk Alex Smith recognised the opportunity the estate offered as a Civic Centre. In October 1949 the council approved the purchase of the property for ¬£45,000. The sale included Overton Gardens, the land to the west of Overton Lodge, which had been destined for use as a model housing estate. The sale of this land helped to offset the cost of the purchase. The house was remodelled to serve as a Civic Centre. The jarrah lined lounge, library and reception hall were combined to become the War Memorial Town Hall and the dining room the Council chambers. Children's playgrounds were built and the water tanks demolished having been declared unsafe, retaining only the empty structure of the Spanish Tower. On 30 September 1950 a crowd of 3,000 gathered to celebrate the official opening and a grand ball was held in the evening. The new Civic Centre provided much needed facilities for community groups. Among them was the Cottesloe sub-branch of the RSL. The branch had contributed funds for the alterations of the centre and in exchange was given the use of the billiard room with its attractive jarrah panels and lead light windows for its meetings. The branch continues to meet there today. One of the upstairs bedrooms was converted to a Children's Library and this provided a much need service to the children of the district until a public library in the town centre opened in 1967. The local Scout group operated a kiosk from the summer house selling icecream and cool drinks on weekends until it was demolished in 1959. For many years Cottesloe children also enjoyed the fancy dress ball held at the centre each year. Perth's annual Motor Show as well as industry fairs were regular events on the western lawns. As needs have changed so has the building. The building has been altered to cater for the growing needs of the Town of Cottesloe and improvements made to the grounds. In 1962 respected landscape architect John Oldham designed an attractive waterfall garden adjacent to the entry gates off Broome Street.In 1966 the remains of the Spanish Tower were demolished. In 1970 the Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck unveiled a statue of war time Prime Minister John Curtin who had lived nearby in Jarrad Street. By 2000 the distinctive Italianate walls surrounding the property were crumbling and extensive repairs were carried out in 2004-2006. To celebrate the Council's centenary in 2007 Pennefather's summer house, which overlooked the tennis court on the south side, was recreated and the original tiled floor restored. The tradition of community events continues. Concerts, Carols by Candlelight, citizenship ceremonies and the annual Pioneers Day lunch are hosted by the Town of Cottesloe. The grounds are open to picnickers and the Civic Centre is a popular venue for weddings. In 1995 the Cottesloe Civic Centre was included on the Town of Cottesloe Municipal Inventory as a Category 1 or Place of Highly Significant Heritage Value. In 1997 it was made a permanent entry on the State Register of Heritage Places for Western Australia.

After the war he flew jet fighters and became a flight instructor. Early life Mikhailichenko was born on 2 September 1920 to a Ukrainian family in the village of Almazna. After graduating from seven grades of school in 1936 he worked at a mine and attended the Sergovo Mining School, which he graduated from in 1938. The next year he completed training at the Sergovsky Aeroclub, but did not enter the military until April 1940.  World War II  Soon after entering the military shortly before the start of Operation Barbarossa, Mikhailichenko began training at the Voroshilovgrad Military Aviation School of Pilots, which had to be evacuated to Uralsk due to advancing German forces. Upon graduating from the school in January 1943 he was assigned to the 19th Reserve Aviation Regiment. He remained in the regiment until June when he was sent to the warfront as part of the 667th Assault Aviation Regiment, but later that month he was expelled and sent as an enlisted soldier in the ground troops for a disciplinary violation; in autumn he was allowed to return to his unit and his rank of junior lieutenant was reinstated. In February 1944 the 667th Regiment was honored with the guards designation and renamed as the 141st Guards Assault Aviation Regiment. For his first 87 sorties on the Il-2 he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 12 January 1944, which was awarded on 1 July 1944. He was nominated for the title a second time on 20 April 1945, which was awarded on 27 June 1945. At the start of the war he was a pilot with the rank of sergeant, but having rose through the ranks he was a senior lieutenant and squadron commander at the end of the war. He participated in the operations for Kursk, Kharkov, Kirovograd, the Dnieper, Lviv, Silesia, Prague, and Berlin; in total scored three solo shootdowns, three shared shootdowns, flew 187 sorties, and engaged in 26 dogfights while flying the Il-2. Less than one month after the victory he was promoted to the rank of captain.  Postwar  Mikhailichenko remained as a squadron commander in his regiment until it was disbanded in 1946, after which he served as squadron commander in the 101st Guards Fighter Regiment before entering the Air Force Academy. He did not graduate from the school and returned to his regiment shortly before it disbanded, so in March 1947 he was reassigned to the 100th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. In July that year he was appointed deputy commander of the 28th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, which used the American-made P-63 as well as the Soviet-made MiG-9, MiG-15, and Yak-15. In May 1950 he transferred to the 145th Guards Fighter Regiment, in which he held a variety of posts including flight commander, squadron commander, and instructor. He received a transfer to the 147th Guards Fighter Regiment in January 1955, which he remained in until January 1958. That year he graduated further flight training in Lipetsk, after which he became the deputy commander of his regiment. There, he sometimes flew with future cosmonaut Boris Volynov. From 1960 to 1962 he worked as a flight instructor on the MiG-17 and Yak-25 in Yaroslavl. In 1962 he retired from the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel, after which he worked at a mechanic until 1974. He died on 2 June 1982 and was buried in the Vostryakovsky cemetery.

May 1919 ‚Äì 26 September 1979) was a ground-attack pilot in the Soviet Air Forces during the Second World War who was twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  Early life  Mylnikov was born on 25 May 1919 in the village of Yegorievka to a Russian family. After completing his seventh year of school in 1936 he went on to attend a trade school in Voronezh. There, he graduated from trade school in 1938 and went on to work at a factory until graduating from the local aeroclub in 1939, after which he entered the army in December. Upon graduation from the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School of Pilots in November 1940 he was assigned to the 163rd Reserve Aviation Regiment; from February to May 1941 he was part of the 171st Fighter Aviation Regiment, and then he was briefly posted to the 169th Reserve Aviation Regiment until July 1941.  World War II  In July 1941 Mylnikov was reassigned as a pilot to the 174th Assault Aviation Regiment, which was awarded the guards designation and renamed in March 1942 as the 15th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment. He quickly was promoted from pilot to flight commander and continued to rise through the ranks, achieving the position of squadron commander before he was nominated for his first gold star. For much of the war he was tasked with taking out targets attacking besieged Leningrad, and in early 1943 he participated in the breakthrough of the blockade; over the course of 13 sorties he took out ten vehicles, an ammunition depot, four railway cars, four bunkers, and killed over 100 enemy combatants. While leading a group of four Il-2 aircraft on an attack over a stretch of railroad on 19 March 1943 they took out 15 railway cars and caused a significant delay of traffic on the line. On 23 September 1944 Mylnikov was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having totaled 192 sorties, which was awarded on 23 February 1945; shorty before that on 14 February 1945 he was nominated for a second gold star for having totaled 223 sorties. During a mission on 21 February 1945 he was badly injured after his Il-2 was hit by an anti-aircraft shell; although he was able to make an emergency landing in Kreuzburg, the severity of his injuries resulted in him being confined to the hospital for the remainder of the war, where he underwent a craniotomy. Throughout the war he fought in the battles for Leningrad, Novgorod, Vyborg, Tallin, East Prussia, and other strategically important areas on the Western, Bryansk, Leningrad, and 3rd Belorussian fronts. By the end of the conflict he totaled 226 sorties on the Il-2, taking out nine tanks, seven aircraft on the ground, four ammunition depots, 58 railway cars, 73 anti-aircraft artillery positions, 115 cars, 26 machine-gun nests, and over 1000 enemy combatants.  Postwar  Eventually Mylnikov was released from the hospital in August 1945, but since he was unable to return to flying for health reasons he had to leave active duty for the reserve in November. From 1948 to 1949 he worked as a senior engineer at the import department of the Ministry of Fishing. After graduating from the Institute of National Economics named after G.V. Plekhanov in 1954 he went on to hold various management positions; initially he was deputy manager and later head of portions of several state construction trusts, but in 1958 he became director of a grocery store in the Zhdanovsky district of Moscow. The next year he became head of the Ostankino hotel, and from 1961 to 1962 he headed a general store. From then until 1969 he was deputy director of several restaurants in the Leningradsky district of Moscow. He lived for the remainder of his life in Moscow, were he died on 26 September 1979 and was buried in the Vagankovo cemetery.

After the war he rose to the rank of colonel and later became an engineer. Early life Mykhlik was born on 29 December 1922 in Soldatskoye village, Nikolayev Governorate, Ukrainian SSR to a Ukrainian peasant family. In 1925 his family moved to the city of Krivoy Rog, where he completed his tenth grade of school in 1940 before entering the military in November. After graduating from the Volsk Military School of Aircraft Mechanics in September 1941 he worked as an aircraft mechanic for the 8th Reserve Fighter Aviation Regiment until starting pilot training in March. From then until December 1942 he trained under the 2nd Separate Training Aviation Regiment, and from December 1942 to April 1943 he underwent further training at the 224th Assault Aviation Division Retraining Center. World War II Having arrived at warfront in April 1943 as a pilot in the 566th Assault Aviation Regiment with the rank of senior sergeant, he did not fly his first combat mission until 12 July. However, once he experienced his baptism by fire he quickly began to accumulate more sorties, totaling five missions in one day on 26 July. Despite being shot down and having to make an emergency landing on 31 January 1944, he and his gunner managed to safely return to their unit just a few days a later. On 6 August 1944 he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having totaled 105 sorties on the Il-2. Mykhlik continued to quickly rise through the ranks of his unit, gaining promotion to squadron commander in November 1944. That year he was admitted to the Communist Party. While the squadron was under his command its crews totaled 309 sorties but lost only one of their own aircraft. In addition to flying combat sorties as squadron commander he took on the responsibility of flight training, training six new pilots in 1945. On 27 March 1945 he was nominated for a second gold star, which he received in June. By the end of the war he was credited with 188 combat sorties, taking out 35 tanks, two ammunition depots, 8 anti- aircraft artillery batteries, five steam locomotives, 19 rail cars, 114 trucks, and shot down one FW 190. Throughout the war he fought on the Western, Bryansk, Leningrad and 3rd Belorussian fronts, participating in the battles of Kursk, Orel, Krasnoye selso-Ropsha, Leningrad, Novgorod, Vyborg, Narva, Tallinn, East Prussia, Koenigsberg, and Zemland. Later life Mykhlik continued to serve as the senior navigator of his wartime regiment until he transferred to the 118th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment in June 1946, but he left in November to attend the Air Force Academy, which he graduated from in 1951. He then held the post of pilot-inspector for flight technique in the 5th Guards Assault Aviation Division until December 1952. He then briefly worked as a flight inspector for the combat training department for the air force of the Moscow Military District before becoming the deputy commander of a research aviation regiment in April 1953; however, he left in July for the position of senior flight inspector at the 4th Air Force Combat Use Center, where he remained until 1958. From 1958 to 1960 he was the senior flight inspector of the Aviation Training Directorate of the Central Committee of DOSAAF, and from then until leaving the military in 1966 he was the duty officer of the flight control command post of General Staff. Throughout his career he flew the Il-2, Il-10, Il-28, MiG-17, Yak-11, Yak-12, and Yak-18. After retiring from the military with the rank of colonel in October 1966 he worked as an engineer for a construction trust, being promoted to senior engineer in 1967 and eventually becoming head of the consolidated personnel recruiting department of field construction for the northern regions in 1976. He died on 29 December 1996 in Moscow and was buried in the Troekurovsky cemetery.

In the closely fought supervisorial election in December 2015, she was defeated by Aaron Peskin, who had previously held the seat from 2001 until 2009. During the election campaign, Julie Christensen cited the physics concept ‚Äúwormhole‚Äù‚Äîa connection between two different space-times‚Äîto describe the Stockton Street Tunnel connecting Union Square and Chinatown, Peskin's ally Rose Pak distorted the word ‚Äúwormhole‚Äù to imply that Chinatown is a hole of worms, which successfully triggered the anger of some Chinatown residents. That negative press controlled by Rose Pak in Chinatown created an opportunity for Peskin to pick up much-needed votes in the Chinese community when he ran against Christensen. She has also served on the Advisory Board for the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association and is an active proponent of extending San Francisco's Central Subway to North Beach.

Most of the sources included in Sefer HaAggadah come from the period of the Tannaim and the Amoraim. Bialik and Ravnitzky include aggadot from the Mishnah, the Babylonian Talmud, Jerusalem Talmud, Avot of Rabbi Natan, Mekhilta, Sifra, Sifre, Tosefta, Midrash Rabba, Midrash Tanhuma, Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, Sefer Yetzirah, Yalkut Shimoni, Alphabet of Sirach and others. Nuhum N. Glatzer, Jewish literary scholar, theologian, and editor writes that Bialik's goal in compiling the Sefer HaAggadah was \\"‚Ä¶part of his attempt to popularize Hebrew classics.\\" This mission is very much evident in Bialik's essay, Halakah and Aggadah where he expands on the roles of Halakah and Aggadah in reinventing or renewing a society's culture.  Halakah and Aggadah  In 1917 Hayim Nahman Bialik published an essay titled Halakah and Aggadah where he elaborates on the role of Halakah (torah law) and Aggadah (lore) as two key elements in Judaism that can only work hand in hand. Throughout the essay Bialik shows the dual nature of Halakah and Aggadah and the complementary roles that they play. He writes that, \\"Halakhah is all husk, body, action; Aggadah is all content, soul, aspiration. The first is hardening inertia, compulsion and submission; the second, continuous renewal, freedom and spontaneity.\\" Although Sefer HaAggadah's goal is to spread the \\"renewal, freedom and spontaneity\\" within the rich tradition of Jewish lore, in Halakah and Aggadah Bialik emphasizes the gravity and importance of Halakah. Halakah to Bialik is the implementation of the lessons learned from Aggadah, it is \\"a defined attitude towards life.\\" When Bialik refers to Halakah he isn't necessarily referring to Torah Law. He may be talking about the implementation of the morals and ethics that people learn from the rich Jewish Aggadic literature. To Bialik the renewal of a Jewish culture was crucial and he believed that it had to be rooted in the past yet refocused for a new modern Hebrew speaking audience. Although the goal of Sefer HaAggadah was to popularize the old Hebrew classics in the form of Aggadah, Bialik's calls for a life of \\"‚Ä¶action rather than talk, and in writing, for Halakhah rather than Aggadah.\\" In other words culture does not enter the conscience of a people or a nation if it does not transition into the realm of action.

Digital labor takes different forms from on-demand platforms, micro-working and the creation of content for digital platforms such as social media. Digital labor describes affective and social activities within capitalist modes of production not typically recognized as work, including the increasing participation on social media websites, and the effect of social media on social patterns and communication and the collapse of work and play. The notion of digital labor has evolved from the traditions of Workerism, Operaismo and Autonomism that grew during the workers' struggles in Italy, which included a substantial feminist movement in the Wages for housework campaign. Operaismo refers to an Italian movement during the 1960s and 1970s in which working class members fought for better working conditions and more pay.http://www.ephemerajournal.org/sites/default/files/7-1wright.pdf Digital labor as a field also includes consideration of the affect and the axiomatization of the body, collective intelligence, and the hive mind, semiotics and postmodernism, artificial intelligence, science fiction, gaming culture, hyper-reality, disappearance of the commodity, contested definitions of the \\"knowledge worker\\" in capitalistic society. Precedents Digital labor borrows from understandings that the cognitive-cultural economy, and the rise of capitalism in the 20th century, has eliminated the previous separation that existed between work and play/entertainment. The rise of digital labor can be attributed to the shift of human history from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age, as production-based industries declined with the rise of a new digital and information-based economy. Multiple authors, including Christian Fuchs (sociologist) Sebastian Sevignani, Nick Dyer-Witheford, and Greg de Peuter have linked digital labor to the theory of Marxism.https://www.fims.uwo.ca/people/profiles/nick_dyer-witheford.html https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-arts/faculty-profiles/greig- de-peuter/index.html Marxism states that capitalism creates a class struggle between the minority and the working class majority. Although this theory applies to the production economy of the time, it can be used to describe labor within the digital economy as digital labor replaces factory labor.  On-demand platforms  On-demand work has been rising since the years 2008-2010. It follows the development of Internet access and the spread of mobile devices, which allow almost everyone to be in touch with this kind of platform, including children and teenagers. Such platforms cover a large field of domains : rental (Airbnb, Booking.com), travel (trivago, tripadvisor), food delivery (Uber Eats, Grub Hub, and Postmates), transportation (Uber, Taxify, Lyft), home services (Task Rabbit, Helpling), education (Udemy, Coursera), etc. 'Workers on such platforms are often not considered as employees, and aren't well paid. For example, an Uber driver earns between $8.80 and $11 per hour after expenses. http://www.ephemerajournal.org/sites/default/files/7-1wright.pdf https://www.nber.org/ All of these platforms can be seen as data producers : both customers and workers produce data while using the service. This data can then be used for improving the service or can be sold on the market. Business model of such companies is often centered around data. Social Media The notion of digital labor on social media arise from the fact that most of the value of any social media platforms is created by the users. Therefore they can be considered as digital workers on the platform. On most platforms however this work remains unpaid. Some exceptions include video and music sharing platforms. This is linked with the notion of participatory culture, \\"a term often used for designating the involvement of users, audiences, consumers and fans in the creation of culture and content\\".Fuchs, Christian. 2013. 'Social media:a critical introduction' Digital labor is rooted in Italian autonomist, workerist/Operaismo worker's rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as the wages for housework movement founded by Selma James in 1972. The idea of the \\"digital economy\\" is defined as the moment, where work has shifted from the factory to the social realm. Italian autonomists would describe this as the, \\"social factory.\\" Studies of the digital labor of social media were some of the first critiques of digital labor. This included scholarship like, \\"What the MySpace generation should know about working for free\\" (Trebor Scholz), and \\"From Mobile Playgrounds to Sweatshop City\\" (2010). (Andrew Ross), Tiziana Terranova and others developed a working definition of digital labor, drawing from the idea of free labor, and immaterial labor. Other scholars who have written about Digital Labor include: Ursula Huws, Trebor Scholz, Frank Pasquale, Sergio Bellucci, Christian Fuchs, Andrew Ross, Jaron Lanier, as well as Postcolonial feminists, including, Lisa Nakamura. Their work has been tied to other Alter-globalization texts. Social networking labor, or user labor, denotes the creation of data by social media and networking platforms users, which contributes to the financial gains and profits of those platforms, but not to the users. It is based on the production and exchange of cultural content, and the collection of users' metadata. Microwork tasks can be completed before using the platform, which indirectly trains algorithms (such as text or image recognition when creating an account). Current debate over digital labor examines whether or not society's capitalistic economy has prompted corporate exploitation of digital labor in social media. Social media has developed as a means for people to create and share information and ideas over the Internet. Because social media are typically associated with leisure and entertainment, the monetization of digital labor has blurred the line separating work from entertainment. Proponents argue that exploitation occurs as typical social media users do not receive any monetary compensation for their digital content, while companies are able to take advantage of this freely accessible information to generate revenues. Studies of social media sites such as YouTube have analyzed their business models and found that user-generated digital labor is being monetized through ads and other methods to create company profit. Criticism against exploitation centers around people as prosumers. Scholars argue that exploitation cannot occur if people are both producing and consuming their own digital labor, thereby deriving value from their own created content.  Microwork  The development of micro-working platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk created new forms of digital labor. These platforms make use of low-wage employees in order to accomplish tasks that cannot or cannot yet be performed by a computer. Micro-working platforms are often used in the field of machine learning, for AI training or AI verification.Antonio Casilli, Julian Posada. The Platformization of Labor and Society. 2018. Internet users can also contribute to a form of \\"user labor\\", in which the user is asked to perform an action which produces data in order to use a platform. As an example, the ReCAPTCHA service developed by Google uses human identification as a way to transcribe books or to label image sets. Digital economy The digital economy has been written about by both those critical of the contemporary geopolitical net sphere and those interested in how to exploit the new features digital economies. Digital labor is also interested in emergent digital subcultures including: community forms, blogs, digital organizing tools, and the way these platforms can be potential generators of cultural goods subsumed and incorporated into globalized networks of cultural goods. Digital labor markets are websites or economies which facilitate the production, trade, and selling of digital content, code, digital products, or other ideas or goods emerging from digital and technological environments. A widely used example of a digital labor market is Amazon Mechanical Turk. Digital labor has been concerned with the topic of disintermediation, where digital labor has taken away the job of the mediator in direct, social, communication. The concept of the digital economy has been applied to the onset of the peer production platform economies, like free and open-source software projects like Linux/GNU, free and open-source projects like Wikipedia. Computer scientist Jaron Lanier, in the books You are Not a Gadget and Who Owns the Future, argues that the open source approach contributed to the social stratification and widening of the gaps between rich and the poor, the rich being the major stakeholders in digital companies, who own the content of the content creators. A digital labor critique of the open source software movement is that peer production economies rely on an increasingly alienated labor force, forced into unpaid, knowledge labor.

Cadwallader William Evan (d. 22 August 1876), first minister in charge of Stow Memorial Church, and educated at Prince Alfred College. Having decided on a career with the law, Evan was articled to Charles Kingston, K.C., and in 1890 entered into partnership with Hiram W. Varley, as Varley and Evan, with which firm he remained all his life. In his youth Evan was a keen Australian Rules footballer, and when the North Adelaide Juniors, of which he was a member, joined with North Park to form the Adelaide Football Club, he was a member of the first eighteen. He played soccer for South Adelaide and junior cricket with Kensington Cricket Club, and when that team amalgamated with the Austral Club and joined the first grade in 1886, Evan was appointed a delegate to the Cricket Association. Evan was a member of the first Australian Cricket Council, held in 1892, along with Henry Sparks, Bill Whitridge, and George Giffen. He was also a member of the first Board of Control of Australian Cricket and its successor, so he had the distinction of having sat in every Australian board appointed to control international cricket to his death. Evan succeeded J. W. Collins as treasurer of the association, and was followed in turn by Bernard Scrymgour. For many years Evan acted as chairman of the ground and finance committee of the association, and he also acted as president, then elected to the position in 1920 when Sir Edwin Smith died.

She began her career by cutting the silhouette images. After studying painting with successful miniature portraitist John Smart, Beetham painted silhouettes to be framed or miniatures were made for jewelry. From 1785 to 1809, she had a business on 27 Fleet Street in London, where she produced silhouettes of men and women. She is considered one of the great 18th century silhouette artists, along with John Miers and Auguste Edouart. Personal life Isabella Robinson was born between 1750 and 1754. Her family were Roman Catholics and Jacobites. Both her father and grandfather were named John Robinson. Isabella's father was of Sedgefield, Durham and her grandfather, an architect and builder, was of Lancaster, Lancashire. She eloped with Edward Beetham in the early 1770s, having met him by early 1773. At the time of their meeting he used his original surname, Betham. Edward Betham, who was born in 1744, and estimated to be at least ten years older than his wife. Edward was the eldest of a brother William and their sisters. Edward and William were born at the Long House in Little Strickland. Both Edward and Isabella had been raised by wealthy families who did not approve of the couple's running off together and eloping. Any financial support ceased as a result. Edward was identified as an actor, which was considered a lowly profession of a \\"rogue and vagabond\\". As a result of his decision to take up acting and marry a woman of a different faith, Edward changed his surname to Beetham to avoid embarrassing his parents. Edward worked at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London and Haymarket Theatre. He invented a weighted roll-up curtain for the theatre to avoid curtains from catching fire in the candle foot-lighting. Since he did not have the money for a patent, he did not profit from the widely used invention. He later became a successful inventor and businessman. The Beetham's had six children. The oldest child was Jane, born about 1773, followed by William, born in 1774. After the birth of the second child, Edward reconciled with his parents. Their subsequent children were Harriet, Charles, Cecilia, and Alfred. The family lived in Cow Lane, Clerkenwell, London and then Little Queen Street, Holborn, London. Edward and Isabella produced a puppet show in 1775 and 1780. Isabella created a frontispiece with a mezzotint portrait of Edward, with images reflecting \\"Laughter\\", \\"Gravity\\", and \\"Misery\\". The Beethams established their residence and businesses at 26 and 27 Fleet Street in 1785. In the 18th century the area included publishers, engravers, bookstores, and quaint gabled houses. At Fleet Street, the Beetham's entertained artist John Opie, writer William Godwin, publisher John Murray, Lidford Bellamy, poet George Dyer, Dr. Priestley, artist John Smart, and Admiral William and Elizabeth (n√©e Betham) Bligh, who was a relative. She gave lessons to Amelia Alderson, who was also in her circle of friends. She made a silhouette portrait of her in 1794. Charles Lamb remarked that she was a warm, generous, and slightly bohemian woman. The Beetham's moved into a quaint house with three gables on Chancery Lane, just off Fleet Street, to accommodate the growing family. The house was razed when the lane was widened around the turn of the century. Early career Isabella developed a talent for making silhouette portraits, first called profiles and shades, which are a solid outline of an image. Initially, Beetham made the portraits by cutting the images on card and paper. She illustrated details, such as frills, on the silhouette with tiny slashes. Her work routinely has a bust-line finish that differentiates her work from other artists. Women had hair styles and hats typical for the time period; Men had cravats without bows. Frames, generally oval shaped, were made of giltwood, pearwood, papier-mache, and brass. The frames were often larger than those used by her competitors. A lengthy trade label was affixed on the back of her work after 1774, that conveyed that she produced portraits of loved family members and friends to help people cope with their loss. The message on the label was so large, though, that much of the verbiage was lost when the label was cut to fit the portrait. Over her career, she had seven trade labels, her cut silhouettes per produced using her first three trade labels.

Beetham painted silhouette portraits on a white background, such as plaster, and often on glass. She made miniature portraits for jewelry. Edward learned a new way to gild glass near Venice in Murano, Italy for his wife's business in 1784 to 1785. Fleet Street In early 1785, Edward leased 26 and 27 Fleet Street in London for the family's businesses and residence. A studio was established in 27 Fleet Street for Isabella to paint her silhouettes, and on the lower floors Edward sold washing machines using his patented wooden, rather than stone, mangles. Bust or 3/4 length profiles were painted on thick paper by Beetham and an employee named Mrs. Bull, whose style varied from Beetham. She also employed William Gardiner, who was an actor, artist, scene-painter, and engraver who put finishing touches on the portraits. Beetham was particularly adept at capturing the fashions of the day in great detail. Likewise, men and women's clothing were painted with \\"consummate skill\\", using straight hatching and cross-hatching to paint frills and details. Beetham used different painting techniques, like dot formations and hatching, to illustrate women's dress. Gum arabic was used for shading. In some cases, she used gold for women's profiles. Work made in Beetham's shop was affixed with a trade label on the back of the work. Into the 1790s, silhouettes were no longer painted on paper. In 1792, Beetham advertised that she created detailed likenesses‚Äîwith unrivalled taste and elegance‚Äîon gold and silver decorated glass, composition, paper, and ivory. She also made miniature portraits for bracelets, lockets, and rings. Beetham was regarded as one of the best silhouettes silhouette makers of her time, particularly for her ability to capture the sitter's features.

Jane frequently painted on glass. Death Joseph Swain, Clarendon Square, Somers Town, London, engraving. The Polygon is on left and St Aloysius Chapel on the right. Edward died in 1809. Isabella lived her later years at 9 The Polygon, a group of houses at Clarendon Square, Somers Town, London (now between St Pancras and Euston stations). Her daughters also lived in the Somers Town, an area settled by French refugees during their homeland's revolution and was mostly inhabited by people of the Roman Catholic faith and low incomes. Isabella Beetham made out her will on 3 August 1825 and died that month, at her home by the 16th, when her will was proved. She left an estate of ‚Ç§200 () to her daughters Cecilia Georgi and Harriet Norman. Legacy In was reported in 1991 that one of her silhouettes sold for $3,498 at a Christie's auction. This compares to a silhouette of children, pets and toys by Auguste Edouart (1788-1861) that sold for $2,100 at Skinner and an 1874 silhouette of a husband and wife enjoying tea by William Welling sold at Phillips for $4,832. In 1995, Michael Christie had one of the finest private silhouette collections, with 120 images by noted silhouette artists, such as Beetham and Miers. The collection was started in 1893 by his mother, Madge Christie. Its highest valued item was a half-length silhouette of a lady by Beetham valued at about ‚Ç§3,000.

Rediff News, 17 Dec. 2004. http://www.rediff.com/news/report/guru/20041217.htm History The history of the ganga sagar has been recorded after the current protector, Rai Azizullah Khan researched historical public records preserved by the British Raj. In 1705, Guru Gobind Singh, turned towards the city of Raikot after walking through the Machiwara Jungle. At Raikot, Noora Mahi, a cattle grazer first met the Guru while he was looking for water to drink. He requested Noora Mahi to bring him water or milk in the Ganga Sagar (one of the personal belongings of the Guru). However Noora Mahi refused as the buffalo had already been milked and even if it were to give milk, the Ganga Sagar would not be able to contain it due to the holes carved around its base. Despite Noora Mahi's claims, the Guru ordered Noora Mahi to say the name of God, rub the belly of the cow and pour the milk in the Ganga Sagar. To Noora Mahi's surprise, the cow gave milk and the milk did not spill through the holes of the Ganga Sagar. Astonished, Noora Mahi told his chief the incident and lead him to meet with the Guru. At the meeting Rai Kahla, the present Muslim chief of Raikot, welcomed the Guru, not only risking his position as chief but his own life and the life of his family and subjects from Aurangzeb. Three days later, on January 5, 1705, when leaving the shelter provided by Rai Kahla, the Guru presented Rai Kahla with two of his belongings, a sword and the Ganga Sagar, as a token of gratitude. The sword is currently located in a museum in New Zealand, while the Ganga Sagar has been in custody of the Rai family for decades now.Khan, Rai. Interview by Amarjit Rai. 24 minutes. Aikam.

N.p., 18 Aug. 2006. http://www.sikhawareness.com/topic/8778-the-story-of-the-ganga- sagar/ Guardian The current guardian of the Ganga Sagar is Rai Azizullah Khan; an ex-parliamentarian of Pakistan. The Ganga Sagar has been in the protection of Khan since 1975 and has been in the Rai family for nine generations, with Rai Azizullah Khan being a direct descendant of Rai Kahla. After the partition of india the Ganga Sagar was relocated to Kamalia, Pakistan with Rai Anayat, the grandfather of Khan. After his death in 1953, it was inherited by Khan's father, Rai Fakirullah, who, died four years later in 1957, leaving Khan's grandmother as protector of the Ganga Sagar. Before her death, she handed over the protection of the sacred relic to Rai Azizullah Khan who since then had kept it in Pakistan. In 2004, he moved it to United Kingdom, where it is now kept safe in a bank vault. Of the nine protectors of the Ganga Sagar, each generation of the Rai family has had only one male descendant born to the family to inherit the duty as guardian of the Ganga Sagar. Khan, too, has only one son, out of five children, who will one day inherit the duty as protector of the Ganga Sagar. Darshan Prior to partition, the Rai family annually held a large, three-day celebration called darshan, celebrated at Gurdwara Tahlianaa Saheb, to mark the stay of Guru Gobind Singh ji in Raikot in 1705. The last event of the celebration would end with a public display of the Ganga Sagar by the Rai family. However, since the partition, despite the relocation of the people associated with the Ganga Sagar and Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the event is still held from January second to fourth annually. It is considered a major event and manages to attract a large number of people from all over Punjab including prominent poets and artists. Instead of the public display of the Ganga Sagar, a rally circulating approximately six kilometers takes place to conclude the celebration at the Gurdwara Tahlianaa Saheb. Tahlianaa Saheb's front wall consists of an inscription describing the journey Guru Gobind Singh Ji made to Raikot, and of the token of gratitude he left for Rai Kahla (the Ganga Sagar). However, no picture of the Ganga Sagar is displayed at the gurdwara.

It was designed by Gibbs, Finlay & Morsby in conjunction with Thomas Blair Moncrieff Wightman and was built in 1926 by J L Green & Sons. It is also known as Metway Chambers and Custom Credit House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  National Mutual Life Building was constructed in 1926. Part of this site was purchased by the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia in January 1883 for the association's headquarters. Title to the adjoining allotment was acquired by the association in July 1920. National Mutual Life proposed the reconstruction of its central offices on the site in 1925. Other contemporaneous redevelopments near the site included the Commonwealth Bank (1929), Colonial Mutual Life (1930‚Äì31) and the AMP building (1930‚Äì34). Designed by Melbourne architects Gibbs, Finlay and Morsby, in conjunction with Thomas Blair Moncrieff Wightman, Brisbane, the new seven storey building provided 114 offices, a basement and caretaker's quarters on the roof. The tender of JL Green and Sons, contractors, was accepted in January 1926, the former offices were demolished in February and construction began. National Mutual Life occupied the building until 1981 when the property was sold to Havelah Investments. In 1982 Comord Pty Ltd purchased the building and the following year $4 million was spent on refurbishment. Since 1987 the building has been leased by Custom Credit and in 1988 Suncorp Insurance bought the property.  Description  This inter-war commercial building is seven storeys in height with a basement and a caretakers office as an attic level. It is a stone faced building on a reinforced concrete structure. The scale and form of the building and the colour of its stonework complements nearby buildings on this side of Queen Street. It has a bronze faced suspended awning and bronze panels separating the windows of the end bays, from the second floor upwards. These end window bays project slightly from the rest of the building and have plain, flanking giant order pilasters. The three central bays of windows are more closely spaced. At their second floor level they extend to the floor and have a projecting balcony that is supported on brackets. This has a wrought iron railing of a diamond shape pattern between balusters of the same material. The stone facing of the first floor level has banded rustication and visually forms a plinth to the upper levels. The windows of the three central bays are separated by decorative stone panels in the same pattern as the bronze panels of the outer bays. An elaborate cornice appears at the top of the facade.

The story takes place in an early 20th-century farmer's community in southern France, where the inhabitants suffer from a mysterious disease, while a healer tries to save them by teaching the value of joy. The title is taken from Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring. An English translation by Katherine Allen Clarke was published in 1940. Reception Isabella W. Athey of The Saturday Review described Giono's novel as \\"an expression of his revolt against the effects of industrial materialism, more poetical and radical than any garden-city retreat from urban life. His territory is whole forests, whole plateaux, and this intensity perhaps explains why he is frequently described as a pagan.\\" Athey continued: \\"The term seems inexact as well as inadequate, for the only pagan world with which the average reader is familiar is that of Greek and Roman cultures, and the classical values, clear even at second and third hand of organic restraint, of rationalistic emphasis on cause and effect, have no bearing upon Giono's code which is, at bottom, a refusal to compromise. This quality constitutes his originality, both as a man of beliefs and as a novelist. It leads also to some of his weaknesses, carelessness in characterization, for instance, and disregard for motivation beyond his personal intuition.\\" References Category:1936 French novels Category:French-language novels Category:Novels by Jean Giono ","title":"Joy of Man's Desiring"},{"id":"45562535","text":"The Melbourne International School of Japanese, Inc.

Description Beyeria viscosa is a pyramidal shrub growing to tall rarely a small tree to tall. Leaves are spirally arranged, oblong to oblanceolate from 2‚Äì5 cm long by 5‚Äì15 mm wide tapering towards the petiole with flat or with slightly recurved margins. The upper leaf surface is glabrous and often viscid were by the lower surface is somewhat lighter. Male flowers are cream-yellow and clustered in groups of 2 or 3 with 4 mm long sepals and numerous short stamens. Female flowers lack petals and are solitary with 2‚Äì3 mm long sepals, roughly globose ovary and large sessile stigma. Fruit capsules are glabrous or sparsely pubescent with a viscid coating similar to that of the leaves and range from 6‚Äì8 mm long with a 2 mm wide persistent stigma. Fruit capsule contains up to 3 smooth, oblong seeds which usually germinate within 5‚Äì7 days of planting. Pinkwoods are dioecious, with separate sexes, some shrubs being female and others being male. Plants flower from December to February through the peak of summer. As the common name implies, the timber of B. viscosa bears a pink hue similar to that of Nothofagus cunninghamii but the general small scale of the plant renders it unviable as a timber tree. The plant responds well to being pruned where is can be maintained as a hedge. Distribution and habitat Beyeria viscosa is found throughout Australia with the exception of the Northern Territory but is most abundant in dry areas of central eastern New South Wales and eastern Tasmania where it is a common understory shrub to Eucalypts. Plants prefer poor, well drained soils on semi-shaded sites and are abundant in riparian habitats, gullies and on rocky hills and ridges where they can form dense stands.

The film was a musical blockbuster with all the songs composed by Ashwath-Vaidi considered evergreen hits. Plot Ananth Nag plays a dual role of Narada in the celestial world and a normal human on earth. It so happens that Narada is forced to descend on earth and interact with humans. A series of humorous incidents occur. Narada enters a passenger aircraft and blesses the airhostess during disembarkment, much to the amusement of the passengers. When Narada walks through the exit gate of the airport, policemen, who think that he is Vijay (Anant Nag - a police officer in Narada's costumes) bring him to the police superintendent's office. The SP addresses him as Vijay, to which Narada politely says that he is not Vijay, but Narada, leaving all those present there, taken aback. Narada also gets to interact with an eccentric plainclothesman police officer (MP Shankar). The situation turns in such a way that the heroine (Vijay's love interest (Padmapriya)) also falls for Narada as he happens to walk past her house and she notices him. The first meeting between Narada and Vijay occurs in a hotel room. Narada beats up Vijay, giving him a taste of his divine powers. They often interact after this incident, which leaves the stout plainclothesman even more confused. Vijay urges Narada to exchange their dresses and costumes; as a result of which Narada in Vijay's costume holds a briefcase and sunglasses like his tanpura and clickers; and Vijay has a cigarette in his mouth. When the stout plainclothesman chases Vijay (in Narada costume), he rides someone's motorbike and escapes.

It was formerly known as the North Quay retaining wall. It was designed by Thomas Kirk and built from 1887 to 1887 by George E Willcocks. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Retaining wall on the River Road at North Quay, Brisbane, 1889 In late January 1887 Brisbane experienced severe storms which resulted in flash flooding and damage throughout the city. A couple of weeks after the floods, sections of the river bank and road along North Quay fell into the Brisbane River. An existing embankment and \\"dry stone wall\\" had been undercut and collapsed. The Brisbane Municipal Council was advised by their Chief Engineer, Thomas Kirk, of several options for dealing with the problem. The council decided on the most permanent solution - to construct a mass concrete retaining wall at an approximate cost of . Kirk's choice of concrete rather than masonry work was quite adventurous, as mass concrete technology was new to Australia. Kirk prepared the designs and the contract was awarded to George E Willcocks. Work began in May and the actual construction time was shorter than even Willcocks' optimistic estimate - the road was opened four months later. One of the most challenging tasks in the construction involved massive excavations, the deepest being for a huge coffer dam which kept the river waters out of the site. The men preparing the foundations many feet below the low tide mark worked behind this dam with the full force of the water bearing on the other side. G E Willcocks had been involved in railway construction in South Africa in the early 1880s. After hearing of the Queensland government's plan to borrow for an expanded railway construction programme, he migrated to Australia in 1885. In 1886, he began a long career in municipal and government works by winning a contract for building a storm water drainage system in South Brisbane and Kangaroo Point. Other public works followed - Stratton Drain, the Ann Street wall, the North Quay (now Coronation Drive) wall, extensive railway works in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales and the wood blocking of Queen and George Streets. The stone cappings which were on the piers have been replaced with bricks. A section of the western end of the wall was moved in 1983.  Description  Retaining wall, as seen from the bikepath, 2008 A mass concrete wall topped by a brick parapet wall and wrought iron railing which extends for a length of about along the northern river bank between Boomerang Street and Eagle Terrace. It is built into bedrock at depths varying from . The wall, which is almost thick at ground level extends by a series of gradations to thicknesses between at the base. The view of the wall from the road reveals only the brick piers and decorative wrought iron railings of the parapet wall. At either end of the wall are marble plaques inscribed with the words \\"James Hipwood Mayor 1887\\". Beneath the parapet wall the concrete retaining wall is visible from the bike path and from the river.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1887, the Coronation Drive retaining wall is as an early example in Queensland of mass concrete technology and is a major engineering achievement of the period.

He became a member of the powerful Central Committee of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party in 1964. For more than two decades he also served as junior Minister for the Chemicals Industry. Life G√ºnther Wyschofsky was born in Bischofswerda, a small industrial town in Upper Lusatia in then southern part of what was then Central Germany, and some 20 km (12 miles) from the frontier with the republic of Czechoslovakia, established slightly more than a decade before his birth. His father was a baker and confectioner who lost his job during the economic crisis of the 1920s and had joined the Communist Party before 1933. His mother worked as a glass maker. He left school aged 14, at the height of the war, and undertook a training as a laboratory technician and pharmacist, after which he used his training professionally, working in Bischofswerda and nearby in Bautzen. The war ended in May 1945 which put an end to one-Party government. Wyschofsky joined the Communist Party. The next year, in April 1946 the contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD created the precondition for a return to one-party rule, this time under Soviet administration across the whole of what was now the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. Wyschofsky was one of thousands of former Communists who now lost no time in signing their membership over to the new Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED). Between 1946 and 1948 he pursued his studies at the Workers' and Farmers' Faculty (ABF / ') in Halle. Next he studied Chemistry at the Dresden University of Technology and at the Karl-Marx University (as it was then known) in Leipzig, obtaining his degree in 1951. He then worked as an industrial chemist, till 1953 heading up the research laboratories at VEB Plastics in Espenhain which was then at the heart of a vast \\"brown coal\\" mining area. Between 1953 and 1957 he worked for the Party Central Committee at a national level as an instructor and section leader in the Chemistry division of its Basic Industries department. At this stage he was selected for a year of study at the Karl Marx Party Academy, after which in 1958 he returned to working as an official of the Party Central Committee, now as deputy department head for Mining, Coal, Energy and Chemistry. In 1959 he was promoted to the Headship of the Basic Industries Department for the Party Central Committee. That job lasted to 1962 when he was again promoted, now becoming Deputy President and Head of the Chemistry Planning department of the State Planning Commission. In May 1966 Wyschofsky was appointed Minister for the Chemicals Industry in succession to who fell out of favour that year on account of his \\"inappropriate behaviour\\".\\"....wegen unw√ºrdigen Verhaltens\\". Wyschofsky himself retained this ministerial post for more than twenty years, till November 1989 and the resignation of the Stoph government. The constitution of the country was closely modeled on that of the Soviet Union, and insisted on the leading role of The Party. Government Ministers held their posts at the pleasure of The Party and their job was to carry out The Party Central Committee decisions. Potential tensions arising from this situation were reduced by the fact that many ministers were also members of the Party Central Committee. G√ºnther Wyschofsky was listed as a candidate for membership in January 1963, and after a wait of less than two years was elected one of the approximately 121 members of the Central Committee in December 1964.Neues Deutschland 6 December 1964 Later he was also Chairman, for the East German side, in the bilateral Economic Committees of the German Democratic Republic with Iran and with China.Neues Deutschland 9 July 1989 Wyschofsky period in office saw the construction or massive expansion of several major industrial facilities that nearly half a century later are still important facilities in their respective sectors. These include the vast Petro-chemicals facility in Schwedt, the second refinery at Leuna and the extended adhesives plant at Piesteritz. On the other hand there were other less prestigious Chemicals plants which were left to deteriorate because the larger high-profile \\"beacon\\" facilities absorbed all the available investment capital. He often found himself torn between insights deriving from his own expertise and the strictures of party discipline. With Wyschofsky it was always party discipline that won. 1990, the year of German reunification, was also the year in which G√ºnther Wyschofsky took early retirement. He returned to live in Bischofswerda.

The former functions as both a general model for the popularization of the sport and as a filtering mechanism, used to pick out locally based footballing talents which are later transferred to the Academy.

The department was founded in the 1950s and has been historically known as one of the best youth systems in the former Yugoslavia. Its training philosophy is not only the development of football players, but also the care for the players' growth, education and character formation, while teaching the sporting spirit and loyalty to the club. The youth teams, besides national competitions, participate in numerous tournaments around Europe, testing their skills against some of the best European clubs. Tournaments the club's youth selection traditionally take part in include Kvarnerska Rivijera, Trofeo Dossena, Generali CEE Cup and the Karol Wojtyla Cup.

The procedure uses a variation of Austin's procedure for two partners and general fractions. That procedure allows two partners to divide an entire cake to k pieces, each of which is worth exactly 1/k for both of them. The main procedure works as follows. A. Use Austin's procedure with k=4 and partners #1 and #2. So we have 4 pieces that the first two partners believe to be of exactly identical value of 1/4. B. Partner #3 trims one piece to create a two-way tie for the largest; the partners now choose pieces in reverse order (#4, #3, #2, #1). Either #4 or #3 must take the trimmed piece. This creates an envy-free division for the entire cake less the trimmings (This is similar to the Selfridge‚ÄìConway discrete procedure). C. Now the trimmings are divided. Assume w.l.o.g. that #3 took the trimmed piece. We use Austin's procedure again with the trimmings and partners #4 and #1, to create 4 pieces each of which equals exactly 1/4 for both of them. Since partners #1 and #2 have an irrevocable advantage over whoever partner that took the trimmed piece, we can let #3 be the first to select a piece from the trimming, then #2, then #4 and #1.  Efficiency  The run-time of the procedure is, technically, infinite, since Austin's procedure involves two knives moving continuously, and this procedure cannot be discretized. The number of cuts is bounded, though. Austin's procedure requires 2 cuts to divide a cake between 2 people with an exact value of 1/2; each of these pieces should be divided with 2 more cuts to generate the 4 pieces with exact value of 1/4. So in total, 6 cuts are needed for step A. A single cut is done in step B and 6 more cuts in step C, for a total of 13 cuts. An advanced variant of the Brams‚ÄìTaylor‚ÄìZwicker procedure uses only 11 cuts.

Plot The book is set in a small seaside resort in the north east of England and starts in 1936. God on the Rocks takes place in a madhouse, a convalescent home for artists. It includes a pastor who likes to preach near the ocean, a Great War survivor, an ancient character and others. The main character, Margaret Marsh, is an eight-year-old who hides in the garden and listens to the conversations of the painters, gardeners and crazy people. She takes day trips to the shore to get away from her mom and new baby brother. Here she meets Charles and his sister Binkie. She hears stories of her mom's youth from them and the book shows the world through Margaret's eyes, as a child and as an adult. Book reviews The New York Times book review said, \\"We are in the hands of a master story-teller. Over the course of the novel, Gardam gives us the past and present of her characters‚Äô lives, zooming in and out of their diverse perspectives, moving from Margaret‚Äôs uncorrupted eyes to the more freighted vision of the grown-ups around her.\\" The Mary Whipple review said, \\"Though this is one of Jane Gardam‚Äôs early novels, written in 1978 and recently reprinted by Europa Editions, it is in many ways, more light-hearted and more memorable than some of her more famous later novels.\\" Kirkus Reviews said, \\"As usual, Gardam requires very few pages to delineate an entire world of class-ridden prejudice and the blighting effect it has on every character. Yet each one is so achingly vulnerable, and depicted with such empathy, that it‚Äôs a relief to be reminded in a final chapter set 12 years later that people are surprisingly resilient and can make the best of even the most unpromising circumstances.\\" Awards The book won the Prix Baudelaire and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1978.

It was built from 1881 to 1882 by Henry Patten. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The balustrading of the Petrie Bight retaining wall is visible to the left of Queen Street, 1926 This retaining wall was built in 1881-82 for the Brisbane Municipal Council. The contractor for the project was Henry Patten and the cast iron balustrading was manufactured locally by Smith Forrester & Co. In 1880, after the Council purchased Kennedy Wharf (just downstream on the Petrie Bight of the Brisbane River from the present Customs House), they obtained a loan of to build the retaining wall and extend Kennedy Wharf to Macrossan Street. Besides providing more working space behind the wharves, the wall marked the recently widened alignment of Queen Street. In 1887 the City Engineer reported that the wall was out of plumb by in . In consequence, the wall was stabilised by the addition of eight engaged buttresses. Use of the Petrie Bight area changed after the 1940s when downstream shipping facilities were established, and the area below the retaining wall became available for development. One such development saw the establishment of a landscaped recreation area beside a car park. Recent alterations since 1988 have seen about of the wall dismantled and reconstructed on a new alignment. The parapet has been breached in three places with openings ranging from wide. One of the openings now houses a reinforced concrete stairway which leads to a five-storey building erected on the river side of the wall.  Description  Cast iron railways as seen from Queen Street, 2008 This , parapeted retaining wall, ranging in height from , is built of Brisbane tuff. The blocks are laid in courses and surmounted by a detailed cast-iron railing which incorporates one of the two original lamp standards and terminates in a sandstone endpost at the Customs House end of the wall. At the northern end of the wall, eight engaged buttresses, added only a few years after construction of the wall, afford further support. The arches provide rhythm to the mass of the wall while the finely detailed balustrade adds an effect of light and space. The distinctive pinks, greens and browns of the Brisbane tuff contribute to the aesthetic appeal of the wall. As the wall was backfilled with rock to the present level of Queen Street, only the parapet and railing are visible from the street. From the river side, however, the wall with its varying depths and distinctive arches and supporting pilasters is clearly visible. The wall is largely intact despite several modifications. The wall appears in an Orient Line postcard of 1895 painted by Arthur Henry Fullwood. Its appearance there does not seem to accord exactly with its history. The buttresses seem to be omitted and reflection in water is suggested. The wall is shown also in a 1905 postcard photo. The tuff retaining wall in nearby Arch Lane to the north is not part of the Petrie Bight retaining wall. The Arch Lane wall was built by the Brisbane Gas Company in 1883. Arch Lane was developed in 1920.  Heritage listing  Petrie Bight Retaining Wall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Petrie Bight Retaining Wall is important in illustrating the development of Brisbane's road and wharf facilities by the Brisbane Municipal Council in the late 19th century. Construction of the wall was associated closely with municipal acquisition of Kennedy Wharf, and reflects the Council's developing role in providing improved transportation facilities in Brisbane. It survives as an example of a major engineering project undertaken by the Brisbane Municipal Council in the 1880s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Petrie Bight Retaining Wall is also a fine example of a late 19th century stone retaining wall, and is important in illustrating its type. It has aesthetic significance in the contribution of its scale and texture to the Brisbane riverscape, and the cast-iron work remains an example of the decorative work of important Brisbane ironfounders Smith Forrester & Co.

Due to his high percentage of wins by knockout (specially for his division, the 108 pounds limit division), he was nicknamed \\"El Pequeno Foreman\\" (\\"Little Foreman\\", after George Foreman). Guzman was born in Santiago de los Caballeros, during the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship era. Professional career Juan Guzman made his professional boxing debut on January 20, 1973, at the age of 21 years and almost 6 months old. He fought Francisco Gomez in Moca that night, prevailing by a six-round unanimous decision. In his next bout, Guzman scored his first professional win by knockout, defeating Matias Sandoval in the first round on February 9 at Puerto Plata. On March 12, he rematched Francisco Gomez, having his hand raised as winner by an eight-round unanimous decision at Santiago de los Caballeros; this was his first professional bout to take place at his hometown. Next, Guzman battled Romon Rosario, again at Moca, knocking him out in the first round. This marked the start of an eight fight knockout winning streak which went from April 9, 1973, to October 15, 1974. As part of this streak, Guzman saw off challenges by Fausto Almonte twice; Ramon Rodriguez, Juan Barido, Sergio Rodriguez, Romon Rosario again, Juan Garcia and Juan Disla. By the time that Guzman was matched with Juan Sandoval on October 15, 1974 at Monte Cristi, he had already fought all over the Dominican Republic and abroad, making his Santo Domingo debut against Garcia (a first-round knockout win on July 6, 1974), and his international one against Sergio Rodriguez in Port-au-Prince, Haiti on March 18, also a first-round knockout win. Most of his wins by this period so far had been mismatches, due in part to the lack of Junior Flyweight fighters in the Dominican Republic at the time. Guzman defeated Juan Sandoval by a 6-round unanimous decision. After the Sandoval match, Guzman embarked on another knockout streak, again reaching eight straight knockout victories. He beat Juan Pimentel, Miguel Minaya, Juan Disla and Fausto Almonte in back to back rematches, Domingo Santana and Sergio Garces. Each of these bouts took place in the Dominican Republic but for the fight with Garces, which was held at Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Every fight during that streak ended in three or less rounds. On August 18, 1975, Guzman somewhat surprisingly lost his condition as an undefeated boxer when matched against Puerto Rican prospect Luis Rosario, 3‚Äì0‚Äì1 coming in, at Santo Domingo. Rosario, who had come off a draw (tie) with Rafael Solis and would later extend world champions Julian Sol√≠s (Rafael's brother) and Alfonso Zamora the ten round distance, defeated Guzman by surviving the initial rounds and extending him, before taking Guzman out in round ten by knockout. Guzman recovered with wins over Frank Palofax and Aniceto Vargas; both those fights took place at San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Vargas one at Coliseo Roberto Clemente. By then he was a top-ten ranked Junior Flyweight by the World Boxing Association. World championship WBA world Junior Flyweight champion Jaime Rios of Panama was 18‚Äì1‚Äì1 when he came to the Dominican Republic to defend his title against local Guzman during June 1976. Their fight took place on July 2, at Santo Domingo. It was a close fight through 15 rounds, not much stylistically separating champion and challenger. At the end, however, Guzman was deemed winner by a very close margin, a split decision with scores of 146‚Äì145 by judge Roberto Lopez and 146‚Äì144 by judge Salcedo in favor of Guzman, referee Isidro Rodriguez voting for champion Rios by 145‚Äì144. Guzman did not enjoy his status as a current world champion very long. Three months later, on October 10, 1976, he travelled to Yamanashi, Japan, to meet 8‚Äì0 challenger, Yoko Gushiken, who stopped Guzman in seven rounds to take the world title away. Gushiken was later voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Rest of career Guzman took off more than one year away from boxing before returning on November 19, 1979, beating Santos Nunez, a fighter with a negative, 1‚Äì6 record, by a ten-round unanimous decision at San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was then defeated by Jose Ortiz on February 18, 1978, at San Juan by a ten-round unanimous decision. This result was an upset; Ortiz had never won a professional fight before, and he would never again win. On July 2, 1978, Guzman boxed future two-division, three-time world champion Hilario Zapata at Gimnasio Nuevo Panama, Panama City, Panama. Despite some early success and dropping Zapata in round two, Guzman lost by ten round unanimous decision to Zapata, who was 4‚Äì0 coming in. This was followed by another defeat, this time at the hands of future Lupe Pintor world Bantamweight title challenger Jovito Rengifo at Caracas, Venezuela, by an eighth-round knockout, on February 1, 1980. Then, Guzman fought popular Mexican fighter, future North American Boxing Federation Bantamweight champion Candido Tellez, on September 4, 1980 at Los Angeles, losing by knockout in round one. Guzman's last two fights took place on September 8, 1981 at La Romana and then on July 2, 1982, at the Auditorium in Miami Beach, Florida. He lost both by first-round knockouts, to future world Flyweight champion Eleoncio Mercedes and to Chilean national hero Martin Vargas. Guzman retired with a record of 26 wins and 8 losses in 34 bouts, 20 wins coming by way of knockout.

Topics and Opinions The Council usually decides on its substantive focus during the last meeting of each year, creating a working schedule for the subsequent months. Each topic is continuously discussed in the plenary sessions, the working groups, and dedicated public events. The working process for an Opinion normally stretches over several years. If, in the drafting process, members have a dissenting view, they may express this in the Opinion. After publishing an Opinion, the Council accompanies the corresponding political and societal debates and evaluates the reception of its recommendations by the general public. In addition to the Opinions, the Council publishes Ad hoc-Recommendations (for further information see the relevant paragraph below). = Anonymous relinquishment of infants = The council's first Opinion ‚ÄúAnonymous relinquishment of infants‚Äù, published on 26 November 2009, addresses the ethical and legal problems raised by facilities for anonymous birth. Considering the legal and individual problems associated with the facilities for anonymous relinquishment of infants, and in view of the unproven life-protecting effect of these possibilities, the German Ethics Council recommends abandoning these facilities. Instead, public information and institutional aid programs for pregnant women should be expanded considerably. = Human biobanks for research = The Opinion ‚ÄúHuman biobanks for research‚Äù, published on 15 June 2010, discusses the ethical and legal issues arising in connection with human biobanks, ranging from the protection of individual rights to the global regulation of research infrastructures. In its Opinion, the Council proposes a five-pillar concept for biobank regulation. It includes recommendations on introducing biobank secrecy, on defining permissible use, on involving ethics commissions, on quality assurance and on transparency. It is the aim of the recommendation to provide a suitable legal framework for the interests and rights of personality of the donors, to achieve more legal certainty for biobank research and at the same time to facilitate research. = Medical benefits and costs in healthcare = The council's Opinion ‚ÄúMedical benefits and costs in healthcare‚Äù, published on 27 January 2011, deals with the question of the allocation of funds in the health care sector. Addressing this issue was a reaction to the inability of two Enquete Commissions appointed by the Bundestag to pass recommendations concerning this matter. Considering the impending cost increase in the health care sector due to medical progress with a simultaneous increase in life expectancy, the council's Opinion formulates recommendations based on the principle of human dignity and the accompanying fundamental rights that aim both at optimising the allocation of funds for healthcare and achieving equitable distribution of resources. = Preimplantation genetic diagnosis = In this Opinion, published on 8 March 2011, the Council comprehensively sets out the relevant factual position and the decisive arguments of supporters and opponents of permitting preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Against the background of current technological and legal developments, the Ethics Council describes the current practice and the new possibilities of genetic diagnosis of embryos. It goes into detail on the various positions and arguments on the status and protection of embryos and discusses the most important socio- ethical aspects. Due to differing views among the council's members, particularly concerning the status of embryos in vitro and thus the justifiability of PGD, the Council develops two alternative proposals for legislation on PGD. = Human-animal mixtures in research = In its Opinion ‚ÄúHuman-animal mixtures in research‚Äù, published on 27 September 2011, the Council identifies the ethical challenges that arise from the creation of human-animal mixtures for medical research purposes. Such experiments call into question the biological species boundary between humans and animals. The Council considers it necessary to identify the ethical challenges that may be presented by the creation of human-animal mixtures and to determine where it may be appropriate to set binding limits. The Council concentrates its attention on the transfer of human material to animals, which it examines on the basis of three examples: cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids), formed by the insertion of a human cell nucleus into an enucleated animal egg; transgenic animals with human genetic material; and the transfer of human cells into the brains of fetal or adult animals (brain chimeras). The Opinion presents recommendations on these examples. = Intersexuality = Upon request of the Federal Government, the Council dedicated its prepared the Opinion ‚ÄúIntersexuality‚Äù, published on 23 February 2012, to the situation of intersex people in Germany. It emphasizes that people with differences of sex development (DSD) deserve respect and support; this implies that they need to be protected from undesirable medical developments, i.e. discrimination. The central issue in question concerns the admissibility of surgical procedures on sexual organs of people with DSD. If a person's physical integrity requires an irreversible medical sex disambiguation or sex assignment measure, the relevant decision should always be taken solely by the individual concerned. In the case of a minor, such measures should be adopted only if absolutely necessary for safeguarding the child's well-being and only after thorough consideration of all their medical, psychological and psychosocial advantages, disadvantages and long-term consequences. The Opinion further recommends that the compulsory binary classification of ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù in the civil registry should be ceased and non-binary people should be enabled to have registered civil partnerships. = Dementia and self-determination = The council's Opinion ‚ÄúDementia and self-determination‚Äù, published on 24 April 2012, emphasizes the importance of respecting and encouraging the self- determination of people with dementia. It supports the Federal Government's aim of developing a National Action Plan for dementia. The need for care of people with dementia should be reviewed by taking adequate account of their potential of self-determination. Outpatient communal housing and residential communities for persons with dementia should be expanded and the effort of caring family members more widely recognized as well as financially supported. The principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which also includes persons with dementia, should be consistently applied to support their possibilities of self-determination. = Biosecurity = The Opinion on ‚ÄùBiosecurity ‚Äì freedom and responsibility of research‚Äù, published on 7 May 2014, discusses the issue of Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC), which describes research results in the life sciences that cannot only be used for the benefit of individuals and society, but also misused with the intent to cause harm. To prevent such misuse, the Council recommends heightening the scientific community's awareness of the danger of misuse, establishing a national biosecurity code of conduct to deal responsibly with research that may be open to misuse, and making funding of DURC contingent on approval by a new DURC Commission. Further, the Council recommends legally binding regulations and calls upon the scientific community and the Federal Government to promote the development of biosecurity codes of conduct for responsible research both within the EU and at a global level. = Incest prohibition = The Opinion on ‚ÄúIncest prohibition‚Äù, published 24 September 2014, evaluates, if, based on ethical reasons, a revision of the current legal situation on the grounds of Ethics is advisable. The Council aims for an open and unprejudiced discussion of the juridical and ethical issues arising in the context of close-relative relationships, focusing on consensual coitus between adults. Particular attention is given the case of sexual contact between (half) siblings that share a family unit and bonds lived in practice no longer exist ‚Äì a possible aftermath of a divorce or sperm donation for example. The evaluation is based on the weighing between clashing fundamental values, particularly how the right of sexual autonomy relates to the obligation to protect family structures. Concerning this matter, the council could not find an unambiguous consensus: the majority would weigh the fundamental right of sexual autonomy higher, while the minority sees the protection of family as an entity as a priority and wants to uphold the prohibition of incest. = Brain death and decision on organ donation = An Opinion, published 24 February 2015, addresses the ethical and legal aspects concerning brain death and their implications regarding organ donation. Particularly, it deals with the questions whether brain death is a convincing criterion for a person's death and whether brain death should be considered as a sufficient condition for the ethical and constitutional legitimacy of organ removal. The Council emphasizes the importance of transparency as well as an open public discussion in order to strengthen confidence in transplantation medicine. Further, it calls for improvements in information and communication and suggests amendments to the statutory regulations on organ-protective measures. = Embryo donation, embryo adoption, and parental responsibility = In an Opinion, published 22 March 2016, the Council presents recommendations regarding the legal regulation of embryo donation, embryo adoption and assumption of parental responsibility. The Council discusses the questions arising from the transfer of so-called surplus embryos to a third party for the purpose of carrying them out and assuming permanent parental responsibility. Namely it addresses the questions of children's opportunities for life and development, parental responsibility, and family relationships. Taking special account of the child's welfare, the Council considers it to be ethically necessary to legally specify the framework conditions of embryo donation and adoption. The Opinion contains several recommendations on how to deal with both. = Patient welfare as an ethical standard for hospital care = Growing economic pressure due to the cost development in the health care sector poses the question of the guiding normative criterion of hospital care. Addressing this issue, the Opinion, published 5 April 2016, identifies patient welfare as the guiding ethical principle for hospitals. It examines three dimensions determining patient welfare: patients‚Äô self-determination, treatment quality, and distributive justice. The Council formulates recommendations that aim to enshrine and guarantee the orientation on patient welfare in hospital care, including for instance improvements in the areas of communication, documentation, digitalization, and accessibility. = Big data and health = The Opinion ‚ÄúBig data and health‚Äù, published 30 November 2017, examines the effects of big data processing on the healthcare system. Big data processing is characterized by the large volume and variety of data as well as the high velocity of its collection and processing,. Big data can improve diagnosis, therapy, and prevention; however, risks such as a loss of control over personal data arise. The Council examined these trends in a two-and-a- half year long process that involved extensive exchanges with experts and interested members of the public. The Opinion analyses the chances and risks of big data in five health relevant application contexts, evaluates the current legal framework and explores how values such as freedom, privacy, sovereignty, beneficence, justice, solidarity and responsibility can be guaranteed under big data conditions. The Council recommends a governance concept focusing on data sovereignty and makes specific suggestions to (i) realise the potentials of big data, (ii) preserve individual freedom and privacy, (iii) safeguard fairness and solidarity, and (iv) promote responsibility and trust. = Benevolent coercion = In this Opinion, published 1 November 2018, the Council addresses the use of coercive measures in health and social services, including for instance the deprivation of liberty and medical treatment or care measures against a person's will. If a person threatens to seriously harm him- or herself, coercive measures can serve a person's welfare. Nevertheless, every instance of such \\"benevolent coercion\\" represents a serious infringement of the fundamental rights of the person concerned and is therefore in particular need of legal and ethical justification. Firstly, the Opinion is indented to raise public awareness of the problems and complexities around benevolent coercion. Secondly, it aims to draw the attention of politicians, legislators and practitioners to regulatory and implementation deficits and it formulates recommendations to remedy them. Thirdly, it intends to support the health and social professions in reorienting their self-image and their practice. The Opinion contains general recommendations for the responsible handling of coercion in professional caring relationships as well as specific advice for psychiatry, child and youth support services, and the fields of elderly and disability care. = Vaccination as a Duty? = Using the example of measles, the council has examined which regulatory measures are ethically and legally acceptable to meet vaccination goals. In its Opinion, published 27 June 2019, the Council states that it is not a purely private matter, but rather a moral duty to have oneself and one's own children vaccinated against a highly contagious infectious disease such as measles. However, the existence of this moral duty does not necessarily entail the justification of a legal obligation to vaccinate. At the time of publication of its Opinion, the Council considers such a mandatory vaccination policy only to be appropriate for personnel in the health, social and educational sectors. However, the Council recommends a number of other measures, which, taken together, could be suitable to close any remaining vaccination gaps and achieve the goal of eliminating measles permanently. = Intervening in the Human Germline = In its Opinion, published 9 May 2019, the Council examines whether interventions in the human germline could be at all justifiable and according to which criteria the ethical admissibility of specific applications can be decided. It examines the further research process necessary before any clinical application and three possible areas of application for germline interventions: the prevention of severe hereditary disorders, the reduction of disease risks and the targeted improvement of specific human traits or abilities (enhancement). The analysis is based on eight ethical concepts: human dignity, protection of life and integrity, freedom, naturalness, non-maleficence and beneficence, justice, solidarity and responsibility. The Council members come up with seven unanimous recommendations, including a call for an application moratorium, but also the agreement that the human germline is not categorically inviolable. On many issues, however, there are different positions. = Robotics for Good Care = The research and development of robotic systems for home and in- patient care has received considerable public funding over the last couple of years. Political justification for this policy derives from urgent infrastructural, personnel and financial problems resulting from the increasing number of people in need of care and assistance and the worsening shortage of nursing staff. In its Opinion ‚ÄúRobotics for Good Care‚Äù, published 10 March 2020, the Council acknowledges the potential benefits of robotics for the entire care sector, but sees these benefits less in the elimination of staff shortages or the nursing crisis and more in its potential to promote good care. The realization of this potential, however, requires that the use of robots does not replace interpersonal relationships, that it is not used against the will of (professional) caregivers and people in need of care or merely to maximize efficiency, and that those affected by the techniques can also participate in their development. = \\"Reasonable\\" Treatment of Animals = The Council takes current debates as an opportunity to critically evaluate the treatment of livestock from a legal and ethical perspective. A working group has been established that will look at differences and discrepancies in dealing with and relating to different animals as well as at the obvious tensions between animal welfare regulations and certain aspects of agricultural practice. The aim of the project is to define more clearly both the protected goods at the heart of animal welfare regulation and the criteria according to which these may be curtailed in favour of other interests. Furthermore, the group aims to examine ways in which such a balancing of interests could be done more honestly and consistently in the future. Ad- hoc-Recommendations Since 2013, the council has been publishing Ad hoc- Recommendations in which it comments on current issues. Ad hoc-Recommendations have been published concerning the following topics: * Stem cell research ‚Äì new challenges for the ban on cloning and treatment of artificially created germ cells? (published 2014) * The regulation of assisted suicide in an open society: German Ethics Council recommends the statutory reinforcement of suicide prevention (published 2014) * Suicide prevention instead of suicide support. Reminder of a demand by the German Ethics Council on the occasion of a decision by the Federal Administrative Court (published 2017) * Germline intervention in the human embryo: German Ethics Council calls for global political debate and international regulation (published 2017) * The Challenges of Providing Care for Rare Diseases (published 2018) * Transgender Identity in Children and Adolescents: Therapeutic Controversies ‚Äì Ethical Orientation (published 2020) * Joint Statement on the Ethics of Heritable Human Genome Editing (joint statement of the Ethics Councils of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, published 2020) * Solidarity and Responsibility during the Coronavirus Crisis (published 2020) Other publications In addition to the Opinions and Ad hoc Recommendations, the Council publishes Annual Reports, three times a year an ‚Äúinformation letter‚Äù (Infobrief, only in German), studies and documentations (in German, sometimes also in English), e.g. conference reports, documentations of consultations. International exchange The Council stays in close dialogue with its partner committees in other European countries. For example, trilateral meetings with the British Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the French Comit√© consultatif national d‚Äô√©thique took place in 2009, 2012, 2016 and 2019. Meetings of the Ethics Councils of Germany, Austria and Switzerland were held in 2014 and 2017. In addition, the Council hosted the 2016 Global Summit of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils in Berlin under the Presidency of 2012-2016 Chair Prof. Dr. Christiane Woopen of Cologne University.

It was first published in 2008. Plot summary A quiet, sensitive girl who loves to read grows up in a very quiet environment. Vivien Kovacs is raised by Hungarian parents who have been quite silenced by the war and thus she seems to be removed from both the past and present. So she uses her books to reinvent herself through her favorite characters. That is, until Uncle Sandor appears on the scene. This uncle comes clad in a diamond watch, mohair suit and accompanied by a girl wearing a leopard-skin hat. He wants to share his life story with Vivien, telling her all about her family‚Äôs past. Vivien‚Äôs parents do not take well to this intruder. But Vivien wants to know why. That is just the plot. Throughout the pages the readers learn about heroism, survival and betrayals and how our clothes define our personalities. Themes Major themes in The Clothes on Their Back ‚Äì set in 1970s London ‚Äì are survival and betrayal, post-war, childhood and becoming the person we all need to become. Survival takes on many forms, including childhood, dealing with parents who are trying to survive the trauma of post-war. Awards The Clothes on Their Backs received the Orange Prize and was shortlisted for the 2008 Man Booker prize. Acclaim Grant‚Äôs writing in this book has been described as ‚Äúspectacularly humanizing.‚Äù She writes in ‚Äúvivid and supple prose [creating] a powerful story of family, love, and the hold the past has on the present.\\" According to a review in The Observer, ‚ÄúThere is nothing lightweight about its themes and yet it is so artfully constructed that you barely feel you're reading it at all, so fluid and addictive is the plot.‚Äù The Evening Standard described the book as being: \\"Gripping and written with keen understatement, it manages to be a domestic coming-of-age story even as it takes in the tumultuous sweep of the twentieth century.‚Äù A review in The Sunday Telegraph said: \\"Like money, clothes have real, symbolic and psychological value. Linda Grant understands these dimensions implicitly. Stitched beautifully into the fabric of her latest novel is an acute understanding of the role clothes play in reflecting identity and self-worth.... Grant's own particular beam reveals the way we acquire our sense of self from what gets reflected back to us, either in the mirror or in our relationships with others. She is at home writing about the thrilling ripple of a skirt as she is charting social tensions.‚Äù The Sunday Times wrote: ‚ÄúWe are what we wear because clothes reveal our personalities but, as Grant makes clear as she guides us through a dizzying ethical maze, they also conceal them....In this meticulously textured and complex novel, beneath Grant's surface dressing, what she is talking about is more than skin deep.‚Äù The Independent declared it: ‚ÄúA beautifully detailed character study, a poignant family history, and a richly evocative portrait...‚Äù The Telegraph said: ‚ÄúThis vivid, enjoyable and consistently unexpected novel is like Anita Brookner with sex. S√°ndor's mix of the endearing and the repellent takes on a life beyond that of an absorbing and unexpectedly ambitious story.‚Äù Maggie Perkovic said it was: ‚ÄúA very good read.‚Äù According to The Sunday Express, ‚ÄúIf you read only one novel this year, make sure it is The Clothes on Their Backs.‚Äù The Daily Express said it was: ‚Äúa beautifully written and truly moving book about the experience of growing up in Britain as a second generation immigrant.‚Äù And The London Paper said: ‚ÄúIt's a sublimely atmospheric and moving novel.‚Äù References Category:2008 British novels ","title":"The Clothes on Their Backs"},{"id":"45563316","text":"A stichting () is a Dutch legal entity with limited liability, but no members or share capital, that exists for a specific purpose.http://www.step.org/dutch-foundation This form of entity makes it possible to separate functions of ownership and control. Its use has been pioneered successfully in recent years as a 'poison pill' style defence tactic in hostile takeover situations by Scott V Simpson, one of Europe's leading mergers and acquisitions lawyers.The Wall Street Journal 'Going Dutch Has New Meaning In Corporate Takeover Battles' May 22, 2006 Formation A stichting is a legal person created through a legal act. This act is usually either a notarised deed (or a will) that contains the articles of the foundation which must include the first appointed board. No government authority is involved in the creation or authorization of a foundation. It acquires full legal capacity through its sole creation. A foundation has no members and its purpose must be stated in its articles, using capital dedicated to such goal. The foundations are defined in the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek), Boek 2 Art 285-304. It is not necessary in the Netherlands that a foundation serves a purpose of general interest, but its official goal cannot include making payments to anybody, except for charitable causes. A foundation is governed and represented by a board that is responsible for the foundation's administration. The board does not have a requirement for specific number of members. Art. 2:289 of the Civil Code establishes that all foundations must be registered in the Register of Commerce or \\"Kamer van Koophandel\\". Commercial activities are allowed if they are within the purpose of the foundation and are taxed. Board members can be held liable for the foundation, civilly as well as criminally. The Dutch Tax Service can declare an institution to be an \\"institution for general benefit\\" (ANBI), with tax benefits. Often, but not necessarily, this is a foundation. Conversely, not every foundation qualifies. Examples =Charitable organizations= *Cornelis Kruseman Stichting ‚Äì purpose: bring the work of painter Cornelis Kruseman (1797‚Äì1857) to the attention of the public. *Stichting Museumjaarkaart ‚Äì purpose: promote visits to Dutch museums. *Nederlandse Omroep Stichting ‚Äì purpose: make news and sports programmes for the three Dutch public television channels and the Dutch public radio services. *P2P Foundation that promotes peer to peer networking and action research. *Stichting FERN ‚Äì purpose: promote greater environmental and social justice, focusing on forests and forest peoples‚Äô rights. *Stichting INGKA Foundation ‚Äì purpose: promote and support innovation in the field of architectural and interior design. *Stichting Max Havelaar ‚Äì purpose: the Dutch member of Fairtrade International. *Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP ‚Äì pension fund for the government and educational sectors. *Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn ‚Äì pension fund for the healthcare and social work sectors. *Wiardi Beckman Stichting ‚Äì purpose: a think tank linked to the Labour Party (PvdA). *Mars One ‚Äì purpose: establish a permanent human colony on Mars. *MINIX 3 ‚Äì Stichting MINIX Research Foundation - purpose: Support and develop Minix3 Operating System. *Urgenda ‚Äì Foundation who won the State of the Netherlands v. Urgenda Foundation case at the Netherlands Supreme Court =Takeover defense= Stichtingen (Dutch plural form) are used as a type of poison pill (takeover defense mechanism) for publicly traded companies. In one case, the Dutch-incorporated pharmaceutical company Mylan established a stichting for the purpose of \\"safeguarding Mylan‚Äôs strategy, mission and independence\\" and gave the stichting the right to veto any proposed hostile takeover of Mylan. The stichting was activated in July 2015 to block a planned takeover by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. =Finance and investment= Stichtingen are used by institutional investors, such as banks and wealthy individuals, as a means of controlling assets while not having legal ownership or consolidating the assets on their financial statements. The properties of a stichting can be used to avoid inheritance tax, trade sanctions and expropriation. In one case, the Libyan-based oil company Oilinvest used a stichting structure to avoid sanctions on Libya and ensure its continued operation following the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi; in another case, the Russian oil company Yukos used a stichting structure in an attempt to shield its assets from tax claims by the Russian government.

A ceremony by the Russian Orthodox Church for the Liberation Day celebrations, March 2019 in Moscow. The Liberation Day, officially known as the Day of Liberation of Bulgaria from the Ottoman Dominion () in Bulgaria is celebrated on 3 March. It commemorates the Liberation of Bulgaria during the events of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) that led to the re-establishment of a Bulgarian statehood. The Treaty of San Stefano signed on 3 March 1878 envisaged the Ottoman Empire to accept the refoundation of the Bulgarian state that was conquered in 14th century during the Bulgarian‚ÄìOttoman wars. It was celebrated for the first time on 19 February 1880 as the Day of the Emperor Alexander II's Assassination and the Conclusion of the San Stefano Peace Treaty. It was officially designated as Liberation Day on its 10th anniversary in 1888 by the Principality of Bulgaria. It was only in 1978 when it started to be celebrated on a national scale. It became an official holiday by decree 236 of the Chairman of the State Council on 27 February 1990, coming into effect on 5 March. In Bulgaria, there are currently over 400 preserved monuments to Russians and Bulgarians. Every year on 3 March, wreaths are laid at the Shipka Monument and military honors in memory of all Russian soldiers who died fighting for the liberation of Bulgaria. Residents around the country commonly lay flowers and notes at monuments to the fallen foreign troops (Russian, Finnish and Romanian) alongside their Bulgarian counterparts. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church holds special liturgy and prayers on Liberation Day. In the evening, on the National Assembly Square near the monument to the Tsar Liberator, there is a solemn military service which includes the inspection of the National Guards Unit of Bulgaria by the President of Bulgaria and the awarding of military personnel with national decorations. An afternoon flag raising ceremony at the Monument to the Unknown Soldier is also held. In recent years, joint events have been carried out in the presence of the Bulgarian President and the President of Russia as well as by the Bulgarian Armed Forces and the Russian Armed Forces. To commemorate the centennial since liberation in 1978, the Bulgarian People's Republic led by General Secretary Todor Zhivkov held many different events including the awarding of the \\"100 Years of the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman Slavery\\" medal to many prominent figures in the Soviet Union. 3 March is an official non working day for Bulgarian employees.

Before the implementation of the Pension Reforms, the Pension security system of Armenia was characterized as a PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) pension system financed on the principle of the solidarity of generations. The system actually performed a distributive function; the payments were made by employees, employers and individual entrepreneurs to the State budget, of which the pensions payments were provided by the order defined by Law. The pension amount in the PAYE system is calculated based on the basic pension amount, the number of years in service and the compensation amount for each ensured service year, as well as pensioner‚Äôs personal coefficient (the latter is also calculated based on the number of eligible years of service). Over time, however, due to a number of factors (they will be discussed below) the pension system based on the principle of the solidarity of generations failed to meet the expectations of its beneficiaries. Evidently, the pension system of any country has to solve one problem: to ensure adequate living standards by guaranteeing their pensioners a dependable pension provision. That‚Äôs why many countries of the world, including Armenia, started looking for other ways to solve the problem, mainly putting forward the idea of developing the self- financing pension systems. History = Pension Reforms Incentives = Actually, the pension system based on the principle of solidarity of generations known to the world as the ‚ÄúBismarck‚Äôs system‚Äù has proved to be effective till the end of the 20th century. That efficiency was attributed to the rapid development of economics which resulted in increase in labor income among the population, as well as in the State tax revenues. Conditioned with the growth of the State budget revenue, the State was able to expand the number of social services provided to citizens by significantly changing their life quality. However, due to the above-mentioned factor, a series of processes took place which later on created a critical situation in the pension systems of those countries. Some of them were of paramount importance: # the average life expectancy increase which, of course, resulted from improvements of healthcare services and technologies, # birth rate decrease as a result of which the elderly began to outnumber in the world. Thus, it was out of the question that this type of pension security system would certainly expire itself and it was necessary to find brand-new solutions. As a result of theoretical and practical steps of different countries undergoing the pension reforms, three main problem solution options were created: * Tax burden increase among the working population; * Retirement age increase; * Development of self-financing pension systems. = The grounds for pension reforms in Armenia = Armenia faced the problem of pension provision after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was promoted by a number of factors such as: * the financial instability as a result of which the State budget was unable to provide pensioners with sufficient pensions, * the demographic situation which the country had to face mainly after it regained Independence; i.e. fertility decline, migration of the working population. The latter resulted in the violation of the digital balance among workers and pensioners and in the increase of tax burden (the ratio of employee to pensioner is 1 to 1 whereas it should be 3 to 1, i.e. three employees make social contributions of which pension is paid to one pensioner). Starting from the 90‚Äôs, the Government of Armenia has put the pension issue at the top of its agenda. A number of resolutions and laws were adopted, aimed at the industry regulation: # Laws ‚ÄúOn the RA Citizens‚Äô State Pension Security\\" were adopted respectively in 1992 and 1995, # and RA Law ‚ÄúOn State pensions‚Äù in 2003. In the initial phase, the preference was given to the situational options such as raising the retirement age, increasing the tax burden which, in fact, proved to be temporary solutions and would not provide reasonable and satisfying results. The need for complete review and radical solution to the issue became more and more prominent. Like numerous countries which have undergone the pension reforms, Armenia has finally decided to set up a new self-financing pension system as an already tested version. In 2005-2006, a new phase of pension reforms launched under which the RA Government adopted a series of regulatory decisions. The final reasoning was the Law ‚ÄúOn Funded Pensions‚Äù made on December 22, 2010 by the RA National Assembly. Thus, the pension system in Armenia became a multi pillar one: 2 new voluntary and mandatory funded pension components have been introduced. In 2014, due to some points the society used to discord with, Law was challenged in the RA Constitutional Court, and only after having met the requirements of the Supreme Court, it was again adopted by the RA National Assembly. = Pension system investment objectives = To minimize the risk of poverty at retirement by providing social welfare to the elderly. 1.to ensure long-term financial sustainability of the pension system, give a reasonable solution to the problem. 2.Create a direct, visible link between the individual‚Äôs income and his future pension amount, making him responsible for his future pension formation. There are a number of other expectations from the long-run funded pension system which are visible in case of the countries that have already undergone the pension reforms. In particular, it is expected that the pension funds will bring long- term financial resources into the economy which will lead to: # financial market activation # long-run money formation # national savings formation # loan interest rate reduction # investments growth. So, all of this will contribute to the stabilization of the economy in the country, and later on to its rapid development.

Early life Lowden was born in Bangkok, the younger brother of Victor Lowden. He was educated at the High School of Dundee from 1932 - 1935 and Strathallan School from 1935 - 1944. Following a brief stint in the Royal Navy he graduated with an MA in law from St. John's College, Cambridge. On 12 December 1945, Lowden received his blue for Cambridge University R.U.F.C., playing scrum-half against Oxford University RFC in The Varsity Match, which Cambridge won 11-8 at Twickenham Stadium. He completed his studies in Dundee, graduating LLB and CA, from the University of St. Andrews. Career Lowden started his career with Moody, Stuart & Robertson in Dundee, training with them from 1949 - 1953, becoming a partner in 1959. Later, he joined Peat Marwick McLintock before their merger with KPMG, becoming office managing partner in 1985. From 1979 - 1992 he was chairman of Dundee Port Authority. In 1955, Lowden started lecturing part-time at the University of Dundee. He is credited with setting up the Department of Accountancy at the University. Lowden became senior lecturer and then professor in the Department of Accountancy and Business Finance. From 1991 - 1997 he was a member of the court of the University. Lowden served as president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) from 1989 - 1990, having served as senior vice-president from 1988 - 1989. His term in office was one of the most traumatic in the history of the organisation. As president, he oversaw a vote amongst the membership which would have merged the organisation with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), creating a new British Institute. On 6 June 1989, members of ICAS and the ICAEW voted on a merger. ICAS voted against the merger, with 4023 voting no and 3274 voting yes, on a 60% turnout of 12,500 members. The ICAEW membership were overwhelmingly in favour of a merger, with 33,495 voting yes and only 2291 against, on a 40% turnout. From London the message was one of disappointment and in Edinburgh one of reconciliation. The debate had been divisive and heated for over 18 months. ICAS members had made a decisive choice and as of 2015 retain their own Institute. In February 1990, Lowden explained his predictions for the future of the profession in Scotland. Sportsman Lowden was a keen sportsman playing rugby for Dundee HSFP and captaining the team from 1949 - 1951. He was also a member of the Rules of Golf Committee at The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. In 2004 the committee became part of The R&A; group of companies and still works in conjunction with the United States Golf Association to govern the rules of golf on a worldwide basis.

The Pavillon de l‚Äôeau offers a permanent exhibition about the water supply history of the city, temporary exhibitions, children's activities (educational workshops, screenings, performances etc.) and thematic meetings. History The steam pump in 1828 In 1828, on the ancient road to Versailles, a steam pump was installed in order to pump water from the Seine to supply the municipalities of Auteuil and Passy. By the end of the nineteenth century, the old steam pumps were obsolete. Consequently, the City Council of Paris voted the construction of a new pumping station to replace the previous one with newer technology. The station (named station A) consisted of two buildings, the engine room and boiler room, both characterized by a brick structure and large roofs topped by skylights to allow sufficient ventilation and lighting. However, the new pumping station became outdated, especially regarding its coal consumption. So at the end of the First World War a new project was launched to attach a new pump to the previous one, referred to as station B, which was electrically powered. In 1955, station A was dismantled and the engine room became primarily used as a garage, and then as an office for administrative services until 2007, when the Pavillon de l'eau was inaugurated.L'usine d'Auteuil, mise en sc√®ne de l'Eau √† Paris, Henri Bresler SAGEP Permanent exhibition Permanent exhibition Alimenter Paris en eau is an exhibition about the water supply of Paris and its history from Roman aqueducts to nowadays.

Designed by Alfonso Architects, the museum is five stories and will feature a grand atrium, skylights, a spiral staircase, more than 40,000 square feet of gallery space, a library, theater, graphic studio, and park. The Two Red Roses Foundation, endowed by art collector, businessman and philanthropist Rodolfo (Rudy) Ciccarello is funding the Museum, which will display the Foundation's collection of fine and decorative arts of the Arts and Crafts Movement period.The building is reported to cost at least $90 million. History The Foundation's collection was developed by Rudy Ciccarello. Ciccarello first intended to build the museum in cooperation with the city of Tampa on a site across from the Tampa Museum of Art at the edge of Curtis Hixon Park. That deal fell apart in 2012 when Ciccarello and the city were unable to agree on financial terms, and Ciccarello decided to construct the museum without government assistace. Dewey Blanton of the American Alliance of Museums remarked on the rarity of museums on this scale being built in the United States \\"these days.\\" Ciccarello, who founded a successful pharmaceutical distribution business, says that he first became interested in the Arts and Crafts movement when he saw a cabinetmaker crafting a bookcase copied from one designed by Gustav Stickley, and decided to buy the original. He has been collecting since the early 1990s, purchasing \\"pottery, metalwork, lighting, tile, built-ins such as fireplaces, even entire rooms, tiled walls and all,\\" in addition to the furniture that first caught his eye. More recently, he began to collect photographers of the early 20th century Pictorialist movement, and the Photo-Secession movement, including Alfred Stieglitz. Kevin W. Tucker, the former Margot B. Perot Senior Curator of Decorative Arts and Design with the Dallas Museum of Art was appointed Director of the MAACM in August 2015. Ciccarello dissolved the Director position in December 2015. Collection The collection includes work by Gustav Stickley, Charles Rohlfs, Frank Lloyd Wright, the artists of Byrdcliffe Colony, Greene and Greene, Dirk van Erp, Roycroft, William Grueby, Newcomb Pottery, and Arthur Wesley Dow. Images and descriptions of some of the work to be displayed in the museum can be found on the website of the Two Red Roses Foundation. Kent Lydecker, director of the Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida), describes the Ciccarello collection as, \\"one of the most important collections of American Arts and Crafts, in all media, in private hands.\\"  References  External links * website of pre-opening collection Category:Arts and Crafts movement Category:Art museums in Florida Category:Museums in St. Petersburg, Florida Category:Decorative arts museums in the United States Category:Planned new art museums and galleries ","title":"Museum of the American Arts and Crafts Movement"},{"id":"45563620","text":"Sonal Parihar is an Indian television actress.
