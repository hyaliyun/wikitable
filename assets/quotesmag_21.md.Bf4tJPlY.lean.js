The temple, a Grama Kshetra, also contains some seventeenth century wood carvings (daru silpas) depicting figurines from epics. A Vattezhuttu inscription on the northern part of the base of the cultural shrine indicates that the repairs were completed in Kollam Era 840 (1665 AD).  The Legend  In the time of Pallibana perumal, it was decided to convert the Neelamperoor Shiva Temple into a Buddhist monastery. It is believed that the ten Brahmin families (later known as Pattiyillam Pottimar) came to Vazhappally by shaking the Shiva Linga of the temple of Neelamperoor and then merged with the existing shiva temple in Vazhappally. The Shiva lingam brought from Neelamperoor was first placed in the Devalokam at north part of Vazhappally gramam. Later, when they tried to shake the Shiva Linga but was unable to do so, Parasurama appeared to the grieving Brahmin family and offered him the Shiva Linga he had worshiped and advised him to build the temple on the Ardhanariswara concept. He built a huge shrine for the Shiva Linga and the Parvati idol. The sanctum sanctorum was built inside the three walls of the rounded stone granite shrine to the east of the Shiva Linga and to the west the Parvathi idol. Dakshinamoorthy and Ganapathi were placed inside the sanctum sanctorum as a vision south. In the south-eastern corner of the Nambalam, there was a large Tidapalli built. Raja built the subshrine temple for Sastha at the Kannimoola outside the Nambalam temple. He was promoted to the position of temple thantric rites to the Taranalloor series and the Tulu Brahmin family of Kasaragod for prients for daily pooja. The main priest was appointed as an umbrella and provided accommodation in the Kuthasanthi Math.  History  Flag-mast of the Vazhappally Temple The temple was very popular in the second Chera dynasty. After the fall of the Cheras, the place came under several rulers, the Thekkumkur and Travancore kings were prominent, witnessed many brutal wars, treachery, murder and annihilation. However, in all these cases, the temple was saved from destruction by the will of God and the prayers of the devotees. The legend behind this concept is that Chera king Palli Bana Perumal, when de-throwned by the Bhattas (learned Brahmins) following a defeat in argument, traveled to Neelamperoor. The news came to the ears of the Potti Leaders of the Pathu Illams (Chengazhi Muttam, Kainikkara, Eravi Mangalam, Kunnithidasserry, Athrasserry, Kolencherry, Kizhangazhuthu, Kannancherry, Thalavana etc.), that the king is going to install his own personal idol at Neelamperoor. The Potti Leaders of the Pathu Illams thus managed to run with the idol of Neelamperoor Shiva and install it at Vazhappally. = Ten Illoms = The temple administration was belongs to ten Brahmin families (ten illoms). These ten Brahmin families came from Neelamperoor village later settled in Vazhappally. Their temple administration lasted until the end of the 17th century. These are the ten Brahmin families are \\"Changazhimuttom, Kainikkara, Iravimangalom, Kunnithidasseri, Athrsseri, Kolancheri, Kizhangezhuthu, Kizhakkumbhagom, Kannancheri, Thalavana\\".

In order to ensure accurate documentation and reporting on a consistent basis, many organisations are positioning the project manager and project controller as part of a centralised project support organisation.http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-role-of-project- controller-10704.html Job Project controllers are often employed by consulting firms that perform management, technology, and/or human capital work for an external client. Although titles vary from firm to firm, most large consulting firms such as Accenture, PWC, Deloitte and Bearing Point have individuals who perform project controller duties. The project controller is responsible for overseeing the financial health of the project by analyzing costs, revenue, risks, and pricing for the consulting firm. The role of the project controller can vary depending on the type and scale of the project, but most all project controllers maintain budget tracking tools, issue invoices and billings, manage fee structures, and forecast potential gains and losses in pursuing future work with a client.Project Controller Key Duties HR Management. November 8, 2010. Not all projects have a project controller. Smaller projects that are expected to be shorter in duration typically may have no project controller overseeing the daily financial activity of the project. The responsibility will usually be assumed by the project manager of the project. For larger scale projects or projects requiring on-site interaction with the external client (typically public sector projects), there may be one or several project controllers to ensure that staffing levels and billing rates are appropriate for the budgetary scope of the project.The Role of a Project Controller Arabian Business. November 8, 2010. Because most project controllers are serving the internal project management team, they are typically considered non-billable to the client. However, in projects where client staff and the consulting firm work in the same unit, some clients have agreed to be billed for project controllers to facilitate financial transactions and communications between the consulting firm and the client. Some project controllers will also perform expense audits for the project to ensure that all expenses to the project are in compliance with the consulting firm's and the client's expense policies. Along with profit/loss analysis and budgeting, project controllers are often involved in the original pricing of a project. The pricing of a project occurs before the work begins and is meant decide the best fee structure and overall cost to the client for the service that will be provided. The project controller helps determine the optimal price to charge the client in order to retain profit at the end of the engagement. Qualification Although there are no formal qualification criteria, project controllers usually have graduate level training in project management or finance such as MSF or MBA degrees, or are qualified accountants (i.e. CIMA, CCA, ACCA, CGA, CMA, or CA designation). \\"Industry experience\\" is often a pre-requisite and so controllers often have undergraduate degrees in related fields. Also, many analysts originally enter this domain through their practice as consultants or accountants and so a very wide range of qualifications is common.Deloitte Project Controller Qualifications Deloitte November 8, 2010. In some firms, it is (additionally) preferred that analysts earn a professional certification such as the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, or the Certified International Investment Analyst (CIIA) designation. However, professional designation is rarely a requirement, and many have reached the peak of the profession without ever sitting for the CFA or the CIIA exam. Basic analytical skills, and strong numerical skills are necessary and a proficient understanding of and experience with Microsoft Excel is usually required.

Early life English is the first of two sons born in Leicester, to businessman Jack English and Dutch mother Jansje Schoen. He attended Ashby Grammar School. Friends of English at the time include Leicester natives fashion photographer David Parkinson and musician Ric Grech (Family and Blind Faith) both of whom died young. English's younger brother William attended the London Film School in 1972, encouraging Jack to move to London where he worked at the International Telephone Exchange on Carter Lane. In the autumn of 1978, Jack was involved in setting up a PX clothes shop in Covent Garden with Roger Burton. He and Burton then left to form Contemporary Wardrobe, leading to a commission to supply the costumes for the film Quadrophenia and independent styling work for MPL (Paul McCartney), Italian Vogue and Boulevard. After his mother's death from cancer, English spent five years working for oil companies in Madagascar, Nigeria and rigs in the North Sea, eventually becoming a flaneur/plongeur in his brother William's restaurant in London's Borough Market (Dining Room 1980‚Äì1990). Here, his brother introduced him to avant-garde film. In 1981, an interview English conducted with Kenneth Anger in New York was published in Time Out magazine, and was later republished in the summer 1983 edition of On Film. Photography English's interest in photography grew from a longstanding love of film, further fueled by his work in the fashion industry. In 1989, using a borrowed camera, English photographed jazz musician Chet Baker after a chance encounter in Cannes, followed by a portrait of Andy Warhol that was published in The Sunday Times magazine. In 1992, English came to a decision to abstain from drugs and alcohol and concentrate on a career as a photographer. This new focus lead to several commissions. Eric Clapton hired English to photograph his 1992 tour of the USA with Elton John as well as shoot images for the liner notes of his 1994 blues album From the Cradle. It was this album that caught the eye of Gary Oldman, who was preparing to shoot his debut film Nil By Mouth. Oldman wasn‚Äôt looking for traditional ‚Äòfilm stills‚Äô and sought out English for a meeting, ultimately recruiting him for the job. Oldman later recommended English to director Luc Besson, who then hired him to take photos on many of his blockbuster films, including The Fifth Element and Joan of Arc. Stills from Nil by Mouth and Joan of Arc are available in published in book form. After taking a break from shooting film stills to focus on other work, including an exhibition about Los Angeles homeless population, English returned in 2008 to shoot Roger Donaldson's The Bank Job. This began a stint of working on acclaimed British films, including Paddy Considine's BIFA award- winning directorial debut Tyrannosaur, Tomas Alfredson's Oscar nominated and BAFTA award-winning Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Peter Strickland's BIFA award- winning Berberian Sound Studio and Lynne Ramsay's BAFTA award-winning short film Swimmer. English's stills from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy were particularly lauded, featuring on the cover of Italian Vogue's February 2012 issue and as part of a travelling exhibition sponsored by Paul Smith. In 2013, English worked on Gavin O'Connor's Jane Got A Gun, Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight and Morten Tyldum's The Imitation Game. In 2014, he photographed the stills of Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash. Style and Influences In his feature film work, English has said that he thinks about the style and context of any film he works on, and how to replicate this in his pictures. He has said that when it comes to his work he finds ‚Äòpainters more influential ‚Äì the Surrealists, for example. He has mentioned Francis Bacon as an influence on his work on Nil By Mouth and the work of Irving Penn on his work on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Other photographers English admires include Paul Graham, Chris Killip, German visual artist Gerhardt Richter, Saul Leiter and Ralph Gibson.

The purpose is to allow access to material for confiscation or digital forensics purposes and use it either as evidence in a court of law or to enforce national security interests. Similarly, mandatory decryption laws force owners of encrypted data to supply decrypted data to law enforcement. Nations vary widely in the specifics of how they implement key disclosure laws. Some, such as Australia, give law enforcement wide-ranging power to compel assistance in decrypting data from any party. Some, such as Belgium, concerned with self-incrimination, only allow law enforcement to compel assistance from non-suspects. Some require only specific third parties such as telecommunications carriers, certification providers, or maintainers of encryption services to provide assistance with decryption. In all cases, a warrant is generally required.  Theory and countermeasures  Mandatory decryption is technically a weaker requirement than key disclosure, since it is possible in some cryptosystems to prove that a message has been decrypted correctly without revealing the key. For example, using RSA public-key encryption, one can verify given the message (plaintext), the encrypted message (ciphertext), and the public key of the recipient that the message is correct by merely re-encrypting it and comparing the result to the encrypted message. Such a scheme is called undeniable, since once the government has validated the message they cannot deny that it is the correct decrypted message.Desmedt, Yvo and Burmester, Mike and Seberry, Jennifer. Equitability in Retroactive Data Confiscation versus Proactive Key Escrow. Florida State University Department of Computer Science 206 Love Building FL 32306-4530 Tallahassee USA. Lecture Notes in Computer Science: Public Key Cryptography, pp.277-286. 2001. (Postscript), (Postscript 2) As a countermeasure to key disclosure laws, some personal privacy products such as BestCrypt, FreeOTFE, and TrueCrypt have begun incorporating deniable encryption technology, which enable a single piece of encrypted data to be decrypted in two or more different ways, creating plausible deniability.Plausible DeniabilityTrueCrypt - Hidden Volume Another alternative is steganography, which hides encrypted data inside of benign data so that it is more difficult to identify in the first place. A problematic aspect of key disclosure is that it leads to a total compromise of all data encrypted using that key in the past or future; time-limited encryption schemes such as those of Desmedt et al. allow decryption only for a limited time period.  Criticism and alternatives  Critics of key disclosure laws view them as compromising information privacy, by revealing personal information that may not be pertinent to the crime under investigation, as well as violating the right against self-incrimination and more generally the right to silence, in nations which respect these rights. In some cases, it may be impossible to decrypt the data because the key has been lost, forgotten or revoked, or because the data is actually random data which cannot be effectively distinguished from encrypted data. A proactive alternative to key disclosure law is key escrow law, where the government holds in escrow a copy of all cryptographic keys in use, but is only permitted to use them if an appropriate warrant is issued. Key escrow systems face difficult technical issues and are subject to many of the same criticisms as key disclosure law; they avoid some issues like lost keys, while introducing new issues such as the risk of accidental disclosure of large numbers of keys, theft of the keys by hackers or abuse of power by government employees with access to the keys. It would also be nearly impossible to prevent the government from secretly using the key database to aid mass surveillance efforts such as those exposed by Edward Snowden.

There's no specific law in this matter, as e.g. in the UK. It is generally assumed that the Polish Criminal Procedure Code (Kodeks Postƒôpowania Karnego Dz.U. 1997 nr 89 poz. 555.) provides means of protecting against self-incrimination, including lack of penalization for refusing to answer any question which would enable law enforcement agencies to obtain access to potential evidence, which could be used against testifying person.Webhosting.pl - W jaki spos√≥b s≈Çu≈ºby mogƒÖ uzyskaƒá dostƒôp do zaszyfrowanych danych = South Africa = Under the RICA Act of 2002, refusal to disclose a cryptographic key in your possession could result in a fine up to ZAR 2 Million or up to 10 years imprisonment.

However, there is legislation proposed on the basis that the Council of Europe has already adopted a convention on cyber-crime related to this issue. The proposed legislation would allow police to require an individual to disclose information, such as passwords and cryptographic keys, during searches. The proposal has been introduced to make it easier for police and prosecutors. The proposal has been criticized by the Swedish Data Protection Authority. = Switzerland = In Switzerland there is no law specifying obligation to issue keys or passwords. = The Netherlands = Article 125k of the Wetboek van Strafvordering allows investigators with a warrant to access information carriers and networked systems.

However, such an order may not be given to the suspect under investigation. = United Kingdom = The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), Part III, activated by ministerial order in October 2007, requires persons to decrypt information and/or supply keys to government representatives to decrypt information without a court order. Failure to disclose carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail, or five years in the cases of national security or child indecency. The provision was first used against animal rights activists in November 2007, and at least three people have been prosecuted and convicted for refusing to surrender their encryption keys, one of whom was sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment. Even politicians responsible for the law have voiced concerns that its broad application may be problematic.https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnjgdq/how-refusing-to- hand-over-your-passwords-can-land-you-in-jail (9) of section 49 failed to consider that mere authentication can be used in a way analogous to encryption, making it possible to circumvent the law via chaffing and winnowing. In 2017, schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 was used to charge Muhammad Rabbani with \\"wilfully obstructing or seeking to frustrate a search examination\\" after allegedly refusing to disclose passwords. He was later convicted. In 2018, Stephen-Alan Nicholson, the prime suspect in a murder case, was charged with refusing to provide his Facebook password to police.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lucy-mchugh-murder- facebook-southampton-woods-stabbing-death-a8471566.html = United States = The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects witnesses from being forced to incriminate themselves, and there is currently no law regarding key disclosure in the United States. However, the federal case In re Boucher may be influential as case law. In this case, a man's laptop was inspected by customs agents and child pornography was discovered. The device was seized and powered-down, at which point disk encryption technology made the evidence unavailable. The judge held that it was a foregone conclusion that the content exists since it had already been seen by the customs agents, Boucher's encryption password \\"adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information.\\" In another case, a district court judge ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case: \\"I conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer,\\" Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled on January 23, 2012. In Commonwealth v. Gelfgatt, the court ordered a suspect to decrypt his computer, citing exception to Fifth Amendment can be invoked because \\"an act of production does not involve testimonial communication where the facts conveyed already are known to the government...\\". However, in United States v. Doe, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled on 24 February 2012 that forcing the decryption of one's laptop violates the Fifth Amendment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation may also issue national security letters that require the disclosure of keys for investigative purposes. One company, Lavabit, chose to shut down rather than surrender its master private keys due to the government wanting to spy on Edward Snowden's emails. Since the summer of 2015, cases have been fought between major tech companies such as Apple over the regulation of encryption with government agencies asking for access to private encrypted information for law enforcement purposes. A technical report was written and published by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where Ronald Rivest, an inventor of RSA, and Harold Abelson, a computer science professor at MIT with others, explain the technical difficulties, including security issues that arise from the regulation of encryption or by making a key available to a third party for purposes of decrypting any possible encrypted information. The report lists scenarios and raises questions for policy makers. It also asks for more technical details if the request for regulating encryption is to be pursued further. In 2019, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in a ruling that only controls for that state's law, held that a suspect in a child pornography case could not be compelled to reveal his password, despite telling the police \\"‚ÄúWe both know what‚Äôs on there.\\"  See also  *Deniable encryption *Key splitting *Rubber-hose cryptanalysis *Crypto wars  References   Further reading  * Bert-Jaap Koops.

Bankstown Library and Knowledge Centre The old central library building was replaced with the new Bankstown Library and Knowledge Centre designed by architects Francis-Jones Morehen Thorp (FJMT) repurposing the old Town Hall Building built in the 1970s. The new library was officially opened by the Mayor Khal Asfour on Sunday, 6 April 2014. The building is 5000m2 and includes meeting rooms and the 300 seat Bryan Brown Theatre.

Portrait photo of Frederick Henry Litchfield (1832‚Äì1867). Early life Litchfield was born in British India, on 27 May 1832, the eldest son of Charles William Litchfield (c.1802‚Äì1850), who was then serving in the 17th Foot of the British Army as a non-commissioned officer. His grandfather was a London surgeon and his lineage is reputedly connected to the Earl of Lichfield title in England.The Advertiser, 25 May 1929, p 16 His mother was Margaret, nee O'Connor (1808‚Äì1834), but after she died young his father remarried in India in 1835 to Ellen Munro (1818‚Äì1908), daughter of Donald and Isabella Munro. Donald Munro (1785‚Äì1822), a Scot, also served in the 17th Foot. His father later transferred to the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot as sergeant- major. In 1836 the regiment returned from Bengal to be stationed at Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. In reward for his many years‚Äô service in India, and pending his retirement, in July 1838 Sergeant-Major C.W. Litchfield was commissioned as ensign (rank), without purchase, and then in November 1838 retired from the army.United Service Magazine, Volume 28, 1838, p 140 South Australia During that same year the extended Litchfield family decided upon emigration to South Australia. Charles William Litchfield and family (including six-year-old Fred) embarked at London on the D‚ÄôAuvergne, arriving at Adelaide on 22 March 1839. Aboard the same ship were Charles' brother John and family, and sisters Mary and Anne. The brother, Dr John Palmer Litchfield, M.D., (1808‚Äì1869) had formerly practiced in London. Upon arrival at Adelaide, Dr Litchfield immediately commenced practice as a consulting physician, subsequently became the first Inspector of Hospitals in South Australia, and later moved to Canada where he died in 1869.Register, 1 June 1839, p 6 One sister, Mary Walford Litchfield, died 1846, while the other, Anne Litchfield, married Thomas Reynolds, later the fifth Premier of South Australia. Much later, in 1851, another brother, Frederick Burnett Litchfield, arrived at Adelaide with his family, and became connected with the railways. His daughter, Louisa Jane Litchfield, married William Davy and were the parents of Dr Ruby Claudia Emily Davy, noted South Australian musician and composer.The Advertiser, 9 May 1929, p 15 In early 1840 Charles William Litchfield joined the newly formed (but short-lived) militia, the South Australian Volunteers, as its captain and adjutant, being thereafter generally known as Captain Litchfield. Police sub-inspector Alexander Tolmer held the other adjutant position in the S.A.V. On 17 June 1840, Litchfield was gazetted as a sub- inspector of the metropolitan (foot) branch of the South Australia Police.South Australian Register, 20 June 1840, p 6 The man who appointed him was Thomas Shuldham O‚ÄôHalloran, then newly appointed as Commissioner of Police, and a former lieutenant of the 17th Foot, with whom Litchfield had served in India. O‚ÄôHalloran was also major-commandant of the S.A.V. militia. Meanwhile, young Fred Litchfield‚Äôs education began at a private day school in Adelaide, and was finished at the Oddfellows School, of which Lodge his father was an office-holder. The family grew rapidly, and younger half-brothers and half-sisters soon joined Fred. Charles William Litchfield served ten years in the police, rising to Inspector rank and overall command of the Adelaide Metropolitan Police. Then, after a short illness, he died on 25 August 1850, aged 47 years, leaving a widow and nine children.Register, 26 August 1850, p 1 His death was not without public controversy. Inspector Litchfield was highly esteemed but not wealthy. Many prominent citizens felt great sympathy for his widow and family. Police connections as well as members of his Oddfellows Lodge rapidly raised a considerable endowment. This was offered as a managed trust, rather than an outright gift, but it was refused by the widow on grounds that she wished to control her own financial destiny.Register, 3 October 1850, p 3 The refusal of this charitable gesture caused many donors to become so indignant that they retracted their contribution.Register, 1 November 1850, p 3 Victorian Goldfields In 1851 Fred‚Äôs sister, Agnes Theresa, married to mounted police Corporal George Ezekiel Mason, stationed at Wellington, South Australia, on the River Murray. Mason was also sub-protector of Aborigines.Register, 7 February 1851, p 2 In view of his stepmother‚Äôs grim financial situation, Fred joined them there, working as a labourer in the district. When the Victorian gold rush came, 21-year-old Fred was quick to head for the diggings to make his own way in life. Along with one of the Mason family, he sailed to Melbourne in January 1853 on the Dreadnought.Register, 27 January 1853, p 3 The pair then led a knockabout life as gold-miners, without tangible success, until Fred returned to Wellington about 1858. Again unemployed, he had thoughts of obtaining his own grazing property there. Tolmer expedition At Wellington, Fred was to again cross paths with Alexander Tolmer, whose police career was ignominiously over. Tolmer was now a settler there, but still had grand ambitions. In September 1859, with partly SA Government support, Tolmer commenced an exploration expedition to cross Central Australia and reach the north coast.Register, 24 August 1859, p 2 Among those in his party of seven was Fred Litchfield, taken because he was \\"generally useful\\". Also in the party was ex-policeman Bernard Shaw of Wellington who, like Tolmer, had served with Fred‚Äôs father. At that time there was fierce competition, notably with the privately sponsored party of John McDouall Stuart, to be first to succeed. Tolmer‚Äôs badly organised expedition was a costly failure, being abandoned just beyond the northern Flinders Ranges.Register, 23 November 1859, p 3 Litchfield received expenses but no wages.Alexander Tolmer, Reminiscences, etc, Vol II, (London 1882), pp 256, 274. Meanwhile, Stuart‚Äôs expedition went on to success and fame. Pastoralist Litchfield‚Äôs first experience of exploration having been a disappointment, he was again unemployed at Wellington, still looking for his own scrub run. On 21 October 1860, in partnership with his half-brother John Munro Litchfield, he took out an annual Crown Lands lease on a sheep run of some 42 square miles. This mallee scrubland run was located east of the River Murray near Wellington but was without water, which the brothers immediately began to sink for. Their uncle, Thomas Reynolds, then Premier of South Australia, paid for the lease and stock.Register, 14 January 1862, p 3 Controversially, another half-brother, William Litchfield, who falsely claimed in the Insolvency Court that he also shared an interest in this run, was appointed Crown Lands Ranger at Wellington, which resulted in very public libel litigation by Thomas Reynolds against the Northern Star newspaper.Register, 13 February 1862, p 2 Northern territory In 1864 the South Australian Government mounted an expedition to the Northern Territory for the purposes of survey and settlement. The leader was Boyle Finniss who, having been Commissioner of Police, knew Fred Litchfield‚Äôs late father well. Having struggled to make a success of his pastoral run, Litchfield relinquished the lease to join the Finniss party of some forty officers and men as a stockman and labourer. Tolmer had recommended him as a good worker. Finniss, who was instructed to examine the Adelaide River and environs, chose a settlement site at Escape Cliffs. Litchfield was 32 years old when he arrived by sea in the Northern Territory, which he was immediately enthusiastic about, despite being speared at Escape Cliffs in August 1864. During 1864‚Äì65 Litchfield‚Äôs reputation rose as he, initially with surveyor W. P. Auld, took part in, and then led, exploration parties in the Howard River, Darwin, Northern Territory, Batchelor, Northern Territory, Adelaide River, Finniss River, and Daly River regions.Register 6 March 1866, p 3 In doing so, Litchfield was among the first Europeans to walk the area that became the streets of Darwin, Northern Territory. Having had experience on the Victorian goldfields, it was at the Finniss River that the presence of gold arrested his attention; hence Litchfield went down in history as the man who discovered gold in the Northern Territory.Dickinson, Janet: Litchfield‚Äôs Gold: the life of Fred Litchfield (Darwin, 1988) Being loyal and industrious, Litchfield was so well regarded by Finniss that on 28 July 1865 he was appointed Acting Inspector in command of his newly formed (and short-lived) Rural Constabulary. Many regarded the formation of this police force beyond the power of Finniss to do, but it must have made Litchfield proud to be emulating the accomplishments of his father. Over time the decisions of Finniss became so criticised that the South Australian Government recalled the party with the intention of holding an inquiry into his conduct. In December 1865 the barque Ellen Lewis left the Northern Territory carrying Finniss and most of the witnesses, including Litchfield, to arrive back at Adelaide in February 1866.Register, 14 February 1866, p 2 Litchfield then appeared as a witness favourable to Finniss at the Northern Territory Commission hearings that took place during March‚ÄìApril 1866.Register, 27 April 1866, p 3 Death and legacy Soon afterward, Fred Litchfield promptly left Adelaide to travel to Bengal to join his younger brother George who was interested in tea plantations, thereby returning to the place of his birth and infancy.Register, 17 June 1867, p 2 In June 1866, the Litchfield family heard that 29-year-old George Charles Litchfield had died suddenly in Cachar, Bengal, on 10 March.Register, 13 June 1866, p 2 The cause is unknown, but famine and disease was then raging in many districts of Bengal. After settling George‚Äôs affairs, Fred travelled about Bengal extensively, and in August 1866 wrote a letter to the Register newspaper in Adelaide comparing the similarities, yet the merits, of the Northern Territory over those of Bengal.Register 3 December 1866, p 3 It seems he was looking for crops which might suit the Territory. Fred Litchfield had been in Bengal only nine months when he died at Sylhet, Bengal, (now Bangladesh) on 1 March 1867, aged 35 years.Register, 28 June 1867, p 5 The cause of death is unknown. He had never married. In his time Litchfield was one of the few Europeans that could see great agricultural and pastoral prospects for the Northern Territory. His gold discovery, though inconclusive, stimulated the rush in the early 1870s that hastened its development. He is commemorated in the naming of Litchfield Municipality and Litchfield National Park, among other places. As a tragic but somewhat connected postscript, in 1875 his aunt and uncle, Anne and Thomas Reynolds, who were his resolute supporters, were returning from the Northern Territory to Adelaide when they were lost in the wreck of the SS Gothenburg.

Playing what was then known as new wave, the station aired for a month, no call letters, no jocks. When they finally announced \\"This is dwNU, if you're listening, please call.\\" After mentioning the phone number on air, the phone rang consistently for three hours. Back then, its studios were located at Paseo De Roxas in Makati. DWNU 107.5 FM was the brainchild of radio veteran Mike Pedero and banker/businessman Atom Henares. Born out of the need to come up with a product that would set the standard for good taste in music amongst the youths, NU 107 blasted the airwaves with rock, music that is \\"dynamic, young, passionate, creative, and always ready to renew itself.\\" =Win Radio (2010‚Äì2014)= 107.5 Win Radio logo (November 8, 2010-June 26, 2014) The station debuted on November 8, 2010 as 107.5 Win Radio after NU 107 signed off for the last time a day earlier.

Since 2002, it retained its #1 spot among Metro Manila stations. Eventually, he formed UBSI in 1991, created and popularized Energy FM in key provinces beginning in 1996. In 2003, Energy took over DWKY in Manila, immediately becoming a household sensation and in 2008 reaching as far as #2 among Metro Manila stations.

Originally written in English in 1963, it was published posthumously by Hong Kong University Press on 15 April 2010.Book Launch: Eileen Chang's The Fall of the Pagoda Zhao Pihui translated it into Chinese. Language The novel was written originally by Eileen Chang in English rather than Chinese, although the author was Chinese. Its author Eileen Chang lived in Shanghai where she spent her childhood. So the translator translated it into Shanghai dialect which can depict their lives vividly. Before its publication, the executor of Eileen Chang's estate, Roland Soong, decided to show people The Fall of the Pagoda in bilingual, both English and Chinese. According to the voluminous correspondence between Stephen Soong and Eileen Chang, the writer planned to translate it into Chinese but she was afraid that the story about a young girl's childhood cannot stimulate the reader's appetite. So the plan was terminated. Background of the book The Fall of the Pagoda is a semi- autobiographical novel written originally by Eileen Chang in English. She finished writing the book in 1963 while she was in the United States.\\"Fall of the Pagoda Records Eileen Chang‚Äôs Childhood\\". Beijing Today. 30 April 2010. Retrieved 19 December 2010. Eileen Chang decided to launch her American career with this book and The Book of Change but failed to find a publisher. In this book, she depicted her childhood years in Tianjin and Shanghai of the 1930s, while the Book of Change revolved around her wartime student days in Hong Kong. Plot summary The Fall of the Pagoda tells a narrative story about the childhood life of a girl, Lute, born in a noble family which is in a process of moral and financial decline. As a young girl, her mother followed her aunt to go abroad,and her father was addicted to opium, leaving her and her little brother to live with their servants, aunt Tong, aunt He, aunt Qin, etc. Her father presided over their family. But he did not work due to a negative attitude to life and the addiction to opium. Lute's mother, Lu, a woman in the vanguard of female self-reliance, decided to divorce with her father, the patriarch who was adrift in post-Qing China. Maybe due to her special family background, the little girl was different in some significant way from others of the same age. Her psychological age is much older than actual age. Lute's sickly brother, Hill, as a boy, was the important child in this family because he would be the successor of his father, Yuxi. The young boy was cosseted, over-supervised and beaten so that he was weak and morose. Lute was often ignored and had more freedom to do what she wanted. She was given to those of no consequence. Lute grew up around servants, the sprawling, extended family existed in a sea of gossip, scandal, jealousy and fear. They were bound together by their need for money, and the terror of destitution. They lived on the family's ever-diminishing wealth and tarnished prestige, pretending loyalty while pursuing their own survival and pleasure. Through young Lute's child clear eyes, those adults sometimes were hypocritical; even her parents were relentlessly selfish. Characters =Lute= Lute () is the main character in this novel. The whole story tells about the young girl's childhood. She was left to the care of servants, and the companionship of her sickly brother. Unlike her brother, Lute was placed in a place of no consequence but also was given more freedom to do what she wanted. She was born in a fading aristocratic family in Shanghai. Around her, contradictions and aberrations are normal in Lute's family. Lute grows up watching the adults around her, and there is much to see. The sprawling, extended family and their ever-present servants exist in a sea of gossip, scandal, jealousy and fear. This is a household immersed in a decaying grandeur amid the intoxicating smell of opium. For Lute, the family was like a pagoda imprisoning her which she spent all her life to escape, albeit reluctantly. It was hard for her to give it up and terminate her memory of the family completely. People most think her father hurt Lute more. But in this novel, you may find out a truth that her mother actually was the person who hurt Lute more. As Lute said to Dew (her mother), not father: \\"He never hurt me because I never loved him\\". =Hill= Hill (), Lute's young brother, was sickly and infected with tuberculosis by his step-mother. As the only boy of the family, he would be the successor of his father. Compared to his elder sister, the boy was cosseted, over-supervised and beaten so that he was weak and unsociable. Most of time, he kept silent to everything around him and no one knew him, even his only elder sister who got along with him every day. Hill died of the negligence of parents, just 17 years old. His death seemed like a secret to Lute to which she never can find the key. =Dew= Dew (), Lute and Hill's mother, was an open-minded woman who had the courage to divorce with her husband in that old days fulling of feudal ideology. But she was also selfish and cruel to give up her little daughter and son. Due to the abnormal family relationship, young Lute always observed the world around her with distrust. Dew became the very person who hurt Lute the most. Generally speaking, she was not a qualified mother. =Yuxi= Yuxi () was the master of the noble family. He indulged himself in debauchery and divorced his wife, Dew-Lute and Hill's mother. Usually, he did not have enough time to get along with his children because of opium addiction. =Servants= There were many servants in this noble family, such as aunt Tong, aunt Qin, aunt He and so on. Taking aunt He for example, she brought up Yuxi's father, Yuxi and Yuxi's daughter, Lute. But at last, aunt He was ejected from the family which she served almost all her life. This was the servants' fate. In that old days, they were always in a powerless position suffering oppression and enslavement. Social factors Eileen Chang lived during a period of transition in China. The author and her work Eileen Chang, whose real name is Zhang Ying (Âº†Áëõ), was born in a decaying noble family. She has the extremely prominent family background that her grandfather, Zhang Peilun (Âº†‰Ω©Á∫∂)was a noted Qing Dynasty statesman; her grandmother Li Juou (ÊùéÈû†ËÄ¶) was the firstborn daughter of Li Hongzhang (ÊùéÈ∏øÁ´†), minister of Qing state court. Eileen Chang is now recognized as one of the greatest modern Chinese writers, though she was completely erased from official histories in mainland China for her first husband Hu Lancheng (ËÉ°ÂÖ∞Êàê). She was the most popular writer in Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II, with English and Chinese stories focusing on human frailties rather than nationalist propaganda. For her non-committal politics and idiosyncrasies, she was boycotted by fellow writers after the war and forced to the margins of literary respectability. Eileen Chang is noted for writing that deals with relationship between male and female in the history of modern Chinese literature. Being a prolific and exceptional writer in modern China, she combined the art with life perfectly and created a large number of outstanding literary works. Her novels, plays, essays and literary comments such as Lust, Caution, Jin Suo Ji, Love in a Fallen City, Eighteen Springs (novel) and The Fall of the Pagoda helped her gain reputation and had set up a unique art building for her.

In the Euclidean plane, the moment curve is a parabola, and in three-dimensional space it is a twisted cubic. Its closure in projective space is the rational normal curve. Moment curves have been used for several applications in discrete geometry including cyclic polytopes, the no-three-in-line problem, and a geometric proof of the chromatic number of Kneser graphs. Properties Every hyperplane intersects the moment curve in a finite set of at most d points. If a hyperplane intersects the curve in exactly d points, then the curve crosses the hyperplane at each intersection point. Thus, every finite point set on the moment curve is in general linear position., p. 100; , Lemma 5.4.2, p. 97; , Lemma 1.6.4, p. 17. Applications The convex hull of any finite set of points on the moment curve is a cyclic polytope.; , p. 101; , Lemma 5.4.2, p. 97. Cyclic polytopes have the largest possible number of faces for a given number of vertices, and in dimensions four or more have the property that their edges form a complete graph. More strongly, they are neighborly polytopes, meaning that each set of at most d/2 vertices of the polytope forms one of its faces. Sets of points on the moment curve also realize the maximum possible number of simplices, \\\\Omega(n^{\\\\lceil d/2\\\\rceil}), among all possible Delaunay triangulations of sets of n points in d dimensions.. In the Euclidean plane, it is possible to divide any area or measure into four equal subsets, using the ham sandwich theorem. Similarly but more complicatedly, any volume or measure in three dimensions may be partitioned into eight equal subsets by three planes. However, this result does not generalize to five or more dimensions, as the moment curve provides examples of sets that cannot be partitioned into 2d subsets by d hyperplanes. In particular, in five dimensions, sets of five hyperplanes can partition segments of the moment curve into at most 26 pieces. It is not known whether four-dimensional partitions into 16 equal subsets by four hyperplanes are always possible, but it is possible to partition 16 points on the four-dimensional moment curve into the 16 orthants of a set of four hyperplanes., pp. 70‚Äì79; , pp. 50‚Äì51. A construction based on the moment curve can be used to prove a lemma of Gale, according to which, for any positive integers k and d, it is possible to place 2k + d points on a d-dimensional sphere in such a way that every open hemisphere contains at least k points. This lemma, in turn, can be used to calculate the chromatic number of the Kneser graphs, a problem first solved in a different way by L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz., Section 3.5, Gale's Lemma and Schrijver's Theorem, pp. 64‚Äì67. The use of Gale's lemma for the coloring problem is due to . The moment curve has also been used in graph drawing, to show that all n-vertex graphs may be drawn with their vertices in a three-dimensional integer grid of side length O(n) and with no two edges crossing. The main idea is to choose a prime number p larger than n and to place vertex i of the graph at coordinates :(i, i 2 mod p, i 3 mod p).. Then a plane can only cross the curve at three positions. Since two crossing edges must have four vertices in the same plane, this can never happen. A similar construction using the moment curve modulo a prime number, but in two dimensions rather than three, provides a linear bound for the no-three-in-line problem.Credited by to Paul Erd≈ës.

In 1934, she joined the Cabaret Cornichon, known throughout Switzerland for its caustic satire, and she remained an important member of the company until 1942. Her stage partners included Max Werner Lenz and Voli Geiler. She married the germanist, Karl Schmid in 1940: there were two children from the marriage, a son and a daughter, born in 1942 and 1943 respectively. In 1943, she wrote the period piece, Wer wirft den ersten Stein? (Who will throw the first stone?) ‚Äì an indictment against anti-Semitism in Switzerland.

ART exploits the phenomenon of half-wave resonance, whereby a suitably excited resonant target (such as a pipeline wall) exhibits longitudinal resonances at certain frequencies characteristic of the target's thickness. Knowing the speed of sound in the target material, the half-wave resonant frequencies can be used to calculate the target's thickness. ART differs from traditional ultrasonic testing: although both are forms of nondestructive testing based on acoustics, ART generally uses lower frequencies and has a wider bandwidth. This has enabled its use in gaseous environments without a liquid couplant. Det Norske Veritas has licensed the technology for use in on-shore water pipes worldwide to Breivoll Inspection Technologies AS. Breivoll has proven the efficiency of the technology in assessing the condition of metallic water pipes, both with and without coating. The company has since 2008 successfully developed a method to enter and inspect water mains, and is a world-leader in their market.http://en.breivoll.no/white_papers/ Whitepaper on condition assessment of water pipes with the use of ART at Breivoll Inspection Technologies, February 2012.

It was formerly used as a base text for modern editions of the Tales, following the examples of Thomas Wright, who used it as the basis for his 1847 edition, and W. W. Skeat, who felt it gave authoritative variant readings. Description f. 1, top half. The Harley MS was likely produced in a London workshop within a decade of Chaucer's death, and is therefore one of the earliest extant manuscripts. It has some decoration in red, blue, pink and green, with gold leaf used on borders and initials, and like the Ellesmere Manuscript represents a commission for a wealthy patron (the style of the decoration is very similar to that seen in Ellesmere, perhaps indicating that the same limner worked on both).Thaisen, J. \\"The Trinity Gower D Scribe's Two Canterbury Tales Manuscripts Revisited\\", in Mooney & Connolly, Design and distribution of late medieval manuscripts in England, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2008, p.42 In the fifteenth century it appears to have been owned by relatives of the Haute family of Ightham Mote. Scribe The scribe of Harley MS 7334, conventionally referred to as \\"Scribe D\\",Shortened from \\"Trinity Gower Scribe D\\". There are five hands in total in the Trinity Gower manuscript, one of whom is Adam Pinkhurst and another of whom is the poet Thomas Hoccleve. is known to have been responsible for several other important manuscripts of the period, including eight copies of the Confessio Amantis of John Gower and one of Piers Plowman. He is also known to be responsible for one other manuscript of the Tales, Corpus Christi College MS. 198, and his work appears in a Gower manuscript alongside that of Adam Pinkhurst, now identified as the scribe of the Ellesmere MS. Scribe D was active in London between the 1390s and 1420s, though his spellings indicate that he was originally from the southwest Midlands. Academic Jeremy Smith has characterised Scribe D as particularly interesting, as his texts display a history in which he moved to London from north Worcestershire, tried hard to eliminate his Worcestershire dialect from his copying, and gradually assimilated peculiar spellings particular to Gower, eventually transplanting them into his work on Chaucer's texts.Transcript of discussion on \\"Manuscript Studies and Literary Geography\\", in Laing & Nicholson (eds) Speaking in our tongues: proceedings of a colloquium on medieval dialectology, Boydell & Brewer, 1994, p.113 Relation to other manuscripts The Harley MS displays a different tale order to that of other significant manuscripts of the Tales, such as the Ellesmere and Hengwrt manuscripts. As well as the Tale of Gamelyn, now thought not to be by Chaucer, it also contains many peculiar variant readings which were, in the nineteenth century, considered to represent either a first or second draft by the author himself.Tatlock, J. S. P. The Harleian Manuscript 7334 and Revision of the Canterbury Tales, 1904, p.2 Modern opinion is that the manuscript's scribe, in common with the practice of the time, would have felt it acceptable to expand or edit the author's text as they felt appropriate.Crane, S. \\"The Paris Manuscript of the Canterbury Tales\\" in Boenig and Davis (eds) Manuscript, narrative, lexicon, Bucknell UP, 2000, p.34 In general, modern editors have agreed with the opinion of Stephen Knight, who noted that while Harley 7334 \\"seems so handsome and authoritative [...] it is in fact heavily and even whimsically edited\\".Knight S. \\"Reading Gamelyn for Text not Context\\" in Field, R. (ed) Tradition and transformation in medieval romance, Boydell & Brewer, 1999, p.16 However, Scribe D was, in his Gower manuscripts, known to have proceeded in a manner similar to \\"a photocopier [and] often copied simply what was before him\\", so it remains possible that the idiosyncratic variant readings might have some other source.Echard, S. \\"Last Words: Latin at the End of the Confession Amantis\\" in Green & Mooney (eds), Interstices: studies in late Middle English and Anglo-Latin texts, University of Toronto Press, 2004, p.118 The manuscript is often conventionally referred to as Ha4, following John Manly and Edith Rickert's notation.

He is known for his work applying rational choice analysis to the behavior of radical religious groups. Research =On violent radical religious groups= Berman argues that economics can provide a significant insight into the vulnerabilities of radical and terrorist organizations, although not only because of the common assumption that cutting their funding is key to their defeat. Instead Berman says that \\"terrorist organizations are terribly vulnerable to defection, the same way that firms are vulnerable to workers stealing trade secrets, or just shirking on the job.\\" He further argues that the economics of religion can provide explanations for the way in which \\"radical religious communities organize mechanisms to control defection in order to successfully conduct mutual aid‚Äîwhich they tend to be quite effective at.\\" Using Laurence Iannaccone's theory of strict religious clubs (see club good theory), Berman argues that successful radical religious groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Mahdi Army and the Taliban, excel at providing social services to their members, while simultaneously filtering out \\"free riders\\"; Berman calls these movements \\"some of the most accomplished rebels of modern times.\\" He further argues that the success of groups such as Hamas and al-Qaeda are more due to their organizational structures than their theology. By way of counter example he examines the case of the militant Jewish organisation Gush Emunim Underground, which ultimately over-reached its ability to sustain a group without defections, by carrying out attacks on civilians while neglecting to induce the necessary loyalty in its members and political base through various welfare measures. (Previous low-level violent vigilante activity, argues Berman, had been treated as a public good by Gush Emunim settlers.) Many commentators assume that people willing to join extremist groups are irrational, motivated only by extreme hate or abstract ideas of rewards in the afterlife. Contrary to these notions, Berman says that radical religious groups are rational in their selection of tactics. Berman does not see a dichotomy between insurgents and terrorists. He argues that they all belong to a single category he calls \\"rebels\\", and who, according to Berman, use a variety of techniques, depending on the circumstances, with suicide bombing being merely one end of the spectrum. Berman does not ascribe suicidal terrorist acts to fanaticism or desperation, but instead he argues that these tactics are used \\"when the terrorist group begins to encounter hard targets, like American military bases, that are impervious to everything else.\\" To support this thesis, Berman gives the Taliban as an example of a group that switched from traditional guerrilla-warfare techniques they used against the Northern Alliance to suicide bombings used against the Americans and other Westerners, as the only means, Berman argues, to make a significant impact against their new and more technologically advanced adversaries. Berman argues that \\"Islamic fundamentalism\\" is a misnomer when applied to modern movements, and he prefers the term \\"Radical Islam\\", reasoning that many post-1920s movements starting with The Muslim Brotherhood, practice \\"unprecedented extremism\\", thus not qualifying as a return to historic fundamentals. He also approves of scholarship that argues that \\"the sanctification of political violence as Jihad by radical Islam is a recent phenomenon, a break with mainstream Muslim theology\\". Berman attributes the birth of the Taliban movement to a phenomenon that long preceded the birth of modern radical Islam. He writes that the Taliban are a direct descendant of the nineteenth-century Deobandi movement in India, which opposed the British colonial rule and, among other things, established a system of religious schools. In his 2009 book, Berman writes that \\"four radical religious organizations, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and the Mahdi Army, continue to surprise established militaries with both their resilience and their lethality.\\" He credits the Hezbollah for being those \\"who invented the modern high-casualty suicide attack in Lebanon in 1982\\". Berman's book seeks to address the question: \\"Why are religious radicals, who often start out appearing benign and charitable and generally avoid conflict, so effective at violence when they choose to engage in it?\\"Eli Berman, Radical, Religious and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism, MIT Press, 2009, , p. 2 Previously, Berman drew other parallels between Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban: > All three formed from affiliates of venerable nonviolent radical Islamic > organizations, Hamas from the [Muslim Brotherhood] and the Taliban from the > Jamiat-e-Ulema-Islam (JUI) in Pakistan, and Hezbollah from the clerical > culture of the Shia holy cities in Iraq and Iran. All three movements arose > in environments with weak local public good provision by government and > responded by providing local public goods. Each developed into extremely > effective insurgent organizations which produced specific local public goods > (security) using violence. All three received generous subsidies from > abroad, whether for geopolitical reasons, out of ideology, or in return for > services. Younger members undergo some costly personal sacrifice in the case > of the Taliban and Hamas (we know less about initiation of Hezbollah > fighters). All three groups changed their ideologies drastically: Hamas in > choosing armed conflict, the Taliban in deciding to protect Bin Laden and > Hezbollah in shifting from a rebellion against Israeli occupation to an > ethnic militia/political party after Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon > in 2000. There are differences: Hamas view most Palestinians as potential > members, as Hezbollah regard Lebanese Shia, while the Taliban treated most > Afghans as a conquered people. Yet the common elements, and especially the > common puzzles, seem to justify analysis in parallel. Berman argued that such parallels were common to other radical religious groups. =On Ultra-orthodox religious groups= Berman has also done field work among ultra-orthodox religious groups in Israel.Terrorism Studies by Nicholas Lemann, The New Yorker, APRIL 26, 2010 Studying full-time Yeshiva students, who Berman finds study until 40 years old on average, and whose families have 7.6 children per woman (in the mid 1990s), he concludes that \\"Subsidies induce dramatic reductions in labor supply and unparalleled increases in fertility.\\" In a 2000 NBER paper, Berman describes Ultra-Orthodox Jews as \\"a fascinating and fast-growing sect which has held virtual veto power over [Israeli] public policy for more than two decades.\\" =On the relationship between unemployment and insurgency= Berman's NBER paper Do Working Men Rebel?, co-authored with Joseph Felter and Jacob N. Shapiro, drew the counterintuitive conclusion that reducing unemployment does not reduce insurgency-related violence. In an interview, Berman explains the findings as \\"insurgencies are very small organizations which need very few fighters to keep them going, and are often not constrained by a lack of recruits‚Äîand even if they were there‚Äôs nothing to stop young men from working by day and planting roadside bombs by night.\\" Personal life Berman was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He describes his parents as \\"middle-of-the-road North American Jews.\\"Washburn, David. \\"A method to madness; UCSD professor sees economic self-interest as a motivation for terrorism\\", U-T San Diego, December 20, 2005. Accessed February 24, 2013. \\"Berman, who was born in Ottawa, Canada, and brought up by parents he describes as 'middle-of-the-road North American Jews,' graduated from Ottawa's Gloucester High School in 1979.... So he made one of his first 'crazy uncle' decisions, and decided to become a citizen of Israel. 'I thought the Jewish experience would be more interesting in Israel,' he said.\\" In 1981, Berman became an Israeli citizen, saying that he had \\"thought the Jewish experience would be more interesting in Israel\\". He then participated in the 1982 Lebanon War. Berman is now a US citizen. He is married and has two children. Education and academic career After leaving the Israeli Defence Force in 1985, Berman studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He graduated with bachelor's degree in computer science and economics in 1987, and in 1989 obtained a master's in economics from the same university. He then obtained a PhD from Harvard University in 1993; his adviser was Zvi Griliches. After graduation from Harvard, Berman became an assistant professor at Boston University.

It combines text, spreadsheet and presentation editors that include features similar to Microsoft desktop editors (Word, Excel and PowerPoint). Since version 5.0 of the editors the interface has been renewed with a tabbed toolbar. Editors allow co-editing, commenting and chatting in real time and provide such functions as Revision History and Mail Merge. The beta version of OnlyOffice Online Editors predecessor, Teamlab Document Editor, was introduced at CeBIT 2012 in Hannover. The product was built using Canvas, a part of HTML5 that allows dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. The basic type of formats used in OnlyOffice document editors is OOXML (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX). Other types of supported formats (ODT, DOC, RTF, EPUB, MHT, HTML, HTM, ODS, XLS, CSV, ODP, PPT, DOTX, XLTX, POTX, OTT, OTS, OTP, and PDF-A) are processed with inner conversion to DOCX, XLSX or PPTX. Functionality of the suite can be extended using plugins (side applications). Users can choose from the existing list of plugins or create their own applications using the provided API. There is a connector to integrate the online editing suite with ownCloud. Desktop editors OnlyOffice Desktop is an offline version of OnlyOffice editing suite. Desktop application supports collaborative editing features when connected to the portal, Nextcloud or ownCloud. Application is offered free of charge for both personal and commercial usage. Desktop editors are cross- platform available for Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, and XP (x32 and x64), Debian, Ubuntu and other Linux distributions based on RPM, Mac OS 10.10 and newer. Besides platform-specific versions there is also a portable option. OnlyOffice Desktop Editors are available for installation as a snap package and AppImage. Editors are compatible with MS Office (OOXML) and OpenDocument (ODF) formats and support DOC, DOCX, ODT, RTF, TXT, PDF, HTML, EPUB, XPS, DjVu, XLS, XLSX, ODS, CSV, PPT, PPTX, ODP, DOTX, XLTX, POTX, OTT, OTS, OTP, and PDF-A. Similarly to the online editing suite, the basic toolset of OnlyOffice Desktop can be upgraded using side plugins. Desktop editors are distributed under AGPL v3 license for personal and commercial usage. OnlyOffice editors are also available as mobile application for iOS and Android. The application is called ONLYOFFICE Documents. In early 2019, OnlyOffice announced the launch of a developer preview of end-to-end encryption of documents (files themselves, online editing and collaboration) that involves blockchain technology and is included in the functionality of the desktop suite.

The group regularly meets to socialise and raise money for Men's health through the Movember Foundation.  Revival  Despite a lack of advertising or investment from its current owner, Reschs has been growing in popularity in recent years. On the 16 September 2019, Reschs was voted Australia's favourite beer in a news.com.au poll. While it is difficult to pinpoint the main reason for this it has been argued this is a push-back against the explosion of craft beers in recent times.

Setting out from northern New Mexico, the expedition traveled west across Arizona and then south along the Colorado to Fort Yuma in California. Mohave native Americans attacked the explorers during their trek across the desert and in a short battle the natives were repulsed.http://www.mohavedesert.net/mohave- indians/us-01.html Expedition Since the Mexican Cession of 1848, topographers, naturalists and other enthusiasts had wanted to explore two of the largest rivers in the newly acquired lands so in 1850, an expedition was organized for that purpose. United States Army commanders were also interested in the area as tension with the Mormons was high and war was expected. Specifically the expedition was sent to map the riverways and determine if they could be navigated by river steamers. Before the establishment of railroads across the Old West, the frontier's riverways were seen, and used, as a valued means of transportation. Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves, of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, was appointed commander and with fifty infantrymen, some porters and the small group of enthusiasts, they headed west from the Zuni Pueblo in September 1851 for the Zuni River. Passing through the Petrified Forest, the party reached the Zuni and followed it southwest to its mouth at the confluence with the Little Colorado just north of present-day Woodruff, Arizona.http://www.mohavedesert.net/mohave-indians/us-01.html The Zuni Pueblo in 1850. At the Little Colorado the Americans proceeded northwest until having to detour around a canyon in which the river flowed through. It was during this detour that the Americans discovered the Wupatki Ruins before making a prolonged turn around the south side of the Bill Williams Mountain. When they reached what was later named Union Pass, near Bullhead City, the party found the Colorado. The expedition up to this point was pleasant, the topographers made their maps, the artists drew several pictures of fauna and landscapes and the military men focused on keeping the enthusiasts from staying at one place for too long. After making it only a short distance south down the Colorado, Captain Sitgreaves' men reported signs of natives in the area and soon after they were met by the Mohave at their camp. Initially peaceful, the Mohaves invited the Americans to a pow wow where the two groups exchanged gifts and engaged in conversation.http://www.mohavedesert.net/mohave-indians/us-01.html Sitgreaves reported that the natives brought many different types of fruits and vegetables which suggested that they were interested in developing trade relations. But the friendliness of the Mohave soon wore off when on one October night, the Americans were growing restless after a long visit from the natives at their camp that they asked them to leave. This upset some of the Mohave women who protested and the next morning several arrows were fired into the camp. One wounded the expedition's doctor in the leg but with his medical experience he was capable of preventing serious harm. Sitgreaves decided it was best to break camp and the Mohave let him without further confrontation. On or about October 22, the Americans reached a friendly Mohave village and learned from a Spanish speaking native that Fort Yuma and the mouth of the Gila River, which connects with the Colorado, was only eight days distant. Again the Americans gave the Mohave elders gifts but they remained on alert, fearing an incident similar to the last.http://www.mohavedesert.net/mohave- indians/us-01.html A lithograph of the Little Colorado made during the expedition. The next day as the Americans moved on, one soldier was lagging behind and attacked by about fifty-five warriors armed with bows and covered in stripes. He was killed and the warriors moved forward to attack Sitgreaves' column. When the captain realized he was under attack, skirmishers were deployed and in a short engagement, four Mohaves were killed and some others wounded. The only American casualty was the first soldier who was relieved of his musketoon when the Mohave retreated. From there the expedition continued on for another week or so until reaching the war zone of Fort Yuma on November 30, 1851, after nearly starving to death and after losing most of their equipment.

The rivers were found to be fully navigable and from then on a growing number of river steamers and schooners began sailing the Colorado.

Javier √Ålvarez (Cuatro Caminos; Madrid, 7 October 1969) is a Spanish songwriter. His musical influences come more from pop music than from traditional songwriters. Among his influences are ABBA, Michael Jackson, James Taylor, The Eagles, Tracy Chapman, Nanci Griffith, Suzanne Vega, and Emmylou Harris. In 1994, he records his first LP with the collaboration of artists such as Ana Bel√©n, V√≠ctor Manuel, Luis Pastor, Pedro Guerra and Rogelio Botanz. Songs such as \\"La edad del porvenir\\" or \\"Uno, dos, tres, cuatro\\" will bring him fame in Spain. He also recorded a cover of \\"Las casas de cart√≥n\\" of the Venezuelan songwriter Al√≠ Primera. In 1996 Javier √Ålvarez records his second LP Dos and three years later, in 1999, his LP Tres, where he experiments with electronic and more \\"radical\\" lyrics. His theme \\"Padre\\" was censored in the main radio stations. His next album is Grandes √©xitos (2001), which is an album of covers of his youth beloved artists. En √©l Javier √Ålvarez rescata las canciones de su infancia y les da su toque personal. Among the songs of this album, \\"Every breath you take\\" and \\"With or without you\\" are notory. Two years later, he published the album Tiempodespacio, the fifth of his career. In 2005 he published a double LP called Plan Be.

Bumbunga lies in the state electoral district of Narungga and in the federal electoral division of Grey.

Located on what was traditionally the land of the Kaurna (indigenous) people, the first pioneers arrived sometime between 1847 and 1849 due to the rapid expansion of farming to the north of the area. Bailliere's South Australian gazetteer and road guide, published in 1866, contains a brief description of \\"Hummock's Run\\" located north of Port Wakefield. This farmland, according to the publication, contained the farming stations of Barunga, Bumbunga and Wokurna and consisted of \\"salt lakes and lagoons, dense scrub, with mallee, pine and bushes, grassy plains and saltbush, well grassed spurs and hills, with oaks and wattle on the Broughton River.\\"Whitworth (1866) p. 283 A secessionist micronation, the Province of Bumbunga, was located in Bumbunga for approximately a decade in the 1970s and 1980s.

This is driven by the foreseen lack of young scientists in all European countries. Science on Stage Europe believes that a good way to encourage schoolchildren to consider a career in science or engineering is to motivate and educate their teachers. Therefore, Science on Stage Europe provides a forum for science teachers to exchange teaching ideas and gives them access to science teaching resources.  History  = Physics on Stage = Organised by EIROforum, a collaboration of European research organisations, the initiative Science on Stage began in 1999 as Physics on Stage (POS),Physics on Stage, official website of the Physics on Stage festival 2000. with financial support from the European Commission [POS was half funded by EIROforum]. EIROforum launched the initiative to address the decreasing numbers of young physicists. The first Physics on Stage festival was at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2000. Over the course of an inspiring week, more than 500 teachers from 22 countries shared activities and projects in a fair, in workshops, in performances and in presentations showed that physics can be fun. On the back of this success, Physics on Stage 2 was arranged in 2002 at ESA in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Physics on Stage 3 followed a year later at the same location. = Science on Stage = The members of EIROforum soon realised that the lack of young scientists was not limited to the field of physics, so the initiative was broadened to cover all sciences and renamed Science on Stage. The first Science on Stage festival Science on Stage festival 2005, official website. took place in 2005, again at CERN in Geneva, and the second in 2007 at ESRF/ILL in Grenoble, France. The format of the Physics on Stage festivals remained and still remains unchanged. In May 2008, the financial support of the European Commission ran out. In March 2009, under the guidance of Stage on Stage Germany Science on Stage Germany, official website. the 27 European countries involved unanimously affirmed their wish to continue the cooperation. All participants stressed the importance of regular European festivals as the flagship of the European Science on Stage activities. Alternative funding would be sought for the festivals. In October 2008, the first of these alternatively funded Science on Stage festivals took place at Urania in Berlin, organised by Science on Stage Germany and sponsored by THINK ING.,THINK ING., official website. an initiative of the Federation of German Employers‚Äò Associations in the Metal and Electrical Engineering Industries. The second alternatively funded European Science on Stage festival took place from 16‚Äì19 April 2011 at the √òrestad Gymnasium √òrestad Gymnasium, upper secondary school in Copenhagen, Denmark. in Copenhagen under the motto ‚ÄúScience Teaching: Winning Hearts and Minds‚Äù. It was funded by the Danish Ministry of Education and organised by Danish Science Communication and the Science on Stage Europe office. The next Science on Stage festival will take place from 25‚Äì28 April 2013 in Slubice and Frankfurt/Oder at the German-Polish border. For the first time, the festival will be organised by two countries, represented by the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and Science on Stage Germany, under the motto ‚ÄúCrossing Borders in Science Teaching‚Äù. 350 science teachers from across Europe will present their most innovative teaching ideas, workshops and performances. Participants are chosen at competitive national events or processes in each country involved.  Organisation  Initially launched as an initiative in 2008, Science on Stage Europe became an officially registered non-profit association in January 2012, with headquarters in Berlin and recognised by German law. Science on Stage Europe is organised in a bottom-up structure. The basis is the Science on Stage community in the participating countries. Each country has a national steering committee (NSC). The NSCs get together in the Science on Stage assembly and elect the executive board. The board is supported by invited experts and by the Science on Stage Europe office in Berlin. The Science on Stage international festivals take place every two years, as the culmination of all the national Science on Stage activities.

As a human rights activist, he has pushed for reform within fundamentalist regimes, such as Iran, and the reform of social or legal practices that are in violation of human rights.  Biography  Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh was born in Tehran, Iran in 1952. On completion of his studies in Arabian Literature (Tehran 1974) and Law (Tehran 1975), he moved to France in 1976. In Paris he studied Theology and History of Law at the Sorbonne University, as well as Comparative Studies of Islam and Christianity at the University of Lyon for which he received two doctorate degrees. One of his professors was the philosopher and theologian Henri Corbin. After having completed his academic studies he continued his research in the areas of religion, philosophy and various fields of science. Azmayesh was admitted into the lineage of initiates of the Nematollahi-Gonabadi order in 1969, which is the most popular and oldest Sufi order in Iran. Azmayesh is the official representative of the Shah Ni'matullah Wali Gonabadi Order outside of Iran. Azmayesh founded a spiritual school.  Human rights activities  = Human rights efforts in Iran = Speech at European Parliament in 2011 at the Conference on Human Rights in Iran Since the onset of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Azmayesh has worked to oppose those who propagate Islamist extremism. His activities have included talks in the United Nations (UN). He has argued that human rights principles are compatible with Quranic principles. For many years, Azmayesh has spoken in opposition of the practice of stoning in Iran. In response to the uprising in 2009 following the presidential elections, he supported the freedom of expression and free speech, and campaigned for the freedom of prominent political prisoners such as Nasrin Sotoudeh, Narges Mohammadi, and religious and ethnic minorities such as Kurds, Baha‚Äôi and Sufis. He has been influential in the release of numerous Sufis who were imprisoned by the extremist elements in the Iranian Regime as part of its program to suppress minorities. = Human rights efforts within Europe = He has spoken at a series of conferences in England, Germany, UK Parliament and the European Parliament, and published research-based proposals and reports to tackling these growing issues of violence and extremism. Azmayesh co-founded the International Organisation to Preserve Human Rights (IOPHR) in February 2014, in order to continue his efforts to protect human rights for all, counter the rise of Islamist extremism and violence, and continue his advocacy for gender-equality and eliminating gender-based violence. IOPHR is an active not-for-profit organisation and think tank based in the United Kingdom. It is a research-based organisation, with the aim to preserve human rights for all, and eliminate threats to the safety and security of society. IOPHR conducts conferences in the UK Parliament, European Parliament, and across Europe, working closely with other activists, researchers, academics, public bodies such as the London Metropolitan Police, and other public service officials.

It is centered on a Greek Revival house built in the 1830s using the unusual stacked-plank structural system. The accompanying barn and privy are also included in the listing. Gates, the original owner, was a pioneer in the settlement of Barre who established the first tannery in the town and later became one of its most prominent early citizens. The property has remained virtually unchanged since his ownership. After new owners restored it, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. It is the second property listed in Barre after the Skinner-Tinkham House in the hamlet of Barre Center, and the second stacked-plank house listed in Orleans County after the Servoss House. Buildings and grounds The farm is located on the north side of the road, just east of where Mix Road intersects from the south. The house and other structures are located near the front of the property; seven acres () in the rear are currently under cultivation. Trees planted in the last two decades, including 15 disease-resistant American elms, mark the property lines, along with some mature black walnuts and sugar maples. Terrain is mostly level. The surrounding area is rural, with farmland predominating. Some woodlots and cellular phone towers are visible in the distance. Nearby buildings along the road are other farmsteads, most of their buildings also dating to the 19th century. The nearest large settlements are the villages of Albion to the east-northeast and Medina to the west-northwest, both about distant. =House= The house itself has a main section with wings to the north and east. A fieldstone foundation has cobblestone facing, protruding mortar V-joints and sandstone quoinss. Atop it rest stacks of one-inch‚Äìthick (2.5-cm) vertical wooden planks nailed together creating load-bearing walls. Plaster was applied to the interior surface; the exterior is faced in clapboard. The two-story, three-bay main block is topped with a gabled roof, shingled in cedar, from which a brick chimney protrudes at the south (front) end. On the east is a side-gabled one-story wing with full-width porch. The north wing projects from the rear of the east wing and the house's east rear. It, too, is side-gabled with a full-width porch facing east. It has the house's other chimney as well. The south facade of the main block has two original six-over-six double-hung sash windows in the two western bays. The main entrance is located in the east bay. Greek Revival elements present include the wide corner pilasters and plain frieze topped by cornice at the roofline, creating a pediment with heavy entablature at the gable field. The porches are supported by square wooden columns, echoed by pilasters along the facades. All entrances can be reached by two wooden steps. A simple wooden surround frames the main entrance, topped by a transom. It opens into a side hall that leads to parlors on the west and (in the wing) on the east. Behind the parlor is the library. Both parlors have Greek Revival interior decorations‚Äîatticurge architraves on the east and corner blocks on the west, where the baseboard forms a plinth block at the floor. A set of stairs near the back leads to the bedrooms upstairs. In the north wing are the kitchen and dining room. Below it is crawl space with a dirt floor. The rest of the house has a full basement. Some interior walls are stacked-plank as well. The non‚Äìload-bearing walls are of vertical plank surfaced with split lath and plaster. =Outbuildings= alt=Two large red wooden buildings, the one on the left bigger than the other, and a small yellow one in front of it. seen through some trees in the foreground Just to the northeast are the outbuildings. The largest is a gabled barn of hand-hewn post-and-beam on a fieldstone foundation with lime mortar. It is sided in board with ogee-shaped battens. Sliding doors at either end lead to an interior with an earthen ramp to the second level and a loft at the west end on the third level. The smaller carriage barn on the east is similar to the barn. It is a sawn post-and-beam building on a fieldstone foundation with tongue-and-groove vertical siding and sliding doors at each gabled end. Inside a stairway leads to the second floor. The smaller privy between the house and barns is more like the former, clapboard-sided with a beaded plank door on an original hand-wrought Suffolk latch. Its walls are sided with plaster on accordion lath. History Gates, the descendant of English colonists who had moved from Massachusetts to Ontario County, in turn moved to Barre around 1830. His initial purchase of was enlarged with the following year, creating the present lot. The house was built around that time. Its stacked-plank structural system may have been employed due to the surplus of wood from land being cleared at the time and the dearth of skilled carpenters in the area. In addition to farming the small parcel, he went into the tanning business. From a single vat hollowed out of a log, by 1852 he had several employees and had built a facility for the work. He sold the house for $3,200 ($ in contemporary dollars) to William Harrison Gates in 1853. After another sale in 1865, the tannery burned down sometime before 1874; an account from 1879 says that only a fragment of a foundation wall remained at that time. Alterations to the house have been generally minimal and incremental. The kitchen floor was raised in the 1840s to bring it level with the dining room. A century later, the original chimney was removed. After the kitchen was remodeled in 1986, the current owners made some major renovations in the early 2000s. Two bathrooms were added, and on the exterior the north wing's porch was added. The original chimney and louvered shutters were replicated. All were done with care to not disrupt the house's overall appearance.

Background and education A member of Clan Murray, he was the second son of Lord George Murray, fifth son of John Murray, 1st Duke of Atholl. His mother was Amelia, daughter and heiress of James Murray, a surgeon, of Strowan. John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl and George Murray were his brothers; his uncle Lord John Murray, later his commanding officer, was his godfather. Murray's father had been attainted and exiled for taking part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745, and in 1749 James joined him in the Netherlands. He was educated at Utrecht and Besan√ßon.Brooke, J.; Namier, Lewis. The House of Commons 1754‚Äì1790: Volume III'. Military and political career Murray's father obtained a commission for him as a lieutenant of the Saxon Army's Grenadier Guards, with a two-year leave to complete his studies. Taking up his commission in 1751, he served in the Seven Years' War, battling the Prussians until the capitulation that followed the Siege of Pirna. He obtained his release through the efforts of Andrew Michell, the British envoy to Frederick the Great. Returning to Scotland, he was given a captain's commission in his uncle's regiment, the Black Watch, and was placed in command of one of the companies being raised for the French and Indian War. He then sailed to North America and joined the fighting in New York State. His own company was left to garrison Fort Edward, but he was wounded at Fort Ticonderoga in 1758 while leading Captain Reid's company. The wound was not serious, and he was present for Amherst's campaign on Lake Champlain the following year. Late that year he was given command, at his uncle's recommendation, of the grenadier company of the 2nd Battalion of the regiment, raised in the previous year. He led them to the surrender of Montreal in 1760. In 1761, the Black Watch was posted to the West Indies, and Murray fought with them in the capture of Martinique. He was wounded during the engagement, a musket ball passing through the left lobe of his left lung and crossing under his chest to lodge under the scapula. He was at first thought mortally wounded, but was up and about in a few weeks, and had regained health and appetite by the time he was invalided home to England. However, the wound left him permanently disabled, and unable to lie down for the rest of his life, sleeping in an upright posture. He spent over six years on sick leave recovering. Murray returned to the Black Watch in 1768, and was appointed lieutenant and captain in the Scots Guards in 1769. He was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel the following year. Murray was elected Member of Parliament for Perthshire in 1774, a seat he held for the next 21 years. He supported Lord North's administration. He was also Governor of Upnor Castle from 1775 to 1778. In 1776, he bought his mother's estate of Strowan from his nephew, the Duke of Atholl. After the outbreak of the American War of Independence, he offered to raise a new Highland regiment, but was refused. He joined the Brigade of Guards in North America in March 1777, where he was wounded during the Philadelphia campaign. Promoted to the rank of colonel on 16 December 1777, he was appointed the colonel of the Atholl Highlanders, newly raised by the Duke of Atholl, on 16 May 1778. He commanded them in Ireland until the regiment was disbanded in 1783. In 1780, Murray was appointed Governor of Fort William. This was the year of the Gordon riots. Murray denounced his kinsman Lord George Gordon, and, when the rioters Gordon had stirred up prepared to storm the House of Commons, he threatened to put a sword through Gordon, who was sitting next to him, if they broke in. During his later years in Parliament he supported William Pitt the Younger. He became a major general in 1782, and on the disbanding of the Atholl Highlanders, was appointed lieutenant-colonel commandant of the 78th Highlanders. He was appointed their colonel when they were renumbered the 72nd in 1786, and was made a lieutenant general in 1793. Personal life Murray died unmarried on his 60th birthday in 1794.

The larvae feed on Homalanthus species, Omalanthus populifolius, Sapium ellipticum, Sapium indicum and Sapium sebiferum. They mine the leaves of their host plant. Mines are always started at the upper epidermal layer. The mine at first is narrowly linear, upper epidermal, and transparent-whitish in colour, then it widens to an irregularly blotch-formed mine, which is upper parenchymal and greenish-brown in colour. The third instar larva, transforms to the tissue-feeding type, continues feeding within the mine cavity. The mine in this stage is completely changed in colour to pale brown, and slightly contorted on the upper epidermis with silken threads. After the moult, the fourth instar larva emerges from the mine through a round hole, and migrates to the margin of the same leaf or another one. It cuts a strip of the leaf along the margin and rolls up the strip into a cone on the lower side of the leaf. Then the larva continues to feed inside the cone. The larva seems to make one or more leaf-rolls during the remaining four instars.

He admitted the autonomy right of the patients' association. The Sotojima sanatorium was destroyed in Muroto Typhoon in 1934 and it was reconstructed as Oku-Komyo-En Sanatorium, Okayama Prefecture. Personal history He was born in Okayama Prefecture in 1859. After becoming the chief of several police stations in Osaka, he became the marshal of the most important Sonezaki Polic Station of Osaka. In 1909, he was appointed the director of the Sotojima Hoy≈çen Sanatorium, situated in Osaka Prefecture. He retired in April 1926 and lived in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture. After 8 months, Masataka Murata became the second director of the sanatorium. He died around July 1940 in Sakai.

He used a free hand considerably admitted the director of the sanatorium. With the exception of Kyushu Sanatorium, Kumamoto, directors of leprosy sanatoriums came from police, since wandering leprosy patients included criminals. However, physicians took the parts of directors later in other sanatoriums. Imada exceptionally stayed long as the director of the sanatorium for 17 years. He appeared a well-built important person. The first chief doctor of the hospital was Takekichi Sugai, who studied leprosy intensively, wrote many papers and guided other doctors. There were about 300 leprosy patients which was the capacity of the sanatorium in one and a half year. The problems of food, drinking water and clothing, first appeared very difficult, became later stabilized. A patient recreation organization was formed at his proposal. Those who could work were given money, and farms and gardens were made. A church was established. He was an able administrator and was loved by patients. In 1919, when the patient organization wanted to withdraw their autonomy right, Imada strongly inspired the spirit of autonomy. References *The records of Sotojima Hoyoen, Sakurai H.

Jeremy, Drew, Josh and Paulo maneuver their lives as each experiences ambition, betrayal, secrecy, money, fame, hot beautiful women and sex. Premise Julius Roden In early 2010, writer/producer/director Julius Roden set a meeting with independent film artists Jude Faith and Chris Lucas. The intention was to create a boy band, but the focus soon shifted to the creation of a new television series. Roden thought about making a television movie about five bachelors with different careers, inspired by the early 1990s hit Filipino sitcom Palibhasa Lalake. However, the producer thought it would be better to create an extended television series rather than a single movie. Roden proposed the title \\"Adam's Apple\\", but Faith and Lucas did not think the audience would take that title seriously. Thus, \\"Adam's Crib\\" was suggested. Then, followed \\"Hot Shots\\", then \\"Men's Locker\\", \\"Men's Secret\\", \\"Men's Room\\", \\"Men's CR\\" and they ended up with \\"Adam's Crib\\". Nevertheless, Julius Roden was still not happy with it. He thought it sounded like the Filipino rock band \\"Barbie's Cradle\\". So he finally changed it to \\"All About Adam\\". The auditions began and several actors tried to get lead parts. The starring role was first offered to Victor Aliwalas but the actor's manager didn't allow him due to conflict in schedules. Then, it was offered to Joem Bascon. However, he also was unavailable. Finally, Roden found Migui Moreno and filming for the pilot began. Synopsis In the pilot episode, Josh and Jeremy are introduced as underground heavy metal musicians hoping to get a record deal from a big time producer while Paulo and Drew get involved with a mysterious vixen and her connection to the suicide case of Christian Jacob that Sgt. Yoga Sabarita and Inspector Laura Marasigan are investigating. The two flamboyant Adams deny their sexual engagement with the mysterious vixen, but the police officers remained skeptical. Cast ; Migui Moreno Moreno is an actor in television, films, theater and commercials. He is a former member of the 1990s Filipino boy band Idolzone, a former member of the That's Entertainment cast, and was the star of Carlo J. Caparas' Kroko: Takas Sa Zoo, which was shown at the same network (IBC-13). He is also known for his performances in Gantimpala Theater. In All About Adam, Moreno is the funny, wild and sexy Paulo Morales. He is the \\"Pinoy cowboy\\" and he loves hot beautiful women. ;Philipp Dunkel Philipp Dunkel Dunkel was rejected twice by Roden in the auditions but filming was about to start and still, no actor was available. On his third audition and screen test, the lead vocalist of the heavy metal underground band United By Fate made it. In All About Adam, the half-Filipino half-German actor/musician is Jeremy Cabrera. ;Jeffrey Canlas Canlas is the vocalist of the alternative rock band Ethigma. Like Dunkel, Jeffrey's band used to be heavy metal but change of directions led their music to a different genre. He had met previously met Adam producer Roden in 2009 at a recording studio. When it came time to cast Adam, Roden sought out Canlas to be part of the cast. In All About Adam, Canlas plays Josh Jimenez, the best friend of Jeremy Cabrera and vocalist of their rock band. ;Michael Ignacio Ignacio was chosen by Roden during the cyber audition of All About Adam. He landed the part of Drew Smith - a gym instructor and the less sex party animal version of Paulo Morales. Despite of being a registered nurse, Michael opted for the world of entertainment and he had performed in several theatrical productions such as director Tony Espejo's Beauty And The Beast, in which he played the character Gaston. ;Karlo Manalo Karlo Manalo Originally chosen by Roden to play Drew Smith in the television movie of All About Adam. But due to conflicts in filming schedules, he played the brief and groundbreaking role of an HIV victim named Christian Jacob. Before joining All About Adam, Karlo Manalo became very controversial when Vice Ganda hit on him and went tumbling backward on national television in 2009 on a Filipino talent show titled Showtime. His Adonis charming looks caught the attention of the host/judge. Manalo was then tagged as The Man who made Vice Ganda go GaGa. ;Martin Mendoza Mendoza joins the cast of All About Adam the series in its first full season. He plays Archie Sandoval, an aspiring writer/journalist. However, because of his boyish looks and a body like a ramp model, most people in newspaper and magazine companies never take him seriously.

Background As late as 23 January 1918, in a letter to Swedish composer Wilhelm Stenhammar, Nielsen explained that although he had included Pan and Syrinx in his concert on 11 February, he had not yet written a single note. It appears, however, that he had been thinking about the piece for some time, ever since he and his wife Anne Marie had discussed Ovid's Metamorphoses the previous year, inspiring him to compose the music. He did however manage to complete the score by 6 February.Peter Hauge, \\"Pan and Syrinx\\", Orchestral Works 2, Carl Nielsen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Retrieved 9 November 2010. In addition to Pan and Syrinx, the concert which was devoted to works by Nielsen over almost 20 years, included the prelude to Act Two of Saul and David, Sleep and the Fourth Symphony, all conducted by Nielsen himself, as well as Chaconne for Piano played by Christian Christiansen. Reception Pan and Syrinx was particularly well received. Writing in Politken, Charles Kjerulf first alluded to its \\"Gallic, quite Debussyesque\\" quality before praising its feeling of renewal, development and mastery. He ended even more gushingly: \\"For each note that was added it became more and more sublime. And when in the end the very highest and very lowest notes of the orchestra were sounded right up against each other in the violin harmonics and double- basses... then the rejoicing broke out quite spontaneously.\\" The other reviews were also positive. The work was frequently played in Scandinavia during Nielsen's lifetime. When the composer planned a concert programme, he often chose to perform Saga Dream and Pan and Syrinx on the same occasion. Music The nine-minute symphonic poem is based on the ancient legend which tells how the amorous god Pan invented the pan flute when following the nymph Syrinx. Syrinx ran to the river's edge and asked for assistance from the river nymphs. In answer, she was transformed into hollow water reeds that made a haunting sound when the god's frustrated breath blew across them. Pan cut the reeds to fashion the first set of pan pipes, which were thenceforth known as syrinx.Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.689ff As the piece features Syrinx it obviously has major parts for woodwind solos. The music was written at the height of Nielsen's powers as a composer, shortly after he finished the Fourth Symphony. It is a vigorous, pretty, and poetic work.Joseph Stevenson, \\"Review: Pan og Syrinx (Pan and Syrinx), for orchestra, FS 87 (Op. 49)\\", Answers.com. Retrieved 9 November 2010.

While one source cites \\"Eric B.\\" as the first person who coined the term,Rice University: Neologisms Database. Accessed April 2020. another holds that the term had already been used by Shirley Silver,Silver, Shirley 1976, Comparative Hokan and the Northern Hokan Language, edited by Margaret Langdon and Shirley Silver, Janua Linguarum , Series Practica, 181. The Hague & Paris: Mouton, 203~236. though the meaning is different from Eric's. Silver used the term for fused words, or for phrasal words like \\"La Brea Tar Pits\\" as a proper noun. The term is also used by some Korean linguists, e.g., Lee 1998 Lee Ji Yang 1998, Fusion in Korean, Published by Taehaksa, Seoul(Ïù¥ÏßÄÏñë 1998, Íµ≠Ïñ¥Ïùò ÏúµÌï©ÌòÑÏÉÅ, ÌÉúÌïôÏÇ¨). and Kim 2010 Kim Hyun Ju 2010, On the morphemizations of Korean Honorific endings, Ph.D dissertation at Korea University, Seoul(ÍπÄÌòÑÏ£º 2010, Íµ≠Ïñ¥ ÎåÄÏö∞Î≤ï Ïñ¥ÎØ∏Ïùò ÌòïÌÉúÌôî Ïó∞Íµ¨). who has coined the term in order to capture the common phenomena between grammaticalizations and lexicalisations, i.e., to capture the phenomena that result in new morphemes via reanalysis, fusion, coalescence, univerbation etc.(cf. Brinton and Traugott 2005 Brinton, Laurel J. and Elizabeth Closs Traugott 2005, 'Lexicalization and Language Change', Cambridge University Press.). In addition to traditional examples of grammaticalization (for example, 'wanna' from 'want to' or 'gonna' from 'going to', etc.), traditional examples of lexicalization (for example, 'forever' from 'for ever', 'nonetheless' from 'non the less', etc.) make new morphemes. A very clear reason that those lexemes are not analyzable into smaller pieces is that the sum of those pieces from any of the lexemes wouldn't equal to the original meaning. These processes may be called 'morphemizations'. Recently, the term 'morphemization' is also used to indicate morphologization in Chinese linguistics, e.g., Chen(2010).Chen, Lian-jun 2010, On the Morphemization of \\"ZHI\\"(Âøó), „ÄäJournal of China West Normal University(Philosophy & Social Sciences)„Äã2010-02-008. Since morphologization is a subcategory of grammaticalization, and well-known, in this case the term 'morphologization' might be better.

The album, their second album release in less than a year, was the last to feature sixth-generation member Eri Kamei and eighth- generation members Junjun and Linlin prior to their December 15 graduation. Writing and development The album's concept, as stated by writer and producer Tsunku, is \\"a mixture of fantasy and reality\\". The album's songs represent various genres, from rock and pop to Motown. The opening song, \\"Onna to Otoko no Lullaby Game\\", is described as the \\"prologue\\" to the album. The album features two solos: \\"Ai no Hon≈ç\\", performed by Reina Tanaka, and \\"Denwa de ne\\", performed by Ai Takahashi. While these are the only solos, other members are allocated main vocals on some songs: Sayumi Michishige on \\"Fantasy ga Hajimaru\\", Risa Niigaki on \\"Onna Gokoro to Nan to Yara\\", and Eri Kamei on \\"Itoshiku Kurushii Kono Yoru ni\\". Similarly to the group's previous album, 10 My Me, the eighth generation, Aika Mitsui, Junjun and Linlin are heavily featured on the same track: track 7, \\"Sungoi My Birthday\\".

Although it was a graduation single it charted relatively poorly, peaking at #6 on the Oricon singles chart, despite a reported total of 42,405 copies in its first week. The second and final single to be featured on the album, \\"Seishun Collection\\", was released on June 6, 2010.

Built in 1872, it is a prominent local example of Italianate architecture executed in brick. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It now houses offices of the Machias Savings Bank. Description and history The Machias Post Office and Customhouse is located at the western corner of Center Street and Main Street (United States Route 1) in the heart of Machias' downtown area. It is a two-story red brick building, topped by a hip roof and set on a granite foundation. Its main facade faces Main Street, and is a symmetrical three bays wide, with the center bay projecting slightly and capped by a fully pedimented gable. One principal entrance is on the first floor of that section, set in a round-arch opening with keystone and pilastered columns. Windows are set in round-arch openings on the first floor and segmented-arch openings on the second, with stone sills and keystones. The Center Street facade is five bays wide, with a similar arrangement and styling of doors and windows. Early federal government facilities in Machias were located in leased spaces secured by the postmasters and customs collectors, a condition eventually found inadequate due to frequently changing addresses, and spaces that were not properly configured for the purpose. In 1867 the United States Congress authorized construction of this building, for which the land was acquired in 1870, and the construction completed in 1872. The building was designed by Alfred B. Mullett, the supervising architect of the United States Treasury Department, and the construction was supervised by Horatio L. Hill, a local builder and architect. In order to save costs, materials were sourced locally.

Origins The family were descended from Sir William Graham lord of Kincadaine and his wife Lady Mary Stewart m. 1406, daughter of King Robert III of Scotland. Their eldest son Sir Robert was titled of Fintry in Stirlingshire, they later swopped these lands for those held by their cousins in Angus. Family The Grahams of Fintry played a significant part in the politics of Scotland as well as being both strong Royalists and Jacobites. William 4th of Fintry married Catherine Beaton sister of Cardinal Beaton and was a strong supporter of the pro-French party and a strong Catholic. David 6th of Fintry and son of Sir David Graham and Margaret Ogilvy of Airlie was beheaded in 1592 for his support of the popish plot. Their son David 7th of fintry was a strong supporter of Charles I. He was married to Margaret, daughter of Sir James Scrymgeour Viscount Dudhope and Scottish Royalist and the family spent a large part of their wealth in support of the Stewarts.

He took great care of his caged birds, often releasing those which appeared distressed, and refused to participate in the extensive trade in dead birds for women's fashions.Mearns & Mearns (1998), p.12. Over forty years of collecting expeditions he travelled through Central and South America, Taiwan, the Philippines, New Guinea and Melville Island, off northern Australia.Mearns & Mearns (1998), p.345. =Mikado pheasant= Goodfellow's best-known ornithological achievement was the scientific discovery of the Mikado pheasant in the central mountain ranges of Taiwan and its introduction to aviculture. In about 1906 he secured the type specimen, comprising two long black tail feathers obtained from one of his porters who was wearing them in a head-dress. On a later visit to Taiwan he obtained eleven live birds, eight males and three females, which were taken to Britain and bred successfully in captivity.Beebe (1990). Recognition Birds and other animals named for Goodfellow include the Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi), the Taiwan shortwing (Brachypteryx goodfellowi), slaty-backed jungle-flycatcher (Rhinomyias goodfellowi), black-masked white-eye (Lophozosterops goodfellowi), Goodfellow's tuco-tuco (Ctenomys goodfellowi), and Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi).

Discovered by BBC Introducing the band went on to sign with independent record label Distiller Records through which they released their debut album What Came From Fire on 28 June 2010 and second album Angels and Enemies on 5 March 2012. In early 2012 the band announced a full UK and European tour to coincide with the release of their second album. In October 2013, the band announced that they were to go on an indefinite hiatus. The band cited that they were going on to \\"focus on other commitments/projects\\" via their official Facebook page. History =Early years= After Andrew Metcalfe and Simon Finley's band split up in the summer of 2007, the pair set up a small studio in a disused social club in Liverpool and spent the next few months writing and recording some new material. At the end of 2007 they were introduced to Nathan Crowley, whose previous band had recently ended too. By the start of 2008, the three had begun writing and recording songs together, some of which would eventually end up on Sound of Gun's debut album 'What Came From Fire'. In need of other musicians to complete the line-up, Crowley played the new recordings for Lee Glynn, a guitarist with whom he had played previously. Glynn had made plans to return home to his family in Perth, Western Australia, but on hearing the recordings, decided to stay and join Sound of Guns on guitar. After a few months of writing and rehearsing as a four piece, the band booked their first shows. After several unsuccessful auditions for a bass player, they decided to go ahead with the shows, and have the bass parts recorded to a backing track until they found the right bass player. It was at their first hometown show at the Barfly in Liverpool that the Sound of Guns line-up was completed. John Coley, a friend of Nathan Crowley, was in the crowd that night, and was so impressed with the raw energy and powerful performance from Sound of Guns that he joined the band there and then. Over the next few months, the band gigged endlessly around the country and carried on recording new material as a five piece. By the end of 2008 they self-released their debut single \\"Alcatraz\\", which was recorded and produced by the band, and gained a fair amount of major radio airplay, including on XFM and Radio 1. =Distiller Records= After more writing and touring, the band soon found themselves at the centre of some serious interest from major and independent record companies. During this time, Distiller Records offered to release their next single. The band took up this offer, and \\"Architects\\" was released in June 2009 as a limited edition 7\\" vinyl, again gaining radio airplay. The band then headed out on tour in support of this release, and played numerous shows which included four gigs at Glastonbury Festival, opening the main stage at Latitude Festival and BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend. The band were invited by BBC Radio 1 to perform four songs at the Maida Vale Studios. After signing a record contract with Distiller Records the band set about writing towards their debut release. On 26 October 2009 Sound of Guns released their first EP, Elementary of Youth, through Distiller Records. It was available on a 7\\" gatefold single, which included a CD, the band's own fanzine Retail Rodeo and digital download. It consisted of four tracks, \\"Elementary of Youth\\", \\"Lightspeed\\" (both mixed by Dave Eringa (Manic Street Preachers/Idlewild)), \\"Dead Sea Scrolls\\" and \\"Gallantry\\". The lead track \\"Elementary of Youth\\" was quickly picked up by BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe and given the title of 'Hottest Record in the World' as well as XFM's 'Single of the Week' by Steve Harris. Controversy During a UK tour in March 2009 Sound of Guns found themselves surrounded by armed police in Wakefield after a mix up involving the band's name led to the group being mistaken for gangsters, as reported by NME. What Came From Fire After touring in support of the Elementary of Youth EP, the band headed into the studio to record their debut album. However, instead of using a commercial studio, the band opted to build their own studio using the advance from their record contract, and spent the end of 2009 recording their debut album, producing it themselves. The album was mixed by Chris Potter (The Verve, U2) in January 2010 and was released in June 2010, titled What Came From Fire. It was preceded by two more single releases, \\"Alcatraz\\" in April 2010 and \\"Architects\\" in June 2010. Both were new versions of the songs and were not limited editions this time round. \\"Architects\\" reached Number 1 on the HMV 7\\" Singles Chart, and was playlisted by BBC Radio 1 daytime and XFM daytime. BBC Radio 1 also gave the track 'Single of the Week' (Greg James) and XFM 'Single of the Week' (Steve Harris). The album was short listed for the 'XFM new music award' in 2011 and highlighted as one of the albums of the year. =Track list= In late 2010 the band announced they would release the \\"Breakwater\\" single and accompanying EP via the band's website. In support of this they also announced a UK tour with The View. The EP Was released in 2011. Angels and Enemies Sound of Guns performing in Dundee, March 2012 In early 2011 the band started writing new material for their follow-up to What Came From Fire, and headed into the studio with record producer Dave Eringa (Manic Street Preachers, Ocean Colour Scene, Idlewild) to record material for the album. The band recorded the album at The Distillery in Bath. The first single to be released from the album was \\"Silicon\\", released as part of an EP which included tracks that never made it onto the album, rare demos and acoustic tracks from What Came From Fire. Also as part of the EP the band teamed up with Pledge to offer exclusive one-off and VIP experiences, limited edition t-shirts, hand written lyric sheets and jam in rehearsals with band. All exclusive pledgers were given a free download of all of the tracks on the EP. The second single \\"Sometimes\\" was released on the same day as the album and has been championed by BBC Radio 1 (Zane Lowe) and XFM (Mary Anne Hobbs). The song \\"Sometimes\\" became a viral hit thanks to its appearance on the Martyn AShton Road Bike Party video. The song, along with \\"Alcatraz\\" is now associated with many extreme sports videos on YouTube including the Turbolenza: We are not crazy... WE ARE AMAZING! video. Angels and Enemies was released to critical acclaim. FMV Magazines Dan Jenko described the record as \\"an excellent return for Sound of Guns: one that not only gives their die-hard fans the crowd-pleasing anthems they wanted, but also provides another stepping stone as they attempt to break into the mainstream fold\\". The iTunes bonus track \\"Violets\\" was a fan favourite, yet was only played once at the band's final gig at Whitehaven Civic Hall on 11 October 2013. =Track list= Members * Andrew Metcalfe - lead vocals * Lee Glynn - guitar * Nathan Crowley - guitar * John Coley - bass * Simon Finley - drums References External links *Spotify *YouTube *Last Fm *BBC Music - artist page *what- music.com - Angels and Enemies album review *Apple Music *Soundcloud Category:English rock music groups Category:English alternative rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2008 ","title":"Sound of Guns"},{"id":"29537938","text":"The Grafton Post Office is a historic former post office building at 205 Main Street in Grafton, Vermont. Built in 1855 in the Greek Revival style, it was the town's post office for over 100 years, and served for a time thereafter as the local historical society museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. It is still owned by the historical society, but leased for commercial retail purposes. Description and history The former Grafton Post Office is located on the east side of Grafton village, on the north side of Main Street (Vermont Route 121), just west of its junction with Chester Road (Vermont Route 35). It stands west of the former Grafton District Schoolhouse No. 2, and across the street from the public library, both individually listed on the National Register. The post office is a small single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a fieldstone foundation. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the leftmost bay. Trim consists of simple corner boards and short gable returns. The interior, consisting of a single large room, with two smaller rooms in ells to the rear, has retained only some of its original features. The post office was built in 1855 for the town's third postmaster, and served in that capacity until 1958. It was lifted off its foundation by flooding occasioned by the Great New England Hurricane of 1938, at which time it was set on its present foundation, a short distance removed from its original location. In 1962 the building was sold to the Grafton Historical Society, which housed its museum there until 1978. The society continues to own the building, leasing it out.

History In 935, Fujisaki Hachimangu was established with the Bunrei of Iwashimizu Hachiman-g≈´ Kyoto, at Chausuyama (now Kumamoto Fujisakidai Baseball Stadium), Kumamoto Castle at the order of Emperor Suzaku. The word Fuji derives from a tale that at the time of establishment, sticking of fuji resulted in fuji Wisteria taking root and grew. Fujisaki Hachimangu has been respected as the defender of Higo, Kumamoto Prefecture. In 1542, Emperor Go-Nara presented a wooden frame ÂÖ´Âπ°Ëó§Â¥éÂÆÆ which is now engraved over the Torii. Rebuilding of the shrine, 20 years apart, had been made with the order of the Emperor. In 1877, the shrine was burnt amid the battle of Satsuma Rebellion and was reconstructed at Igawabuchi Machi, the present location. In the modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines, Fujisaki was listed in 1915 among the 3rd class of nationally significant shrines or . In 1952, the shrine was designated a religious corporation. Great Festival  Of the events of the shrine, most known is the parade of Kami with horses in September.

History Victoria Square, where The River artwork and water feature is located, was once one of the busiest interchanges in Birmingham. By the mid-1900s, plans were drawn up for the remodelling of Victoria Square in a bid to open up Colmore Row to more cars, but those plans were subsequently quashed. By the 1990s, a completely different set of plans were put in place. An international design competition was held for a central water feature in the square, which was won by Dhruva Mistry. Construction commenced in 1992 and was completed in 1994, when the square was officially reopened by Diana, Princess of Wales. Further work and renovations were carried out over the next few years, including the installation of a multi-coloured lighting system. Repairs were frequently required, and in autumn 2013 the fountain had to be switched off after a major leak was identified. The fountain later filled with soil and plants in 2015. Mistry's fountain is the largest sculptural piece in the square. Mistry's winning design for Victoria Square consists of four sets of works (named The River, Guardians, Youth and Object [Variations]), representing youth and eternity. The River features a 1.75-tonne bronze statue of a woman, tall, wide and long. The surrounding pool is paved with Wattscliff sandstone. Engraved in the rim of the upper pool by Bettina Furne√© are the following words from the poem Burnt Norton by T. S. Eliot: When active as a fountain, the water in the pool flowed at a rate of 12,000 litres (3,000 gallons) per minute into a lower pool, in which is another bronze sculpture, Youth. This sculpture is tall and in diameter, depicting a boy and a girl facing each other at either end of a fountain. Beside them are an egg and a cone. The surrounding lower pool is also paved with Wattscliff sandstone, on the floor of which is a bas-relief of six large salmon. The combination of The River and Youth won a Fountain of the Year award in 1995. Developments A water leak from the fountain occurred in November 2008 and as a result it was only switched on for special occasions and maintenance.http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/16588/response/41958/attach/html/3/scs025d1.doc.html After a ¬£300,000 restoration in 2010 the fountain was turned back on. The work also involved the installation of a new multi-coloured lighting system. After another leak occurred, the water was turned off in 2013 to save costs. As of 6 July 2015, the main pool was filled with soil and bedding plants and no longer functions as a fountain. The Guardians One of the Guardians On either side of the fountain are two large sculptures collectively known as Guardians. The sculptures ‚Äì made from the same Darley Dale stone as the Council House ‚Äì are high, wide and long. The sculptures are not identical and take features from a variety of animals. They have been derided in the past for having faces like characters in the children's television series Thomas and Friends.Noszlopy & Beach (1998), p. 21. On either side of these sculptures are two obelisk-shaped sculptures collectively known as Object (Variations). The sandstone sculptures are tall and . The two obelisks were initially refused by the city council, as they were deemed unnecessary; but Mistry ‚Äì who declined to comment on their meaning ‚Äì urged the council to reconsider, and they were later approved. They now act as lampstands in the square.

For his 2001 movie Cicatrices (Scars), based on the novel of the same name by Juan Jos√© Saer, he was nominated for the 2002 Silver Condor award for Best Screenplay Adaptation at the Mar del Plata Film Festival. Cicatrices weaves together three stories of frustrated men and women in the 1960s, a downbeat movie in which it always seems to be raining. The movie starred Omar Fantini, Raul Kreig, Pablo Di Crocce, Monica Galan, Maria Leal and Vando Villamil. A critic said of the movie \\"Coll's film is not easy to pigeonhole: it revolutionizes the visual language, and yet openly avoids clich√©s of cinema in recent decades\\". In 1966, Patrick Coll and Jorge Goldenberg Hachero filmed a documentary on the social situation of the loggers in the northern province of Santa Fe. The film crew was based in a small town called Fortin Olmos, where a group of worker priests from the Congregation of the Brothers de Foucauld had settled a few years earlier and established a farm cooperative. Forty years later, the filmmakers returned in search of survivors from that experiment, documented in the 2008 Regreso a Fort√≠n Olmos (Back to Fortin Olmos). Although the cooperative proved to be an unattainable utopia, the film shows the clarity, conviction, passion and dedication of the protagonists.

It was built between 1881 and 1884 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Li√®ge in World War I and again at the opening of World War II. It has been preserved and is operated as a museum. Description The Fort d'Embourg is located about southeast of the center of Li√®ge, on the heights above the community of Chaudfontaine, overlooking the Vesdre valley. The fort was built as an irregular rectangle, in contrast to most Brialmont forts, which were triangular. A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. The fort is one of the smallest Li√®ge forts. Embourg is more elevated above the surrounding country than most of the Li√®ge forts, overlooking the Ourthe and Vesdre valleys and controlling the road from Li√®ge to Spa. With the exception of the Fort de Loncin, the Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Li√®ge), with lesser protection than the two \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21 cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21 cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Armament Embourg's armament included a Gr√ºsonwerke turret with a single 21 cm Krupp gun, a15cm Creusot turret with twin guns and a 12 cm Ch√¢tillon-Commentry turret with two Krupp guns, all for distant targets. Four Gr√ºsonwerke 57 mm gun turrets were provided for local defense. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight. Nine rapid-fire 57 mm guns were provided in casemates for the defense of the ditches and the postern. The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with the neighboring Fort de Loncin and Fort de Liers. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.Donnell, p. 17 First World War The Li√®ge forts Li√®ge first came under attack on 6 August 1914. When the Li√®ge's fortifications proved unexpectedly stubborn, the Germans brought heavy siege artillery to bombard the forts with shells far larger than they were designed to resist. Embourg was heavily bombarded starting 12 August. The fort surrendered the next day after 48 hours of bombardment. Occupying the fort during the remainder of the war, Germans made a number of improvements to the fort in 1914 and 1915. Fortified Position of Li√®ge Embourg's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge II, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 The armament was upgraded with new guns in the turrets and an anti-aircraft battery. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. An infantry shelter with an automatic rifle cloche was built at this time, as well as a remote air intake tower some distance to the west of the fort, linked to the fort by a tunnel. In 1940 the fort's garrison comprised 323 men, mostly reservists, with four officers. Second World War Embourg first came into contact with German forces during the Battle of Belgium on 12 May 1940. The fort was surrounded on the 13th, occupying areas around the rear of the fort including the air intake tower. The neighboring Chaudfontaine provided supporting fire against German infantry, who mounted an infantry attack at 10 p.m.. On the 14th the Germans continued artillery fire against Embourg while Embourg fired in support of Chaudfontaine. On the 15th, aerial bombardment started at 2 p.m., lasting until the night. The next day the aerial bombardment resumed while German units infiltrated the area around the fort . On the 17th the fort was attack by bombers, artillery and infantry. Embourg called for artillery support from surrounding forts, which they could not provide, but did provide support for a while to Chaudfontaine. Shortly thereafter the 75mm gun turrets were knocked out of action. After sabotaging the fort's equipment, the garrison surrendered. Present A commemorative association was established in 1946, which has erected monuments and maintained a museum in the fort. The fort has been preserved and may be visited by the public.

Early life Nomura was born Donald Engel at St. Luke's International Hospital in Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo. Born to a Japanese mother and a Jewish American father, Yoshie It≈ç left the family when Don was six, leaving Alvin George Engel to care for him and his younger brother Kenneth. He attended St. Mary's International School, a private, English-speaking Catholic school in Tokyo, until he was kicked out for fighting at the age of 16. Nomura then attended Chofu High School, then transferred to Zama High School, where he played baseball, and graduated in 1975. During this time, he began visiting his mother, who had changed her name to Sachiyo and married NPB catcher and manager Katsuya Nomura.Whiting 2004, p. 123 After completing high school, Nomura enrolled at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona, California where he studied and played baseball from 1975-77. In 1977, at the age of 21, the Japanese Home Ministry would no longer allow Nomura to hold a dual US-Japan citizenship, requiring him to choose one. He chose Japanese citizenship. Nomura's decision was influenced by a NPB restriction that allowed only two foreign players per team at the time. He then assumed the name until his stepfather adopted him that same year, at which time he took the name Don Katsuki Nomura.Whiting 2004, p. 124 Commenting on his new Japanese name, Nomura remarked, \\"It helped me get into places and meet people\\". He began playing on a minor league team affiliated with the Yakult Swallows the next year as a utility infielder. In 1981, he was released after playing four seasons with the team because of poor performance. That same year, Nomura's 62-year-old father, Alvin Engel, committed suicide in Hawaii via carbon monoxide poisoning. Nomura traveled to Hawaii to pick up his father's ashes and returned them to Japan.Whiting 2004, pp. 124-125 In December 1981, Nomura moved to Los Angeles with his new wife. There he worked a series of odd jobs that including non-paying scout for the Milwaukee Brewers, travel agent, janitor, waiter, driver, liquor store clerk, tour coordinator, translator, and other odd jobs. For a time, Nomura was forced to send his wife and infant daughter back to Japan while he lived out of his car in Los Angeles because of his poor financial state. By 1985, he had saved enough money to rent an apartment and bring his family back to L.A.Whiting 2004, p. 125 Nomura then converted $1,000 to $41,000 while playing baccarat in Las Vegas. The money helped him to buy an apartment building in L.A. for $250,000 that he later sold for $400,000.Whiting 2004, p. 126 Career In 1989, Nomura borrowed money to buy 50% of the Salinas Spurs, an unaffiliated Class-A baseball team in the California League. NPB teams sent their high school draftees to Nomura's Spurs for training. As a teenager, baseball player Mac Suzuki worked in the team's clubhouse until he began playing with the Spurs in 1992. That year, Suzuki became Nomura's first client when he signed him to a personal representation contract. Nomura then negotiated with the Seattle Mariners and later earned Suzuki a million-dollar signing bonus.Whiting 2004, pp. 126-127 In 1992, Nomura sold the Spurs to a group in San Bernardino.Whiting 2004, p. 127 He founded the Los Angeles-based company KDN Sports, Inc. and became a full-time sports agent. In 1994 Nomura discovered a loophole in the NPB player contract and working agreement between MLB and NPB. According to the 1967 working agreement between MLB and NPB, NPB players could not sign a contract with an MLB team until they reached free agency after 10 years of service or unless their team sold their contract to an MLB team. However, a player who \\"voluntarily retired\\" from NPB was no longer bound to their NPB team outside Japan and was free to sign overseas without violating the working agreement. After the 1994 season Nomura assisted star NPB pitcher Hideo Nomo in testing the loophole. After failing to reach a contract agreement with the Kintetsu Buffaloes, Nomo retired from NPB and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. In 1998 he represented Hideki Irabu, whose contract was sold by the Chiba Lotte Marines to the San Diego Padres. Irabu stated that he would only play for the New York Yankees, and refused to sign with the Padres. The Padres traded the rights to Irabu to the Yankees, where he finally made his MLB debut. Despite Irabu's refusal to sign with the Padres, other teams were unhappy that they didn't get the chance to bid on Irabu. In 1998, the NPB contract loophole was tested again when Nomura advised Hiroshima Carp player Alfonso Soriano of the Dominican Republic who wished to move to MLB. Although NPB had amended the player contract to prohibit retired players from signing overseas, they had inadvertently failed to notify MLB of the change as required by the working agreement. After failing to reach a contract agreement with the Carp, Soriano declared his retirement as Nomo had three years before. This decision resulted in the Carp management suing Nomura for $100,000 in damages as well as threatening legal action against any MLB ball club that negotiated with Soriano. However, MLB eventually ruled that Soriano could be classified as a free agent. The Carp gave up pursuing legal action, and the suit with Nomura was later settled. Soriano signed with the New York Yankees for $3.1 million over four years, a vast improvement over the $40,000 a year he was offered from the Carp. The incidents with Nomo, Irabu, and Soriano motivated NPB and MLB to abolish the working agreement and replace it with the current posting system. This led to a wave of star players leaving NPB during their prime to play in the United States, in addition to the dozens of players who moved to the US after becoming free agents. Personal life Nomura's stepbrother is former NPB player and current Yomiuri Giants coach Katsunori Nomura. After a 2001 tax evasion scandal involving Nomura's mother Sachiyo, he and brother Kenneth Engel got into a public dispute with her, but later reconciled. Katsunori Nomura, however, remained supportive during the months preceding Sachiyo's arrest.

Background  Greek artillerymen with 75 mm field gun. Greece, a state of 2,666,000 people in 1912,Erickson (2003), p. 70 was considered the weakest of the three main Balkan allies, since it fielded the smallest land army and had suffered a humiliating defeat against the Ottomans 16 years before in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Following the defeat, starting in 1904 and especially after the Goudi coup of 1909, serious efforts were undertaken to reorganize and modernize the Army. From 1911, this task was undertaken by a French military mission.The history of the organization of the Hellenic Army, 1821‚Äì1954 (2005), pp. 219‚Äì282 The peacetime establishment of the Hellenic Army in 1912 comprised four infantry divisions (1st at Larissa, 2nd at Athens, 3rd at Missolonghi and 4th at Nafplion) newly reformed as triangular divisions, a cavalry brigade, six Evzones battalions, four field artillery and two mountain artillery regiments, one heavy artillery battalion and various support units, including two engineer regiments and an aircraft company. From 25 March 1912, Crown Prince Constantine assumed the position of Inspector-General of the Army, becoming its de facto commander-in-chief.The history of the organization of the Hellenic Army, 1821‚Äì1954 (2005), pp. 239‚Äì241, 285  Mobilization  The army was still in the process of reorganization when the war began. With the escalation of the crisis between the Balkan states and the Ottoman Empire, on , a general mobilization was declared. The existing units were brought up to full complement, and the 5th, 6th, and 7th infantry divisions were set up. This brought the peacetime establishment of ca. 25,000 men up to ca. 110,000. In contrast to pre-war planning, no army corps were established; instead, the divisions were directly subordinated to GHQ.The history of the organization of the Hellenic Army, 1821‚Äì1954 (2005), p. 287Hall (2000), p. 17 The available forces were grouped into two main commands: the Army of Thessaly (Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ¨ ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒØŒ±œÇ), under the Crown Prince, which comprised the bulk of the Greek Army, and the Army of Epirus (Œ£œÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπŒ¨ ŒóœÄŒµŒØœÅŒøœÖ), under Lt Gen Konstantinos Sapountzakis.Oikonomou (1977), pp. 289‚Äì290  Army of Thessaly  Field uniforms of the Greek Army during the Balkan Wars The Army of Thessaly comprised in total 59 infantry and 4 Evzone battalions, eight cavalry companies (of the Cavalry Brigade), seven engineer companies (organic to the infantry divisions), 32 artillery batteries with 96 field guns, 24 mountain guns and 70 machine-guns, and various support troops including an aviation company with four aircraft. The force totalled some 100,000 men, with ca. 80,000 effectives. On these were organized in the following formations: *1st Infantry Division (Œô ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), under Maj Gen Emmanouil Manousogiannakis 2nd Infantry Regiment 4th Infantry Regiment 5th Infantry Regiment 1st and 2nd squadrons of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment *2nd Infantry Division (II ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), under Maj Gen Konstantinos Kallaris 1st Infantry Regiment 3rd Infantry Regiment 7th Infantry Regiment 1st and 2nd squadrons of the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment *3rd Infantry Division (III ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), under Maj Gen Konstantinos Damianos 6th Infantry Regiment 10th Infantry Regiment 12th Infantry Regiment 1st and 2nd squadrons of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment 3rd Mountain Artillery Squadron *4th Infantry Division (IV ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), under Maj Gen Konstantinos Moschopoulos 8th Infantry Regiment 9th Infantry Regiment 11th Infantry Regiment 1st and 2nd squadrons of the 4th Field Artillery Regiment 1st Mountain Artillery Squadron *5th Infantry Division (V ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), under Col Dimitrios Matthaiopoulos 16th Infantry Regiment 22nd Infantry Regiment 23rd Infantry Regiment 3rd Squadron of the 1st Field Artillery Regiment 2nd Mountain Artillery Squadron *6th Infantry Division (VI ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), under Col Konstantinos Miliotis-Komninos 1st Evzone Regiment 17th Infantry Regiment 18th Infantry Regiment 3rd Squadron of the 2nd Field Artillery Regiment *7th Infantry Division (VII ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), still forming at Larissa under Col Kleomenis Kleomenous 19th Infantry Regiment 20th Infantry Regiment 21st Infantry Regiment 3rd Squadron of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment Machine-gun Squadron *Cavalry Brigade (Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ± ŒôœÄœÄŒπŒ∫Œøœç), under Maj Gen Alexandros Soutsos 1st Cavalry Regiment 3rd Cavalry Regiment *Gennadis Detachment (ŒëœÄœåœÉœÄŒ±œÉŒºŒ± ŒìŒµŒΩŒΩŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑), under Col Stefanos Gennadis, covering the army's left flank 1st Evzone Battalion 4th Evzone Battalion *Konstantinopoulos Detachment (ŒëœÄœåœÉœÄŒ±œÉŒºŒ± ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩŒøœÄŒøœçŒªŒøœÖ), under Col Konstantinos Konstantinopoulos, covering the army's right flank 2nd Evzone Battalion 6th Evzone Battalion  Army of Epirus  The Army of Epirus was tasked with the secondary strategic direction, towards the strongly fortified city of Ioannina and beyond. As the main initial strategic effort was to be against Thessaly, it was relegated to a secondary role, and was initially outnumbered by the Ottoman forces in the area (Yanya Corps under Esad Pasha). It nevertheless pushed back the initial Ottoman assaults, took Preveza and advanced to the approaches of the Ioannina fortified zone. Two attacks on the city in December and January were repulsed by the Ottoman forces, but after extensive preparations and transfer of forces from Macedonia, the city fell following the Battle of Bizani. The Army of Epirus was commanded until by Lt Gen Konstantinos Sapountzakis, and thereafter by Crown Prince Constantine. = Order of battle at the outbreak of hostilities = The Army of Epirus was composed of several independent units of roughly divisional strength. Its forces numbered eight infantry and Evzone battalions, one cavalry company and 24 guns, totalling some 10,000‚Äì13,000 in the early phases of the war. At the outbreak of the war, it comprised the following units: *15th Infantry Regiment *3rd Evzone Battalion *7th Evzone Battalion *10th Reserve Evzone Battalion *2nd National Guard Battalion To these were later added two battalions of Cretans, as well as the volunteer Garibaldini legion. On , these forces formed the Epirus Division (ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ± ŒóœÄŒµŒØœÅŒøœÖ), renamed in February 1913 as the 8th Infantry Division (VIII ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±). In early December, the Army of Epirus was reinforced with the 2nd Infantry Division,Erickson (2003), p. 293 followed on 27 December by the 4th Division, by mid-January by the 6th Division and the 7th Infantry Regiment.Erickson (2003), p. 299 In preparation for the Battle of Bizani, the Crown Prince brought in additional troops and artillery, while a Mixed Brigade was formed to attack the fortifications of Ioannina from the northeastern flank.Erickson (2003), p. 301 = Order of battle before the Battle of Bizani = Plan of the Greek flanking move that led to the fall of Ioannina. Before the Battle of Bizani, the Army of Epirus comprised the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th Infantry Divisions, the Mixed Brigade, a cavalry regiment and the three independent detachments of Acheron, Preveza and Himara, in total 51 infantry battalions and other units, comprising 41,400 men with 48 machine guns and 93 field and mountain guns.

It acts as an umbrella organisation for regional societies and individuals interested in spiders, and related animals, and organises an International Congress every three years. History =Conception= The idea of arachnologists coming together for scientific meetings stems from the German zoologist Hermann Wiehle in 1959 . He encouraged Wolfgang Crome (Berlin) and Ernst Kullmann (Bonn) in this matter and a subsequent meeting of the German Zoological Society in Bonn in 1960 was used as a platform for the first arachnological meeting; with about 20 (mostly German) scientists in attendance. A second meeting, again associated with the German Zoological Society, followed in Saarbr√ºcken in 1961 organised by Otto Kraus, and attracted additional international participation. The third meeting, again organised by Otto Kraus, was held in Frankfurt am Main in 1965 under the title III. Kongre√ü europ√§ischer Arachnologen. =C.I.D.A.= During preparations for the Frankfurt meeting Otto Kraus and the French zoologist Max Vachon discussed the establishment of a formal organisation to improve international cooperation among arachnologists. In 1963 of the Centre International de Documentation Arachnologique (C.I.D.A.) based at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris was formed. Max Vachon was the first Pr√©sident and Otto Kraus the Pr√©sident-adjoint; with Kraus becoming Pr√©sident in 1965 and Vachon Secr√©taire g√©n√©ral. A series of national correspondents were also appointed as local representatives of the emerging society. From 1963, C.I.D.A. began to produce, every three years, an Annuaire des Arachnologistes Mondiaux ‚Äì a list of active workers in the field of arachnology, cross-referenced by country and research interests ‚Äì and a Liste des Travaux Arachnologiques ‚Äì an annual list of recent scientific publications in this field. Following Frankfurt, further international meetings were held on a regular three year cycle beginning with the IV√®me Congr√®s International d‚ÄôArachnologie in 1968 in Paris, and thereafter known as the International Congress of Arachnology. =ISA= Administration of C.I.D.A. remained for many years in Paris, largely under Jacqueline Heurtault who was elected Secr√©taire g√©n√©ral adjoint in 1968 and Secr√©taire g√©n√©ral in 1983. Following her retirement from the post in 1998, administration of the society moved to Washington, D.C. with Jonathan Coddington at the United States National Museum taking over as Secretary. At the same time a proposal was made at the 1999 Chicago meeting to change the name to International Society of Arachnology (ISA). This phase also saw the start of a homepage and subsequently an electronic mailing list, which gradually came to replace the older printed documentation such as the Liste and the Annuaire. Earlier international congress proceedings were produced either in special congress volumes or local journals, but since 1999 the proceedings have been published in a dedicated issue of the Journal of Arachnology produced by the American Arachnological Society. Since 2002 administration of the society moved to Berlin and Jason Dunlop at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde. From 2007 the society has begun to make a series of awards during its international meetings to honour senior colleagues in the field. The society The society is headed by an executive committee which includes a President, Vice-President, Past-President, Treasurer, Secretary and Webmaster; plus a number of ordinary council members. In addition to this, there are regional correspondents. Ideally one is appointed for each country, and they act as local representatives and contact points for questions relating to spiders and other arachnids. A general assembly of the society is held every three years during the international congress. As of 2015, ISA has about 560 members world-wide encompassing most of the world's professional and semi-professional arachnologists.

The SwissFEL design is optimised to generate X-ray pulses in the wavelength range of 1 √Ö to 70 √Ö. With an overall length of just under 740 metres, the system configuration is relatively compact. The project is being built and operated as a complement to the European XFEL. Construction work for SwissFEL began in the spring of 2013. After completion of the building, installation of the technical components started at the beginning of 2015. The first pilot experiments were carried out in 2017. In 2018 the first beamline, called ARAMIS, was put into operation. The second beamline, ATHOS, is expected to follow by fall 2020. ARAMIS delivers very high-energy short-wave X-ray light, which can be used to follow how atoms behave during a fast-moving process. ATHOS delivers softer X-ray light with lower energy, making it possible to observe atoms and molecules as they form a new chemical bond. The total construction cost is around 275 million Swiss francs.  Location  SwissFEL was built in the W√ºrenlinger forest, near the PSI campus. There the temperature fluctuations and vibrations are particularly small, and this simplifies operations: The temperature in the beam channel may not deviate more than 0.1 degree from the ideal 24 degrees Celsius, because otherwise the slightest material expansions could distort the measurement results or thwart experiments entirely. This is also why large parts of the long building were covered with earth and gravel. Doing so created, at the same time, a so-called alkaline grassland biotope that serves as a natural habitat for many endangered plants and animals.  How it works  SwissFEL essentially consists of four components: an electron source, a linear accelerator, an arrangement of undulators, and measuring stations. Electrons are set free from a copper disk with a pulsed laser. The cloud of released electrons is accelerated and held together with an electrical field. They are guided into the linear accelerator, which further accelerates the electrons with alternating current at high frequency. The electrons now fly through the undulator, a stretch of dipole magnets in an alternating arrangement: This forces them onto a slalom course. With every change of direction, the electrons emit X-ray light. This produces an X-ray beam with laser-like properties, which can be used for experiments in the measuring stations. The X-ray beam reaches up to 10 gigawatts of power and is pulsed extremely rapidly: up to 100 flashes per second, each lasting only 1 to 60 femtoseconds. The pulses are so bright that they can be used to produce films of the movements of atoms and molecules. There are only four other X-ray laser facilities on a comparable scale in the entire world.  Application Areas  X-ray lasers like SwissFEL can be used, for example, to study new materials for electronics with the aim of further advancing miniaturisation in this field. The course of catalytic reactions can be followed on the atomic level in order to optimise them and thus improve resource efficiency in environmental technology or the chemical industry. Biomedical scientists can observe in detail the structure of vital proteins and their reactions to substances, in order to develop new drugs.

He was particularly active in the improvement of school textbooks on this subject, and was amply rewarded by substantial sales, second only to Webster's American Spelling Book. Portrait of Jesse Olney from the Connecticut Magazine Biography He was educated at Whitesboro, New York, became a teacher at Whitesborough and Binghamton, and was for twelve years principal of the Stone School in Hartford, Connecticut, resigning in 1831. In 1828, he brought out A Geography and Atlas, which was at once accepted as a standard work, and for thirty years was used in almost every public and private school of the United States. It was many times enlarged and revised, and ran through 98 editions, some of the editions numbering 80,000 copies. Millions of copies were sold, and the popularity of Olney's Geography was surpassed only by that of Webster's American Spelling Book. Olney's Geography has the distinction of having caused a complete revolution in the methods of teaching geography. Olney was a practical instructor, and was dissatisfied with the existing textbooks and treatises, which began with an exposition of the science of astronomy, and, making the centre of the solar system the initial point, developed the scheme until it finally included the earth. Olney reversed this method. He began with the scholar's own continent ‚Äî in fact, in the very city, town, or village in which he or she lived, and made clear by lucid definitions the natural divisions of land and water, illustrating each instance by the use of maps. His plan was to familiarize the child with the surface of the earth by going from the near to the distant, and from the concrete to the abstract, and this system at once overthrew theoretic geography, and initiated the modern practical and descriptive science. The immediate success of the work led Olney to give up teaching and devote himself to authorship. Leaving Hartford in 1833, he settled in Southington, Connecticut, until 1854, when he moved to Stratford. His text-books (1831‚Äì52) included other geographies, a series of readers, a Common School Arithmetic, and a History of the United States. He also compiled A Family Book of History, Psalms of Life, poems, and other works. After discontinuing to teach, he devoted himself to the cause of popular education. He was for many years a member of the legislature, afterward comptroller of the state for two terms, and used largely his legislative and official powers to build up the system of Connecticut common schools. In 1840, he had become a Unitarian, and for the next fourteen years he gave sympathy and much practical aid to the liberal religious movement that was then agitating New England.

Viceland launched on February 29, 2016 with two Viceland-branded cable channels; the American version (rebranded from H2) is a joint venture majority-owned by A&E; Networks (who owns a 10% stake in Vice Media, alongside a separate 10% stake owned directly by A&E;'s co-owner Disney), while the now defunct Canadian version (rebranded from Bio) operated as a Category A-licensed specialty channel majority-owned by Rogers Media. Operating under the creative direction of film director Spike Jonze, Viceland has a focus on lifestyle-oriented documentary and reality series aimed towards millennials, leveraging the resources of Vice's verticals with new original series, along with adaptations of and reruns of existing Vice web series. The network's launch programs featured programs hosted by existing Vice personalities such as Action Bronson and Thomas Morton, as well as notable figures such as Eddie Huang, Ellen Page, and Lance Bangs.  Overview  = Precursors = Vice's first foray into television was VBS.tv, an online video joint venture with Viacom's MTV Networks division (specifically, MTV and Logo TV. As part of the venture, MTV Networks had international television distribution rights for the content produced for VBS.tv, resulting in the creation of television specials that compiled content from the service (in the U.S., these aired on MTV2). Vice later produced a series for MTV, The Vice Guide to Everything. In 2013, Vice premiered a self-titled newsmagazine series for HBO. The following year, HBO's parent company Time Warner expressed interest in acquiring a stake in Vice, and proposed the possibility of Vice taking over its struggling cable news channel HLN, and revamping it as a millennial-focused service drawing from its own content. However, the deal fell through due to concerns regarding editorial control. On August 29, 2014, A&E; Networks‚Äîa joint venture of Hearst Corporation and The Walt Disney Company‚Äîacquired a 10% minority stake in Vice Media for $250 million. On October 30, 2014, Vice announced a CDN$100 million joint venture with Canadian media conglomerate Rogers Communications, to build a studio in Toronto's Liberty Village neighbourhood for producing original content. Rogers holds the minority 30% stake of the Vice Canada Studio in Toronto. Rogers also announced an intent to launch Vice-branded television and digital properties in Canada in 2015. Rogers CEO Guy Laurence described the proposed studio as \\"a powerhouse for Canadian digital content focused on 18- to 34-year-olds\\" which would be \\"exciting\\" and \\"provocative\\". In 2015, Rogers-owned television network City introduced Vice on City‚Äîan anthology series featuring short-form content produced by Vice's Canadian outlets and reporters. The Vice company had previously moved from Montreal to New York City due to difficulties in reaching a sufficient scale in Canada at the time. The company believed that Rogers' investment in Vice helped to better achieve these goals. = Programming = Viceland's programming consists primarily of lifestyle- oriented documentaries and reality series aimed towards millennials, directed in Vice's trademark style of \\"character-driven documentaries\\". Creative director Spike Jonze stated that his goal for Viceland was to make its lineup have \\"a reason to exist and a strong point of view\\", rather than be just a \\"collection of shows\\". Jonze explained that Viceland would continue to reflect Vice's core mission of \\"trying to understand the world we live in by producing pieces about things we're curious about or confused about or that we think are funny. And if it doesn't have a strong point of view, then it shouldn't be on this channel.\\" Vice co-founder and CEO Shane Smith stated that the channel's main goal was \\"trying not to be shitty\\". Viceland originally focused primarily on lifestyle content; in the U.S., Vice News content (including its series Vice News Tonight) would remain largely exclusive to Vice's existing joint venture with HBO. Jonze stated that unlike the HBO content, Viceland would be \\"far from objective [reporting]\\". Vice Media plans to enter into similar partnerships in international markets to further expand Viceland. The Walt Disney Company, who co-owns A&E; Networks with Hearst Corporation, made a second 10% investment of $200 million in Vice Media to support the production of new programming. Thirty different programs were developed for Viceland, including original series and expanded versions of existing Vice's web series. Original programs announced for the initial slate included Thomas Morton's Balls Deep, Flophouse‚Äî a series where Lance Bangs follows the lives of up-and- coming comedians at underground stand-up events, Fk, That's Delicious‚Äî a television version of the food-oriented web series starring Action Bronson, Gaycation‚Äî a series in which Ellen Page explores the LGBT cultures of different regions, Huang's World‚Äî featuring Eddie Huang \\"exploring identity using food as an equalizer\\", King of the Road‚Äî a series following skaters on Thrasher Magazine's annual scavenger hunt, States of Undress‚Äî a series focusing on fashion weeks around the world, the music documentary series Noisey, Vice World of Sports, and Weediquette‚Äî which focuses on the mainstream cannabis culture and industry. Blocks of existing short-form content from Vice (Vice Lab) are also featured, along with other, acquired content‚Äî such as Friday-night airings of cult films accompanied by Vice Guide to Film documentaries on their directors. Ten of the thirty original programs planned were produced in Canada, including Cyberwar‚Äî which focuses on cyberterrorism, and Dead Set on Life‚Äî an expansion of Matty Matheson's food-oriented web series Keep It Canada. A month after Viceland's initial launch, the U.S. version of the network announced a second slate of shows, including Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch ‚ÄòAncient Aliens‚Äô‚Äîa series in which Action Bronson watches episodes of Ancient Aliens with guests whilst smoking marijuana, Black Market‚Äî a series in which Michael K. Williams explores underground economies around the world, the U.S. premieres of Cyberwar and Dead Set on Life, Party Legends‚Äî a show about re-enactments of entertaining party stories, WOMAN‚Äî a series in which Gloria Steinam features the lives of different women around the world, and VICE Does America‚Äî which Abdullah Saeed and two Vice co-workers explore forgotten places of the world. In October 2016, the network launched a late-night talk show, Desus & Mero, hosted by Desus Nice and The Kid Mero. The program ran through June 2018, when it was cancelled after the duo signed with Showtime to host a rebooted version (which premiered in early-2019). In 2019, Viceland began to pivot its U.S. operations to include a larger focus on news programming: on February 29, the network launched Vice Live‚Äîa two-hour \\"variety show\\" aired Monday‚ÄìThursday nights from Vice's Brooklyn headquarters, which featured coverage of the day's trends, reports from Vice's international bureaus, guest appearances, as well as other freeform content. The show was cancelled on April 15. That month, Viceland also premiered Dark Side of the Ring, a documentary series on controversial events in professional wrestling. The series would become Viceland's highest- rated premiere, and was renewed for a second season. After HBO ended its partnership with Vice News, Vice News Tonight was subsequently picked up by Viceland. In February 2020, in the lead-up to the program's re-launch, the U.S. network was quietly renamed Vice on TV.  Versions  In June 2016, Shane Smith announced at the Cannes Lions Festival that Vice Media had reached deals with local broadcasters to expand into 44 countries with the launch of editorial properties and localized Viceland networks, including the Special Broadcasting Service (Australia), Econet Media (sub-Saharan Africa), The Times Group (India), Moby Media Group (Middle East), Multi Channels Asia (Southeast Asia), Sky Network Television (New Zealand), V Media Group (Canada, French- language), Ziggo (Netherlands) and Telenet (Belgium). Vice holds a 49% minority stake and control of international expansions, except for Australia where the channel is 100% owned and operated by SBS. =North America= Prior to launch day, Vice ran newspaper ads for Viceland, containing only the network's name and a phone number that, when called, invited viewers to contribute answers to questions. Pre-launch programming for Viceland began on February 29, 2016 at 5:00 a.m. ET in Canada (with Bar Talk, a one-hour special hosted by Vice Canada's head of content Patrick McGuire), and on the same day at 6:00 a.m. ET in the United States, broadcasting a countdown clock to the official launch later in the evening, accompanied by footage of Vice executives answering the viewer-contributed calls as voice mail. The first program following the countdown was the series premiere of Noisey, following hip-hop musician Kendrick Lamar. United States The American version of Viceland is operated by a joint venture between Vice Media and A&E; Networks, and originally replaced H2.  Canada  A Canadian version of Viceland launched concurrently with the U.S. version as a rebranding of The Biography Channel, with Rogers Media as a managing partner. Separately, plans were made with V Media Group to create a channel in French Canada. To comply with Canadian content regulations, it also produced some of its own programming (sourced primarily from a Toronto studio it co-founded with Rogers); Vice co- founder Suroosh Alvi stated the programs were being produced eland would view its Canadian productions as being of global interest, as opposed to a regulatory obligation of little interest of non-Canadians; one-third of the network's first slate of original programming are Canadian productions from the new facility. In November 2017, Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that Rogers intended to cease providing funding to Viceland in early 2018, citing inside reports of low viewership and unprofitability. Representatives of both companies declined to comment. On January 22, 2018, Rogers and Vice jointly announced a termination of their partnership, with the Viceland channel discontinued on March 31, 2018. Vice inherited complete ownership of the Toronto production studio and the original content produced for the channel as the Vice website will stream Viceland's programming in Canada. Plans for a French-language channel were also dropped; V Media Group will feature Vice content in French on its channels. On August 16, 2018, Vice announced a new long-term output deal with Bell Media, with its programming being aired by Bell platforms such as Crave and Much. =United Kingdom = On March 9, 2016, Vice Media announced that it would launch Viceland in the United Kingdom in September 2016 as part of a partnership with Sky, marking its first international launch. This includes carriage on its satellite and over-the-top Now TV services, access to Vice apps on Sky Q set-top boxes, and timed exclusivity for video-on-demand/Sky Go access. Sky will handle advertising sales for the channel. Low ratings were reported of the British version, where some programs premiered to viewership so low that they failed to register ratings. A Sky representative defended the channel, noting the steady growth and accolades of the U.S. network. On July 17, 2017, Viceland launched a block of late night anime in partnership with Anime Limited.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-06-20/viceland-channel- announces-late-night-anime-block/.117730 Viceland changed its name to Vice on TV in 2018.https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2019/03/08/vice-on-tv-lands-on-bt- platform/ As of 21 July 2018, Vice on TV is now available on Virgin Media channel 219. A temporary duplicate launched on channel 191 on Virgin Media at midnight on 22 July 2018, a slot previously vacated by W HD prior to the UKTV channels' removals, until the network was restored on 11 August 2018. The channel was removed from Virgin Media on 20 July 2020. = Netherlands and Belgium = Viceland started broadcasting in the Netherlands and Flanders on March 1, 2017. In the Netherlands, initially it was exclusively visible with the cable-operator Ziggo, owned by VodafoneZiggo. Viceland had concluded a deal with Liberty Global, 50% owner of VodafoneZiggo. On June 15, 2017 Viceland started with the local cable operator Caiway. Only on July 18, 2018, Viceland managed to obtain distribution with KPN, a national provider and competitor to Ziggo, resulting in nationwide availability. At the same time distribution started with T-Mobile Thuis, another national operator.https://mediamagazine.nl/televisiezender-viceland-ook-te-zien-via- kpn-en-t-mobile-thuis/ Viceland Nederland produces a few Dutch productions and was in the beginning of its existence in the news for having a documentary with Geert Wilders. In Belgium, Viceland Vlaanderen started with Telenet, the Flemish cableprovider majority owned by Liberty Global on March 1, 2017.https://press.telenet.be/nieuwe-tv-zender-viceland-vanaf-vandaag-bij- telenet# Viceland Belgique, a French-speaking Belgian version of Viceland started on June 1, 2017 together with the launch of the Dutch version on the national IPTV provider Proximus. In October 2017 also VOO (operator for French speaking Belgium) and provider Orange started distributing Viceland giving Viceland national distribution in Belgium. In the Netherlands and Flanders, the television channel was renamed to VICEtv in November 1, 2019. Vice TV ceased existing in the Netherlands and Flanders on August 24, 2020. = Australia and New Zealand = On November 15, 2016, Australian public broadcaster Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) re-launched its SBS2 channel as SBS Viceland. The re-branded channel features Viceland's programming and other newly commissioned content, alongside original news, entertainment, and sports programming carried over from its previous branding. In New Zealand there is also a version of Viceland available (owned by Vice Media). = Southeast Asia = A Viceland programming block is aired on Outdoor Channel since August 2016.

It is the most high-ranking temple of the sect in Kyushu. In Honmy≈ç-ji is the grave of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, (1562‚Äì1611), a Japanese daimy≈ç, builder of Kumamoto Castle and a dedicated buddhist of Nichiren Buddhism. The temple Honmy≈ç-ji consists of two parts, the grave of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa which is called J≈çchiby≈ç, and Honmy≈ç-ji temple. He was a dedicated believer of Nichiren Buddhism. There is a straight road beginning at Kamikumamoto, through a big torii, dotted with 12 smaller temples called tatch≈´, leading to the Honmy≈ç-ji temple. From the temple, a steep slope begins, which is called Munatsuki Gangi, consisting of 176 stone steps, leading to the grave. On the central part of the road are many stone lantern structures, contributed by believers. People pray before the altar of the grave of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. There is a museum housing various traditional items of historical importance. There is a big statue of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, 300 steps upwards. Tonsha-e On July 23, one day before the death day of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, a festival is observed which is called Tonsha-e. It is observed to console the spirit of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, by writing the long Lotus Sutra during one night by many priests. History The original temple was built in 1585 in Osaka to console the spirit of the father of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. The temple in Osaka was moved to Kumamoto Castle in 1600 and the grave of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, which is called J≈çchiby≈ç was built in the present site of Mount Nakao in 1611. The temple in Kumamoto Castle was burned, and was moved to the present site considerably under the grave of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa in 1614. In 1871, the shinto shrine part grave was moved to Kumamoto Castle in the name of Kat≈ç Shrine under the policy of the separation of shintoism and buddhism. During the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, the temple was partly burnt. Later the temple and the grave were reconstructed. Throughout the Edo period and Meiji period, the temple attracted many people from Kumamoto for recreation. Either since the Edo period or Meiji period, leprosy patients had gathered around the temple, for they could live, begging money from many people coming to the temple. Around 1930, there occurred the \\"No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture\\" movement and the Government intended to hospitalize all leprosy patients in sanatoriums. On July 9, 1940, 157 leprosy patients living around Honmy≈ç-ji temple were forcibly hospitalized into many sanatoriums throughout the country.

The wide untrammeled bush was his home and he revelled in it.\\" Early life Ernest Henry was born on 1 May 1837 in Crosthwaite, Cumberland (now Cumbria).http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world- records?firstname=ernest&lastname;=henry&yearofbirth;=1837&yearofbirth;_offset=0 After leaving school he was apprenticed to the sea and on his maiden voyage in 1853 sailed to Australia on the steamship Victoria, one of the vessels of the Australian Royal Mail Steamship Co. He returned to England to serve in the Crimean War. He emigrated to Australia when he heard that gold had been discovered, arriving in Melbourne with his brothers Arthur and Alfred in 1858 on board the sailing ship Red Jacket. From Melbourne he made his way to Ballarat. Not greatly impressed by prospects on the goldfields, Henry rode to Brisbane with the idea of exploring the outskirts of northern settlement to take up a run of his own. He rode alone, travelling by way of the rivers, through country only sparsely occupied. Hughenden Station In Brisbane, Henry met George Elphinstone Dalrymple who was planning an expedition to explore the Burdekin River. Henry was invited to join the expedition in mid-1859. They travelled via the Darling Downs and the upper Burnett River to Rockhampton, and from there to the junction of the Suttor and Burdekin Rivers. Henry's participation in Dalrymple's expedition resulted in him securing three pastoral stations: Baroondah (now the locality of Baroondah) on the Dawson River, Mt McConnel at the junction of the Suttor and Burdekin rivers, and Conway (which adjoined Mt McConnel) at the head of Sellheim Creek. By 1861 he and his brother Arthur had stocked them with sheep and cattle driven from southern Queensland properties. But Henry was never satisfied. His desire for new land and adventure was fed by the reports of Frederick Walker and William Landsborough who returned from their separate searches for Burke and Wills in 1862 with promising reports of the Flinders River country. Henry wanted to view this new country himself and set out from Mt McConnell on 24 November 1863 with a Mr Devlin and his favourite aboriginal boy, Dick. On the Flinders River he took up land which he named Hughenden Station after his mother's childhood home in England, Hughenden Manor. The township of Hughenden was laid out in the same area in 1876. Loss of Stations Henry and his \\"faithful Dick\\" returned from the Flinders to Mt McConnel in March 1864, and sometime later that year Henry went into Bowen to attend to the sale of some of his properties to cover his increasing debts. In a letter to his mother, Henry called it \\"rashness and too-eager ambition\\" to acquire four properties in as many years and attempt to stock and improve them. He was more than ¬£13,000 in debt. Baroondah was the first station to be sold, probably during 1864. Conway was sold the same year, but the buyers alleged misrepresentation. The ¬£8000 they paid remained lodged in a Rockhampton bank until a court could decide the outcome. In the meantime, Henry's creditors were circling. Henry wrote to his father asking for a ¬£4,500 loan. His father provided ¬£5,000 ‚Äì but with the condition that Conway and Hughenden were first sold. The difficulties dragged on until the end of 1865 by which time Hughenden had been sold to Henry's cousin, Robert Gray, and all of Henry's remaining assets were consigned, on his father's advice, to his creditors in exchange for his debts. Henry was chastened by his failure and openly admitted his failings in a letter to his mother dated 23 November 1865. In that letter, Henry again accepts blame, but he also expresses optimism \\"for fresh exertions with a less aspiring, though steadier and more calculating, zeal. I am not daunted, but rather urged on by misfortune, which creates in me a fresh desire for action\\".Extracts from early letters of Ernest Henry, 994.37031, HEN V2, p152 On the loss of his properties, Henry focussed his attention on the country west of Hughenden Station with the object of acquiring another run. At Eastern Creek (near the present-day township of Julia Creek), he saw the tracks of Duncan McIntyre who had passed north just a few weeks before with a party of men in search of Ludwig Leichhardt. Henry and McIntyre, separately, were heading to Burketown. McIntyre arrived there on 20 April 1866; Henry on the 26th. Both stayed in the vicinity for some weeks and both caught \\"gulf fever\\". Henry survived, McIntyre didn't. :8 May 1866 ‚Äì I was awfully bad when I got up in the morning, suffering chiefly from fearful shooting pains down the right side of my head. We luckily had a fair wind up the river. I laid on and under blankets at the bottom of the boat. The pains in my head came so quick and sharp sometimes as to take away my breath, and for the life of me I could no help crying out. I clenched my teeth and did all I could but had no power to help it.Extracts from early letters of Ernest Henry, 994.37031 HEN V3, p152s Henry returned to Hughenden Station to recuperate. Discovery of Cloncurry Copper On an exploring trip in the Cloncurry region in 1867, Henry found lumps of a heavy black mineral and took samples to Peak Downs, the nearest settlement inland from Rockhampton, to report and register their find. The mineral proved to be iron ore, a worthless find as the deposit was too distant from the nearest port. Henry again returned to the Cloncurry area with his aboriginal boy, Dick, fossicking for minerals. On 20 May 1867 he found the mother lode of copper that became the Great Australian Mine. In 1876 the township of Cloncurry was laid out by Surveyor William H Bishop, the same man who laid out the township of Hughenden. Henry worked the Great Australian Mine, bagging and exporting copper ore, until it was sold in 1879. Although the lode was rich, copper was low in value, and it was costly to cart ore to Normanton and bring stores to the mine. In 1882 he discovered copper mines at Argylla, 50 miles west of Cloncurry, and at Mount Oxide, 90 miles from Argylla. Writing to his mother in the same year he said: :When I first made the discovery of copper in this district there was not a white man within a hundred miles and great tracts of country lay in every direction, unpopulated save by a few tribes of savages. At the present moment it would be difficult to find a patch of available land that has not been secured by squatters. Hitherto they have been cattlemen, but now the southern capitalists are turning their attention to our northern prairies and are introducing sheep. Sheep have always been the harbingers of prosperity to all good grazing districts.Pearson, S.E, The Prospector of Argylla:Being an Account of the life of the late Ernest Henry, HEN/PEA C.A In 1883 Tarsis Copper Smelting Company began work on the Great Australian mine. A furnace, rail tracks, rail trucks and other mining equipment were dragged from Normanton. But the mine soon closed and the furnace on the bank of the Coppermine Creek decayed into a rusty Cloncurry landmark. Final years Henry disposed of his various mining leases over the years, and by 1913 the last of his holdings, Mount Oxide, had been sold for ¬£40,000. He lived alone at the Grange on the outskirts of Cloncurry. His wife, whom he had married in 1870 and by whom he had two children, died in 1888. Henry died at Epping, New South Wales, on 26 March 1919. Legacy To commemorate Henry's importance to the Cloncurry area, the Ernest Henry mine, 38 kilometres north-east of Cloncurry, was named in his honour and began commercial production in 1998 as an open-pit copper mine.

He retired as a bishop of the Anglican Church of Canada in 2004 after 12 years. Anglican Church in North America In November 2007, Harvey relinquished his ministry in the Anglican Church of Canada pursuant to Canon XIX of the General Synod, and was received into the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone under its primate, Gregory Venables. In becoming a bishop in the Southern Cone, he came out of retirement, resumed full-time episcopal ministry on a volunteer basis as Moderator Bishop of the Anglican Network in Canada, a founding diocese of the Anglican Church in North America in 2009, and began to offer episcopal oversight to a number of Canadian Anglican parishes that no longer believed the Anglican Church of Canada was doctrinally orthodox.

It connects the two Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and L√ºbeck, and is part of the line to Denmark. The line was opened in 1865. Route The line runs the south-west from L√ºbeck through mostly agricultural, undulating land. The Trave river is crossed three times. The most important intermediate stop is Bad Oldesloe, where the line connects with hourly services on the line to Bad Segeberg and Neum√ºnster, operated by Nordbahn. Between Ahrensburg and Hamburg-Rahlstedt the line runs along the Stellmoor tunnel valley. In the city of Hamburg the line crosses the rail freight bypass and then runs parallel to the S-Bahn line until Hamburg Hauptbahnhof is reached from the east. History  The first plans to build a direct rail link between Hamburg and L√ºbeck were put forward in 1831. Because of the refusal of the Danish authorities to allow a direct line to be built through Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt, which was ruled by the King of Denmark, the L√ºbeck‚ÄìB√ºchen line was built by the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company (L√ºbeck-B√ºchener Eisenbahn, LBE). This provided a connection between L√ºbeck and the Berlin-Hamburg railway, but meant that trains to Hamburg had to take the route via B√ºchen. This was approximately 32 km longer that the direct line, which was only opened by the LBE on 1 August 1865. In 1875/76 the track was duplicated. In 1963, the L√ºbeck‚ÄìPuttgarden and R√∏dby Havn‚ÄìCopenhagen lines were completed as part of the Vogelfluglinie (literally: bird flight line) to Copenhagen. This increased the range of long distance trains between L√ºbeck and Hamburg. In addition to the trains to Copenhagen there were Interzone trains (trains between East and West Germany) to Rostock. Express trains, the Merkur Trans Europ Express and Trans-Europ-Express-Marchandises freight trains were hauled to Puttgarden by the class DB-221 diesel locomotives. In the 1960s and 1970s express trains in push-pull operations were hauled by class DB-220 diesel locomotives. The Travem√ºnde‚ÄìL√ºbeck and the L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg lines were electrified in 2008. Electric operation began from the timetable change in December 2008. Since that time, Intercity-Express trains have also operated between Munich, Hamburg and L√ºbeck. Operations  IC3 of the DSB in Hamburg Hauptbahnhof L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg Regional-Express in Bad Oldesloe station The construction of the Great Belt Bridge between Funen and Zealand significantly reduced long-distance rail traffic on the Hamburg‚ÄìL√ºbeck‚ÄìCopenhagen route. Since December 2007 Deutsche Bahn ICE TD and DSB IC3 trains have operated on the route. Between L√ºbeck and Hamburg Regional-Express trains run every twice an hour from morning to evening from Monday to Friday and hourly on weekends. This section has the greatest number of train passengers in Schleswig- Holstein. The Regional-Express trains stop only in Reinfeld, Bad Oldesloe and at times in Ahrensburg. Regionalbahn trains operate on the Hamburg‚ÄìBad Oldesloe section, stopping at all stations. They are almost always composed of double-decker coaches. They are propelled in push-pull mode by electric locomotives, either class 112 or 143. Ahrensburg-Gartenholz halt was built between Ahrensburg and Bargteheide in 2009. It opened in 2010. The opening was delayed because the station had to be modified. Although international trains never stop there, they do pass through, so the station has to comply with international standards. Future  The level crossing in Marienthal will be replaced by an underpass. Starting in 2017, the Hamburg‚ÄìBad Oldesloe section will be upgraded for S-Bahn operations with new stations at Claudiusstra√üe, Bovestra√üe, Holstenhofweg and Pulverhof. By 2018, the railway crossing at the Hammer Stra√üe in Marienthal will be replaced by an underpass, which is seen as a prerequisite for the expansion of the S-Bahn.

Gameplay The game is set during the Fourth Crusade and stars two crusaders. The player controls Denz de Bayle. He is joined by a partner, the Spanish mercenary Esteban Noviembre, who can either be controlled by AI or by a second player via online or local co-op. The game allows for various cooperative moves, such as grapple executions, team healing, and level progression. The player controls their character in a third-person perspective, and can rotate the camera 360 degrees, for a full view of their surroundings. The game takes place in a linear adventure across Europe, including locations such as France, Croatia, Constantinople, and Syria. During the game, the player can pick up and wield up to four weapons, including swords, maces, axes, shields, and spears. All of the weapons will break, forcing the player to either conserve their weapons, or find more. The characters have an ability to use the 'Curse.' An ability that lets them walk between the divide of Earth and Hell, giving them supernatural powers. The curse will grant the player stronger moves, faster movement speed, and an ability to see collectibles previously hidden. The curse will drain their meter as long as it is in use, and eventually, will kill the player. Story The Cursed Crusade follows the story of the cursed crusader Denz de Bayle, a talented swordsman who has never let fear best him in a fight. He searches for his father, who never returned from Syria during the Third Crusade. Once he finds his father, he believes that he will be able to reclaim his family castle from his treacherous uncle and also remove the curse.

Motorhome stopovers are usually operated by local authorities. These vehicles can stay overnight or longer depending on terms and conditions specified on a sign by each locality. Parking is in accordance with local building codes and road traffic law. There are three main purposes of these stopping places: providing a place for a short-term overnight stay without paperwork involved or restrictions of checking-in and checking-out time constraints imposed by formal campsites, allowing for travellers who prefer to move frequently from one place to the next during a short period of vacation and allowing parking places that are generally within walking distance to tourist sights. These stopovers differ from campsites in that they are usually intended for a very short-term usage‚Äîusually one or two days‚Äîthus they provide very limited space for parking and limited facilities or at times no service at all. Some stopovers may provides services like campsites but these places generally will not provide much space around the vehicles as most campsites do. In most cases these places are usually located at the center of or at the edge of a town or a village and are convenient for visiting such places and generally do not have a management facility like a campsite. In addition, the majority of these place are free of charge, in particular those that belong to smaller localities. Where fees are applied, they are usually very nominal. Motorhome stopovers are a very popular mean of travelling in Germany, France and Italy but are gradually gaining more popularity in Spain and some other countries in Europe. A formal motorhome stopover in Europe is usually indicated by a sign post. Locations of these stopovers vary depending on the locality. Some stopovers are part of a town's public parking, a part of the town sports facility, or next to a church‚Äîsome with designated parking bays and some without. Others are specifically created for such purposes. Countries like Germany permit the staying in a vehicle as long as the driver can resume driving when necessary.Ulrich D√§hn: Wohnmobilrecht.de, Kapitel: Das √úbernachten im Wohnmobil auf deutschen Stra√üen , retrieved 7 September 2010 This rule applies to motorhome parking in public places as well.

He was elected mayor of the city six times serving from 1991 to 2003, when he resigned after being convicted on federal felony corruption charges. Ganim was released after serving six years in a Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix. In 2015, Ganim mounted a successful political comeback after being elected Bridgeport mayor again.Associated Press, Ganim Sworn In As Bridgeport Mayor Five Years After Getting Out of Prison (December 1, 2015).Kristin Hussey, Joseph Ganim, Disgraced Ex-Mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., Wins Back Job, New York Times (November 3, 2015). Ganim was sworn in as mayor on December 1, 2015. Ganim has twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Connecticut, running in 1994 and 2018. On February 2, 2019, the FBI delivered a subpoena to Ganim's administration, revealing a federal Grand Jury and the DOJ were probing his administration for possible municipal corruption. On June 28, 2020, it was revealed Ganim's administration spent more than $500,000 handling the criminal probe into Bridgeport which included hiring private lawyers for Ganim. Accordingly, this marks the second time the Federal Government of the United States has probed Ganim's acts as mayor for possible corruption (the first resulting in his incarceration and disbarment). Early life and education Ganim was born to George W. Ganim Sr. and Josephine Ganim of Easton, Connecticut.Weddings: Joseph Ganim and Jennifer White, New York Times (May 23, 1993). Ganim's father was a prominent Bridgeport attorney and Republican Party loyalist who was a lieutenant of local Republican boss Ed Sandula.Sullivan, p. 97. Ganim, on the other hand, became a Democrat. Ganim graduated from the University of Connecticut and received a law degree from the University of Bridgeport Law School (which later became Quinnipiac University School of Law). Early political career In 1988, a young Ganim made his first run for office against Lee Samowitz in the 129th House District, a Connecticut House district in Bridgeport.Sullivan, p. 97. Ganim lost, but only by about 150 votes. First mayoralty (1991‚Äì2003) Ganim was elected the 51st mayor of Bridgeport in 1991, receiving 15,768 votes (54%) and defeating incumbent Mayor Mary C. Moran, who received 10,951 votes, and two minor party candidates, who got a combined total of 2,258 additional votes.Kirk Johnson, New Mayor in Bridgeport Faces the Same Old Problems, New York Times (November 7, 1991). During his campaign, Ganim accused Moran of making the city \\"a symbol of urban failure with a bankruptcy filing that drew national headlines.\\" Ganim was subsequently reelected four times, serving five terms.Joseph De Avila, Ganim, Former Bridgeport Mayor Who Served Prison Time, Wins Primary, Wall Street Journal (September 17, 2015).

The state board had ordered the city to raise its property taxes by 18 percent to close a $16 million budget shortfall for the 1991-92 fiscal year. Ganim also campaigned on a law and order platform, promising to hire a hundred new city police officers to combat crime. One reason why Ganim was elected was because \\"there were few politicians who wanted the grief of being mayor of Bridgeport for the paltry salary of $52,000 a year, hence there was not a lot of strong opposition with which Ganim had to contend.\\" When Ganim became Bridgeport's fiftieth mayor, he was the youngest person to hold the office in city history.Sullivan, pp. 97-98. As mayor, Ganim began to clean up the city's East End, reducing the area's notorious crime rates, and reclaiming real estate from drug gangs. Under Ganim, the city installed street lights and street signs and planted trees and flowers. In 1992, the city removed a pile of construction debris (labeled \\"Mount Trashmore\\") that had been illegally dumped by a demolition business.'Mount Trashmore' to Be Removed, Associated Press (May 14, 1992). 1994 gubernatorial candidacy In 1994, three years after becoming mayor, Ganim ran for the Democratic nomination for governor of Connecticut. Ganim withdrew from the race in July 1994, less than a week before the Connecticut Democratic convention, after lagging in the polls, and endorsed John B. Larson, the State Senate president pro tem and the front-runner for the party's nomination.Michele Jacklin, Ganim's New Gubernatorial Campaign Ad, Hartford Courant (June 18, 1994).Ganim Is Leaving Race for Governor, New York Times (July 8, 1994).Craig W. Baggott & Michele Jacklin, Ganim Drops Out of Race For Governor, Backs Larson, Hartford Courant (July 8, 1994). =Subsequent terms (second, third, fourth, fifth)= In 1997, Ganim defeated Republican challenger Joan K. Magnuson by a huge margin.Sullivan, p. 107. In that election, Ganim's appearances on taxpayer-funded commercials \\"boosting his city's image\\" were criticized by his opponents, who believed that the commercials were tools for re-election.Peggy McCarthy, When All Politics Is Truly Local, New York Times (November 2, 1997). Under Ganim, the City of Bridgeport joined a number of U.S. cities (others included New Orleans, Miami, and Chicago) to file legal actions against the handgun industry, arguing that they were liable for product liability negligence in failing to use technology to make their products safer, leading to handgun violence.Fred Musante, After Tobacco, Handgun Lawsuits, New York Times (January 31, 1999).Bruce Shapiro, Going for the Gunmakers, The Nation (February 4, 1999).David Segal, Blaming Bullets for Urban Blight, Conn. Mayor to Sue Gunmakers, Washington Post (January 27, 1999). Such suits were inspired by successful litigation against the tobacco industry. The City of Bridgeport's suit was filed in Connecticut Superior Court in January 1999; it named Smith & Wesson, 11 other U.S. firearms manufacturers, three handgun trade associations, and a dozen gun dealers in southwestern Connecticut as defendants. Ganim said that the city's action aimed at \\"creating law with litigation...That's the route that we're going because [the industry has] always very effectively, with big money, lobbied the legislature and kept laws from being passed.\\" The city sought $100 million in damages for the cost of human life lost and the public cost of treating shooting victims; Ganim said that the city would agree to a settlement, \\"if the companies will agree to improve the design of their handguns to prevent their misuse.\\" The suit was unsuccessful: the court dismissed for lack of standing in December 1999,John Springer, Makers of Guns Prevail in Court: Dismissal of Bridgeport's Suit Hurts Cases Nationwide, Hartford Courant (December 11, 1999). and the dismissal was unanimously upheld by the state supreme court in 2001.Ganim v. Smith and Wesson Corp., 1258 Conn. 313, 780 A.2d 98 (2001).Lynne Tuohy, Court Disarms Gun Lawsuit, Hartford Courant (October 2, 2001). In 1999, Ganim was one of three American mayors to receive the City Livability Program Award from the United States Conference of Mayors.Kathy Amoroso, 1999 City Livability Program Award Winners Announced at Annual Conference of Mayors in New Orleans , 67th Annual Conference of Mayors. The award was conferred for Ganim's \\"Clean and Green program,\\" which addressed urban decay and blight through a beautification campaign which saw the demolition of more than five buildings and the development of twelve new city parks. A cornerstone of the city's redevelopment efforts was the construction of a new baseball park (The Ballpark at Harbor Yard) for a minor league baseball team, the building of a new arena (Webster Bank Arena), and the redevelopment of industrial land on the city's waterfront.Joseph De Avila, Felon Ex-Mayor Seeks Old Job in Bridgeport, Wall Street Journal (May 14, 2015). Ganim's term also saw the competition of demolition of Father Panik Village--a housing project notorious for drugs and violent crime; the final fifteen buildings were razed in 1993.Sullivan, p. 100. Ganim also benefited personally, however, by collecting kickbacks from developers, eventually leading to his prosecution (see below). Conviction on corruption charges On March 19, 2003, Ganim was convicted of 16 federal counts: one count each of racketeering, extortion, racketeering conspiracy, and bribery; two counts of bribery conspiracy; eight counts of mail fraud, and two counts of filing a false tax return.Editorial: Court Right to Deny Law License to Ganim: State Supreme Court squashes former mayor's effort to get license back, Hartford Courant (April 9, 2014).Paul von Zielbauer, Bridgeport Mayor Convicted On 16 Charges of Corruption, New York Times (March 20, 2003). Ganim was acquitted on six other counts. Ganim surrendered his law license upon conviction. The charges arose from Ganim's \\"role in a six-year scheme to shake down city contractors for more than $500,000 in cash, meals, clothing, wine and home renovations.\\" In April 2003, two weeks after being convicted, Ganim resigned from office.John Christoffersen, Ganim resigns as Bridgeport mayor following his conviction, Associated Press (April 2, 2003). He was replaced by councilman John M. Fabrizi. Ganim faced a possible sentence of up to 126 years, $500,000 in restitution, and $4 million in fines. Federal prosecutors asked for a sentence of ten years and one month, while the defense asked for a sentence of no more than three years and ten months.Paul von Zielbauer, Federal Judge Sentences Former Mayor of Bridgeport to 9 Years in Corruption Case, New York Times (March 20, 2003). Testimonials seeking leniency were filed with the court on Ganim's behalf, including one from Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York. On July 1, 2003, U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton sentenced Ganim to nine years in prison and about $300,000 in fines and restitution, in addition to $175,000 that he had previously stipulated that he owed. Judge Arterton said that Ganim's crimes were \\"stuff that cynicism is made of\\" and determined by clear and convincing evidence that Ganim had \\"lied to the jury when he denied any knowledge of fee-splitting deals and other incriminating evidence.\\" Ganim appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Ganim's convictions in December 2007.United States of America v. Joseph P. Ganim, 510 F.3d 134 (2nd Cir. 2007). =Federal prison sentence= Ganim surrendered in September 2003 and served most of his sentence at FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey.Metro Briefing: Connecticut: Bridgeport: Ganim to Serve Time at Fort Dix, New York Times (July 18, 2003).Associated Press, Ganim moved to federal prison in Pa. (February 11, 2009). He unsuccessfully petitioned for a transfer to FCI Otisville in New York, in order to be with his family.Ganim v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 235 F. App'x 882 (3d Cir. 2007). In 2009, Ganim was transferred to the FCI McKean prison camp in Pennsylvania. Ganim then served the last seven months of his sentence at a halfway house in Hartford.Associated Press, Ex-Bridgeport Mayor Ganim freed from prison (July 19, 2010). Ganim's sentence was reduced by a year for participating in a drug-treatment program. Release and return to Bridgeport In July 2010, Ganim was released after serving seven years in prison. After his release, Ganim worked as a legal assistant at his family's law firm in Bridgeport.Daniel Tepfer, Court: Ganim still can't practice law, Connecticut Post (April 9, 2014). Ganim and his brother George Ganim Jr. also opened a consulting service, Federal Prison Consultant LLC, which offered other white-collar convicts advice on surviving federal prison terms.Michael P. Mayko & Daniel Tepfer, Ganim looks to help inmates, Connecticut Post (October 26, 2010). Ganim also sought restoration of his license to practice law. In 2012, a five-member panel of the State of Connecticut Grievance Committee recommended that Ganim's license be restored.Daniel Tepfer, Ganim gets backing in quest for law license, Connecticut Post (March 5, 2012). In September 2012, a three-judge panel of Connecticut Superior Court judges rejected the recommendation, writing that: \\"Allowing an applicant to be readmitted to the practice of law following a conviction on 16 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion, mail fraud, bribery and filing false income tax returns without any apology, expression of remorse, or explanation, and with only a vague acceptance of an unspecified event, simply would set the bar for readmission too low in the state, and we are unwilling to do that.\\"Daniel Tepfer, Ganim denied law license, Connecticut Post (September 27, 2012). Ganim appealed to the Connecticut Supreme Court in 2014, which unanimously ruled against his effort to have his law license restored. In 2017, Ganim applied to the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut for permission to practice in that federal court without being readmitted to the Connecticut bar; these efforts were rebuffed by the court.Edmund H. Mahony, Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim Rebuffed Again On Law License, Hartford Courant (December 4, 2017). Second mayoralty (2015-present) =2015 mayoral campaign= On January 1, 2015, Ganim offered a public apology to the City of Bridgeport for his corruption scandal, saying: \\"I'm truly sorry.\\"Edmund H. Mahony, Joe Ganim: Is He Back?, Hartford Courant (January 25, 2015). The apology--as well as visits to churches in city's mainly African- American east side, a former stronghold for Ganim during his days as mayor-- fueled speculation about a return to politics for Ganim. In March 2015, Ganim moved back to Bridgeport from Easton, where he had been living.Ken Dixon & Brian Lockhart, Ganim wins in landslide, Connecticut Post (November 4, 2015). In May 2015, Ganim officially entered the race for mayor, filing paperwork to challenge incumbent Democrat Bill Finch as mayor of Bridgeport.Jim Shay, Ganim says, officially, he's running for Bridgeport mayor, Connecticut News (May 6, 2015). Ganim won the endorsement of the Bridgeport police union.Brian Lockhart, Ganim gets police union's official support, Connecticut Post (July 2, 2015). Ganim also won the key support of local clergy and the Democratic machine led by Democratic Town Committee Chairman Mario Testa.Brian Lockhart, Ganim stays one step ahead, Connecticut Post (September 27, 2015). In September 2015, twelve years after his conviction, Ganim won the Democratic primary, making \\"a big step toward completing an improbable political comeback.\\" Ganim defeated two primary opponents: Finch, the incumbent mayor, and University of Bridgeport vice president Mary-Jane Foster, co-founder of the Bridgeport Bluefish minor-league baseball team.Diane Orson, Why Bridgeport's Mayoral Race is Closer Than You'd Think, WNPR (September 15, 2015). Ganim received 6,264 votes, Finch 5,859, and Foster 1,177.Bridgeport primary election returns, Connecticut Post (September 17, 2015). In the days after the primary election, Finch sought to run in the general election under the \\"Job Creation Party\\" ballot line, while Foster announced she would not seek to appear on the general-election ballot as a petitioning candidate.Mark Pazniokas, Mayor Bill Finch Off Bridgeport Ballot; Re-Election Options Slim, Hartford Courant (September 21, 2015). However, Finch's campaign missed a filing deadline, and he dropped out of the race; Foster jumped back into the race, receiving Finch's endorsement.Ray Hardman & Ryan Caron King, Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch Drops Out of Mayoral Race, Endorses Mary-Jane Foster, WNPR (September 29, 2015). During his campaign, Ganim promised to reduce taxes, lower crime by adding more police officers, and lower unemployment, which is high in Bridgeport. He managed to persuade Edward Adams, a former FBI agent who helped convict Ganim on corruption charges, to support his campaign. However, Michael Wolf, the FBI special agent-in-charge of Connecticut during the Ganim investigation, fired back with a letter published in the Connecticut Post saying that Adams was not the lead investigator in the Ganim case, and writing that \\"a mayor who swindled a city he was entrusted to govern, should not be given the opportunity to do it again.\\"Dave Collins, Ex-FBI Agents in a War of Words Over Ganim Mayoral Campaign in Bridgeport, Associated Press (October 29, 2015). Wolf called Ganim the \\"poster boy\\" of corrupt Connecticut politicians, a group that included former Governor John G. Rowland, former state Treasurer Paul J. Silvester, and former Bridgeport state Senator Ernest Newton II. On November 3, 2015, Ganim won election as mayor by a wide margin, defeating Mary Jane Foster (a Democrat running as an unaffiliated candidate) and Republican nominee Enrique Torres, a city councilman.Associated Press, Former Bridgeport Mayor, Out of Prison, Declares Victory in Primary (September 17, 2015).Ex-convict declares victory in Bridgeport mayor's race, WTNH (November 3, 2015).Rob Polansky, et al.

The New York Times reported Ganim's election victory as \\"a stunning return to public office ... remarkable for its sheer audacity, coming after a widely publicized fall from grace.\\" =Sixth term= Ganim was sworn in on December 1, 2015. 2018 gubernatorial candidacy In 2017, Ganim filed paperwork creating an exploratory committee to run for governor of Connecticut in 2018. Ganim requested public campaign financing, which in Connecticut is available to qualified candidates. In April 2017, however, the Connecticut Elections Enforcement Commission denied his request due to a state law denying public funding to candidates convicted of \\"felonies related to public office.\\"Rick Rojas & Kristin Hussey, A Disgraced and Re- elected Connecticut Mayor Eyes the Statehouse, New York Times (May 17, 2017).Edmund H. Mahony, Judge Deals Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim A Setback, Rejects His Effort To Obtain Public Campaign Financing, Hartford Courant (November 29, 2017). Ganim challenged the denial in federal court on constitutional grounds, but the U.S. District Court dismissed his suit in November 2017. In his campaign against Ned Lamont for the nomination, Ganim unsuccessfully ran as \\"feisty, in-your-face campaign, which he tried to frame as a city-versus-suburban class struggle.\\"Ken Dixon, State Democrats choose Lamont, CT Post (August 15, 2018).

Second Corruption Investigation By The FBI  On February 2, 2019, the FBI served a subpoena to Ganim's administration, which was obtained by the Connecticut Post. The subpoena revealed a federal Grand Jury in New Haven, Connecticut was investigating his administration for possible municipal corruption. On June 28, 2020, The Washington Times further noted that Ganim's administration spent more than $500,000 handling the criminal probe into Bridgeport which included hiring private lawyers for multiple government officials including Ganim. Many journalists have noted similarities between this investigation and the FBI's criminal investigation into Ganim's actions as mayor in 2003. Personal life In 1993, Ganim (then the 33-year-old mayor of Bridgeport) married Ellen Jennifer White, known as Jennifer. The couple wed at the St. Augustine Cathedral in Bridgeport in a ceremony performed by Bishop Edward M. Egan (later cardinal) of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport. They have three children.Daniel Tepfer & Brian Lockhart, Joe Ganim pleads for lower alimony payments (February 26, 2015). Ganim's wife had stood by him through his trial and years in prison. In 2014, the couple divorced. In 2015, a Connecticut Superior Court judge agreed to Ganim's request for a reduction in Ganim's alimony payments, he sought on the basis of his low income and lack of business in his consulting job.

Headquartered in Marcoussis, just south of Paris, the company has satellite operations in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, as well as a global Rental Network of production companies deploying and cross-renting its products. The company is also known for providing music festivals with its loud, powerful sounding speakers. History In September 1984, Dr. Christian Heil, a physicist in the field of elementary particles with a passion for sound, created an electro-acoustic engineering firm named C.HEIL.TEA, later to be renamed L-Acoustics. In 1989, the company launched its MTD115, a high-performance coaxial loudspeaker for sound reinforcement use. In 1992, Heil and his team pioneered the field of modern line source array loudspeakers with their V-DOSC system, which benefitted from L-Acoustics‚Äô new Wavefront Sculpture Technology (WST) theory.Sound Field Radiated By Arrayed Multiple Sound Sources, AES Convention Paper #3269. Article presented at the 92nd AES Convention, Vienna 1992 Based on principles developed by Heil and fellow physics colleague Professor Marcel Urban, WST defined five criteria for design and use of true line source arrays. At the heart of WST is the internationally-patented DOSC waveguide, which was the first high-frequency device capable of creating a rectangular, constant-phase planar output.Wavefront Sculpture Technology, AES Journal, October 2003 In combination with WST, coplanar symmetry - the equivalent of coaxial assembly for HF, MF and LF drivers in vertical arrays - provides a coherent wavefront over the entire horizontal coverage at all frequencies. This behaves as if the sound was radiated by a single, continuous and articulated ribbon, and allows a highly coherent sonic signature in long throw applications, beyond the limits of previously traditional clustered systems. Although Heil did not invent the underlying theory of the line array, his research and design work that ultimately resulted in the V-DOSC system altered the landscape of loudspeaker design.The Birth of the Array: Part 03, Filter 06, July 2005 http://gtaust.com/filter/06/08.shtml Today, nearly every professional audio loudspeaker manufacturer has adopted the line array model for their premier touring systems, and Heil is generally recognized as the \\"father of the modern line array.\\"Interview: Christian Heil, Founder of L-Acoustics, France - The Father of Modern Line Array Speaker Systems, Audio Pro International, November 2004 http://www.garycooper.biz/articles/interviews0411-1.html Over the years, L-Acoustics has gone on to introduce other products, including the ARCS Constant Curvature Array (1995), dV-DOSC modular line source (1999), Kudo with K-Louver variable directivity (2005), P Series self-powered coaxials (2006), SB28 subwoofer with laminar vents and LA4 and LA8 amplified controllers (2007).

He sat in the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for the borough of Shrewsbury for most of the period from 1826 until his death in 1862.  Early life  Slaney was the eldest son of Robert Slaney (1764‚Äì1834) of Hatton Grange, Shropshire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Mason of Shrewsbury. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the bar in 1817 at Lincoln's Inn.  Career  He was first elected at the 1826 general election, and was re-elected at the next three general elections, until his defeat at the 1835 general election by the Conservative Party candidate John Cressett-Pelham. He was re-elected in 1837, but did not stand in 1841, when the seat was won by Benjamin Disraeli. He won the seat again in 1847, but did not stand in 1852. He was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1854. Slaney was returned again at the 1857 general election, re-elected in 1859, and held the seat until his death, aged 70. Among other achievements, Slaney was instrumental in setting up the Select Committee on Public Health of 1840, which paved the way for the later Board of Health;E Hal√©vy, Victorian Years (1961) p. 176 and in fostering the Industrial and Provident Societies Partnership Act 1852, sometimes known as Slaney's Act.C Raven, Christian Socialism, 1848-1854 (1968) p. 289 Attending the opening of the London International Exhibition on 1 May 1862, he fell through a gap in a platform floor and injured his right leg, despite which he continued to view the exhibition and attended Parliament up until the 8th. He died, at his London house in Mayfair, from gangrene (then reported as 'mortification') that set in.  Family  His residence was listed in 1857 as Walford Manor, Shropshire. Slaney had three daughters, amongst whom his estate was shared. The youngest, Frances Catherine, married William Kenyon, who as a condition of Slaney's will took the additional surname of Slaney. The eldest, Elizabeth Frances (died c. 1870), married the naturalist Thomas Campbell Eyton, a Deputy Lieutenant of Shropshire.

Louis Dufresne was one of the naturalists on board the Astrolabe, which accompanied by the Boussole, left Brest in August 1785 on a voyage of discovery. The ships went first to Madeira and Tenerife, then to Trinidad and then to the coast of Brazil (including Santa Catarina Island). Rounding Cape Horn the expedition landed at Concepci√≥n and on to the Sandwich Islands and then sailed north along the coast of north- west America to Alaska. In 1786, the expedition resumed this time visiting Monterey before crossing the Pacific to land in Macao in China. In 1787 the boats returned to France. Six years later in 1793, Dufresne became a taxidermist and curator at Museum d'Histoire Naturelle. His work included the classification and arrangement of collections of invertebrates as well as vertebrates and he visited many parts of the world on behalf of the Museum. In 1802 he popularized the use of arsenical soap for preserving birds in an article in Nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle a technique which had enabled the Mus√©um to build the greatest collection of birds in the world. Dufresne also maintained a private collection which by 1818 consisted of 1,600 bird specimens (on wooden supports and with both with Latin and French names), 800 world eggs, 4,000 shells, fossils, amphibians, corals and 12,000 insects. This collection purchased for the University of Edinburgh in 1819. In 1854 the University transferred the Natural History Museum into the government ownership to form a publicly-funded national museum, which became the Royal Scottish Museum (now part of National Museums Scotland). In 1829 Dufresne was awarded the Legion of Honour. He died of lung disease.

Therefore, according to the oriental traditional medical practice, we will take advantage of our forefather experiences\\" he said. * During the years of study and research in Poland during protect doctoral thesis time, he has found the enzyme alkaline fosfataza on intestinal mucosa of experimental animals. From there, he opened to research some other enzymes in metabolic cycle gluxit to render a comprehensive picture of metabolic changes of the animal environment. After three years, his work has been completed. His thesis was rated excellently by the professors in the Scientific Council, agreed for him to transfer immediately to doctor of science thesis. This is a rare case is almost unprecedented for a foreign graduate student then as prescribed by your country, from doctor to make the transition doctor of science cost at least 10‚Äì15 years. * In June, 1976, he returned to Poland, with Professor Kaviac studied of experimental cancer - malignant cell line nodes in mice. Starting from here, he went deeply into the research field of cancer cell membrane. During four years working hard in the laboratory, his best friends were the electronic microscope and a wealth of laboratory chemicals. He has published dozens of articles for research on cancer cell membranes in English on the scientific subjected journals of Germany, Japan, and Poland. A particularly major mark in this time was that he discovered Calmodulin molecules containing calcium ions deposited on the membrane of cancer cells named L-1210. As announcing this discovery, he immediately received many invitations to work together with the \\"dream\\" income level from scientific research institutes of many countries, besides, many scientists around the world sent messages to congratulate him and offered hime to share information on research. Refusing to have good conditions in western countries, he came back to Vietnam with the thought that bringing his knowledge when studying overseas is to devote to Vietnam. Professor Deputy Director of the Nenxiki Institute - Poland asked him to write a thesis over 200 pages thick dissertations written in English for the Institute's archives, and to protect doctor of science thesis, he just summarized his dissertation into an article about five pages long, printed in a prestigious professional newspaper. However, not succumbed to the notion that it fails to help patients recover the diseases completely because of its only cancer treatment medicine after operation, he was involved in insight to find out the new medical products that can cure the cancer. This product has the name Etamin or AK-96, after many indefatigable studying years, this product that takes effect to destroy the cancer cell and prevent the blood vessel from feeding the tumor by injecting in it has come into existence. After injecting in the mouse malignant tumor for a period of 10 up to 2 weeks, it has disappeared. When the test has been carried out later, the tumor has become normal and no longer had the cancer cell. * He is not only spends his whole life in searching to save the life of the cancer patients but also the HIV and drug sufferers make him worry.Vietnamese researcher claims promising results for herbal AIDS drug From 1986 to 2006, after carrying out thousands of tests on the chicken, he and his colleagues found the Daisvan active agent that had the role to enhance the immunity and the experiment on the clinical test on 109 patients acquired the positive results.

Development of Gosu began in 2002 internally for Guidewire Software, and the language saw its first community release in 2010 under the Apache 2 license. Gosu can serve as a scripting language, having free-form Program types (.gsp files) for scripting as well as statically verified Template files (.gst files). Gosu can optionally execute these and all other types directly from source without precompilation, which also distinguishes it from other static languages. In March 2018, active development of Gosu inside Guidewire ceased. History Gosu began in 2002 as a scripting language called GScript at Guidewire Software. It was used to configure business logic in Guidewire's applications and was more of a simple rule definition language. In its original incarnation it followed ECMAScript guidelines. Guidewire enhanced the scripting language over the next 8 years, and released Gosu 0.7 beta to the community in November 2010. The 0.8 beta was released in December 2010, and 0.8.6 beta was released in mid-2011 with additional typeloaders, making Gosu capable of loading XML schema definition files and XML documents as native Gosu types. The latest version is 1.10, released in January 2016, along with a new IntelliJ IDEA editor plugin. Philosophy Gosu language creator and development lead, Scott McKinney, emphasizes pragmatism, found in readability and discoverability, as the overriding principle that guides the language's design. For instance, Gosu's rich static type system is a necessary ingredient toward best of breed tooling via static programming analysis, rich parser feedback, code completion, deterministic refactoring, usage analysis, navigation, and the like. Syntax and semantics Gosu follows a syntax resembling a combination of other languages. For instance, declarations follow more along the lines of Pascal with name-first grammar. Gosu classes can have functions, fields, properties, and inner classes as members. Nominal inheritance and composition via delegation are built into the type system as well as structural typing similar to the Go programming language. Gosu supports several file types: * Class (.gs files) * Program (.gsp files) * Enhancement (*.gsx files) * Template (*.gst files) In addition to standard class types Gosu supports enums, interfaces, structures, and annotations. Program files facilitate Gosu as a scripting language. For example, Gosu's Hello, World! is a simple one-line program: print(\\"Hello, World!\\") Gosu classes are also executable a la Java: class Main { static function main(args: String[]) { print(\\"Hello, World!\\") } } =Data types= A unique feature of Gosu is its Open Type System, which allows the language to be easily extended to provide compile-time checking and IDE awareness of information that is typically checked only at runtime in most other languages. Enhancements let you add additional functions and properties to other types, including built-in Java types such as String, List, etc. This example demonstrates adding a print() function to java.lang.String. enhancement MyStringEnhancement : String { function print() { print(this) } } Now you can tell a String to print itself: \\"Echo\\".print() The combination of closures and enhancements provide a powerful way of coding with Collections. The overhead of Java streams is unnecessary with Gosu: var list = {1, 2, 3} var result = list.where(\\\\ elem -> elem >= 2) print(result) Uses This general-purpose programming language is used primarily in Guidewire Software's commercial products.

He is known for his involvement in drafting the first Eurocode as a leading member of European regulatory bodies, and was a prominent academic involved in structural engineering research. Palazzo a Vela, Turin (with Annibale Rigotti). Photo by Paolo Monti, 1961. Education Levi received his degree in Engineering from the Ecole Centrale in Paris and from the Polytechnic University of Turin in the years 1936 and 1937. Already assistant to Professor Gustavo Colonnetti in Turin, in 1938 he had to go into exile to France and later on to Switzerland due to the anti-Semitic laws. Career = Research in Turin = Back in Italy in 1945, he was able to resume his research at the Polytechnic University of Turin. This work was covering the most recent topics of structural mechanics and engineering, and he published papers and books on the theory of states of coaction, on plastic theory, and on the time-dependent behaviour of concrete structures, with particular regard to creep effects. He designed the Torino Palavela. His attention was attracted by the need of a quick transfer of scientific advancement to the practical design and construction of structures. The opportunity for that action was the development of the new technique of pre-stressed concrete, in which he was scientifically involved since 1938, during his first research period. After the war, since 1945 to 1961, as Director of the CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (Italian National Research Council) in Turin, Franco Levi had an essential role in the international discussion on the theoretical and practical aspects of this innovative technique and on the establishment of design rules to be internationally agreed. Panoramic view of Expo 61 with Palazzo a Vela in 1961, photographed by Paolo Monti. = Material innovation= The innovation of prestressed concrete, together with the new approaches of plastic design and of probabilistic safety criteria induced the most advanced specialists of structural design and analysis to install in 1953 a new committee (Comit√© Europ√©en du B√©ton ‚Äì CEB) having the objective of a coordination and synthesis of research and of the creation and international harmonization of the principles and rules for the conception, calculation, construction, and maintenance of concrete structures according to the new approaches. = Involvement in European scientific organisations = Franco Levi was appointed President of CEB from 1957 and maintained this position until 1968, leading this organization to the publication of the first and the second set of CEB Recommendations. Between 1966 and 1970 he was also President of the ‚ÄùF√©d√©ration Internationale de la Pr√©contrainte ‚Äì FIP‚Äù, which had the role of promoting the innovative technique in the practical field. In 1979 the European Community considered the work of CEB ripe to become the basis for the first Eurocode; Franco Levi was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee for Eurocode 2 (Concrete Structures). Eurocode 2 was printed by CEC in the famous Luxemburg edition 1988, together with EC1, EC3, EC6, EC8. Franco Levi had an essential role in the coordination of the drafting of such 5 Eurocodes based on the same criteria of the ‚ÄúLimit States‚Äù and on what was called the ‚ÄúSemiprobabilistic approach‚Äù. This format still remains the format of the subsequent set of Eurocodes issued by CEN TC 250 (Structural Eurocodes). In the same time he was Professor of Structural Analysis at the University of Venice and at the Polytechnic University of Turin and Director of the Department of Structural Engineering and Soil Mechanics until 1989, when he became Emeritus. Recognition In 1986 he became Full Member of the Academy of Sciences of Turin. He received honours from the Universities of Li√®ge, Waterloo, Venice, the American Concrete Institute, AICAP, and the Trasenster, Freyssinet, M√∂rsch, Caquot, Torroja Medals, as well as the Golden Medal of the Italian Government.

Voter turnout in the election was 56.7%.Dieter Nohlen, Michael Krennerich & Bernhard Thibaut (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p93 Background On 10 December 1969 President √âmile Derlin Zinsou was overthrown by Maurice Kouand√©t√©, who had installed him as president in 1968. However, the military refused to recognise Kouand√©t√©. As the two men could not reach agreement, a Military Directorate was established with Paul-√âmile de Souza as its chairman.. Elections were organised to determine the true president. Campaign The three candidates were allowed to campaign, and they did not miss the chance. Intimidation and bribery were commonplace, and the electoral campaign saw the return of regional loyalties.. It was also marked by a series of violent outbursts; invalidated reports state that six people were killed or wounded at incidents in Parakou on the eve of the elections. Fellow candidate Zinsou asserted that Maga supporters had killed one of his supporters during said incidents.. Results The accusations made against him did not affect Maga's standing in the polls; he received a majority of the vote in the north, and Apithy and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin received a majority in the southeast and southwest/central, respectively. The election results showed a victory for Maga with 252,551 votes, 200,091 for Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, and 186,332 for Apithy.. In the entire south, Maga received 24,000 votes compared to the 180,000 who voted for him in the Borgou Department, obtaining 97.3 percent of the 78 percent turnout.. Zinsou, running to counter the constant tribal clashes, received 3 percent,. with 17,551 votes. Aftermath Following the election, de Souza decided to nullify the results from Atakora, the region where Maga received the most votes, on 3 April.. Outraged, Maga formed the Assembly of the Peoples of the North, which threatened to secede unless he was declared President.. He refused to leave his campaign headquarters at Parakou even to attend political meetings. Maga's reaction to the nullification prompted many southern workers to flee the north. Apithy stated that he would convince his region to join Nigeria if Maga took the presidency and took steps to bribe his way into that office. Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin claimed Maga had defrauded the electoral system to his advantage. In contrast with the other three former presidents, Zinsou admitted that he had been defeated and decided participate in bargaining,. explaining that he rejected the idea of a coalition \\"for personal reasons\\".. The other former Presidents, on the other hand, agreed to a hasty compromise on 13 April to prevent a civil war. References Bibliography *. *. *. *. *.

The Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba (; , \\"Saint Jerome of Cotalba\\") is a monastic building of Valencian Gothic, Mud√©jar, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical styles constructed between the 14th and 18th centuries, located in the municipal area of Alfauir, (Valencia), Spain, about 8 km. from the well-known city of Gandia.  History  The monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba is one of the most historic monastic constructions in Valencia and located near Alfauir, a village about eight kilometres outside Gandia. It has its origin in X√†bia. In 1374 Pope Gregory XI authorized the foundation of a monastery to the hermit of X√†bia, who belonged to the Hiernymite order. The duke Alfonso of Aragon granted the grounds to the building. The monastery was attacked by pirates in 1387. Therefore, the monks feared to return there. For that reason in 1388 Alfonso of Aragon bought the territories of Cotalba from the Muslims, which were more protected and he donated them to the Hieronmyte monks of X√†bia. They moved to Cotalba and Alfonso of Aragon founded the monastery in 1388. In 1388 Alfonso of Aragon and Foix, Royal Duke of Gandia, constructed a fortress to protect the monastics from attacks by Berber pirates. Tradition claims Saint Vincent Ferrer preached publicly from the monastery. The father, Pere March, and the two wives of the well-known Valencian medieval poet Ausi√†s March are buried in this monastery. In the 16th century the monastery came under the protection of the House of Borgia. The Duchess of Gandia, Maria Enriquez de Luna, widow of the duke Giovanni Borgia and daughter-in-law of the Pope Alexander VI, financed the monastery's enlargement such as the upper cloister of late Gothic style or the medieval cistern of the Orange Tree Patio. Later, also Saint Francis Borgia frequented the monastery and his wife, Leonor de Castro, lady and intimate friend of the Empress Isabella of Portugal, spent her last days in it recovering from her ailments, where she died on March 27, 1546. Spanish Renaissance painter Nicol√°s Borr√°s was so impressed by his stay at the monastery, he asked for membership in the order has his only payment. He was born in Cocentaina (Alicante). He was a pupil of Juan de Juanes. He is one of the best artists of Valencian monastic painting. The Hieronymite monks of Cotalba called him to paint the greater altarpiece of the church. In this way, he entered in the order. The altarpiece consisted in fourteen tables. There was a sculpture of Saint Jerome in the middle. In addition, he made other altarpieces for the chapels of the church and the chapterhouse. Also he produced paintings for different parts of the monastery. He painted four great linens for the stations of the low cloister. However, the only work conserved in its original place was The Saint Supper painted in fresco. It is placed in what nowadays is known as the oil mill, that originally was the dining hall (refectory). He took the habit in 1575, and professed final vows the following year. He passed the rest of his life painting, leaving twelve altarpieces in the church alone, and spent his own money to hire sculptors and builders for the monastery's embellishment. The Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal sold off the religious buildings to pay state debts. The monks left the monastery August 6, 1835. ln 1843, it was acquired by the Tr√©nor family and remains in their bands until today. The Tr√©nor family has owned it since 1843, although it became a military hospital temporarily during the Spanish Civil War. In 1994, the monastery was declared as an item of cultural interest (BIC), and is now being restored. The doors were opened to the public on May 26, 2005. The restoration work has been carried out on the area behind the church's retable and Nicolas Borr√°s painting gallery. Nowadays, most of the monastery is open to visitors.  Architecture  The construction of the monastery began in the 14th century and continued through the 16th century, though its current layout dates from reconstruction in the 17th and 18th centuries. The main facade is overlooked by the main and priory towers. The gothic church has a rectangular ground plan with one aisle and chapels between buttresses, as well as Baroque elements from the 18th-century renovation. The most significant areas on the upper floor are the presbytery and the choir. The bell tower's facade features 17th-century blue and white carvings, and includes the founder's date and name in Valencian. The cloister is arranged in four galleries on two floors encircling a garden. The lower cloister includes arches and vaults in two-coloured Mud√©jar style remniscent of the C√≥rdoba mosque. The sala capitular houses the remains of Prince John and Princess Blanche of Aragon, children of the mediaeval Duke Alfonso the Old. = Sections of the monastery = * The Entry's main door: The main entry of the monastery has a ceramic where Saint Jerome appears writing the Vulgata. At the top, we can see the stone shield of Duke Alfonso of Aragon. There appears the crown, the bars of Aragon's crown, the lis fiower (symbol of the French royalty), the lion and an arm of an eagle with a sword. * The Cotalba village: When we cross the main door, there is a pre-existent Moorish village to the right we can see a tower of square form. It is the oldest construction of the building. The houses, next to the moorish tower, were built two centuries ago. * The Main or bell tower is of rectangular form, whose walls are made with ashlar masomy. The tower is divided in four parts by means of moldings. The bell was in the 1ast floor. It has four pointed arcs that finishes with battlements. The inaugural stone is placed in this tower, it is written with Gothic letters and in old Valencian. * Main fa√ßade: The main front of the monastezy has two towers: The Main tower and the prior's tower. When the church was reformed in the 18th century, a porch was constructed to reinforce the front. The fa√ßade is divided in three floors plus a loft. Two doors stand out. One of them is the main door to go into the monastery. It has a pointed arch and on top of it, is placed the founder's shield. The other door goes into the church and it is located under the porch. It also has a pointed arch, which was cut in the walls by the use of the church as a wine cellar and warehouse. In the fa√ßade we can also see the balconies with bars on the first floor. They were made in the 18th century and they have ornamental tile in the ground. * The church has a rectangular form with a single hall. There are chapels between each buttress. The presbitery is at the head and the choir at the back. The original church was of Valencian Gothic style. In the 18th century the hall was covered with a domed vault, as a baroque style. From the presbitery, there are two accesses to the Transagrario. This one has square form. It is covered by a \\"cupola with lantern\\", with floral decoration of baroque style. The pavement is of Valencian tile from the 17th century. The choir has two floors. In the low part, we find two sections, one of which is surrounded by two reduced arcs. The high choir of rectangular form has a vault with lunetos and shells in the corners. After the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal the pictorial works went to the Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia. The Monstrance went to the Collegiate Basilica of Gandia, the organ to the Pias Schools of the same city, the great bell went to Xeresa and the image of the Virgin of the Health was taken to the church of Rotova. The church became a warehouse. * Cloister: The cloister has four galleries with two floors. The inferior part was built during 14th and 15th centuries. The high galleries were built between 15th and 18th centuries. In the cloister high and low, there are seven vaults with crossed arcs in each gallery, plus another one by each angle. We can see different phases of construction in the superior cloister. The four galleries form a central patio where there is a cistern, which stored the water for use of the monastery. Its construction was ordered by the Duchess of Gandia, Maria Enriquez de Luna, in the 16th century. In the low cloister, the pointed arcs are made with brick and lime mortar, in the manner of mudejars. In this way, the combination of the brick's colour with the target creates a two-colour pattern. The corbels and the keystones are made of stone. There is a spiral staircase in the southeastern angle. Next to it, there is a space with moulding, where one of Friar Nicolas Borras paintings were located. Three other paintings should be located in the other angles of the cloister. The superior South gallery is the oldest of the four. It was raised in the 15th century. In the south side the prioral cell was in the high floor. On the ground floor, the kitchen, the barber's and clother's were located. * Chapterhouse: In the low part of the wing, we find the chapterhouse. Where the monks met to read the chapter. It is of square form with a vault of crossed arcs. It is of the first construction period. At the moment it is the chapel of the Virgin of the Health since it became the chapel for the cult of the proprietary family at the end of the 19th century. For that reason, they installed a neogothic altar, which has a copy of the Virgin of the Health of Rotova's church. There is also a gothic tomb of the Infants Juan and Blanca of Aragon, children of the Duke Alfonso of Aragon. It still preserves the rests of the painting. In the southwestern corner of the room, there is a spiral staircase, which goes up to the high cloister. It was constructed in the 16th century. It is of gothic style, made in p1aster with floral decoration. Tiles of the steps also stand out. * Oil mill: Is next to the chapter house. Originally, this room was divided in three spaces: the infirmary, oratory and the dining hall (refectory). The latter only conserves the distemper of Friar Nicolas Borras that represents The Saint Supper. This room became the oil mill in the 1ast stage of the monastery. For that reason there are large earthen jars that were used to store oil. * The Monstrance is the more remarkable gold work of the monastery. It was made by Friar Antonio Sancho de Benevento in 1548. It measured one meter in height. It was a piece in tower form, with numerous images with great detail. His quality and his technique was comparable to the monstrances of the Toledo Cathedral or the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, being one of the best examples of the Spanish Renaissance gold work. After the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal the mostrance went to the Collegiate Basilica of Gandia. It was exhibited in the Barcelona International Exposition in 1929. It disappeared during the Spanish Civil War. * High cloister: The east superior gallery was built in the 16th century by Maria Enriquez de Luna, Duchess of Gandia. It is made of stone with a gothic style. The arcs are closed by double windows. The north gallery is from the 17th century. There are double windows with columns of d√¥rico capital. The underground store and the wine and oil press were in the low part. The library and the archive were on the upper floor. The dining hall (refectory) was constructed in the west wing at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century. The armoury was next to this room. The superior gallery is of the 18th century. * Romantic gardens: We can access the garden from the square going into an irrigation pool. The Tr√©nor family ordered to make a romantic garden in the style of the Nicolas Forestier made. This garden was made in the west side at the beginning of the 20th century. There are a variety of non-native trees and plants. It has a pool which receives water from a waterfall attached to the aqueduct. This serves to close the garden. *Aqueduct: The aqueduct was constructed to provide the monastery with water in the 15th century. It saved the distance of five km and the topographic unevenness between source of Batlamala and the monastery. The aqueduct is divided in two heights, the inferior made of brick with pointed arches, the superior has the same type of arcs but of a smaller size.  Tour routes and visitor information  The monastery now stands at the start of the Route of the Monasteries of Valencia (GR-236), a religious, cultural and tourist route established in 2008 to connect five monasteries located in central region of the Province of Valencia, (Valencian Community).Source: El Mundo (Spain). The route of the Monasteries is inaugurated.Source: Las Provincias. The route of the Monasteries: El Pas del Pobre. It is also on the Route of the Borgias, a tourist route accessible by automobile. Nowadays, it's possible to visit the majority of the building. The monastery's website includes scheduling information (updated visit schedule).

It is the main hospital in Stafford, England. The hospital is managed by University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust. County Hospital's Accident and Emergency unit is the only such facility in Stafford. Wards at County Hospital are numbered, with the exception of specialist units. The Hospital changed its name on 1 November 2014 from Stafford Hospital to County Hospital as part of the dissolution of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust. History Hospital entrance This hospital was built on the site of Coton Hill private psychiatric hospital which opened in 1854 and was demolished in 1976 with only the old chapel and gatehouse still visible. When the County Hospital site opened in 1983 it was named Stafford District General Hospital. The hospital was renamed Staffordshire General Hospital when Staffordshire General Infirmary, also in Stafford, closed in the early 1990s and services transferred. It was widely described as a \\"showpiece\\" hospital on its opening. However, in early 1985 it was the site of the second major outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. In October 2011 a Care Quality Commission inspection found a lack of suitably trained nursing staff on duty in the accident and emergency department. In consequence the department was closed at night for three months to remedy this, and to allow time for staff development. In January 2013 a police investigation started following the discovery that a dummy had been taped to a baby's face, allegedly by a member of staff. In 2013 the hospital's regulator, Monitor, warned the trust was close to insolvent. Over the past five years there had been a 67% drop in the number of patients, largely due to a loss of patient's confidence following the Stafford Hospital scandal, and annual income had fallen by nearly ¬£4 million. Stafford Hospital's mortality rate is now amongst the best within the West Midlands. In July 2013 two Stafford Hospital nurses were struck off the nursing register for falsifying A&E; discharge times between 2000-2010 to avoid breaches of four-hour waiting targets. In May 2015 it was announced that children's services and 8 beds for haematology and oncology patients would be transferred away from the hospital to Royal Stoke University Hospital and Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust as part of larger specialist wards. The day case chemotherapy suite is to undergo a ¬£2m investment in facilities and a new chemotherapy suite will open at Cannock Hospital. The Accident and Emergency service for children was withdrawn in August 2016 because the trust did not have enough specialist doctors to keep it open, but a minor injury unit for children was opened in October 2016. In September 2017 it was reported that 45 patients could not be discharged because of the lack of community and domiciliary services. Staffordshire County Council said they could not meet the delayed transfer of care targets. Support Stafford Hospital Campaigners in the Support Stafford Hospital group led a 50,000-strong march through the centre of Stafford in April 2013 - a rally where protesters waved banners saying \\"Stafford saved my dad\\" and \\"Stafford looks after my son\\". The group said \\"We need to have an intensive care unit here, we need to have an accident and emergency 24 hours a day and we believe that's possible\\". A protest camp with more than 30 tents was established outside the hospital by the group in July 2014. Julian Porter, one of the founders of the camp said he feared increased journey times for patients making the trip from Stafford to one of the other hospitals could risk lives and increase the burden elsewhere. A meeting was organised by Jeremy Lefroy MP in March 2015 to discuss a leaked KPMG report for NHS England which suggested shrinking the Hospital and turning it into a rehabilitation and elective surgery centre. Campaigner Cheryl Porter called for an all-party delegation to London to demand the reinstatement of a fully functioning hospital. Stafford Hospital scandal The hospital has been at the centre of the major scandal in which numerous newspapers estimated that because of the substandard care between 400 and 1,200 more patients died between 2005 and 2008 than would be expected for the type of hospital. In February 2010, an independent investigation recommended that the regulator, Monitor, de-authorise the Foundation Trust status. The official investigation and report showed that the method used to collect statistics re mortally were deeply flawed and gave a false result. The Francis Report had no definite figure for any deaths caused by neglect or poor care. In June 2010, the new government announced a full public inquiry, expected to report in March 2011. The final report was published on 6 February 2013, making 290 recommendations.

He is best known for his 1976 thriller La casa de las sombras (House of shadows). Wullicher was born in Buenos Aires. His 1972 movie Quebracho tells the story of \\"La Forestal,\\" an English company extracting Quebracho trees between 1900 and 1963 in the northern province of Santa Fe. The wood and its main product, tannin, were highly coveted between 1918 and 1945 and became a focal point of political and social struggles connected with the evolution of trade unionism, as well as the emergence of the Radical Civic Union and Peronism. It is considered an iconic film of its period, if now somewhat dated. His 1978 documentary Borges para millones, about the writer Jorge Luis Borges, includes an interview with Borges and staged reenactments of some of his works. After the return to civilian rule in 1983, the government of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n abolished censorship, placing Wullicher and Manuel Ant√≠n in charge of the National Film Institute. The period that followed saw a renaissance in the Argentine film industry. Wullicher's 1995 film La nave de los locos (The ship of fools) is set in a small town in Patagonia, where a Mapuche Indian chief sets fire to a tourist complex that is under construction, and refuses to defend himself. The story contrasts his approach of waiting for help to arrive from the ship of fools, a traditional source of strength that caused him to start the fire, and that of his appointed defense lawyer, a white woman who argues that he acting in self-defense since the commercial structures were being built on the sacred burial grounds of his ancestors.

History After the New York City Bar Association was founded in 1870, it housed itself in a series of buildings in lower Manhattan. By the 1890s, membership of the Association had grown to the point where its leadership began looking for a new House farther uptown. On December 11, 1894 the membership approved the acquisition of a large site between West 43rd and West 44th Streets for the construction of a new, larger building. The street, already home to the Harvard Club of New York and the Century Association, was considered by the members ‚Äúspecially adapted to our purposes‚Äù because of the other prominent clubs and societies in its vicinity.‚ÄúThe House of the Association.‚Äù New York, NY: The New York City Bar Association. October 8, 1996. p. 6 Current building 43rd Street Entrance of the New York City Bar Association Building, circa 1900 The prominent architect Cyrus L.W. Eidlitz, son of the influential New York architect Leopold Eidlitz, was commissioned to design the building. Eidlitz had designed a number of landmark buildings throughout the country, including Dearborn Station in Chicago, Buffalo & Erie County Public Library, St. Peter's Church in the Bronx, and Bell Laboratories Building in Manhattan. Construction was begun in early 1895 and completed 18 months later at a total cost of $584,700. The House was built in the neoclassical style, from Indiana limestone. The fa√ßade included elements of the Doric order on the bottom three floors, Ionic columns framing the fourth floor windows, and Corinthian pilasters on the fifth floor, creating a historicist ‚Äúcomposite‚Äù of classical architecture. The new House was considerably larger and grander than its precursors: it stood six stories tall; included a meeting hall with a seating capacity of 1,500; a reception hall with a standing capacity of 1,500; a library of over 50,000 volumes, and three additional floors of offices. The entrance hall and first floor stairways were constructed of marble, and the second floor hallway, reception hall, and meeting hall of granite, marble, and mahogany. The Association opened the doors of its new House on October 8, 1896, with a gala of several thousand guests. The New York Times described it as ‚Äúone of the most interesting and successful works of recent architecture‚Ä¶a work having the classical qualities of simplicity, purity, and serenity in a high degree.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe House of the Association.‚Äù New York, NY: The New York City Bar Association.

She is a specialist in Regulatory Law, whose doctrine she founded in France. Studies Her studies notably consisted of a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the Universit√© de la Sorbonne (Paris IV) in 1987, a Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) in Private Law at Universit√© Pantheon Sorbonne (Paris I) in 1984, a Master of Advanced Studies (DEA) in Procedural Law at Panth√©on-Assas University in 1983, and a State Doctorate in Private Law, which she obtained after defending a thesis entitled Generalities on the Adversarial Principle at Panth√©on-Assas University in 1988. Her studies culminated with the first place in the Agr√©gation of Private Law in 1991. Professional career Following her studies, she successively occupied Professorial positions at the University of Angers, Universit√© Paris-Dauphine, and Sciences-Po (Paris). She founded a Master of Advanced Studies (DESS) in Economic Law at each of these establishments.Curriculum vitae Within Sciences-Po, she founded the Chaire R√©gulation in 2000, which is a structure for performing research and organising events, and directed it until 2009. Her research goals have been developed throughout her various responsibilities in education, publication, and consulting for governments and private businesses: she has established a theoretical position based on law, economics, and politics, on the rules and decisions characteristic of regulated sectors (such as telecommunications, transports, media, Internet, energy, finance, banking, insurance, healthcare, and the environment). When she arrived at Sciences-Po in 2001, she founded the Master in Economic Law, which she directed until 2009. She founded the Journal of Regulation published in paper format and on the Internet. She created two editorial collections, Cours Dalloz published by Dalloz, and Droit et Economie (Law and Economics) published by LGDJ. She created her own publishing house, MAFR Publishing, in 2010. Publications, Speaking Engagements, Research Interests Marie-Anne Frison-Roche has written about fifteen books, edited about forty, and written about 250 articles and monographs. A large part of her work is available on her website. From a qualitative point of view, her main area of expertise is regulation. In 2000, wrote the seminal articles on what has since come to be known as \\"Regulatory Law\\" and participated in the implementation, both in France and abroad, of successful and effective economic regulation of various sectors. She wrote the major reference works concerning regulation in France, especially Les 100 mots de la r√©gulation (in press) and the Pr√©cis Dalloz du droit de la r√©gulation (forthcoming). She approaches regulation from the triple angle of Law, economics, and political science. Many French and foreign regulators call upon her to draw up reports and studies. The publication she founded, The Journal of Regulation is sponsored by more than forty corporate partners and all of France's specialized regulators are members of its Global Committee. It is widely believed that Marie-Anne Frison-Roche is the reference in terms of directly applicable doctrine in Regulation. She continues her work on the role of States in global economic regulation, and publishes legal sociology articles, drawing especially on her experience at the laboratoire de sociologie juridique of Panth√©on-Assas University, founded by Jean Carbonnier, which she directed for many years.

Education Gregory was born in Aberdeen on 13 April 1813, the youngest son of Isabella Macleod (1772‚Äì1847) and James Gregory (1753‚Äì1821). He was taught initially by his mother, and in October 1825 he was sent to the Edinburgh Academy, and after two years of study spent a winter at a private academy in Geneva. While there his mathematical talent attracted attention, specifically geometry. On his return to Scotland, he attended classes at the University of Edinburgh, working at chemistry, making experiments in polarised light, and advancing in the higher parts of mathematics, guided by Professor Wallace, his mentor. In October 1833 he commenced residence at Trinity College, Cambridge. He earned fifth wrangler in the tripos of 1837. He took the degrees of BA in 1838 and MA in 1841.Graduati Cantabrigienses, p. 133, 1846. He was elected fellow of Trinity College in October 1840.The Mathematical and Other Writings of R.L.

Many of his articles for the CMJ were collected in The Mathematical Writings of D. F. Gregory, edited by his friend and colleague William Walton. In 1841 he published his Examples of the Processes of the Differential and Integral Calculus, which expanded the earlier work of John Herschel, George Peacock and Charles Babbage to include the mathematics used to describe discontinuities observed in heat transfer explored by the French mathematician Joseph Fourier, and the theory of undulatory light, a topic familiar to him.Mathematical Writings of Ellis, pp. 198‚Äì9. He was elected a member of the Philological Society 12 May 1843.Proceedings ‚Äì Philological Society (Great Britain), Volume 1, No. 9, (London, 1844). Other disciplines Acting as tutor, Gregory was also an examiner of his college and lectured occasionally in chemistry. Two of his papers explored the physics of pendulums (clockmakers) and were written with Mr. Archibald Smith.Philosophical Magazine Vol. XXXI Jan.-Jun. 1866, p. 77, (London University, 1866). (On the Sympathy of Pendulums, See pp. 175‚Äì86, Mathematical Writings of D.F. Gregory.) Illness and death Gregory's circumstances did not allow him to accept the Mathematical Chair at the University of Toronto offered in 1841. Illness overtook him the next year. Incapacitated, he left Cambridge in the spring of 1843, and died in Edinburgh the following February, at 30 years of age.Mathematical Writings of Ellis, p. 200. Gregory is buried with his siblings in his parents burial plot in the south-west corner of Canongate Kirkyard, next to Adam Smith. Family Gregory never married. He was the youngest son of eleven children. His older brother William, like his father, was a chemist and physician. His great- great-grandfather James Gregory, the mathematician, designed the Gregorian telescope. James's nephew, David Gregory, was appointed a professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1683. Gregory lived together with his brothers and their wives in a huge Georgian townhouse, 10 Ainslie Place, on the Moray Estate in the western New Town of Edinburgh, originally their father's house.

The varied practice approach focuses on the distribution of practice in time, the organization of activities to be practiced (blocked vs. random), and the interleaving of information or content to highlight distinctions that facilitate learning. For example, a varied practice approach to learning to shoot a basketball might involve a sequence of ten mid-range jump shots, followed by ten layups, followed by ten free throws, followed by ten three- pointers, with the entire cycle repeating ten times. This contrasts with traditional approaches in which the learner is encouraged to focus on mastering a particular aspect or subset of the relevant information before moving on to new problems (e.g., focusing on free throws before moving to three-pointers). With varied practice, the learner is exposed to multiple versions of the problem even early in training. Benefits In many learning domains, varied practice has been shown to enhance the retention, generalization and application of acquired skills. There are many potential sources of the observed advantages. First, greater diversity of the tasks may also allow the learner to extract the most relevant, task-invariant information. Any given practice trial contains both task-relevant and task- irrelevant information. By mixing up the trials, task-irrelevant information will be less consistent, allowing the learner to strip away the spurious associations. Task-relevant information should be constant regardless of the particulars of individual trial. Second, varied practice creates conditions that are likely to encourage elaborative rehearsal (see Craik & Tulving, 1975). Elaborative rehearsal is a means by which the learner forms multiple associations with the to-be-learned material, so that it can be recalled using a variety of cues. Cognitive psychologists generally regard elaborative rehearsal as one of the most effective means of acquiring new information, and its basic logic ‚Äì to study the material from a range of perspectives in order to form richer links with preexisting knowledge ‚Äì is completely consistent with the varied practice approach. Finally, because learners are frequently changing tasks, practice may seem less repetitive, potentially minimizing boredom and increasing the level of engagement during practice. Theory The theoretical underpinnings of the varied practice approach stem primarily from a behavioral phenomenon discussed in the skill acquisition literature called contextual interference (Shea & Morgan, 1979). Contextual interference refers to a learning benefit observed when the items to be learned are randomly intermixed across training blocks rather than repeated in blocks (for a review, see Magill and Hall, 1990). That is, when identical items are blocked together during training, post-training performance is worse than when different items are intermixed. Although primarily studied with motor skill learning task, contextual interference was originally reported in a verbal paired associates task (Battig, 1966, 1972) and has been observed in other non-motor tasks (e.g., Carlson et al., 1989). The benefits of mixed-item blocks are apparent only some period of time after practice, indicating that the effects are primarily long-term. The source of contextual interference is not well understood. At present, it is primarily an empirical phenomenon. Most accounts assume that it emerges because blocked practice is not sufficiently demanding to produce optimal effort or attention. Consistent with this view, contextual interference is reduced or eliminated with more complex tasks (see Wulf & Shea, 2002). Across the various accounts of this complexity effect, the dominant theme is that as complexity increases, learners benefit more from the opportunity to repeat and refine their responses on successive trials. There is also debate regarding whether children show the effects of contextual interference as adult learners. Some studies suggest children show normal contextual interference (e.g., Edwards et al., 1986) whereas others show no effect in children (e.g., Del Rey et al., 1983). Moreover, as with adults, more difficult or complex tasks show less contextual interference (Magill & Hall, 1990). Thus, the absence of contextual interference in some studies with children may simply be another manifestation of the task complexity effect. Similar to Contextual interference bears an intriguing similarity to a phenomenon observed during the training of neural networks called catastrophic interference (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989). Catastrophic interference occurs when a network is trained to criteria on one set of mappings, and then switched to a new set, at which point it loses access to the initial mappings. In a sense, rather than forming a set of connections that would preserve the knowledge it acquired in the first task, the network optimizes its performance completely to the new task. The solution to this problem is simply to interleave the training sets so that the network is forced to optimize its behavior in a way that is sensitive to both of the tasks and their statistics. While this was not thought to characterize human learning (a supposed weakness of this approach), recent evidence suggests that human learning also exhibits this principle under the right conditions (Mirman & Spivey, 2001). In science Neuroscience techniques have recently been applied to investigating the effects of varied practice. Because these effects are typically only observed after a considerable delay, these studies have focused on the neural changes occurring during the consolidation period. For example, Kantak and colleagues (2010) used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) immediately after varied practice of a motor task and, in a separate group of participants, after traditional constant practice of the same task. When the rTMS was applied over the prefrontal cortex, performance 24 hours after training was much worse than immediately after training. In contrast, when the rTMS was applied over primary motor cortex, performance 24 hours after training improved similarly to a control group that received no rTMS. Thus, disruption of neural activation in the prefrontal cortex after varied practice appears to eliminate its benefits. In contrast, when a constant practice schedule was used, all groups performed worse 24 hours after training than immediately after training, and the group receiving rTMS over the primary motor cortex performed much worse than either the prefrontal or control groups. In sum, the findings suggest that varied and constant practice engage distinct sets of neural regions, the former involving the prefrontal cortex and the latter involving primary motor cortex. In education The practical benefits for varied practice in the educational domain may be largely untapped. Dempster and Corkill (1999) argued that the available evidence warranted focused investigations of the role of these underlying processes (cognitive inhibition and contextual interference) to the teaching-learning process. More recently, Rohrer and his colleagues studied the benefits of varied practice in mathematics curricula. Rohrer and Taylor (2007) noted that, contrary to the basic science supporting the varied practice approach, most mathematics textbooks had each set of practice sections made up almost entirely of problems corresponding to the immediately previous lesson; only in a small number of cases did they find the practice problems to be systematically shuffled so that each practice set includes a variety of problems drawn from many previous lessons. They concluded that varied practice was underused. Apfelbaum, Hazeltine and McMurray (2013) found consistent benefits of varied practice for children learning phonics regularities in English. Children who practiced the vowel rules of English in varied consonant contexts showed substantially stronger learning of the vowel rules than children who practiced in constrained contexts. These benefits of varied practice included generalization to new tasks and new items. This finding contrasts with the common phonics practice of emphasizing \\"word families,\\" in which students practice phonics rules in sets of highly similar items (e.g. cat, hat, pat, bat). In sum, there are clear applications for varied practice for students and educators alike; tapping these principles could improve generalization of knowledge and long-term retention.

Initially a right-handed pitcher, he was a rookie sensation at age 18 when, just days out of high school, he pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout for the St. Louis Cardinals in his first Major League (MLB) start against the defending National League champion Brooklyn Dodgers on June 21, 1957. McDaniel went on to have a sparkling debut season in the Majors. Winning his first four decisions, he pitched 19 consecutive scoreless innings, bested his first start by recording a one-hitter, and posted a 7‚Äì5 win‚Äìloss record and a 3.22 earned run average in 17 games and 86 innings pitched. But a breakdown in his pitching mechanics resulted in severe control problems that curtailed both his mound and MLB careers and caused him to eventually become a third baseman in minor league baseball. Major League debut The younger brother of Lindy McDaniel, Von was born in Hollis, Oklahoma; he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Upon his 1957 graduation from Arnett High School, he signed with the Cardinals for a $50,000 bonus and was placed on the Redbirds' Major League roster per the bonus rules of the era. Lindy, then 21, was in his third season with the Cardinals; he was an established big leaguer who would win 15 games for St. Louis that season, and go on to pitch for 21 years in Major League Baseball. Von McDaniel joined the Cardinals and pitched effectively in relief, gaining his first Major League win against the Dodgers at Ebbets Field with four innings of shutout relief five days prior to his June 21 debut as a starter. In his two-hitter on June 21 at Busch Stadium, he allowed an infield single to Jim Gilliam and a bunt single to Duke Snider, both of them in the sixth inning. But he worked out of a bases-loaded, no out jam to preserve his shutout.Retrosheet box score: 1957-06-21 He issued three bases on balls and struck out four. With the McDaniels winning six games between them, the Cardinals won 18 of 24 games between May 31 and June 23, rising to second place in the National League standings, where they finished at year's end. Von's one-hitter took place July 28, also at Busch Stadium; he allowed only a second-inning double to Gene Baker, blanking the Pittsburgh Pirates, 4‚Äì0, striking out four and issuing no bases on balls.Retrosheet box score: 1957-07-28 Control problems But when the 1958 season began, McDaniel became inexplicably wild. He appeared in only two games for the Cardinals, and in two innings issued five walks, gave up three hits and three earned runs, and was dispatched to the Class B Carolina League to try to regain his effectiveness. Although McDaniel rebounded somewhat in 1959, in Class D, then the minors' lowest classification, he never conquered his control problems. As events turned out, his final appearance in Major League Baseball occurred on May 11, 1958. \\"He lost his coordination and his mechanics\\", Lindy McDaniel told author Pat Jordan, himself a former professional baseball pitcher, in 2001. \\"There was no real explanation. Some people thought it was psychological. But who knew about those things then? They sent Von down to the minors, but he couldn't get anyone out. He kept sinking further and further until he couldn't pitch anymore.\\" Conversion to third baseman During the 1960 season, with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Class C Northern League, McDaniel became a third baseman to take advantage of his batting prowess and try to return to the Major Leagues. He slugged 14 home runs and batted in 79 runs in Triple-A with the 1962 Oklahoma City 89ers of the American Association, but failed to make the parent team, the expansion Houston Colt .45s. His professional career ended after the 1966 season. Von McDaniel died at age 56 in Lawton, Oklahoma, after suffering a heart attack and a stroke.

Indeed, it appears as if Lord Hastings has finally found the legendary city of Guyanacapac and its immense riches somewhere in South America with the help of the local indigenous Moxtechica (Mox). Desperate and pregnant from her lover, Vivian decides to join the expedition and visits Dr. Livesey in search for help. Reluctantly, Dr. Livesey introduces her to the former pirate and cook Long John Silver whose help Vivian needs if she wants to take command of the expedition, thus preparing a mutiny. Interested, Long John Silver agrees and manages to plant several of his men among the crew of Captain Edward Hastings' ship Neptune before joining the crew himself, together with Dr. Livesey. After several weeks of hard work under Captain Hastings, the pirates lead a successful mutiny which places Silver into the captain's position. However, as the map to Guyanapac was lost together with Captain Hastings in the mutiny, the crew has to rely on Mox's guidance across the meanders of the Amazonas river and its numerous effluents. Not even yet arrived in Guyanacapac, the adventure takes a turn for the worse when the Neptune suddenly disappears shortly after finding what is left of the Nimrod, Lord Byron Hastings' ship, amid increasingly mysterious circumstances.

A genealogy, cited by Geoffrey Keating, states: \\"Tadhg son of Cian, son of Oilill Olom, had two sons, namely, Connla and Cormac Gaileang. From Iomchaidh son of Connla comes O Cearbhaill, and from Fionnachta son of Connla comes O Meachair.

It is being increasingly used in molecular biology for multiple displacement DNA amplification procedures, and has a number of features that make it particularly suitable for this application. Œ¶29 DNA replication Œ¶29 is a bacteriophage of Bacillus subtilis with a sequenced, linear, 19,285 base pair DNA genome. Each 5' end is covalently linked to a terminal protein, which is essential in the replication process. A symmetrical mode of replication has been suggested, whereby protein-primed initiation occurs non-simultaneously from either end of the chromosome; this involves two replication origins and two distinct polymerase monomers. Synthesis is continual and involves a strand displacement mechanism. This was demonstrated by the ability of the enzyme to continue to copy the singly primed circular genome of the M13 phage more than tenfold in a single strand (over 70kb in a single strand). In vitro experiments have shown that Œ¶29 replication can proceed to completion with the sole phage protein requirements of the polymerase and the terminal protein. The polymerase catalyses the formation of the initiation complex between the terminal protein and the chromosome ends at an adenine residue. From here, continual synthesis can occur. The polymerase The polymerase is a monomeric protein with two distinct functional domains. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments support the proposition that this protein displays a structural and functional similarity to the Klenow fragment of the Escherichia coli Polymerase I enzyme; it comprises a C-terminal polymerase domain and a spatially separated N-terminal domain with a 3'-5' exonuclease activity. The isolated enzyme has no intrinsic helicase activity, but may carry out an equivalent function by way of its strong binding to single stranded DNA, particularly in preference to double stranded nucleic acid. This is the property of this enzyme that makes is favorably applicable to Multiple Displacement Amplification. The enzyme facilitates the \\"debranching\\" of double stranded DNA. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate cleavage that occurs as part of the polymerisation process probably supplies the energy required for this unwinding mechanism. The continuous nature of strand synthesis (compared to the asymmetric synthesis seen in other organisms) probably contributes to this enhanced processivity. Proofreading activity conferred by the exonuclease domain was demonstrated by showing the preferential excision of a mismatched nucleotide from the 3' terminus of the newly synthesised strand. The exonuclease activity of the enzyme is, like its polymerisation activity, highly processive and can degrade single stranded oligonucleotides without dissociation. Co-operation or a 'delicate competition' between these two functional domains is essential, so as to ensure accurate elongation at an optimal rate. The exonuclease activity of the enzyme does impede its polymerisation capacity; inactivation of the exonuclease activity by site- directed mutagenesis meant that a 350 fold lower dNTP concentration was required to achieve the same rates of primer elongation seen in the wild type enzyme. Whole genome amplification Œ¶29 polymerase enzyme is already used in multiple displacement amplification (MDA) procedures (including in a number of commercial kits) whereby fragments tens of kilobases in length can be produced from non-specific hexameric primers annealing at intervals along the genome. The enzyme has many desirable properties that make it appropriate for whole genome amplification (WGA) by this method. *High processivity. *Proofreading activity. It is believed to be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude less error prone than Taq polymerase. *Generates large fragments, over 10kb. *Produces more DNA than PCR-based methods, by about an order of magnitude. *Requires minimal amount of template; 10 ng suffices. *Novel replication mechanism; multiple-strand displacement amplification. Random primers (hexamers) can be used, no need to design specific primers/target specific regions. No need for thermal cycling. *Good coverage and a reduced amplification bias when compared to PCR-based approaches. There is speculation that it is the least biased of the WGA methods in use.

He has stated that the neighborhood was very mixed and that he played with Jewish and Irish children in addition to African Americans. When he was ten, his family moved to the Esplanade Gardens, a co-op high rise in Harlem with tenants of various classes and races. Career Cooper began his writing career as a music critic for The Village Voice, serving later as an investigative reporter for the New York City alt- weekly from 1980 to '89. He wrote \\"Teddy Riley's New Jack Swing: Harlem Gangsters Raise a Genius\\" for the Voice in 1987 and is credited with naming the then-new hybrid of R&B; and rap. That same year, Cooper's article \\"Kids Killing Kids: New Jack City Eats Its Young,\\" also published in the Voice, brought him to the attention of Quincy Jones, who hired him to rewrite a screenplay about 1970s Harlem heroin dealer Nicky Barnes. Cooper's screenplay was later produced as the film New Jack City (1991), which he set in Harlem after the arrival of crack cocaine in the '80s. It was the first film in what has been called Cooper's \\"Harlem trilogy,\\" which also includes Sugar Hill and Above the Rim (cowritten with Jeff Pollack, the film's director, from a story by Pollack and Benny Medina), both of which were released in 1994.

It is part of the 99 Names of Allah, by which Muslims regard Allah and which are traditionally maintained as described in the Qur'ƒÅn, and Sunnah, amongst other places. Linguistic Meaning Haleem comes from the root \\"hilm\\", which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be forbearing, mild, lenient, clement; to be forgiving, gentle, deliberate; to be leisurely in manner, not hasty; to be calm, serene; to manage one's temper; or to exhibit moderation. Having \\"hilm\\" can be understood to have a wisdom and a forebearance that allows a person to control their anger. Hilm is an intelligence that, in our terms, allows someone to control their anger, even if their anger is justified. It allows you to, when you are justifiably angry, control it and not manifest it. Deeper Meaning Al-Haleem (ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑŸäŸÖ) is the One Who has the following characteristics: Knowledge (to know what happened); Wisdom (to control that which makes you angry); the notion that you must be justifiably angry (only a foolish person gets angry for no reason); and finally the notion that the person who‚Äôs angry justifiably could take revenge on you but doesn‚Äôt. In his book, \\"Al-Maqsad Al-Asna fi Sharah Asma' Allahu al-Husna\\" (aka The best means in explaining Allah's Beautiful Names), Imam Al Ghazali translates Al Haleem as \\"The Non-Precipitate and Forbearing One\\". He states that Al Haleem is \\"the One Who Witnesses the disobedience of the disobedient, the One Who Sees the violation of the command ('amr). But Anger does not rouse Him and Rage does not seize Him. He is not one Who is prompted by haste and recklessness to take Swift Vengeance, even though He has unlimited Power to do so.\\" He then quotes verse 35:45 from the Quran: \\"And were Allah to punish men for what they earn, He would not leave on the back of it (surface of the earth) any creature...\\" Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Nooniyyah: \\"He is the Forbearing and does not hasten the punishment for His slave, (granting him respite) so that he may repent from his sin.\\" Al-Sa‚Äôdi said in his Tafseer: ‚ÄúAl-Haleem is the One Who keeps bestowing blessings, both visible and hidden, on His creation, even though they disobey Him and make many mistakes. So He forgives and does not give the sinners the punishment they deserve; He encourages them to repent and gives them time to turn to Him.‚Äù Occurrence in Quran Al Haleem is seen in various ayat in the Quran. For example, 2:235, 2:263, 4:12, 5:101, 17:44, 22:59, 33:51, 35:41, 64:17. Al Haleem is usually paired with various other Names of Allah in the Quran. For example, it is paired with Al Ghaffur (The Most Forgiving One) and some have said that this pairing means that not only does He overlook our actions and not get Angry, He forgives and covers them up and protects us from the effects of them. This is so because Al Ghaffur is said to come from the verb ghafara (ÿ∫ŸéŸÅŸéÿ±Ÿé), which means to cover. It is also paired with the Attribute Al Aleem (The All-Knowing), which some say implies that despite His Knowledge of our actions, He‚Äôs still controlling His Anger, though we deserve to be shown His Anger. Another pairing is with His Name, Al Ghani (The Self Sufficient, Rich beyond any need). Some say this pairing means that He doesn't need anything from us and yet He is still forgiving us for our mistakes and sins. This shows His Attribute of Clemency. It can be argued that when a judge or a police officer lets a person off the hook with a crime; maybe they chose that action because of some benefit towards them. Allah does not benefit in any way, shape or form from any of his creation. This can be greatly understood by Prophet Musa in his statement in verse 14:8 in the Quran: ‚ÄúIf you were to be ungrateful, you and everyone on Earth, Allah is Rich Beyond Need, Praiseworthy.\\" Another pairing is with His Name As Shakur (The Appreciative). This pairing can mean that not only will the sins of believers be overlooked, they will be rewarded with more than they deserve. Occurrence in Hadith It was narrated by Imam Ahmad, Imam Bukhari, and Imam Muslim, on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Islamic prophet Muhammad, encouraged the saying of this supplication at the time of distress: \\"La ilaha illallahul- Azimul-Halim. La ilaha illallahu Rabbul-'Arshil-'Azim. La ilaha illallahu Rabbus-samawati, wa Rabbul-ardi, wa Rabbul-'Arshil- Karim. (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the Incomparably Great, the Compassionate. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah the Lord of the Mighty Throne. None has the right to be worshiped but Allah the Lord of the heavens, the Lord of the earth, and the Lord of the Honourable Throne.)\\"https://sunnah.com/riyadussaliheen/17/38 Imam al-Tabarani also narrated on the authority of Ali ibn Abi Talib that Muhammad taught him to say the following words at times of fear: \\"la illaha il allah al-Haleem al-Kareem, Subhan'Allah wa tabarak Allah rabb al-‚ÄòArsh al-‚ÄòAdheem, wal Hamdulilahi Rabb al-‚ÄòAlameen\\" (There is no god but God, The Forbearing and Generous. Glory be to Allah and Blessed is Allah, The Lord of the Mighty Throne and all praise is due to Allah, The Lord of all the worlds). Concept of Allah's Forgiveness When contemplating how Allah deals with an individual's forgiveness, the root definition of each of these words help a great deal. In general, an individual has sins that he is aware of and sins that he is not aware of. Al Haleem has been explained to mean that Allah is Forbearing and Clement, where He gives an individual respite, or time to ask Him for forgiveness. Allah is not in haste to punish an individual for his sins. He even at times overlooks sins due to His Attribute of Haleem. Al Ghaffur has been described as meaning Allah is \\"The Most Forgiving One\\". He forgives a particular sin, no matter how large it may be. If the person returns to the same sin, Allah is Al Ghaffar, The Very Forgiving One. Al Ghaffar gives the notion that Allah continuously and repetitively forgives an individual for his sins. If an individual returns to Allah and asks for repentance, it can be accepted due to Allah's Attribute of being Tawwab, the Acceptor of Repentance. Once Allah accepts the repentance of an individual through His Infinite Mercy, He can erase the sin altogether because of His Attribute, Affuw. It would be as though there is no sin at all. Since man is not perfect, he repetitively sins and asks for forgiveness and seeks repentance, so the cycle of Forgiveness can repeat from Allah.

Facts Some members of the National Union of Vehicle Builders sued the executive committee for increasing fees. Rule 19 of the union constitution required a ballot and a two-thirds approval level by members. Instead a delegate meeting had purported to allow the increase without a ballot. Judgment Jenkins LJ granted the members' application. He held that under the rule in Foss v Harbottle the union itself is prima facie the proper plaintiff and if a simple majority can make an action binding, then no case can be brought. But there are exceptions to the rule. First, if the action is ultra vires a member may sue. Second, if the wrongdoers are in control of the union's right to sue there is a \\"fraud on the minority\\", and an individual member may take up a case. Third, as pointed out by Romer J in Cotter v National Union of Seamen[1929] 2 Ch 58 a company should not be able to bypass a special procedure or majority in its own articles. This was relevant here.

The film features an ensemble cast of Abhishek Bachchan, Bobby Deol, Vinod Khanna, Bipasha Basu, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Sonam Kapoor, Sikandar Kher and Omi Vaidya in the lead roles, while Aftab Shivdasani appears in a cameo. The theatrical trailer premiered on 3 November 2011, and the film was released on 6 January 2012. It is an official remake of the 2003 American film The Italian Job, which itself is a remake of the 1969 British film of the same name. Players employs the same plot as the 2003 version, while making the characters and incidents completely different. The story follows a team of players, consisting of a con-man, an automobile expert who doubles up as a seductress, an illusionist, an explosives expert, an expert hacker and an actor turned prosthetic makeup artist, who plan to steal gold worth from a moving train. During the robbery they are double crossed by members of their own team. Players was named one of the most anticipated Bollywood films of 2012, as it received hype ever since it was announced to be a remake of The Italian Job, was made on a huge budget, had a multistar cast, was filmed in foreign locations as New Zealand, Russia and even the North Pole‚Äîwhich was a first for a Bollywood film‚Äî and was heavily promoted. Upon release the film received mixed reviews from critics. Many praised the action sequences and the performances of Neil Nitin Mukesh, Omi Vaidya, and Bipasha Basu, but also criticized the screenplay, length, pace, music, and Sonam Kapoor and Abhishek Bachchan's performances. It opened to a poor response at the box office, despite having a wide release. The shocking failure of the film led to many trade industry analysts reinstating the belief of a jinx in Bollywood that the first-released film of the year always fails at the box office, which happened to the films Halla Bol (2008), Chandni Chowk To China (2009), Pyaar Impossible! and Dulha Mil Gaya (2010). Plot Mastermind Charlie Mascarenhas (Abhishek Bachchan) and his accomplice Riya (Bipasha Basu) are one of the greatest pairs of thieves in India. Charlie's friend, Raj (Aftab Shivdasani), is killed by the Russian mafia. At Raj's funeral, his wife Shaila hands Charlie a CD containing information about the transfer of gold ingots by a train from Russia to Romania. Charlie decides to rob the train with the help of imprisoned Don and con-artist Victor Braganza (Vinod Khanna). They hire a team of criminals to join them in the robbery. The group includes Spider (Neil Nitin Mukesh), a world-class hacker, an explosives expert Bilal Bashir (Sikander Kher), a prosthetic makeup artist Sunny (Omi Vaidya), and an illusionist Ronnie (Bobby Deol). Before the heist, Victor's daughter Naina (Sonam Kapoor) returns to India from Australia to receive Victor when he is released from prison. The group of players devise a plan to rob the Russian train in the sliest way possible. Spider hacks into a Russian satellite system and Ronnie uses his illusion to trick the soldiers guarding the gold while the rest of the team transfer the gold from the train. The robbery is executed successfully. Charlie calls Victor to inform him of the successful robbery, but Naina overhears the call and realizes Victor broke a promise to her to never return to his life of crime. While the players celebrate their success, Ronnie reveals to the team that he has a daughter who is hospitalized because she got paralyzed during one of his magic performances and hopes to help her recover soon. Spider double crosses the gang and tries to flee with all of the gold. Spider is stopped by Ronnie, who is then shot multiple times by Spider's assassins. The group are chased by the assassins as Ronnie and Riya are killed by Spider. Charlie, Bilal, and Sunny manage to escape after Spider blows up the location and flees with the gold. At the same time, Spider's assassins break into the house and murder Victor. Naina decides to cut off all contact with Charlie. Over the course of a year, Charlie contacts various gold dealers to learn which one has the stolen gold that Spider escaped with. In New Zealand, the gang locate a dealer who is in contact with Spider. Charlie explains to Naina that the gang only wanted to steal the gold so they could help achieve Victor's dream of building a big orphanage. Naina understands and teams up with Charlie to exact revenge on Spider. In New Zealand, they discover that Riya is still alive and living there. She explains that she also wants revenge on Spider and provides the gang with the information about Spider's residence. Unaware of her plans, Spider flirts with Naina and takes her to his villa. Spider finds a hidden camera in Naina's dress and realises that she is working with Charlie, who breaks into Spider's mansion in an armored truck to rescue her and tells Spider that he will steal all of the gold within 48 hours. Spider tries to move the gold to another country, but the gang, using three large trucks and by hacking into the traffic system, take the gold and hide it inside three Mini Coopers. Just as they are about to leave New Zealand, they are caught by Spider and discover that Riya was working with Spider all along. Spider tries to force the gang to hand over the gold, but the trunks of the Mini Coopers are empty. Spider betrays Riya and threatens to kill her. Before Charlie can reveal the real location of the gold, Riya shoots herself and Spider stabs Charlie. Spider tries to escape, but Sunny and Bilal stop him and beat him up badly. Naina, who wants revenge for the death of Victor, shoots Spider thrice. It is then revealed that the real Mini Coopers containing the gold are elsewhere. As the four leave the scene, Spider makes a final call to the Russian mafia and tells them that Charlie has stolen Russian gold. The gang take the real Mini Coopers and leave for India, but the Mafia stop them to check the cars and once again they are found to be empty. It is then revealed that the Mini Coopers were made out of the actual gold itself. In the end, Bilal opens a car dealership business, Sunny becomes a theatre actor, Charlie and Naina open Victor's dream orphanage and Charlie raises Ronnie's daughter as his own.

At first Abbas- Mustan were hesitant, but after watching the 2003 remake of The Italian Job they decided it would be a good idea to Indianise it. They spent around a year working on the script and making a few tweaks including two new characters, played by Basu and Deol. =Casting= Bachchan was the first actor to be signed, along with Katrina Kaif and Neil Nitin Mukesh, to play the roles originally played by Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Edward Norton in the original. Mukesh was approached for the negative role, as the directors were impressed by his performance in Johnny Gaddar (2007). Rumours circulated of different names being linked and approached including Sonakshi Sinha, who opted out due to date problems, to Anushka Sharma supposedly being called in to replace her. Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra had also been approached to play the leading female roles opposite Kunal Kapoor and Akshaye Khanna. Khanna later claimed he was never approached and expressed disappointment in not being cast. Kapoor left the film out due to her family problems with the Bachchan's. Deepika Padukone was also backed out, as she just like Chopra felt \\"the female lead does not have a strong part to play\\". Chopra was eventually dropped in a controversial matter, citing differences with Bachchan and the directors. Later Abbas Mustan claimed that the film was never offered to Chopra. At one point the film had no three male leads and no female lead, which caused the directors to panic, after Kaif also backed out due to date problems. As the directors wanted a younger girl she was eventually replaced by Sonam Kapoor. Kapoor walked out of the film, as the director she was working with on another film, Mausam, asked to concentrate solely on his film. However, she was signed again, as she managed to a lot dates, but due to heavy pressure from both projects, she passed out on the sets of Mausam. Rumours circulated that Mukesh had been dropped, due to the poor commercial business of his Lafangey Parindey (2010), although it had been a profitable venture. He later slammed the rumours saying \\"Arrey issme real ya unreal status ki kya baat hai? (There is no question of real and unreal status) It's sad that I am giving clarification on this when the fact is that I am already preparing for my role. The film is pretty much on and I am also not going anywhere\\". As Basu was approached, she immediately agreed after she read the script and was \\"blown away\\" by it. She had previously worked with Abbas-Mustan in her debut film Ajnabee (2001) and in Race (2008). Veteran actor Vinod Khanna made a comeback since his cameo appearance in Dabangg (2010), and was chosen to play a small but key role as the mastermind of the heist over the likes of other Indian senior actors Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor and Dharmendra. Aftab Shivdasani was roped in to play a guest cameo appearance. It was Abbas Mustan's first time working with all the actors except for Basu and Deol, who they had previously cast together in Ajnabee. The latter in five films, along with Johnny Lever who has played minor roles in all but two of their films. It was also the second pairing of Bachchan and Kapoor, who reunited after Delhi-6 (2009). Bachchan had also worked with Basu and Sikandar Kher (son of actors Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher) in Dhoom 2 (2006) and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey respectively. =Pre-production = Before shooting could begin, the entire cast underwent physical training to the requirement of the roles they were playing. Bachchan was required to tone up the most as he was the lead character and had to perform dangerous train stunts. For her role Kapoor, was required to learn to drive a car, although she had no previous experience. She practised in the small lanes of Juhu and after reassurance from her father Anil Kapoor to the directors, Kapoor drove, only to crash the car. Abbas Burmawalla commented on this \\"Our action director Allan Amin felt that she should get comfortable zipping around in the Mini Cooper. So about 10 days before we started shooting, Sonam started practicing driving the Mini. However, on the first day, she accelerated while reversing, and banged into a lamppost\\". Basu was required to wear a bikini during one of the songs, had gained weight during the year and worked with personal trainer Paul Britto, to ensure the perfect body. Her regime included functional training with abdominal exercises, kickboxing, aerobic exercise, stretching and weight training. Shweta Bhardwaj, who was playing a pivotal character in the film, was also required to physically tone up for an entirely different bikini scene. =Filming= One of the three Minis used in the production (this one was driven by Sonam Kapoor in the film) on location in Wellington, New Zealand Filming in India, mainly in Goa, began on 9 November 2010 and continued until the end of December 2010. The song \\"Buddhi Do Bhagwaan\\" was filmed on Miramar beach in Goa. The second phase of filming began in New Zealand in mid January 2011, in locations across Wellington and Auckland. Wellington City Council closed some areas of the city centre for two weeks so there would be no problems in shooting. Scenes were shot across the City to Sea Bridge, Okarito Lagoon on New Zealand's South Island, Te Papa's Awesome Forces Museum, Cuba Mall and in the Tulsi Indian restaurant. The replication of the \\"Mini Coopers\\" scene from the 2003 version of The Italian Job was filmed at Wellington Airport, which Bachchan had difficulty with due to his height, as he could not get in and out of the cars quickly. There was some controversy when airport officials refused to give permission for filming when they felt it was dangerous; the scene required a plane to overfly three Minis, which were being driven by Bachchan, Kapoor and Kher, and miss by inches. The traffic jam sequence involving the Minis was also shot in Wellington. Sixth months before shooting had commenced in New Zealand, Abbas Mustan met with the Tourism Board and Film Council in Wellington and they put up LED signs, to notify local residents of the street closure during that weekend. The crew finished shooting and left New Zealand just days before an earthquake hit the country. The third schedule of shooting, which was the longest and most important, began on April 2011 in parts of Siberia, St Petersburg and Murmansk. For the shooting in Siberia, the directors had a lot of difficulty acquiring permission. Similarly they had also faced several problems during the shooting in new Zealand. Describing this ordeal Mustan Burmawalla said \\"We had to seek lot of permissions for a traffic jam scene to be shot in New Zealand and that took a long time. While, in Russia we faced language problem, we appointed about 25 interpreters. We needed them to help us about basic things like where to go to eat etc,\\". Due to the difficulty allotting dates, Bachchan had to leave another project by Ram Gopal Varma titled Department, whom Varma would later blame for the dismal performance of the film at the box office. The sequences involving the train were directed by Filmfare award winning, stunt director Allan Amin. Bachchan refused to have a body double for the scenes and performed all the dangerous stunts himself. During the sequence, he had to balance himself atop two trains which were travelling at approximately 100 km/h. He hit his head on a rod on top of the train, but still managed to complete the scene. During another scene Bachchan was left hanging by a rack on the train for around 20 hours. While filming took place there, a group of Russian soldiers learnt that an Indian film was shooting nearby and joined the crew on the sets and requested to meet all the stars. Some of the scenes were filmed close to the Arctic Circle, Arctic Ocean and at the North Pole, which was the first time a Bollywood film had been filmed there. However a slight problem arose; no food was available because of the extremely cold climate and everyone had to manage on packets of soups. Shooting in Russia ended in late July 2011. The cast flew back to India, finalised a few last minute shots and songs, before the film went into the post production stage. Release The release of Players was repeatedly delayed; it was initially planned for a Diwali release but the film was not completed in time, as the story demanded extensive filming of action scenes. Hussain Burmawala took six-and-a-half months to complete the editing, which is the longest time taken for any Indian film to be edited. The release was expected on 9 December 2011 alongside Ladies vs Ricky Bahl and Agent Vinod but was further delayed until 26 December, to make more time for promotions. Bachchan requested that the film was released at a later date as he wanted to avoid a clash with Shahrukh Khan's Don 2. Players was finally released on 6 January 2012, making it the first released Bollywood film of 2012. =Pre-release= Before its release, Players garnered a lot of curiosity from Bollywood movie buffs and critics, ever since the first preview which generated a positive response from the audience. The directors Abbas-Mustan, who are known for their adaptations of Hollywood films into Indian-esque classic thrillers, returned to direction after quite some time. They had promised to break the boundaries of the action genre, as the major action stunts and sequences in the film were performed on par with Hollywood by the actors themselves. This is rarely seen or done in Bollywood. Kapoor who had previously played mostly girl next door type roles, brought a completely different look to her previous films, which attracted positive attention and was tagged as \\"sexy\\" by the media once the films promo's released. Another reason the film had created curiosity was because none of the actors expect Basu had enjoyed much box office success, while the rest were relative newcomers. Bachchan, who had been in the industry for over 10 years, had endured a series of flops, in spite of this the directors were confident of him. Players was named as one of the most-awaited films of 2012 by Mid Day, IBN Live, Hindustan Times, India Today and The Times of India. =Promotion= The first look at the film, along with teasers and an extended promo was revealed on 3 November 2011, on Kaun Banega Crorepati, which featured Abhishek's father, Amitabh Bachchan as the host. Amitabh Bachchan also helped to promote the film on his blog and Twitter feed. The theatrical trailer was also released on 3 November 2011, on the movie's official YouTube channel and Facebook page. Players had an extended promotion schedule since its release was delayed for an extra month. Promotion for the film was orchestrated by using tactics never seen before. The campaign began at the music launch on 13 December 2011, where the team promoted the film in a first event of its kind, as the lead actors Abhishek Bachchan, Bobby Deol, Bipasha Basu, Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Sikandar Kher and Omi Vaidya performed live stunts. Deol, who played an illusionist in the film, performed the opening act as he disappeared from two different towers. Kapoor drove an armoured truck through a golden brick wall and then drove around the arena. She was followed by Kher, who according to his role of an explosives expert, set off multiple explosions with a remote control, throwing a car 40 feet into the air before it hit another car, blowing both cars up. Vaidya and Mukesh spoke some dialogues from the film. Bachchan was followed in a car by Basu on a pillion as they both drove through a ring of fire and blew a bus up. Bachchan fractured one of his fingers during the stunt when he drove a car through a sheet of glass and performed the doughnut act and a 360-degree wheelie. Promotion continued at various airports and railway stations like the Delhi Metro where Bachchan, Mukesh and Kapoor fabricated a train heist similar to the one in the film, after which they travelled inside the Metro, followed by a media interaction and later gave away some merchandise from the film. At Chandigarh Airport, the actors spoke about their characters and signed autographs. Players was also promoted elsewhere in India, such as the Ambience Mall and the Inorbit Mall. Kapoor featured as a guest on Imagine TV's Nachle Ve with Saroj Khan and Bachchan promoted the film on Arjun Rampal's show Love 2 Hate U, where he met his biggest hater. Kapoor and Mukesh also appeared on reality show Bigg Boss's season 5 during the semi-finals, four days before Players was released. Players was heavily promoted in London with help from the cast of the 2003 remake of The Italian Job, including Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton and the director F. Gary Gray. The film was released in UK cinemas by B4U Pictures. The producers of Players held \\"Go for Gold\\" competitions where the winner would meet the cast and spend a day with them. =Premiere= Players had its worldwide premiere in Dubai on 4 January 2012. It was held at the Grand Cineplex in the Global Village and was attended by Bachchan, Basu, Kapoor and Mukesh. Instead of the traditional red carpet, a golden carpet was used in keeping with the theme of the film. Kapoor caused controversy over the outfit she had worn during the premiere, giving her a busty look and was verbally attacked by Fashion bloggers. Reception =Critical reception= Players received a mixed reception from critics. Joginder Tuteja from IndiaGlitz gave it 4 out of 5 stars and said \\"Fantastic ‚Äì That's what you end up exclaiming once the last twist of Players takes you by complete surprise. Oh yes, there are around half a dozen or more twists in this film, something which was pretty much expected since the men at the helm of affairs are Abbas-Mustan\\". Subhash K. Jha from Bollywood Hungama wrote, \\"Players does a first-rate job of adapting The Italian Job. It's slick and well-written, eye-catching and intelligent, witty and delectable. It beats every other action-adventure flick in recent Bollywood history\\". Oneindia.in also gave a positive review, and said that, \\"Players electrifies movie buffs with its hi-voltage action. The highlights of the movie are wonderful performances by the lead actors, stylised stunts, adrenaline-pumping chases, stunning visuals, Pritam's songs and comic sequences. But the editing work is a big let down\\". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Music by Pritam is good while it lasts. Some editing sorely needed, visual imagery quite polished, and the look as usual is of new age Bollywood.\\" Daily Bhaskar rated it 3 out of 5 and said, \\"Direction by Abbas-Mustan, cinematography and an edgy plotline are the strong points. Music, dialogues and performances (besides Bipasha and Neil's performance) are the weak points\\". Piyali Dasgupta from NDTV gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said, \\"Players ends up as a fun weekend flick, especially for action buffs. Abhishek Bachchan shows some of the style of the Dhoom series. Neil Nitin Mukesh, largely off the radar after an intense performance. Bipasha too shows a hint of Race with her glamourous role and that red bikini. Sonam Kapoor somewhat redeems herself as an actor playing the good geek Naina. But don't expect much from Pritam's music.\\" Zee News gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said, \\"Abbas Mustan's 'Players' is a slick, fast paced and racy thriller. Technically the film is brilliant, but when it comes to drama and emotions, the film falls flat on its face. In comparison to The Italian Job, Players‚Äô is long and overstretched. Kaveree Bamzai of India Today also gave it 3 out of 5. Players also received a number of negative reviews. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave it 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"On the whole, Players rides mainly on the clout of its credible director duo [Abbas-Mustan], daredevil stunts and stunning visuals. But, most importantly, it is deficient of a captivating screenplay\\". Rajeev Masand of IBN Live rated it 2 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Players is a fastpaced khichdi. Abhishek Bachchan is earnest, and thankfully dials down his trademark smugness to play the ringleader of the team. Neil Nitin Mukesh gets some interesting scenes to sink his teeth into. Bipasha Basu fills out a bikini nicely, but poor Sonam Kapoor changes her costumes and her hairstyle more frequently than her expressions. What could have been a satisfying entertainer doesn't quite achieve its potential. Karan Anshuman of the Mumbai Mirror gave it 2 out of 5 stars. Aniruddha Guha from DNA India awarded it 2 out of 5 and wrote, \\"The writing is juvenile, the dialogues a joke, the acting over-the-top, yet everyone seems to be taking themselves so seriously\\". Sukanya Verma of Rediff also gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Players is lacklustre and unimaginative\\". Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times gave it 1.5 out of 5. Komal Nahta from Koimoi rated it 1 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Whats good? The train robbery sequence; some comedy in the second half; Omi Vaidya and Neil Nitin Mukesh's acting. Whats bad? The loose and uninteresting screenplay; the poor music; the dull acting of Abhishek, Sonam and Bobby\\". Yahoo! Movies gave the film a rating of \\"Game Over\\" and said that, \\"the remake of \\"The Italian Job is definitely a job taken not so seriously\\". =Box office= India Players had a wide release of over 2000 prints, but despite the film having an extensive promotion schedule it only opened to around 35‚Äì40% occupancy, as it failed to make any headway over the weekend, grossing . Daily collections were on Friday and on Saturday. There was a small rise on Sunday as the film made . On Monday, its revenues decreased as it made . Collections decreased throughout the first week. On Tuesday the film grossed , on Wednesday it made and on Thursday , making the total first week revenues . The second Friday was extremely poor; Players grossed just 6 million compared to its reasonable first Friday gross of . Over its second weekend, even with a small increase on Saturday, the film only earned , taking its total 10-day collections to around . In its second full week Players grossed and in its third week it grossed taking the total three-week revenues to around . Players saw a further drop in its fourth week, grossing 800,000, due to the release of Agneepath. After six weeks Players ended its total lifetime collections at . It was reviewed as below average by Boxoffice-India. Overseas Players also failed to make an impact overseas, earning to on its first weekend. Its performance was dismal in Australia and below average in the UK and USA, although it performed respectably in the UAE and Fiji. It was most successful in New Zealand where it had the largest cinematic release of an Indian film in the country. 11 prints were distributed to two of New Zealand's biggest cinema chains, Event and Hoyts. Players exceeded the previous record held by Don 2 (2011), which was released two weeks earlier with nine prints. Soundtrack The official soundtrack was composed and directed by Pritam and the background score was composed by Sandeep Shirodkar. The lyrics were written by Ashish Pandit. The music rights were sold to T-Series and released on 30 November 2011. The main track used in the teaser and trailer is \\"Anti You\\" from Blue Stahli's eponymous album Blue Stahli. Sandeep Shirodkar composed the film score. =Track listing= =Reception= The soundtrack album received positive to mixed reviews. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"'Players' delivers what one expected from it. The need of the situation was to have a racy score that complements the fast paced story telling of Abbas-Mustan. The song which has the most potential is 'Dil Ye Bekarar Kyun Hai', others would work as instant coffee that would keep the momentum up for the film's narrative\\". Satyajit from Glamsham gave it 3 out of 5 and said, \\"Players, a stylish packed hi-voltage action thriller has cool and reasonably good listening soundtrack to its credit. As anticipated from its huge expectations, it proves to be an above average affair but lacks the zing and zeal of being 'spectacular' or 'earth-shattering' like the composer's previous works in this genre (Dhoom, Dhoom 2 and Race), which have been big successes in their respective years of release\\". Vanessa Barnes of Bolly Spice awarded it 2.5 out of 5 and wrote, \\"Pritam has created exactly the type of soundtrack to perfectly fit and complement the material onscreen. I think that in conjunction with visuals, some of which we‚Äôve already had a taste of in the promising, well-received trailer ‚Äì the songs will be effective. The bad news? I think as a whole, listened to on its own, the album is pretty average ‚Äì and if you don't like auto-tune, or excessive remixes, steer well clear\\". Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com also gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars and said, \\"After four very popular albums this year, Ready, Bodyguard, Dum Maaro Dum and Mausam, Pritam dishes out yet another album that is a mix of sure-shot winners and drab space fillers.\\" =Remix Plans= Because the album received mixed reviews from critics, Viacom 18 and T-Series decided that Pritam's score had not lived up to the audience's expectations as well as Abbas-Mustan's reputation of having hit music in their films. Pritam's last work with director duo in Race (2008) had sold well and helped the film's initial run at the box office and they decided to remix the hit song Jumma Chumma from Bachchan's father Amitabh Bachchan's hit film Hum (1991). However Abbas-Mustan were not very keen on this, causing tension between them and the producers. There were also plans to remix the song Tamma Tamma Loge from Sanjay Dutt's Thanedaar (1990), but plans to remix the song were scrapped as there was less than two weeks before the release of the film. Controversies During the shooting in New Zealand, authorities at an airport refused to give permission to film a scene, having decided it was too dangerous. An aeroplane was to fly a few inches above three cars, which were being driven by Bachchan, Kapoor and Kher. The stunt directors Mark and Allan Amin rehearsed the scene and the airport authorities finally gave permission because it was an important scene. The New Zealand Government and the local film crew were also unhappy and claimed the crew of Players had disregarded New Zealand laws and cared little for health and safety concerns, took months to pay invoices and damaged some locations. John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, had declared tax breaks for Bollywood films shooting in New Zealand to attract more film- makers. After Players did well at the New Zealand box office, laws allowing more film crews and actors to shoot there were to be enacted, causing concerns among the New Zealand people and authorities. Initially the way Chopra left the project, was deemed controversial, as it was said that the directors had been directly influenced by Bachchan. Bachchan and Chopra had previously starred together in several films, including one directed by Rohan Sippy, Bachchan's long time family friend. It was reported that Chopra had refused to star in another one of his film, due to this Bachchan had asked her to be dropped. However Abbas Burmawalla cleared Bachchan's name, saying \\"The star cast of The Italian Job was finalized long time back. We had signed Abhishek Bachchan, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Katrina Kaif in the first go and Katrina was always our first choice so there was no question of talking to Priyanka Chopra. She was never approached or spoken to for this role so how can Priyanka lose out on a role she was never even considered for?\\". Players received a U/A certificate. Controversy erupted regarding the Censor Boards clarification to a scene in which Kapoor is seen making a middle finger gesture, which was clearly visible in the promos of the film. It was initially blurred out but was later approved after appeals from the directors and Kapoor, who stated, \\"I don't believe in censorship so whether they like it or not, I really don't care about it. I just want people to come and see my film. Showing a middle finger is a part of today's youth\\". Media criticised her, claiming \\"For Sonam Kapoor, showing middle finger is no big deal\\" and the censor board for allowing the scene pass without cuts or blurring; a similar scene in Ranbir Kapoor's Rockstar (2011) had also been allowed. The issue was brought to light once again, when cricketer Virat Kohli famously made the gesture at Australian fans (two days before the film's release) during the Australia vs India 2011‚Äì12 series. Impact After the poor financial performance of Players, Bachchan's lack of success continued, and he was dropped from his next film role. The unexpected failure of the film led to many trade industry analysts reinstating the belief of a jinx in Bollywood that the first-released film of the year always fails at the box office, which happened to the films Halla Bol (2008), Chandni Chowk To China (2009), Pyaar Impossible! and Dulha Mil Gaya (2010). This had been happening for years until 2011 when No One Killed Jessica became a \\"semi hit\\" supposedly breaking the jinx. The analysts were confident that Players would be successful. Plans for a sequel to Players were scrapped after major disputes began between the directors Abbas-Mustan and producers Viacom 18, who claimed that Abbas-Mustan had made changes to the script without their consent and that the film had gone over budget from to around which had caused them extra losses. Bachchan, who was signed for approximately , forfeited his payment of and claimed he was \\"happy with the way the film was shot\\" and he turned down the balance fee owed to him. The film initially recovered most of its cost through theatrical rights, sold for to Ponty Chadha, music rights bought by T-Series for , and satellite rights that were sold to Zee TV for an approximate . The total loss amounted to around .

It is a necrotizing agent and it induces hypertension by release of catecholamine. It has been shown to cause necrotic enteritis in mammals and induces necrotizing intestinal lesions in the rabbit ileal loop model. C. perfringens beta toxin is susceptible to breakdown by proteolytic enzymes, particularly trypsin. Beta toxin is therefore highly lethal to infant mammals because of trypsin inhibitors present in the colostrum. Structure and homology Clostridium perfringens beta toxin shows significant genetic homology with several other toxins. C. perfringens beta toxin shows 28% homology with S. aureus alpha toxin and similar homology to S. aureus gamma-toxin and leukocidin. It appears in two forms. The smaller, with a molecular mass of 34 kDa, represents the monomeric gene product. The larger has a molecular mass of 118 kDa and may be an oligomer of smaller units. The first 27 amino acids may encode a signal that allows beta toxin to cross the cell membrane, further evidenced by the presence of beta toxin in extracellular fluid of C. perfringens cultures.Hunter, S.E., J.E. Brown, P.E. Oyston, J. Sakurai, & R.W. Titball. 1993. Molecular genetic analysis of beta-toxin of Clostridium perfringens reveals sequence homology with alpha-toxin, gamma-toxin, and leukocidin of Staphylococcus aureus. Infection and Immunity. 61(9): 3958-3965. Function =Pore formation= Because C. perfringens beta toxin shares homology with S. aureus pore-forming alpha toxin, it was hypothesized that beta toxin acts in a similar way. Upon investigation, it was found that C. perfringens beta toxin forms cation-selective pores in cell membranes of 1.6-1.8 nm and results in swelling and lysis in HL60 cells. Treatment of these cells with beta toxin induces an efflux of K+ and influxes of Ca2+, Cl‚àí and Na+. Heat-stable beta- toxin oligomers are shown to bind to cell membranes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells; endothelial cells are beta toxin's primary target, upon introduction. Further work on beta toxin has been hampered by its ineffectiveness on many readily available cell lines. Clinical significance =C. perfringens Type B= Beta toxin is the principal disease causing toxin in C. perfringens type B infection. Type B has caused lamb dysentery in Great Britain and South Africa.[Nilo, L. 1980. Clostridium perfringens in animal disease: a review of current knowledge. The Canadian Veterinary Journal. 21(5): 141-148] Enterotoxemia caused by a strains of Type B has been seen in foals in Great Britain and sheep and goats in Iran. Vaccines have been developed to combat lamb dysentery in sheep flocks at high risk. =C. perfringens Type C= Beta toxin from C. perfringens type C is highly lethal to neonatal pigs and occurs worldwide in farmed pigs. Beta toxin is the principal disease causing toxin in C. perfringens type C infection, and causes necrotizing enteritis and enterocolitis. In the disease process, C. perfringens penetrates the upper jejunum between absorptive cells and releases beta toxin. Beta toxin causes necrosis of the villi and mucosa, often causing blood loss into the lumen and intestinal wall. Type C causes fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in neonatal calves in North America but has been particularly prevalent in swine worldwide.Niilo, L. 1988. Clostridium perfringens type C enterotoximia. The Canadian Veterinary Journal. 29(8): 658-664. It is primarily fatal to animals 1‚Äì3 days old, whose digestive enzymes may not be sufficiently active to break down beta toxin. It has been experimentally shown that trypsin may normally break down beta toxin, and trypsin shortages in the digestive system of experimental animals have been used to induce type C disease. Vaccination of pregnant sows has proven effective at preventing the disease in piglets. Outbreaks in piglets from unvaccinated sows may be treated with oral antibiotics and antiserum.

Mico was appointed resident musician at Thorndon Hall, Essex, in 1608. There, he worked for Sir William Petre (William Byrd's former patron) as a music teacher for the family's children, as well as composing for the household. Surviving documents record the handing over of the household instruments to Mico in 1608, including five viols (with bows), a lute, organ and virginals. While working for Petre, Mico adopted his employer's faith, converting to Roman Catholicism. In 1630 he was appointed as organist to Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I, and held this post until the queen's flight to Holland in 1642.

It was first performed at the Music Society (Musikforeningen) in Copenhagen on April 6th, 1908 by Nielsen himself. Background While working on the music for Ludvig Holstein's drama Tove in the winter of 1907‚Äì08, Nielsen started to think about writing an orchestral piece based on Njal's Saga. The first traces of the introductory theme for clarinet and viola are to be found in a draft of Tove where it is played by a French horn. On April 1st, 1908, just after completing Tove, Nielsen signed off the fair copy of Saga Dr√∏m, only a few days before its scheduled performance. Peter Hauge, \\"Saga Dream\\", Orchestral Works 2, Carl Nielsen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Retrieved 9 November 2010. Nielsen no doubt learned of Njal's Saga and the piece's motto \\"Now Gunnar dreams; let him enjoy his dream in peace\\" from the translation by N.M. Petersen. The saga tells how Gunnar, on his way out of the country with Kolskeg and Hjort after being sentenced to exile, is so tired that he calls for a stop and falls into a troubled sleep. Hjort asks whether they should rouse him but Kolskeg replies, \\"No, let him enjoy his dream.\\" In his dream, Gunnar imagines they are being attacked by wolves. He and Kolskeg manage to defend themselves but Hjort is killed. The others see Gunnar is having a nightmare but Kolskeg still insists that he should not be disturbed. Reception The reviews of the initial performance at the Music Society on April 6th, 1908 were not very favorable. Dannebrog maintained: \\"It is not music at all, nothing but juxtapositions of sounds and an eternal build-up from pianissimo to fortissimo.\\" William Behrend, writing in Illustreret Tidende concluded that though the piece had a \\"highly stimulating effect... it seems to lack proportions ‚Äî to be at once too short and too long, as dreams after all can be.\\" Robert Henriques, writing in Vort Land was however far more positive. \\"It is as much the daydreaming of a fantasist as a sleeping dream that the composer wanted to depict. The entire piece presents a clash between the reality of life (the fugato movement) and life as a preparatory stage for an afterlife (the chorale). In the middle of the piece Carl Nielsen has tried definitively to paint the confusion that seizes us when one idea after another rushes through our heads. He has done so very originally in a free cadenza of flute, oboe and clarinet, later joined by bassoon, violins and a few cymbal tremolos. Saga Dream once more shows the talented composer‚Äôs ability to intertwine fine fibres of atmosphere into a tissue of notes that expresses the depth-seeking imagination of a distinctive personality. In this music there is nothing specious, although it does not easily always find a straight path to the listener‚Äôs immediate understanding. But this music is not to be dismissed as it speaks its own serious, penetrating language.\\" Music The unusual insertion of a free cadenza half way through the work may well explain why several of the reviewers were hesitant in condoning the piece. Kristeligt Dagblad referred specifically to \\"an intermezzo of a kind that can hardly be described in musical terms: it sounded more like an orchestra tuning up for a concert.\\" However, this compositional approach is echoed in Nielsen's \\"The Market in Ispahan\\" of Aladdin Op. 34 (1918-19) where partitions of the orchestra build upon one another. In an interview in Politiken published a few years later, Nielsen explained his work in some detail: \\"I am so fond of the work myself. It is kept almost piano all the time and musically it is very radical. It depicts the dream of Gunnar of Hlidarende, this marvellous figure from Njal‚Äôs Saga who plundered and slaughtered, yet was still made of finer stuff and was ahead of his time. He dreams of a brighter, better future for mankind, and I have tried, in muted tones, to give voice to the strange ideas engendered in the dream. There are among other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely alongside one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way ‚Äî differently and randomly for each performance ‚Äî until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.\\" References Category:Compositions by Carl Nielsen Category:Incidental music Category:1908 compositions Category:Symphonic poems Category:Works based on sagas Category:Works set in the Viking Age ","title":"Saga-Dr√∏m"},{"id":"29540376","text":"Julio Lencina is a cinematographer and director from Argentina who is known for his work in the cinematic world of the Andes (Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru).

Ranitomeya reticulata. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2. Downloaded on 31 May 2013. is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is an arboreal insectivorous species, and is the second-most poisonous species in the genus, after R. variabilis. Like many species of small, poisonous frogs native to South America, it is grouped with the poison dart frogs, and is a moderately toxic species, containing poison capable of causing serious injury to humans, and death in animals such as chickens. R. reticulata is native to the Amazon rainforest in Peru and Ecuador.  Poison  The red-backed poison frog is a moderately toxic dendrobatid, and is the second-most poisonous of the frogs in the genus Ranitomeya. Its toxins are used as the frog's natural defense mechanisms, making them inedible to many, if not most, of the predators in its natural area. To advertise its poison and further reduce the risk of injury, the red-backed poison frog displays its brilliant warning colors, especially its red-orange back, for which it is named. Like all dendrobatids, it does not manufacture its poison itself, but rather is theorized to take the toxins from the ants, mites, and beetles on which it lives. It absorbs the insects' poisons into its body, which is immune to the poison. The poison is stored in skin glands just beneath the frog's epidermis. The poison seeps through open wounds and orifices, and, it is believed, through the pores. This defense is especially effective against mammalian and avian predators, and, to a lesser extent, reptilian ones. Amazonian ground snakes have a limited resistance to the poison, and occasionally will attack such frogs.  Description  R. reticulata climbing a tree. Ranitomeya reticulata is one of the smaller species of poison dart frogs, hence its inclusion in the \\"thumbnail\\" species group. Males can reach approximately 12 mm in length from snout to vent, while the larger females may reach 15 or even 20 mm long. Like all poison dart frogs, R. reticulata are vividly coloured and patterned, which advertises their poison. Red-backed poison dart frogs have black legs with a cobalt or sky-blue mesh pattern, a black belly, and a back that ranges from fiery orange to scarlet in color, hence the common name. Like all arboreal frogs, R. reticulata possess suckerlike disks on their toes which makes their grip adhesive. As they are very small, they often attempt to advertise their poison by flaunting such colors or by ascending trees to escape from predators. If isolated from any form of escape, R. reticulata will use their poison as a defense mechanism. R. reticulata are more slimly built than many dendrobatids, which combined with their small size, gives them the ability to squeeze into minute hiding places.  Reproduction  R. reticulata naturally live in groups of five or six. At the end of the wet season, several of these groups join in large breeding gatherings. As with other poison dart frogs, the males court the females by calling to capture their attention, and then by gently stroking and licking them. A female will signal that she is sufficiently impressed by stamping her hind feet. The two frogs will then mate. The fact that the breeding season begins at the end of the wet season ensures that the eggs will be laid at the beginning of the next wet season, ensuring that the young will have a steady supply of water to keep them alive. Once the eggs hatch, the male carries the baby tadpoles into the canopy. The tadpoles have a water-soluble adhesive mucus that helps them stick to their father's back. The male R. reticulata will deposit the tadpoles into the tiny pools that accumulate in the centre of bromeliads. The female will then feed the tadpoles with infertile eggs that she lays into the water. Once the tadpoles become froglets, they are led by their parents to an existing group of red-backed poison frogs . While the young froglets are accepted by all members of the group, only their parents will look after the young frogs .  As pets  R. reticulata is considered a species for advanced dart hobbyists only. Their small size, breeding difficulties, and generally difficult care relative to other darts shows through high mortality rates with novice keepers. These difficulties are also the reason that the frog is fairly uncommon in the dart frog hobby and command a price upwards of $125‚Äì150 U.S. dollars per frog. It is also recommended to only keep them in pairs unless the tank size is substantial (55 gallons or larger), as there are many witness accounts and anecdotal reports of heavy same-sex aggression in smaller enclosures.

The time frame of the book is not specified, but is probably set between the birth of Attila the Hun in 406 AD, and the rise of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan in 1162 AD. The story begins with the central character Bardiya, a Saka tribesman, escaping westward across the steppe on horseback from the brutal Mongol-like Tugar people. The fictional Tugars may have been modeled on the Avars (580-804 AD), a Turkic people who were a nomadic confederation also ruled by a Khagan (emperor).Holmes, Morgan \\"Year of the Horsetails\\", The Robert E. Howard United Press Association, March 22, 2009, accessed November 8, 2010. Plot summary Bardiya had been a conscript soldier from the minority Saka people in the Tugar army as a light, mounted cavalryman but sentenced to death for desertion. Bardiya fled the Tugars on horseback and encountered a sedentary and pastoral Slav people called the Drevich who assisted him fighting off his former compatriots who had tracked him across the vast endless grasslands of the steppe. He decided to stay and live with them, quite possibly influenced by Marissa, a beautiful woman from the tribe. Bardiya warns the Drevich that the dreaded Tugars are campaigning towards their region and that they will be overrun unless they leave, or are determined to fight. Bardiya then trains the Drevich in the war techniques and methodologies of the Tugars and prepares them to defend their homeland. The final scenes comprise the battle between the Tugars and the Drevich, who by tactical ingenuity and discipline, manage to avoid being beaten by the Tugars and inflict a stinging defeat on the invaders.

Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) is a program in the United States established in 2003 and was designated to incorporate all projects that provide funding to local, state, and Federal government agencies by the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of the grants is to purchase surveillance equipment, weapons, and advanced training for law enforcement personnel in order to heighten security. The HSGP helps fulfill one of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security by enhancing the country's ability to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from potential attacks and other hazards. The HSGP is one of the main mechanisms in funding the creation and maintenance of national preparedness, which refers to the establishment of plans, procedures, policies, training, and equipment at the Federal, State, and local level that is needed to maximize the ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from major events such as terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The HSGP's creation stemmed from the consolidation of six original projects that were previously funded by the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness.Bullock, Jane. Introduction to Homeland Security, p. 103. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006. The HSGP now encompasses five projects in the program: State Homeland Security Program, Urban Areas Security Initiative, Operation Stonegarden, Metropolitan Medical Response System Program, and Citizen Corps Program. During the 2010 fiscal year, the Department of Homeland Security will spend $1,786,359,956 on the Homeland Security Grant Program. Core program priorities As stated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, these four areas of mission-supporting responsibilities are what drive the Homeland Security Grant Program: * Protecting the United States from terrorist threats is the founding principle and highest priority. * Securing the Nation‚Äôs southern and northern borders along with air and sea ports of entry. * Facilitating legal immigration and naturalizing new Americans, while prosecuting those who violate the country's laws. * Helping communities prepare, respond and recover from all facets of disaster. Current projects funded by the Homeland Security Grant Program The HSGP encompasses three projects with over $1 billion in funding available for FY 2017: the State Homeland Security Program ($402 million), the Urban Areas Security Initiative ($580 million), Operation Stonegarden ($55 million). The HSGP previously included other projects, including the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program and Citizen Corps, but beginning in 2012, these projects were no longer part of the HSGP. =State Homeland Security Program (SHSP)= This grant program offers a total of $402 million to enhance the state and local levels' ability to implement the goals and objectives of each state's individual preparedness report, which is one of the first steps in moving the grant processes, programs, and planning from a focus on loosely affiliated equipment, training, exercises and technical assistance projects to one that delivers a picture of prevention, protection, response and recovery capacity. In correspondence with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53) (9/11 Act), states receiving funding are legally required to ensure that at least 25 percent of the appropriated funds are dedicated to the planning, organization, training, exercise and equipment necessary for terrorism prevention. Additionally, SHSP funds may be used to facilitate secure identification including REAL ID, enhanced driver's licenses, Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC), and first responder credentialing. Only those items specified on the \\"authorized equipment list\\" are eligible to be purchased by SHSP funding.Hetzel, Otto and Abbott, Ernest. Homeland Security and Emergency Management: A Legal Guide for State and Local Governments, pp. 190‚Äì191. American Bar Association, 2010. Authorized items fall into the following 18 categories: personal protective equipment (fully encapsulated liquid and vapor protection ensemble, chemical resistant gloves, etc.) explosive device mitigation and remediation equipment (ballistic threat body armor, real-time x-ray unit, etc.), chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) search and rescue equipment (rescue ropes and ladder, confined space kits, etc.), interoperable communications equipment (personal alert safety system, antenna and tower systems, etc.), detection equipment (M-8 detection paper for chemical agent identification, photo-ionization detector, etc.), decontamination equipment (decontamination litters/roller systems, high efficiency particulate air vacuum, etc.), physical security enhancement equipment (motion detector systems, radar systems, etc.), terrorism incident prevention equipment (joint regional information exchange system, law enforcement surveillance equipment, etc.), CBRNE logistical support equipment (equipment trailers, handheld computers for emergency response applications, etc.), CBRNE incident response vehicles (hazardous materials vehicles, mobile morgue unit, etc.) medical supplies and limited types of pharmaceuticals (automatic biphasic external defibrillators and carry bags, epinephrine, etc.) CBRNE reference materials (National Fire Protection Association guide to hazardous materials, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health hazardous materials pocket guide, etc.), agricultural terrorism prevention, response and mitigation equipment (animal restraints, blood sampling supplies, etc.), CBRNE response watercraft (surface boats and vessels for port homeland security purposes), CBRNE aviation equipment (fixed- wing aircraft, helicopters, etc.), cyber security enhancement equipment (firewall and authentication technologies, geographic information systems, etc.), intervention equipment (tactical entry equipment, specialized response vehicles and vessels, etc.), and other authorized equipment (installation costs for authorized equipment, shipping costs of equipment, etc.). = Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI)= The Urban Areas Security Initiative program makes $580 million available\\"Fiscal Year 2017 Homeland Security Grant Program.\\" 2 June 2017. Accessed 3 July 2017. to enhance regional preparedness in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States. The UASI program directly supports expanding regional collaboration and is meant to assist participants in their creation of regional systems for prevention, protection, response, and recovery. Again, in correspondence with the 9/11 Act, states are required to ensure that at least 25 percent of appropriated funding is dedicated to terrorism prevention planning, organization, training, exercise, and equipment. State Administrative Agencies (Department of Public Safety, State Office of Homeland Security, Emergency Management Agency, etc.) are the only groups eligible to apply directly to FEMA for UASI grants.  Regional recipients  The Recipients of the UASI program include the 64 highest risk Urban Areas in the country, which are divided into the 10 highest risk areas (Tier 1) and the remaining 54 areas (Tier 2). These areas are determined by the DHS by examining the relative risk of the 100 most populous Metropolitan Statistical Areas defined by the Office of Management and Budget. Relative risk is determined in a three-step process that analyzes urban areas and states based on threat, vulnerability and consequence measurements, an effectiveness assessment of applicants‚Äô investment justifications, and then the final allocation decision. * Tier 1 areas: Los Angeles/Long Beach, San Francisco Bay, the National Capital Region, Chicago, Boston, Jersey City/Newark, New York City, Philadelphia, Houston, and Dallas/Fort Worth/Arlington. * Tier 2 areas: Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim/Santa Ana, Riverside, Sacramento, Oxnard, Bakersfield, Denver, Bridgeport, Hartford, Miami, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Atlanta, Honolulu, Indianapolis, Louisville, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Baltimore, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha, Las Vegas, Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Syracuse, Charlotte, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus, Toledo, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Portland, Pittsburgh, San Juan, Providence, Memphis, Nashville, San Antonio, El Paso, Austin, Salt Lake City, Norfolk, Seattle, and Milwaukee. =Operation Stonegarden (OPSG)= Map of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol sectors, wherein OPSG seeks to aid border securityThe intent of this $55 million program is to enhance coordination among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to secure the borders with Mexico, Canada, and international waters.\\"Fiscal Year 2017 Homeland Security Grant Program.\\" FEMA. 2 June 2017. Accessed 3 July 2017. OPSG is intended to support U.S. border States and territories in increasing the nation's capability to handle border security issues, emphasizing the role of local operational groups in enhancing National and State Homeland Security (such as the Federal Secure Borders Initiative and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strategies), increasing collaboration among all the levels of law enforcement agencies, continuing the enhancements required for border security, providing intelligence-based operations through U.S. Customs and Border Protection experts to ensure safety and operational oversight of law enforcement agencies participating in the projects operation, supporting the activation, deployment, or redeployment of specialized National Guard Units, Packages and elements of State law enforcement to enhance operational activities, and continuing to increase readiness of all law enforcement agencies. Those eligible for OPSG funding are local units of government at the county level and federally recognized tribal governments in the states bordering Canada, Mexico or those with international water borders. Allocations of funds, received from the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 110-83), are based on a risk-based prioritization by U.S. Customs and Border Protection‚Äôs sector-specific border risk methodology, which include \\"threat, vulnerability, miles of border and other border-specific law enforcement intelligence.\\" On July 15, 2010, Secretary Napolitano announced that 80 percent of Operation Stonegarden funding will now be directed to Southwest border states, and tribal funding will be increased by $8.2 million to $10 million in FY 2010. =Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) Program= In 2011, the Metropolitan Medical Response System program made $34.9 million available\\"FY 2011 Homeland Security Grant Program. FEMA. 4 May 2017. Accessed 3 July 2017. for the integration of emergency management, health, and medical systems into an organized response to mass casualty incidents such as nuclear, biological or chemical terrorist incidents.Christen, Hank and Maniscalco, Paul. Homeland Security: Principles and Practice of Terrorism Response, p. 14. Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2009. Successful MMRS grantees will be provided with the necessary resources to reduce the potential costs of a mass casualty incident during the initial stages of an incident by having proper coordinated response systems, such as equipment and supplies procurement, emergency triage and pre-hospital treatment/emergency medical services, hospital evacuation, patient tracking, etc. already in place. Aside from the typical local, regional and state emergency response agencies, the MMRS also includes facets of response such as disaster medical assistance teams and disaster mortuary operational response teams that may be federalized in disaster situations. The program created 124 local MMRS jurisdictions, in which the $39.36 million budget is distributed evenly. The 124 jurisdictions are encouraged to collaborate closely with local, regional, and State health and medical partners, such as Medical Reserve Corps Units, Citizen Corps Councils, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the Center for Disease Control's Cities Readiness Initiative, and Strategic National Stockpile programs. =Citizen Corps Program (CCP)= The Citizen Corps booth at FEMA's Hurricane Awareness Day at FEMA Headquarters to raise awareness and community emergency preparedness.In 2011, the Citizen Corps made $9.98 million in grant funding available\\"FY 2011 Homeland Security Grant Program. FEMA. 4 May 2017. Accessed 3 July 2017. for integrating the community and government to better coordinate local involvement in the preparation, planning, mitigation, response and recovery stages of emergencies. The main mission of the Citizen Corps is to utilize every resource by means of education, training, and volunteer service to local security and readiness to respond to threats of terror, crime, health issues, and disasters. CCP allocations are determined using the USA PATRIOT Act formula, which specifies that each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will receive a minimum of 75 percent of the total available grant funding. This leaves the remaining 25 percent of the total available grant funding to be allocated to the four territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The balance of CCP funds are to be distributed on a population-share basis among all of the recipients. Funding controversy Some criticism of the Homeland Security Grant Program has come from the distribution of funds. Not unlike other federal funding programs, the HSGP distributes a portion of funding based on population and distributes the remainder of funding evenly. For its part, the HSGP distributes 60% of funds on the basis of population, and the other 40% is evenly spread across all recipients regardless of population.Bennett, James. Homeland Security Scams, p. 64. Transaction Publishers, 2006. Wyoming for instance, despite being the least populous state, received more funding per capita in homeland security grants than any other state in 2004. At $45.22 per citizen of the state, Wyoming received more than four times the amount of funding per citizen given to either California or New York. Another criticism has come from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in regards to the risk-based grant methodology. Although the GAO concluded that the overall risk-based methodology (threat, vulnerability and consequences) was reasonable, the absence of a proper way to measure variations in vulnerability greatly reduce the value of the vulnerability portion of the assessment. Ultimately, they concluded that the vulnerability measure as part of its risk analysis model should be amended to better capture variations in vulnerability across the different states and urban areas it assesses. =News= * \\"SoCal gets nearly $53m in Homeland Security funds\\", Associated Press, 8/9/2010 See also * Homeland Security Act * Operation Virtual Shield * Surveillance * MATRIX * Fusion center References Further reading =Books= * \\"Terrorism Preparedness Grant Programs\\" in A legal guide to homeland security and emergency management for state and local governments, Ernest B.

John Drummond was the second son of James Drummond of Auchterader. A family history narrates that in 1521, John Drummond was given the lands and mill of Milnab in Strathearn, and the royal charter described him in Latin as; \\"Machinarum bellicarum ejaculator et carpentarius noster,\\" - \\"keeper of the throwing machines of war and our carpenter.\\" Royal buildings The later Drummond family history attributed to him the fine timber work in Stirling Castle and the roof of Drummond Castle set up in 1493.Lord Strathallan's Genealogy of the House of Drummond (Edinburgh, 1831), p. 62. A number of records of the royal exchequer of Scotland describe the career of the Master Wright with more certainty. John Drummond was first recorded as a wright (carpenter) in 1506, and made Principal Master Wright on 8 June 1532.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3, p. 114; Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 2, p. 304. In Spring 1538 he went to Tantallon Castle and Dunbar Castle with William Hill, the master-smith, to oversee repair works. John and his two workmen went to France in 1538 on the ships that brought the king's bride Mary of Guise to Scotland.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8, pp. 133-4: Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), pp. 230, 241. In 1541 he was building a part of the Register House at Edinburgh and also working at the castle of Crawfordjohn which had been forfeited to the crown by James Hamilton of Finnart. In December 1541 he made an organ-loft at Edinburgh Castle and it was carried in carts down to Holyroodhouse to be installed for Christmas.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907) pp. 497-500. Moving and mounting the royal artillery In 1515, John took the guns off two warships, the James and Margaret, at Dumbarton, which had been returned from France by the Duke of Albany, and took the cannon to Edinburgh overland via Glasgow.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 5 (1903), pp. 16-17, 72. John was often based at Edinburgh Castle where carpenters and ironworkers maintained the royal artillery. He directed the transport of these heavy guns. Drummond also had an armoury in a building at the gate of Holyroodhouse rented from the priest of St. Leonards.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8, 120 On 8 August 1536, John delivered guns to George Stirling of Glorat at Dumbarton Castle. These included four great guns furnished with stocks, wheels, vices and wedges, six falcons with stocks and wheels, 33 hagbutts, four iron culverins, bullets, gunpowder and ramrods. John took away a 10 foot long brass gun barrel.Macphail, JRN, ed., Fraser Papers (Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1924), pp. 221-222. Drummond went with the King to France in 1536. A friend of the exiled Douglas family, John Penven, wrote to George Douglas of Pittendreich describing how he went to Newhaven by Dieppe to speak secretly to 'John of Drummond.' Drummond was charged with keeping the King's treasure ship and would not speak with Penven. However, John Barton, the mariner, told Penven that the King had spoken to Drummond during the voyage, telling him how he played James Hamilton of Finnart against the Earl of Angus.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 11 (London, 1888) no.916: Cameron, Jamie, James V Tuckwell (1998), p.206. After James and his French bride, Madeleine of Valois, arrived at Leith in June 1537, Drummond and two helpers spent six weeks taking the guns from the ships off their sea-stocks and mounting them on land-stocks.Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1 (HMSO, Edinburgh, 1957), p. 233. Drummond sailed to France to collect Mary of Guise, the King's second bride. His work continued at Edinburgh Castle, making and mounting new guns. In March 1539, the English messenger Henry Ray was told by a \\"secret friend\\" who was an associate of the banished Earl of Angus and an officer of the Scottish royal ordnance that 16 great cannons or culverins and 60 smaller guns had been refurnished or newly made in Edinburgh Castle. All the guns would be ready 20 days after Easter.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 4 (London, 1836), pp. 153-6: Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol.14 part 1 (London, 1894), no.635, Norfolk to Cromwell, 29 March 1539: for the exchequer record for this work, see Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol.7 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 209-231 After working at Crawfordjohn and cladding the new Register House at Edinburgh Castle with imported 'Eastland' oak boards in July 1541, in August he went to the woods of Calder for twenty days and cut down 'ane hundredth grete treis' to make wheels for the artillery carts. For this he paid the forester a duty of fourpence a tree and then the timber was carted to Edinburgh.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 497-500 In March 1542, when a cannon had been successfully cast at Edinburgh Castle, Drummond paid the wood-carver Andrew Mansioun to engrave the royal arms and date on the barrel. In the same month the Mary Willoughby delivered three cannons bought from Hans Anderson in Flanders. Drummond directed the workmen who unloaded the double-cannon and two great culverin-moyanes at Leith and laid them on the Shore. After an extra difficulty when the draught horses refused at the gate of Edinburgh castle, the guns were mounted using a crane.Accounts of the High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8, (1908), 121, 123, 127, (Mansioun also engraved brasses for memorials, see ibid. pp. xxvii-xxviii) John Drummond was also in charge of the manufacture of gunpowder at Edinburgh. At the start of the war with England called the Rough Wooing, John was with the gunners who defended Edinburgh Castle from Lord Hertford's army in May 1544. In September 1545, Drummond was summoned from his home to help carry the artillery towards the English border.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8, p. 408. In September 1547 he was working at Dunbar Castle, and led the artillery train from Edinburgh Castle to the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), pp. 112-120. John was given livery clothes at Christmas,Melanie Schuessler Bond, Dressing the Scottish Court: 1543-1553 (Boydell: Woodbridge, 2019), pp. 137, 584. the last time in 1550, and thereafter there is no further record.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 461. Family and homes According to the family history of 1681, his mother was a daughter of the Laird of Craigie-Ross. John married a daughter of the Laird of Logie-Bisset, and they had a daughter who married Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig. John's brother, David Drummond, succeeded him at Milnab.Lord Strathallan's Genealogy of the House of Drummond (Edinburgh, 1831), pp. 60, 62. A royal charter of 7 May 1527 sets out that his daughter Jonet and her heirs would inherit Milnab. A charter of 19 July 1536 gave lands near Haddington with Milnab to him and his wife, Christiane Brogy, without mentioning Jonet. A subsequent charter of 20 April 1541, apportions the lands to all three. The latest charter also seems to be the one mentioning 'bellicarum ejaculator' quoted but wrongly dated by the family historian . It would seem that from this sequence that Christiane Brogy was John's second wife, but there is no record of Jonet's marriage. The lands near Haddington at Ballencreiff neighboured those granted to other royal servants, Robert Borthwick, gun founder to James IV, and Robert Gibb of Carriber, a master of the stable of James V.Register of the Privy Seal: 1513-1546 (Edinburgh, 1883), p. 102 no. 453, p. 357 no. 1603, p. 535 no. 2338.

At the time of independence in 1947, it acceded to Pakistan. The two senior battalions of Bahawalpur Regiment trace their origin to 1827, when the Nawab of Bahawalpur first organized his forces. In 1848, Bahawalpur State actively supported the British war effort during the Second Sikh War with 7000 infantry and 2500 cavalry, who were engaged in operations near Multan.

However, in 1901, the force was disbanded and in its place, Bahawalpur raised a camel baggage train with an escort of mounted infantry, called the Bahawalpur Imperial Service Mounted Rifles and Camel Transport Corps, which would go on to become the 1st Bahawalpur Sadiq Battalion in 1924. In 1912, the colour of their uniform was khaki with green facings.Head, RW. (1981). The Bahawalpur Army. =The First World War= During the First World War, Bahawalpur State Forces, served in Egypt, Palestine, East Africa, Mesopotamia, Baluchistan and the North West Frontier of India.350px A detachment of 73 men from the Bahawalpur Mounted Rifles was sent to Egypt as reinforcement for the Alwar State Infantry Battalion with whom it served throughout the war; except briefly in 1915, when it served with the Bikaner Camel Corps. In February 1915, Turkey launched an attack on Suez Canal from Palestine. The detachment of Bahawalpur Mounted Rifles took part in reconnaissance of the Turkish advance and then pursuit of the retreating Turks after their attack was repulsed. It then served on line of communication during the British advance into Palestine, in the Third Battle of Gaza and the Battle of Megiddo, which resulted in Turkish defeat. In Palestine, it operated in the Jordan Valley and took part in the capture of Amman. Meanwhile, the rest of the Camel Corps was dispatched to the Persian Gulf in November 1914 in support of the Indian Expeditionary Force. However, the detachment soon returned, as the camels were no longer required. In February 1915, a detachment of 38 men and 100 camels was sent to Jubaland in British East Africa but returned in November after the death of most of the camels. From May 1917 to January 1918, the Bahawalpur Camel Transport Corps operated with the South Waziristan Field Force against hostile Mahsud tribesmen, while between March and May 1918, it took part in a punitive expedition against rebellious Marri and Khetran tribesmen in Baluchistan. =Post First World War= In 1917, Bahawalpur State raised the Imperial Service Double Company, which was designated as 2nd Bahawalpur Household Infantry in 1922 and redesignated as 2nd Bahawalpur Haroon Infantry a year later. During the Third Afghan War of 1919, Bahawalpur Mounted Rifles and Camel Transport Corps operated in the Zhob Valley in Baluchistan. After the war, the Camel Corps was disbanded and the remaining elements eventually emerged as the 1st Bahawalpur Sadiq Battalion in 1924. In 1921, Bahawalpur joined the Indian State Forces Scheme, placing its two infantry battalions at the disposal of the Government of India. The Bahawalpur Infantry was mostly composed of Punjabi Muslims. Their uniforms underwent numerous changes, until settling for grey colour in 1930. Ceremonial headdress included the distinctive 'fez', which was unique to the Bahawalpur State Forces. The badges of Bahawalpur Infantry also underwent numerous changes but included the pelican as their central theme.Poulsom, Lt Col NW, and Ahmad, Lt Col RN. (2011). Uniforms & Devices of the Baloch Regiment. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre. =The Second World War= On the outbreak of the Second World War, the Nawab of Bahawalpur placed his forces at the disposal of the British Government. In March 1941, the 1st Bahawalpur Infantry (Sadiq Battalion) was dispatched to Malaya in anticipation of impending hostilities with Japan. The battalion was deployed for the protection of airfields in Kedah in North Malaya. Following the Japanese invasion in December and their rapid advance, the battalion was forced to retreat towards Singapore with the rest of the British forces. On 15 February 1942, it was taken Prisoner of War at Singapore after the British surrender. Captain Mahmood Khan Durrani was awarded the George Cross for displaying outstanding courage, loyalty and fortitude during the harsh and brutal Japanese captivity. On repatriation after the war, the battalion was reformed in 1946. Bahawalpur raised two more battalions in 1940 and 1944. The 4th Battalion was redesignated as 3rd Bahawalpur Light Infantry in 1946 on conversion of the 3rd Battalion into Training Centre. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Battalions remained in India. The Bahawalpur Regiment On independence, Bahawalpur State acceded to Pakistan and in 1952, Bahawalpur Infantry was integrated into Pakistan Army as the Bahawalpur Regiment. The regiment was entirely composed of Punjabi Muslims. The Regimental Centre was based at Dera Nawab Sahib. Uniform of the new regiment was of rifle green colour with scarlet facings. Officers' winter mess kit was of French grey cloth with black cuffs and facings, and blue overalls. Cummerband was rifle green. Cap badge of gilding metal consisted of a pelican surmounted by a star and crescent, the whole surrounded by a date palm wreath, with a scroll below, inscribed 'Bahawalpur Regiment'. Backing for the cap badge was of circular maroon cloth. The lanyard was of maroon cord.Army Dress Regulations 1953. Rawalpindi: Government of Pakistan. In July 1948, 5th Bahawalpur Light Infantry was raised from Muslim officers and men of 2nd Patiala Infantry, who had opted for Pakistan. It was redesignated as 4 Bahawalpur in 1952 (Later 21 Baluch Regiment). In 1956, a major re- organization took place in Pakistan Army and the existing infantry regiments were amalgamated to form larger regimental groups. As a result, the Bahawalpur Regiment was merged with the Baluch Regiment. The new line up of Bahawalpur Infantry with its supporting artillery regiment was: * 1st (Sadiq) Battalion The Bahawalpur Regiment - 8th Battalion The Baluch Regiment - 1st Abbasia * 2nd (Haroon) Battalion The Bahawalpur Regiment - 9th Battalion The Baluch Regiment * 3rd (Abbas) Battalion The Bahawalpur Regiment - 20th Battalion The Baluch Regiment * 4th Battalion The Bahawalpur Regiment - 21st Battalion The Baluch Regiment Battle honours of the Bahawalpur Regiment *Battle honours awarded by the Governments of British India and PakistanRodger, Alexander.

He led the first performance on 26 November 1724, concluding the liturgical year of 1724. The cantata is based upon Jakob Ebert's hymn \\"\\". It matches the Sunday's prescribed gospel reading, the Tribulation from the Gospel of Matthew, in a general way. The hymn's first and last stanza are retained unchanged in both text and tune: the former is set as a chorale fantasia, the latter as a four- part closing chorale. An unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas as alternating arias and recitatives. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of natural horn, enforcing the soprano in the hymn tune, two oboes d'amore, strings and basso continuo.  History and text  Bach wrote the cantata in 1724 for the 25th Sunday after Trinity as part of his second annual cycle of mostly chorale cantatas. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, the coming of the Lord (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Tribulation (). The cantata text of an unknown author is based exclusively on Jakob Ebert's hymn in seven stanzas (1601). The librettist of Bach's chorale cantata cycle is not known,but Bach scholar Christoph Wolff notes that \\"he must have worked closely with Bach\\" and names as \\"the most likely candidate\\" Andreas St√∂bel, a co- rector of the Thomasschule. The first and last stanza in their original wording are the outer movements, stanzas 2 to 4 were transformed to movements 2 to 4, and stanzass 5 and 6 were rephrased for movement 5. The hymn is in a general way related to the gospel. Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 26 November 1724, which was that year the last Sunday of the liturgical year. The parts show that Bach performed it at least once more but not until after 1740.  Music  = Structure and scoring = Bach structured the cantata in six movements. The text and tune of the hymn are kept in the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame a sequence of alternating arias and recitatives. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four- part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of natural horn (Co) enforcing the soprano in the hymn tune, two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. The title page of the autograph score reads: \\"Dom: 25 post Trinit. / Du Friede F√ºrst Herr Jesu / Christ ect. / √† / 4 Voc: / ~~Tromba~~ / 2 Hautb: d'Amour / 2 Violini / viola / con / Continuo / di / Sign: / J.S.Bach\\". In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. = Movements = = 1 = The opening chorus, \\"\\" (You Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ), is a chorale fantasia, the soprano singing the cantus firmus, supported by the horn. The composer of the tune is not known. It appeared in a hymnal by Bartholom√§us Gesius in 1601, and is similar to \\"Innsbruck, ich mu√ü dich lassen\\". The melody is embedded in an orchestral concerto with ritornellos and interludes, dominated by the concertante solo violin. The treatment of the lower voices is varied within the movement. In lines 1 and 2 and the final 7 they are set in homophonic block chords. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the salutation \\"Du Friedef√ºrst, Herr Jesu Christ, wahr' Mensch und wahrer Gott\\" (You prince of peace, Lord Jesus Christ, true man and true God) thus receives weight. In lines 3 and 4 the lower voices begin in vivid imitation before the entrance of the cantus firmus. In lines 5 and 6 their faster movement contrasts to the melody. = 2 = The alto aria, \\"\\" (Alas, the agony is unspeakable), is accompanied by an oboe d'amore as an equal partner, expressing the soul's terror imagining the judgement. Hofmann notes that \\"Bach has captured the expression of deep sadness in the music with all the tools of his trade: sighing figures, suspensions and augmented, diminished or chromatic melodic intervals: the harmony is full of dissonances.\\" = 3 = The recitative for tenor, \\"\\" (Yet consider, o Jesus), begins as a secco recitative, but the idea \\"\\" (Yet consider, o Jesus, that you are still called a Prince of Peace!), close to the theme of the cantata, is accompanied by a quote of the chorale tune in the continuo. = 4 = Rare in Bach's cantatas, three voices sing a trio. In the text \\"\\" (Ah, we recognize our guilt)\\", they illustrate the \\"\\" (we), confessing and asking forgiveness together. The voices are accompanied only by the continuo. = 5 = The recitative for alto, \\"\\" (Ah, then through the harsh rod), is a prayer for lasting peace, accompanied by the strings and ending as an arioso. = 6 = The closing chorale, \\"\\" (Illumine our minds and hearts as well), is a four-part setting for the choir, horn, oboes and strings.

It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). The church's original property, which subsequently housed other Protestant congregations, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, but has since been torn down. The present complex was built in 1952 and contains two buildings that are contributing properties in the Vander Veer Park Historic District. The present church building was completed in 2007. History =Development of the Lutheran Church in Davenport= The Lutheran Church was the last mainline Protestant congregation to organize in Davenport. Early attempts were made among the German immigrants, but they were met with only minimal success. In 1861, a German Lutheran minister was sent to Davenport. A year later he started organizing First German Evangelical Lutheran Zion Church and a building was erected in 1866. Theological disagreements erupted within the congregation and the pastor and a group of parishioners left to form Trinity German Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1869. They affiliated with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. Zion languished until a new wave of German immigration came into the city in the 1870s. They continued German language services until World War I. Both Zion and Trinity remain in existence. There is some evidence that early in the 1850s there were efforts to establish an English Lutheran Church as well. Property had been acquired in Green's second addition to the city of Davenport by the trustees of the First English Lutheran Church. There was a stipulation that a two-story building, no less than be constructed on the property. The condition was not met and the property was forfeited. The Davenport banking firm of Cook & Sargent was involved in the transaction. = Formation of the congregation = The Rev. George W. Snyder was commissioned to Davenport by the board of home missions on April 1, 1879. He had spent the previous year canvassing the city with the Rev. G.W. Diveley and was able to get the signatures of thirty people who wanted to belong to the new congregation. The congregation was affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa on October 30, 1879, but no services or other functions were held by the congregation until a church building was constructed. Snyder was able to raise $4,000 and secure property on the corner of Main and 14th Streets for $1,740. The first church building was built during the autumn of 1881 and the first service for the new congregation was held on January 22, 1882. The Sunday School, which was also organized that day, counted 34 students. The charter members of the new congregation included: H. B. Martin, Mrs. A. S. Martin, Jane Rhodes, Bernhard Reilley, Catherine Reilley, Anna A. Reilley, Philip Garner, Susan Garner, Lucinda Garner (who later became Mrs. John Roth) and Laura B. Snyder. The small church was dedicated on April 30, 1882. Rev. G. W. Stelling, of Omaha, Nebraska, preached the sermon. Also assisting at the service were Rev. J. W. Goodlin, the secretary of the board of home missions, and Rev. S. D. Barnitz, the western secretary of the board. On April 1, 1891, Snyder ended his pastorate at St. Paul's to assume a charge at Council Bluffs, Iowa. The Rev. W. Henry Blancke accepted the call on June 24, 1891. The church building had become too small for the congregation, so a building committee and a finance committee were appointed and plans were developed for a new church. On May 4, 1902, the new sanctuary was dedicated. The new building, organ, and furnishings cost $26,000. Rev. E. F. Bartholomew, from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, preached the dedication sermon in the morning and Rev. J. A. Wirt, of Des Moines, preached the evening sermon. Blancke also served as president of the Civic Federation of Davenport during his pastorate. They employed legal extremes to fight vice and liquor. His continued leadership led to threats against himself, the congregation, and the church building. Membership suffered and fell to 100 in 1916 and the Sunday School had its lowest enrollment. with After Blanke's pastorate ended the congregation grew spiritually, financially, and numerically. =Historic church building= Architecturally, the original 1881 church was a Gothic Revival structure. It featured a simple rectangular form with a steep pitched front-gabled roof, buttresses, and a large pointed-arch window on the main fa√ßade. The 1902 structure, which was attached to the older structure, was also designed in the Gothic Revival style. It featured a cross-gabled plan with towers tucked into the corners.Svendsen, 12.1 The asymmetrical massing and the compactness of the structure emphasized the strong verticality of the structure. The rather plain brick exterior was punctuated with gothic-arched windows that were enhanced with narrow hood molds. An addition to the building was constructed in 1919. Later history 1952 church The house on Lombard Street. By the middle of the 20th-century, the congregation outgrew its facilities yet again. This time the congregation chose to relocate further north and acquired property across Lombard Street from Vander Veer Park, and across Brady Street from the Outing Club. On the property was the E.C. Mueller House at 2136 Brady Street. The Georgian Revival home was designed by the Davenport architectural firm of Temple and Burrows. It was incorporated into the new church complex and housed administrative offices. It and another small house along Lombard Street are contributing properties in the Vander Veer Park Historic District. In 1952 a new sanctuary was built in the Georgian Revival style on the corner of Lombard and Brady Street. It contains of space. The old sanctuary was sold to El Bethel Assembly of God Church in 1952. The property was eventually sold to Third Missionary Baptist Church. They built a new sanctuary and tore the old church down. The location of the old church is now a parking lot for their present church. = Current church building = In 2007 the current St. Paul's sanctuary was built by the congregation. The $7.2 million expansion project was accomplished during the pastorate of Rev. Peter Marty and reflects the existing Georgian Revival style of the church's complex. The architect for the project was Groth Design Group of Cedarburg, Wisconsin and Estes Construction of Davenport was the main contractor. The new worship space is and seats 750 people. It features a tower of light, 10 stained glass windows from the 1952 sanctuary, and a widescreen. Wood craftsman Jay Stratton, glass sculptor Mark Fowler, and custom metal worker Mike Boyler created the altar, pulpit, and sanctuary cross. August Peter created a bronze baptismal font bowl and M.L. Bigelow and Company from American Fork, Utah built the pipe organ. The old sanctuary was turned into a gathering space and a chapel. St. Paul's congregation, which now numbers around 3,000 people, has always been aware of its missionary responsibility. Over the years three other Lutheran churches have been founded from St. Paul's: St. Mark in Davenport, St. James in Bettendorf, and Faith Lutheran in Eldridge. In 1976, the congregation developed Camp Shalom near Maquoketa, Iowa. In more recent years it has housed a Pastoral Residency Program to assist newly called pastors in the ELCA.

Their desire was to put together a local group for competitive barbecue. It has since grown exponentially and provides oversight to hundreds of competitions. It is the largest competitive barbecue organization in the world, with more than 20,000 members. Competitions The Kansas City Barbeque Society is the official sanctioning body of competitive barbeque cooking. Each year, KCBS sanctions more than 500 competitions across the country and has over 20,000 members that consist of Certified BBQ Judges (CBJ's), cook teams, contest reps, contest organizers and all around lovers of great food and community. Competitions are usually coordinated in conjunction with a local festival or events and most often linked to fundraising effort for local, regional and national causes. Teams typically begin to arrive on a Thursday or Friday morning and set up their equipment and share quality time with their \\"BBQ Family\\". Competitors will begin to cook on Friday evening and then throughout the night with a turn in for the various smoked meats some time in the early afternoon on Saturday. The four standard turn in for KCBS cook teams are Chicken, Pork Ribs, Pork Shoulder or Boston Butt and Beef Brisket. Events usually have a cash prize of varying amounts and trophies. Quite often these events draw crowds of spectators numbering in the thousands, and depending on the prize amount, they will draw competitors from several states. KCBS has over the 30+ years of operation become the \\"biggest and best\\" in BBQ and sets the standard for competitive food events around the world. KCBS along with sanctioning competitive food events in the BBQ segment have recently added an entire \\"Grilling\\" or cooked over open flame focus in a division of their organization. The National Grilling Society is a division of KCBS that focuses on grilled or cooked over flame competitive food events that do not focus on the traditional four KCBS meats. Some popular choices are Steak, Hamburger, Chicken Wings, Pork Chop, etc. KCBS is the largest competitive food sanctioning body in the world with a presence all over the globe. Many large retail brands support KCBS in their efforts and have been a contributing factor to the explosive growth and massive presence. These include Igloo Coolers, Reynolds Wrap, Royal Oak Charcoal, Blue Rhino Propane, Cabo Wabo Tequila, BBQ Guru, McCormicks Grillmates and spices, French's, Franks Hot Sauce, Lawry's Compart Duroc Pork, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and so many more household names.

In order to become a Certified Barbeque Judge, one must be at least 16 years of age and attend one of the hundreds of Certified Barbeque Judge classes held each year. A Certified Barbeque Judge attains the status of Master Certified Barbeque Judge after participating in 30 contests, cooking with a competition team, and passing an online exam. Judges at all sanctioned Kansas City Barbecue Society competitions take a judges' oath authored by renowned judge Ardie Davis. Judge's Oath:I do solemnly swear to objectively and subjectively evaluate each Barbeque meat that is presented to my eyes, my nose, my hands and my palate. I accept my duty to be an Official KCBS Certified Judge, so that truth, justice, excellence in Barbeque and the American Way of Life may be strengthened and preserved forever.

It was built from 1881 to 1882 by a chapter of the State Grange of Minnesota, the first state-level subdivision of the National Grange. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its local significance in the themes of agriculture and social history. It was nominated for being a well preserved example of an early meeting hall built by a subordinate Grange. With Origin Crescent Grange Hall #512 is an outgrowth of the Reconstruction era in Minnesota. During this period, rural residents united in response to economic upheaval and high interest rates. Farmers, particularly those in the south and west of the state, struggled to make a living in a volatile and unregulated economy. After the American Civil War, Southern farmers who had exploited enslaved people for their expertise and labor tried to adapt through sharecropping, while farmers on the Western plains faced falling crop prices. Both became increasingly indebted to bankers and merchants who charged high interest rates. Compounding the problem, railroads and food producers charged high tariffs. In 1866, the U.S. Department of Agriculture assigned Oliver Hudson Kelley of Minnesota to assess the situation. Kelley, a successful farmer who owned of land near Elk River, was struck by the social isolation he encountered on farms. In response, he and six colleagues founded the National Grange and Order of the Patrons of Husbandry, which included both men and women as members. His message to farmers was clear: join the movement, find strength in numbers, and secure prosperity through a share of the market. Envisioning a way to counteract the tariffs and fraudulent methods endured by the farmers, Kelley encouraged farmers to form cooperatives through which they could store and sell their crops and compete against middlemen and their high fees. He then organized the State Grange of Minnesota‚Äîthe first such state- level subdivision of the organization‚Äîin 1869. By 1875, the national Grange had grown to 858,000 members. Construction Minnesota's Crescent Grange #512 was organized in Anoka County's Linwood Township in 1874. Until a hall was built, members met at churches and in the homes of charter members. On February 23, 1881, a meeting was held at the home of J. G. Green in which L.O. Tumbler proposed building a hall. J. G. Green offered to donate the land for the project, and the motion carried. On March 25, 1881, Grange #512 members met to cut pine wood from a nearby forest. The men hauled the wood to George Haskell's sawmill near Typo Lake, where they cut it into lumber for building. Construction began in earnest at township 33, range 22, section 4 of Anoka County on the first Saturday in June. Over the summer, members absent from the project were fined one dollar. During this period, the original architectural plans were modified to include sufficient kitchen space. Crescent Grange Hall #512 held its first formal celebration on July 4, 1882, but work on the structure continued until 1884. The one-story, structure is capped by a gabled roof with clapboard siding. The interior contains a meeting room, an auditorium, and a kitchen. In 1916, further embellishments to the hall made by Grange member W.W. Wittig created alcoves on each of side of the building. The front alcove began to serve as an entrance; the one in the rear contained decorative stained glass. Further modifications to save heat and improve acoustics occurred in 1949, when the ceiling was lowered. Use and legacy The hall served as a venue for educating and informing farmers of the best practices in agriculture throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It allowed members to share equipment owned collectively (including a threshing machine and saw) and to use a barn space for both storage and social gatherings for the Granger community. By the turn of the 20th century, the Grange Movement had outlasted the remains of the Farmers' Alliance, a group that called for more explicitly political action and served as a catalyst for the People's Party.

Peabody Institute of Archaeology The Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology, formerly known as the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology, is a learning center and archaeological collection in Andover, Massachusetts. Founded in 1901 through a bequest from Robert Singleton Peabody, an 1857 Phillips Academy alumnus, the institute initially held the archaeological materials collected by Peabody from Native American cultures. Peabody's passionate interest in archaeology led him to create the institute at Phillips Academy to encourage young people's interest in the sciences, and to foster respect and appreciation for the Native American peoples who have inhabited that hemisphere for thousands of years. The Peabody's major collections include artifacts and material from the Southwest, Northeast, Midwest, Mexico, Southeast and the Arctic. The date range represented by these collections spans from Paleo Indian (10,000+ years ago) to the present day. History The Robert S. Peabody Institute has served as a major center for fieldwork, research, and publication since its founding in 1901. Peabody, an 1857 graduate of Phillips Academy, established the Museum as the repository for his collection of approximately 38,000 artifacts and as a place where students could become acquainted with the discipline of archaeology.Concise History of the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and its Collection by Malinda S. Blustain Throughout its history, the institute has been known by several names, including the Department of Archaeology, the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology, the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology, and, most recently, the Robert S. Peabody Institute for Archaeology. As the museum's first director, his son Charles initiated the strong emphasis on research with excavations in 1901 at the Dorr Mound, Mississippi, Jacob's Cavern, Missouri in 1903 and Bushy Cavern, Maryland in 1904, among others. His excavations used an early form of grid system and produced some of the first well-documented evidence of man in association with extinct fauna. His 1904 report on Jacob's Cavern inaugurated the museum's long history of research and publication. Warren K. Moorehead, appointed curator in 1901 and second director in 1924, conducted fieldwork throughout North America. He undertook extensive regional surveys and excavations in the Arkansas River Valley, Northwest Georgia and coastal Maine from 1907 to 1938. Work at Etowah, Hopewell, the Cahokia Mounds, and ‚ÄúRed Paint‚Äù sites in Maine added about 200,000 objects and provided some of the most valuable early collections. Moorehead was appointed by Theodore Roosevelt to the Board of Indian Commissioners in 1909. He investigated claims of fraud at the Annishinabe Reservation at White Earth Minnesota, exposing illegal seizure of reservation land by lumber and land companies. The museum curates photographs documenting the work and gifts from Annishinabe people whose land was eventually returned. Between 1915 and 1929 A. V. Kidder excavated sites in the Pecos Valley, New Mexico and elsewhere in the American southwest. Kidder is known as the ‚Äúfather of archaeology‚Äù for his demonstration of the value of stratigraphic excavation in the Americas.Robert L. Kelly and David Hurst Thomas. Archaeology, 5th Edition. Wadsworth Cengage Learning, Belmont, CA. 2010. With Carl Guthe and Anna O. Shepard, Kidder's analysis resulted in the first full chronology of southwestern archaeology. Inspired by questions raised at Pecos, Carl Guthe and Elsie Clews Parsons conducted ethnographic studies at Jemez and San Ildefonso Pueblos in the first use of analogy with the present as a tool in archaeological interpretation. The excavations at Pecos and related sites recovered more than 25,000 artifacts. Earnest Hooton at Harvard's Peabody Museum studied the more than 2,000 sets of human remains from Pecos in the first physical anthropological study of population groups through time. In 1927 Kidder held the first Pecos Conference, initiating regional archaeological conferences. The Pecos Conferences were first sponsored by the Peabody and later hosted by participating institutions. Third director, Douglas S. Byers, and curator Fred Johnson were national leaders in research and publication from 1938 through 1968. The Robert S. Peabody ‚ÄúFoundation for Archaeological Research‚Äù updated and revised cataloging, artifact storage systems, exhibits and publications. Fieldwork was focused on identifying the New England stratigraphic sequence. Johnson pioneered interdisciplinary paleoecological analysis for archaeological interpretation, applying it first to the Boylston Street Fish Weir in 1939. Excavation of Paleoindian occupations at the Bull Brook and Debert sites during the 1950s and 60s employed Pleistocene geology as an analytical tool. Extensive work was also undertaken in the Yukon and in Mexico. These excavations, plus several significant private collections, added another 200,000 objects. The RSPM hosted the initial meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in 1935 and inaugurated the Massachusetts Archaeological Society five years later. During the 1950s Fred Johnson chaired the American Anthropological Association committee linking the needs of archaeologists with the expertise of Willard F. Libby to develop Carbon 14 dating for archaeological sites. The Peabody hosted the 1954 Conference on Radiocarbon Dating and the 1956 International Conference on Radiocarbon Dating with representatives from seven European countries, Canada, and the United States. In 1968, Richard ‚ÄúScotty‚Äù MacNeish was appointed Director. His major excavations in Mexico, Peru, and Belize investigated the origins of agriculture. MacNeish's discoveries of early corn and the pre-ceramic sequence in Mexico provided crucial insight into plant and animal domestication and the beginnings of sedentary life in the New World. This work is considered one of the most important interdisciplinary studies in 20th century American archaeology. His contributions to archaeology were acknowledged through more than a dozen medals and honors, including his election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1974. The Museum curates the type collections published in the Tehuacan volumes and the personal papers, field notes, maps, photographs and publications constituting the MacNeish library and archives. The museum was dormant after MacNeish's 1983 departure until the arrival of James W. Bradley in 1990. Bradley renamed the institution the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and revived the museum's research and educational functions, achieved broad use of the museum's resources within Phillips Academy, inaugurated highly successful expeditionary learning programs and reactivated the Research Associate program. Innovative work directed toward NAGPRA compliance resulted in a national model for partnerships with tribes. Bradley's emphasis on collection management, acquisition of significant private collections, and building relations with native communities, avocational archaeologists, educators and professional museum and archaeology constituencies, rebuilt the museum's national significance. In November 2017, the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology was renamed the Robert S. Peabody Institute of Archaeology in order to more accurately reflect the institution's mission and to avoid confusion with other similarly named institutions. The Peabody Today Today, under director Dr. Ryan Wheeler, the Peabody continues its primary role as a teaching museum and educational resource for Phillips Academy and its community. Collections The Robert S. Peabody Institute curates artifacts, archives, books, and images that pertain to indigenous cultures of the Americas, past and present. These materials reflect a century of archaeological field research, much of which was cutting edge science for its time. They also mirror the diverse interests of Peabody directors and curators. While not a primary focus, the museum also curates a small collection of European Paleolithic material as well as several small post contact historical archaeology collections. The Peabody artifact collections are organized into three distinct categories: research, education, and comparative collections. The strengths of the three collection categories are well documented, particularly the archaeological research collection which continues to be an important resource for professional scholarly research. The Peabody archives, library, and image collections support the museum's artifact collections and serve as a resource for the Phillips Academy, archaeological, scholarly, native, and museum communities as well as the public on occasion. The primary users of the Peabody collections are:RSPM Collections Plan, internal document *Phillips Academy faculty and students through student workduty, classroom visits and collections tours and independent projects. *Archaeological, scholarly, and museum communities through research queries, visits, publications, and artifact loans. *Native communities through research and repatriation requests primarily in connection with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. *Massachusetts Archaeological Society Northeast Chapter members, the general public, and other interested groups through attendance at lectures, exhibits and/or education programs. NAGPRA The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was passed in 1990 and provides a process for museum and federal agencies to return human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony to their descendent Native American Communities. The Peabody Museum is in full compliance with the NAGPRA law for culturally affiliated materials. In 1999, the Peabody took part in the largest American repatriation to date in collaboration with the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University and the Pecos National Historic Park. Together they returned approximately 2,000 sets of human remains and 1,020 burial and ceremonial objects to the Pueblo of Jemez. Most of the human remains had been housed at the Harvard Peabody while the majority of the artifacts were returned by the RSPM. These remains were from sites within the Pecos Valley, including Pecos Pueblo, Rowe Ruin, Loma, Lothrop, and Dick's Ruin, outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico.Slayman, Andrew. \\"Mass Reburial\\" Archaeology, Vol. 52 No. 4. July/August 1999. Pecos Pueblo was excavated by A.V. Kidder from 1915-1929. Artifacts uncovered by Kidder were sent back to the RSPM and to Harvard. The Pecos repatriation remains the largest single repatriation in NAGPRA history and has fostered an ongoing relationship between the Pueblo of Jemez, Pecos Pueblo National Historic Park, and the Robert S. Peabody Museum.Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, 1st Session. Senate. May 26, 1999. Page 11015. References External links *Robert S.

She gathers the neighborhood to start a protest during the mayor's award speech. Keith decides to propose to Bree, but Bree says she‚Äôs not ready and they compromise on Keith moving in. As he is packing his things, Richard (Keith‚Äôs father) convinces him that Bree doesn‚Äôt care for him. Keith starts to doubt Bree and his relationship and decides to not move in. On the day of the protest Richard (who is in love with Bree) asks to do some landscaping chores but makes a move on Bree and she forces him out. Bree tells Keith about this and in the result of his anger before Richard leaves he starts a fistfight with Richard. Gaby is still trying to cope with her biological daughter, Grace, leaving her forever causing Juanita to become suspicious. Gaby seeks help from Lynette and she suggests that Gaby write a letter to Grace that would never be sent. Gaby does so, but Juanita discovers it and reads it causing her to find out that Grace is Gaby's daughter and she is not. Juanita flees the house into the streets of the protest, causing her to get lost in the hundreds of people. She crawls into Bob and Lee's car who are fleeing Wisteria Lane since the neighborhood is angry with them for selling their house to Paul (due to Paul's lying about another neighbor selling to him). As Richard and Keith are fighting a few neighbors spot them and mistake Keith to be an ex-con. They start to fight with Keith and in a rush to defend her boyfriend, Bree fires a gunshot into the air hoping it will break up the fight. It only makes matters worse and all the people on the street start a riot and stampede. Susan gets knocked over and gets injured from people stepping on her and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, as Bob and Lee are trying to escape the riot and are unaware of Juanita being in the backseat, people try to tip over and break the windows of the car. Juanita reveals herself and Bob and Lee climb into the backseat trying to comfort her as she is shrieking for help. Gaby finally catches sight of Juanita in the backseat and tries to rush to her aid, but before she gets there, a crazy neighbor uses a baseball bat to completely shatter the backseat window. Gaby rips the man off, while Carlos comes and pushes aside several rioters and they both bring Juanita home. Bob successfully escapes the car and tries to help Lee escape, but the neighbors are repeatedly punching and hitting Lee. One neighbor even threw an empty wine bottle at Lee's head. Lynette quickly runs to Lee's aid and he successfully escapes injured. Lynette blames and scolds Paul for starting this whole mess and Paul responds by saying: \\"Me? Those are your friends out there, Lynette! The solid citizens of Fairview! Tell me again why you think they're better than a bunch of ex-cons.\\" The riot is exactly what Paul Young wanted to happen. At the end of the episode, when the riot is finally over, while walking down the street of Wisteria Lane, he is shot by an unknown assailant, knowing it was revenge.

The mountain sits at the point where the main northeast-facing escarpment of the Black Mountains meets the northwest facing escarpment, the next peak to the west being Twmpa. The flat summit of Hay Bluff which is marked by a triangulation pillar at a height of overlooks the middle Wye Valley and the book town of Hay-on-Wye. The hill is largely within the Welsh county of Powys though parts of its eastern flanks lie within the English county of Herefordshire.  Geology  The base and indeed greater part of the hill is formed from mudstones of the St Maughans Formation whilst the upper part is formed from the sandstones and mudstones of the Senni Formation (formerly known as the 'Senni Beds'), both of which are assigned to the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. A number of small quarries have been worked on its slopes in the past, not least for the Ffynnon Limestone, a calcrete which crops out along the northeastern and northwestern flanks of the hill at the base of the Senni Formation.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 214 Talgarth & accompanying sheet explanation  Access  The Offa's Dyke national trail makes a steep ascent of the hill's northern slopes and then heads south eastwards along the broad ridge of the Black Mountain and the Hatterrall Ridge. A more gentle path to the summit follows the crest of the northwest- facing scarp, known as Ffynnon y Parc, from the road summit about 1 mile / 1.7 km to the southwest at Gospel Pass. There is also a clear, but unpaved path which passes along the edge of the escarpment to the east with good views over the countryside towards Hay-on-Wye. It leads to the trig point at the Black Hill (Herefordshire), and continues on to the south-east dropping down the stony knife-edge ridge towards Longtown. There is a small car park where the ridge drops into the Olchon valley, about 2 miles north of Longtown itself.

The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It has since been torn down and it was delisted from the National Register in 2008. The theatre building has been significantly altered since a fire in the 1920s. Both, however, remain important to the history of the city of Davenport. Burtis‚ÄìKimball House Hotel The original Burtis Hotel with the first bridge across the Mississippi River behind it. The building became a factory before being destroyed in a fire in 1915. The first phase of hotel construction in Davenport lasted from 1836, when the city was founded, until just before the Civil War. Most of these hotels were small and were located near the Mississippi River to take advantage of the passengers disembarking from the riverboats. The second phase marked the arrival of the railroad when the first bridge to cross the Mississippi was opened between Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport in 1856. Two years later J.J. Burtis, who had operated the LeClaire House in Davenport, opened his own hotel. It had an entrance on the mainline of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. The hotel rose to prominence in 1861 when Iowa Governor Samuel Kirkwood made the hotel his Civil War headquarters as the telegraph lines did not extend any further west. A new railroad bridge replaced the original one in 1872, and Burtis built a new hotel along the new mainline of the railroad at Fourth and Perry Streets in 1874. The block was already the site of the Burtis Opera House. The new hotel featured its own train platform as well as telephone, telegraph, and an elevator. In 1880 the name of the hotel was changed to the Kimball House and it was advertised as the \\"largest and best hotel in Iowa.\\" After 1900 the Kimball House was eclipsed by the third phase of hotel building in the city that included the Hotel Davenport, the Hotel Blackhawk, and the Hotel Mississippi. The hotel was transformed into an apartment building and renamed the Perry Apartments. Future US President Ronald Reagan lived in the building when he worked for radio station WOC from 1932‚Äì1933. In 1939 the building was heavily damaged by fire. Bill Vale was paid $5,000 to tear it down, and then bought the property for $25,000. He put in bout $12,000 in repairs, and renamed the building the Vale Apartments. As time went on the building started to decline. While attempts were made to save it, the building had become structurally unsafe and was torn down in 1993. Burtis Opera House The former Burtis Opera House building as it was reconstructed. The Burtis Opera House was opened in Davenport in 1867 at 415 Perry Street. The theater could hold an audience of 1,600 and it was a widely used facility. Mark Twain spoke to a sold-out house on his \\"The American Vandal Abroad\\" tour in 1869. In March 1874 Susan B. Anthony lectured on the woman's right to vote. Al Jolson performed on the stage years after he worked as a singing waiter at Brick Munro's Pavilion in Bucktown. The Quad City Symphony Orchestra played its first concert as the Tri-City Symphony in the Burtis on March 29, 1916. The Burtis was an elegant building constructed in the Second Empire style. It featured a mansard roof with heavily hooded dormer windows. A bracketed cornice defined the transition from the roofline to wall elevation. A projecting pavilion with its own mansard roof contained the building's main entrance in the center of the fa√ßade. On April 26, 1921, an arsonist set fire to the building and it was largely destroyed. Charles T. Kindt, the building's owner and operator of the opera house, had the damaged building remodeled for the Thomas Cusack Company, an outdoor advertising firm from Chicago. Kindt was the was district manager of the firm's Davenport branch. The Chicago architectural firm of Zimmerman, Saxe & Zimmerman designed the building's renovation, which was built by John Soller & Sons. Zimmerman worked nationally for Cusack, the world's largest outdoor ad firm at the time. The building's appearance was altered in the rebuilding process. The third story with its mansard roof, as well as the second floor, were not retained. The pilasters on the corners were shortened and a simple cornice was added across the top. The roof is flat and a raised parapet defines the main entrance. The arched windows that flanked the center pavilion were retained in an altered form. The building's style now resembles the Renaissance Revival style. By 1925 the building housed the General Outdoor Advertising Company. It was later occupied by a VFW post and state offices. The building stands on its own next to the raised railroad tracks since the Kimball House/Vale Apartments and the rail station have been torn down. Tri- City Electric occupied the building for several years before the United States Department of Veteran Affairs. In 2020 the building was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District as the Thomas Cusack Co. District Headquarters.

The site was inhabited from the Proto-Iberian period (7th century BC) to the Late Iberian period (2nd to 1st centuries BC). The site was walled and covered around 10 hectares. The archaeological site has been known from the mid-18th century, although it was first excavated archaeologically in 1956, with later campaigns as recent as 2011.  Toponymy  Coins with the name 'Kelin' written in Iberian script have been found both at the site and through the Iberian Peninsula. The coins are Iberian ases and semis and were minted sometime between the mid-2nd and early 1st centuries BC. Remains found around Caudete de las Fuentes itself indicate that the main settlement moved to the banks of the Madre river following romanisation of the area from the 2nd century BC. From this new location arose the Latin name Caput Aquae (water source) from which the name of the modern town derives, via Muslim Qabdaq and Valencian Cabdet.  Iberian polity?  Kelin may have been the capital of a complex Iberian polity covering much of the submeseta de Utiel-Requena. At 10 hectares in size, and with perhaps around 3,800 inhabitants, Kelin is the largest known Iberian site in the area. Throughout its long occupation, the site has a greatest range of imports in the submeseta, suggesting it dominated trading and distribution networks. More written material has also been found at the site than at its neighbours, and it appears to have been the only site to mint coins during the Roman Republican period. Taken together, these indicators suggest Kelin was at least the pre-eminent site in the area, and may perhaps have acted as a form of capital controlling the surrounding area.  Description of the site  Two zones of house remains can be seen at the present site, showing the evolution of building styles from the 7th to 2nd century BC. The houses have elongated rectangular rooms with few internal divisions. The materials used were a stone foundation and adobe brick walls. At the edge of the site, a section of wall is visible as well as a quarry which may have provided building material for the wall or houses. The pottery found at the site includes hand-made forms, some of which imitate wheel-made forms, as well as remains of amphorae, Western Phoenician storage containers and Iberian Red Slip ware.

In the 1940s, Germany‚Äôs biggest chemical industry conglomerate established a committee to explore screw technology in mixing and kneading applications. Three men who served on that committee would go on to become founding fathers of modern processing technology. One of them, Heinz List, became the first engineer to seriously explore the feasibility of concentrated solid-fluid reactions. Until then, such processes had been thought to be impractical due to the presence of highly viscous, solid, and crusty phases. Heinz List believed he could overcome these difficulties, and that the future lay in solvent-free processing.  Background  During World War II, BAYER-Werk, part of the former IG Farben Company (IG Farben was founded on December 25, 1925 as a merger of six companies including BASF, Bayer, Hoechst, and Agfa), initiated research to explore screw technology in mixing and kneading applications. Three men who served on that committee would go on to become the founding fathers of modern processing technology. Rudolph Erdmenger would later develop the co-rotating twin screw machine, the ZSK- Extruder. Siegfried Kiesskalt went on to pioneer special counter rotating screw extruder designs. A third committee member, Heinz List, was assigned the study of ‚Äúspecial designs‚Äù. It was here that he first developed the concept for a single-screw-machine that combined oscillation with screw rotation. This design ultimately evolved into the continuously operating Ko-Kneader. Coincidentally, the introduction of the Ko-Kneader corresponded with the rapid development of the plastics industry. To date, over 3000 Ko-Kneader systems have been sold worldwide. During this time, Heinz List also became the first engineer to seriously explore the feasibility of solid-fluid reactions. Until then, such reactions were thought to be impractical due to the highly viscous and solid phases. List, however, believed that the answer lay in developing technology for concentrated, solvent-free processes.  Inventor of the Co- Kneader  List‚Äôs first design was a single-screw machine that combined oscillation with rotation, and ultimately evolved into the commercially successful Co-Kneader. By 1965 he had developed the twin-shaft All Phases processor, the first machine that could reliably and safely process highly viscous, pasty and crust-forming products.  High Viscosity Processing  In 1966, Heinz List established his own company to further develop the field of high-viscosity processing. Heinz List established the LIST Dry Processing Group based on the following: Machines that can handle multiple phase transitions (wet, pasty, viscous, powdery, granular) in one working step provide maximum energy efficiency and process yield. Future processing technology will depend on machines that can efficiently handle large working volumes, are self-cleaning, offer a wide range of residence times, and exhibit excellent mixing and kneading performance during wet, pasty and viscous phases.  LIST KneaderReactor Technology  The company‚Äôs first successes were in simple drying and kneading applications. Subsequently, LIST Kneader Reactor technology showed that it could effectively combine multiple phases and process steps ‚Äî reaction, crystallization, drying, melting, mixing, kneading and evaporation ‚Äî in a single machine. It was this thinking that led List to develop the Mixing Kneader Technology, a new generation of processing technology. In 1969, the AP (All Phases) system was developed and was the first twin shaft machine. In 1972, the company reached another milestone with the development of the single-shaft DISCOTHERM-B.  Polymer Processing Hall of Fame  Though Heinz List died in 1988, he is remembered both as a pioneering engineer ‚Äî one of only 26 members of the Polymer Processing Hall of Fame at the University of Akron, Ohio, USA ‚Äî and as a business leader. Under his sons J√∂rg and Klaus List, the company has thrived and expanded into new industries: polymers, fibers and food. Today LIST is world leader in numerous industries, including TDI, Sugar Replacer, ABS, Fiber Spinning Solutions, SAP (Super Absorbent Polymers), and EPDM. LIST Today Headquartered in Switzerland, and with offices in the US and Singapore, LIST is the worldwide technology leader and forerunner in dry or concentrated processing focusing on processes that operate without the use of solvents.

(1991). Voices of the Self: A study of language competence. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. Gilyard's autoethnography offers a poignant portrayal of his life as a student in the American public school system during childhood and adolescence. The chapters vary between narrative stories of how Gilyard communicates in different social situations and scholastic analyses of those experiences. One of the major themes of the autoethnography is that, as Gilyard explains, African-American males in the public school system have difficulties developing a strong sense of self because of the inherent contradictory in-school and out-of-school literacy practices in which African-Americans participate. Following a model similar to James Paul Gee's \\"specialist varieties of language\\",Gee, J. (2004). Situated language and learning: A critique of traditional schooling. New York: Routledge. Gilyard explains the various sociocultural factors that influenced his decisions to use certain varieties or dialects of language depending on the context of individual situations. The book progresses with abrupt changes between chapters written as Gilyard the academic scholar (written in a style that highlights the aspects of what Gilyard refers to as \\"Standard English\\" and Gilyard the African American male (written in a style that highlights the aspects of \\"Black English\\"). Gilyard refers to this transition as \\"bidialectalism\\", or the ability to code-switch depending on specific social situations.Gass, S. (2006). ‚ÄúFundamentals of Second Language Acquisition.‚Äù Language and Linguistics in Context: Readings and applications for teachers. Eds. H. Luria, D. M. Seymour and T. Smoke. Lawrence Erlbaum: Mahwah, New Jersey. Pp. 43-59. As Gilyard explains, this ability to alter his dialect provided Gilyard with unique opportunities for success. Major themes Standard English competence Standard English, a term that comes with a long history of debate, is generally understood by linguistic and literacy researchers as the language variety emphasized by the American public school system as the acceptable dialectical version of the English language. However, Gilyard argues that because students bring diverse literacy and language practices with them from their home environment, and specifically, African-American students bring \\"Black English\\" into schools and thus are forced to change their language and assimilate to the \\"Standard English\\" of public schools, African-American students have a harder time being successful than their white peers. Code switching Pointing to two scholarly sources, Gilyard explains that code-switching is \\"the ability to move back and forth among languages, dialects, and registers with ease, as demanded by the social situation\\"Elgin, S. H. (1979). What is Linguistics? Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall and that it is also a \\"strategy by which the skillful speaker uses his knowledge of how language choices are interpreted in his community to structure the interaction so as to maximize outcomes favorable to himself\\".Penalosa, F.

It is near the site of the short-lived Popham Colony, founded in 1607 and abandoned the following year. The beach and the surrounding area are considered part of the town of Phippsburg in Sagadahoc County. At the southwestern end of the beach, access is granted via the popular Popham Beach State Park, administered by Maine Bureau of Parks & Lands. The northeastern end of the beach is accessed via paths around historic Fort Popham, a handful of private parking lots and pathways, as well as the Ocean View Campground situated near the boundary of the state park. Popular recreational activities at Popham Beach include walking, beachcombing, sunbathing, sightseeing, kite flying, swimming, and fishing for species such as striped bass and bluefish. Casual hikers also enjoy exploring the remnants of Fort Baldwin on the opposite side of the cove from Fort Popham. The state park is patrolled by lifeguards during the warmer months, with no lifeguards on duty at any time beyond the state park boundary. At low tide, sandbars are exposed that provide brief access to Wood Island and Fox Island. The Pond Island and Seguin Island lighthouses are easily visible from the shores of Popham Beach, and their distinct foghorns are audible for miles around. Pets are allowed on parts of Popham Beach all year round, but there are special rules that apply to pets for parts of the beach in the state park. It is a rule in the state park that you must pick up any waste that your pet may leave behind. But the open part of the beach is considered more pet friendly than its state park counterpart. Popham Beach State Park is a popular day trip destination for area residents, while the cottages (and their access roads) at the northeastern end of the beach are privately owned. There are many cottages available for seasonal rental, as well as a seasonal motel and a bed and breakfast, the latter of which is housed in an old Coast Guard Station. In recent years, increased erosion has threatened the southwestern end of the beach, with massive dune loss at the state park and the area bordering the park, which is home to numerous rental cottages and seasonal residences, along with the Ocean View Campground. Part of the 1999 film Message in a Bottle was filmed at the beach.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in parkland beside a lake. History St Mary's was built in about 1743, and was designed by James Gibbs for Sir John Astley. It replaced an earlier medieval church on the site. Additions were made to it in 1874 by W. C. Banks. These included a north aisle, a bell tower, and a dome. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone, with lead roofs. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a north aisle, a single-bay chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower. At the corners of the church and the tower are rusticated quoins.

History The RUF, the operators of the SBU, was established as a strategy by the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as a way of spreading revolution across Africa. RUF leader Foday Sankoh was trained in Libya at the secret military academy, World Revolutionary Headquarters. He trained along with Liberian President Charles Taylor, who further helped with the founding and solidification of the RUF. Recruitment Most of the recruitment of children to the army was forced. Commonly, RUF members would raid local villages and capture children. After their capture, it was not uncommon to force the children to witness or participate in the torture and killing of their relatives.UNICEF \\"Children as Soldiers\\" Accessed 7 December 2010. For some children, participation in the SBU became viewed as an opportunity. Children were considered ideal candidates by the SBU, as they were seen as \\"easily malleable and in times of conflict, additional factors can contribute to their recruitment as soldiers including poverty, education and employment, family and friends, politics and ideology, and culture and tradition.\\" One girl noted that she came to like the RUF who captured her, as she said, \\"They offered me a choice of shoes or dresses. I have never had decent shoes before.\\" For others, benefits included a limited education that had long been diminished in their home towns. They were able to use scraps from textbooks and receive training in the art of bush-warfare. This presented an opportunity for educationally starved children to exert themselves and show off their skills. Actions of the SBU During training, children were taught how to mutilate people. One common technique was the cutting off of civilians' limbs. Children were instructed to get the subject on the ground and shove the gun barrel to the back of the person's neck. Once he was helpless, another boy takes the victim's arm and lays it on a piece of wood then brings the machete down on it to make an amputation. After this step, the child soldier was free to cut anything else, including lips, nose and removing internal organs and making the victim eat them.Sweeney, John. \\"Sierra Leone: Boys Taught to Torture and Maim\\" Daily Mail and Guardian. Daily Mail and Guardian. Accessed 7 December 2010. As of 2010, Sierra Leone has an estimated 10,000 amputees, one of the highest rates in the world, largely due to the actions of the SBU.Sheila, Burke. \\"Child Soldiers and the War in Sierra Leone\\" Sierra Express Media. Accessed 7 December 2010. When members of the SBU came across a pregnant woman, the children would argue the sex of the child, then use a machete to cut the womb to discover the sex. Psychological effects There were numerous psychological effects that resulted from being part of the SBU. In particular, these children suffered severe flashbacks. For some, the worst memory was when the rebels came to their home. One child soldier remembers how they poured petrol over the mother, father, two brothers and sister and set fire to them, watching as they ran around, burning alive before her capture. Many children who have been child soldiers \\"report psycho-social disturbances ‚Äî from nightmares and angry aggression that is difficult to control to strongly anti-social behavior.\\"IRIN \\"Africa: Too Small to Be Fighting in Anyone's War\\" Humanitarian News and Analysis from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Accessed 7 December 2010. Much of this was because the army forced the children to consume drugs, most notably cocaine and LSD, in order to loosen their inhibitions. The consequence of this was that the children suffered with addiction to drugs after the war and health related problems. In addition, many of the children were branded or forcibly tattooed with the letter of their affiliated army, serving as a constant reminder of what they had been through. In order to help with this issue, UNICEF founded a relief project that provided a service to remove tattoos and disguise them. In addition to removing the weapon from the child and taking them out of conflict, it is also important that the child be reintegrated into a family setting and a strong community environment. International policy and intervention Prior to the war, in 1989, the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted by the UN General Assembly that developed law and policy directed specifically at children. The Convention, which is universally binding and non-negotiable, highlights rights that are unique to those under the age of 18.UNICEF \\"Convention on the Rights of the Child\\" United for Children. Accessed 7 December 2010. There are two optional protocols included in the Convention; one pertaining specifically to the restriction on using children as soldiers. Specifically, it establishes \\"18 as the minimum age for compulsory recruitment and requires States to do everything they can to prevent individuals under the age of 18 from taking a direct part in hostilities.\\" It is clear that Sierra Leone violated this Convention during the war. In 1998, during the final years of the war, the UN established the United Nations Observer Missions in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) \\"to monitor the military and security situation, as well as facilitate the disarmament and demobilization of former combatants.\\"UNOMSILM. \\"Sierra Leone- UNOMSILM Mandate\\". United Nations. Accessed 7 December 2010. In 1999, Sierra Leone signed the Lom√© Convention, which lead to the formation of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone leading to the disarmament and demobilization of more than 75,000 ex-fighters, including child soldiers.\\"UNAMSIL: United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone. \\"Peace and Security Section of the Department of Public Information in Cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations\\" United Nations. Accessed 7 December 2010. On 6 January 2002, the Special Court for Sierra Leone was established by the Sierra Leone government and the UN to prosecute those involved in the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since November 1996. Following trial, 5 leaders of the RUF were indicted for their crimes. Additionally, as of 2007 and still ongoing until 2010, Charles Taylor is facing eleven charges relating to terrorizing the civilian population, murder, sexual violence (rape and sexual slavery), physical violence (cutting off limbs), using child soldiers (under the age of 15), enslavement (forced labor) and looting. During the prosecution phase of the trial, Taylor denied recruiting or using children as combatants and claims to have no knowledge that children were being used as soldiers in Sierra Leone.Sesay, Alpha. \\"Prosecutors Accuse Charles Taylor Of Using Child Soldiers In Liberia.\\" AllAfrica.

The Southwark North by-election, 1927 was a parliamentary by-election for the British House of Commons constituency of Southwark North held on 28 March 1927. The election was won by Edward Strauss of the Liberal Party, regaining the seat from the Labour Party. Vacancy The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Labour MP, Leslie Haden-Guest. Haden-Guest had represented Southwark North since the 1923 general election but found himself increasingly at odds with official Labour Party policy.The Times, 1 March 1927 p9 The immediate cause of Haden-Guest‚Äôs resignation from the Parliamentary Labour Party was the policy the party had adopted in respect of the Chinese Civil War. Haden-Guest believed that Labour‚Äôs policy was tantamount to a call for intervention in the civil war and was therefore in contravention to the policy agreed at the party conference in Margate in 1926 and that as a consequence British citizens in Shanghai would be put at risk.The Times, 1 March 1927 p9 Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald called on Haden-Guest to resign his seat, assuming that Labour would be able to hold it in the ensuing by-election.The Times, 2 March 1927 p16 Haden-Guest declared that he was willing to contest a by-election, standing as an Independent Constitutionalist. There was never any Constitutional Party as such with any centralised organisation but it fielded candidates in the 1924 general election in constituencies where local Conservative and Liberal parties were willing to join forces against socialism.Chris Cook, Sources in British Political History 1900-1951: Volume 1 Organisations and Societies; Macmillan, 1975 p75 Haden-Guest sought local Conservative Party backing for his candidacy, attending a meeting of the North Southwark Conservative Association on 3 March 1927 ‚Äì although making it clear he would not stand as a Conservative. The Tories endorsed his stance against Labour‚Äôs Chinese policy which they described as ‚Äòanti-British‚Äô and their candidate, Rear Admiral Humphrey Hugh Smith announced his willingness to stand aside for Haden-Guest at a by-election urging local Conservative supporters to vote for him. Smith later reinforced and justified his position in a letter to The Times later in the campaign.The Times, 15 March 1927 p12 Haden-Guest resigned from Parliament using the traditional device of applying for the Chiltern Hundreds.The Times, 10 March 1927 p14  Previous result  Candidates *At an early stage after Haden-Guest‚Äôs resignation from the Parliamentary Labour Party, it seemed that Labour was anxious to use the opportunity of a by-election to get William Wedgwood Benn into Parliament as a Labour MP.The Times, 2 March 1927 p16 Wedgewood-Benn had been Liberal MP for the St George's division of Tower Hamlets in east London from 1906 until 1918 and then for Leith in Scotland, a seat he held until March 1927, when he resigned from the Liberal Party and from Parliament.Leslie Hale, revised Mark Pottle, William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate; in Oxford Dictionary of Political Biography online, 2004-10 Despite the flurry of attention paid by the press to a possible candidacy by Wedgwood Benn, Labour was also reported to be considering George Isaacs. Isaacs was a trade union official, being general secretary of the National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants. He was the former MP for Gravesend and had fought Southwark North at the 1918 general election. Another name apparently being considered was that of Herbert Morrison who was at that time secretary of the London Labour Party, having previously been MP for Hackney South and who was a member of the London County Council.The Times, 9 March 1927 p11 On 10 March 1927 Labour unanimously adopted Mr Isaacs.The Times, 11 March 1927 p16 *The Liberals re-selected the experienced Edward Strauss.The Times, 9 March 1927 p11 Strauss was a corn, grain and hop merchant by profession Werner Eugen Mosse & Julius Carlebach, Second Chance: Two Centuries of German-speaking Jews in the United Kingdom; Mohr Siebeck, 1991 p183 but he had entered politics and was the local MP from 1918‚Äì1923, having also previously represented Abingdon and Southwark West.Who was Who, OUP 2007 *The Conservatives honoured their promise to Haden-Guest, choosing not to put up a candidate and supporting his campaign. Campaign Haden-Guest and his Conservative backers wished to present the by-election as a struggle between socialism and constitutional government. They declared that the duty of the electorate was to revolt against a Labour Party they believed was drifting increasingly leftwards. For this reason they were horrified by the decision of the Liberal Party to intervene in the contest and risk splitting the anti- socialist vote.The Times, 11 March 1927 p16 Haden-Guest‚Äôs split with Labour over China appears to have been symptomatic of wider differences of opinion with the party. He had already taken a different line on the issue of the 1926 General Strike. Opinions also diverged on foreign and Empire policy issues. Haden-Guest was a supporter of Imperial Preference which brought him into conflict with party policy and he had a reputation as a strong supporter of the Empire.The Times, 14 March 1927 p11 Strauss indicated he would support an orthodox Liberal approach in line with a recent speech by Liberal Party Deputy Leader Sir Herbert Samuel, adhering strongly to the traditional Liberal policy of Free Trade.The Times, 14 March 1927 p11 Haden-Guest wished not only to appeal to the electorate on the basis of his opposition to Labour policy and what he and the Conservatives were presenting as the struggle between constitutional government and socialism. He wanted to stress his local credentials and commitment to the community as a former medical officer of the London County Council with a clinic in the heart of the Borough of Southwark where he cared for large numbers of local people.The Times, 15 March 1927 p11 Strauss had well-established local credentials of his own of course. He had been MP for Southwark West from 1910‚Äì1918, for Southwark North from 1918‚Äì1922 and had twice fought the seat since then. His campaign devoted much time and effort to local issues in addition to the national and Imperial questions which were dominating the fight between Haden-Guest and Isaacs. Strauss picked up on voter dissatisfaction with housing policy. He resurrected his proposals for the building of homes for working-class tenants in Borough High Street which he had campaigned for after the end of the Great War but for which the local Labour borough council had refused to grant the necessary planning permission. The Liberals also tried to knock the shine off Haden-Guest‚Äôs medical good works by pointing out that his clinic was not personally funded by him, as some Constitutionalist supporters were happy to imply.The Times, 21 March 1927 p9 Result The result was a gain for the Liberal Party with Strauss obtaining a majority of 1,167 over Isaacs with Haden-Guest a distant third with less than 20% of the poll.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow 1949, p49 In his speech to the crowd after the count, Haden-Guest condemned the Liberal intervention in the by-election as opportunistic. He seemed to feel that it was for him to decide the issue on which the election was determined, rather than the electors of Southwark North. He displayed a proprietarial disposition towards the electorate saying that Strauss had ‚Äú......intrude[d] on what I had hoped was going to be the direct vote of my own people on the unpatriotic attitude of the Labour Party.‚Äù The Times, 29 March 1927 p14  Aftermath  Strauss‚Äô victory, together with a number of other Liberal gains from the Conservatives which followed in the rest of 1927 and into 1928 led the Liberals to hope for a political revival, which it was believed would reap dividends at the next general election which was due by 1929. However, many Liberal analysts ‚Äì including David Lloyd George ‚Äì were cautious, worrying that a combination of three-cornered contests and growing Labour strength in industrial areas would weigh seriously against them under the first-past-the- post electoral system.Chris Cook & John Ramsden, By-elections in British politics; UCL Press, 1997 pp 59-60 Strauss himself spoke for those who had faith that revival had come. He felt the doomsayers had got it all wrong and shared a widespread Liberal hope that the electorate, disillusioned by the government of Stanley Baldwin yet unwilling to turn to the socialist ideas of Labour would rally to the Liberal cause. He wrote to one sceptic saying,‚ÄùI cannot allow you to cast any doubt on the reality of the Liberal revival.‚Äù Michael Bentley, The Liberal Mind 1914-1929; Cambridge University Press, 1977 pp 111-112 The outcome of the 1929 general election saw the fears of the doubters realised however with only a limited increase in Liberal representation in the House of Commons and in Southwark North Strauss was unable to hold off a renewed challenge by Isaacs who took the seat by a majority of 432.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow 1949, p49 References See also * List of United Kingdom by-elections * United Kingdom by-election records Category:1927 elections in the United Kingdom Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in London constituencies Category:Elections in the London Borough of Southwark Category:1927 in London ","title":"1927 Southwark North by-election"},{"id":"29541758","text":"Harriet King (born September 22, 1935) is an American fencer.

Yelverton was a justice of the peace in Norwich in 1427 and recorder from 1433 to 1450. In 1435 and 1436 he was the member of parliament for Great Yarmouth and in 1439 he was made a sergeant-at-law. He was the under-steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, Norfolk and made judge of the king's bench in 1444.

Yelverton seems to have been capable of surviving the reigns of several monarchs and it was said of him that \\"This learned person seems to have stood equally well with the monarchs of both of the Roses, as we find him not only continued in his judicial office by King Edward IV., but made a Knight of the Bath, in order to grace that king's coronation; and upon the temporary restoration of King Henry [sic VI], appointed by patent, dated October, 1470, one of the judges of the court of common pleas.\\" John Burke from A general and heraldic dictionary of the peerages of England, Ireland and Scotland...

After his death his estate passed to his son William. Caister Castle and the Pastons Yelverton was an executor and heir to the estate of Sir John Fastolf, a Norfolk knight who died in 1459. In his latter years Fastolf had taken counsel from John Paston, to whom he was related through Paston's wife, Margaret. Fastolf's will was disputed by Yelverton and the other executors once it was discovered that Paston was to inherit the estates. The dispute between Yelverton and Paston was taken up by the Lord Chancellor's office and went on for many years although most notable was the furore over Caister Castle which is written about in the Paston Letters. Other properties had been similarly fought for by Fastolf in previous years and Yelverton had played a part in securing at least one, Dedham manor, for him. \\"In 1459 Sir John Fastolf [q. v.] had appointed Yelverton one of his executors, and he thus became involved in the prolonged disputes about the disposition of Fastolf's property; he generally acted in concert with William Worcester [q. v.] in opposition to the Pastons, and there is frequent mention of his name in the Paston Letters.\\" John Burke from A general and heraldic dictionary of the peerages of England, Ireland and Scotland...

Scheibler's research focused on sugar, including the technical chemistry of sugar production and the composition of molasses. Scheibler was born the son of Friedrich August Theodor Scheibler (1788‚Äì1864) and Anna Gertrud Eschweiler (1806‚Äì1877) in Gemereth/Eupen, at that time a small town close to the Belgian border. He went to school in Aachen and studied chemistry at the University of Berlin. He received his PhD for his work De Wolframiatibus. Scheibler worked with Gustav Werther in K√∂nigsberg and from 1858 at the Pommersche Provinzial-Zuckersiederei in Stettin.Elisabeth Nay- Scheibler: Die Geschichte der Familie Scheibler, in: Stiftung Scheibler-Museum Rotes Haus Monschau (Hg), K√∂ln 1994Carl Johann Heinrich Scheibler: Geschichte und Geschlechtsregister der Familie Scheibler, Cologne, 1895 In 1866 Scheibler founded the Zuckerchemische und technische Laboratorium (Laboratory for sugar chemistry and technology) in Berlin, which was financed by the Verein der Deutschen Zuckerr√ºbenindustrie (Association of the German Sugar Beet Industry). It was one of the first institutes dedicated to the chemistry of sugar. In 1870 Scheibler became professor at the Gewerbeakademie Berlin and at the University of Agriculture Berlin and he also was a member of the imperial patent office in Berlin between 1877 and 1882. After a conflict with the Verein der Deutschen Zuckerr√ºbenindustrie in 1882, he only worked privately at his institute, but he was able to patent several inventions in that time. For example, he helped his relative Carl Johann Heinrich Scheibler invent a fertiliser, and he also improved smokeless powder for Otto von Bismarck in 1888. His most influential patents were based on the technical production of sugar from beets. The crystallisation of sugar from molasses was difficult and therefore the sugar had to be separated from the molasses. In 1863 Scheibler invented the elution method. During his research on molasses he discovered several compounds in molasses, for example betaine, asparaginic acid, glutamic acid, arabinose, arabinic acid, dextran, phosphoglyceride and cholesterol. He improved the strontia saccharate process, in which strontium hydroxide is mixed with the molasses and strontium di-saccharate precipitates and can be separated from the molasses. Prior to World War I the beet sugar industry used 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. Scheibler died in Berlin on 2 April 1899.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The Lend-A-Hand sign from the old building at the new facility at Third and Ripley Streets The Lend-A-Hand Club was established in Davenport in 1886 as a chapter of the International Order of the King's Daughters and Sons. It became an affiliate of the national network of Lend-A- Hand Clubs launched during the 1870s by Edward Everett Hale, a Unitarian minister who had risen to nationwide prominence as an abolitionist and writer for the Atlantic Monthly prior to the American Civil War. The club was a place for young women who lived and worked away from home to associate in a safe environment. Initially, it occupied various downtown locations that it rented. When it was housed in a department store it offered rest and reading rooms. When it moved to larger facilities it expanded to a cafeteria, reading rooms, parlor, shower and bath, laundry, arts and crafts, and a gymnasium. It also provided a lecture series on various women's topics. The Lend-A-Hand Club was the city's main woman's service facility and usurped any potential for the YWCA to establish itself in Davenport. Money was raised and in 1922 a permanent location was secured and a building was constructed along South Main Street opposite the Dillon Memorial. The facility contained dormitory rooms, a lounge, cafeteria, and a swimming pool. Its construction was a part of major riverfront improvements there were completed in Davenport between 1912 and 1931. Programs offered by the club covered women's issues as bicycling for women, the pros and cons of women working outside the home, woman's suffrage, and other topics. The building closed as a woman's facility in the 1960s. It was rented to the city of Davenport who converted it to elderly housing in 1973. A new building was constructed for the elderly at Third and Ripley Streets in the late 1980s and the Lend-A-Hand Club building was torn down in 1990. It was removed from the National Register in 2014. Architecture The Lend-A-Hand Club was a three-story, brick, U-shaped building that was built over a raised basement. It was designed by Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen in the Renaissance Revival style. It featured terracotta pilasters and cornice. Four decorative urns were located on the parapet. The shape of the building allowed the residential spaces to receive full natural light and air circulation. The main floor was a rectangular box that housed the social service elements of the facility. See also *International Order of the King's Daughters and Sons Other buildings designed by Frederick G.

Although many of the matches in his early career were against fairly inexperienced fighters, several notable opponents were faced; including wins over Welsh champions Boyo Rees and Terence Morgan; a draw with Southern area champion Dick Corbett and a victory against future NBA World champion Jackie Wilson. After the Crowley contest, James began to face more challenging contests on a regular basis. James fought and lost against Spaniard Baltasar Sangchili, but then knocked out fellow Welshman Phineas John in the eighth round in October 1936. These bouts were followed with another points draw with Corbett. The end of 1936 through to 1937 saw James face a dearth of experienced challengers, before he met Cuthbert Taylor at St Helen's in Swansea. The match was won by James, which was followed by another victory, this time against Douglas Kestrell. The Kestrell fight was followed by a loss to Liverpool fighter Tony Butcher, who came off a twelve- match losing streak to stop James by a technical knockout in the sixth of a twelve-round bout in the Market Hall of Haverfordwest. James bounced back in 1938 with four straight wins, three by knockout, before being disqualified in a contest in front of his hometown against NBA ex-champion Freddie Miller of Cincinnati. He then took in ten winning bouts, most notably over Tommy Hyams and Dick Corbett, before two losses, to Dave Finn and another loss to Crowley. After losing to Crowley in April 1939, James didn't lose a fight until May 1942, including wins over both Finn and Crowley. By 1943 James was heading towards a British title fight, which had evaded him before this date. Although losing three bouts on a run on the build-up to his championship claim, one to Lefty Satan Flynn and two to Arthur Danahar, he was still allowed a shot at the title against Eric Boon. The Boon contest was for the British Lightweight title and took place on 12 August 1944 at the Cardiff Arms Park in the Welsh capital. James took the title after a tenth-round knockout.Odd, Gilbert E. (ed.) (1946) Boxing News Annual 1946, War Facts Press, p. 53 James never defended his British title but before retiring he challenged American Ike Williams for the NBA World Lightweight title. The match brought the champion to Wales, the first time a boxing title had been held in the country, taking place at Ninian Park on 9 September 1946. James was knocked out in the ninth round after suffering six knockdowns during the bout. James retired from boxing in 1947 after being beaten by a 19-year-old Cliff Curvis at the Vetch Field in Swansea. James had failed to make the 9 st 9 lb weight limit for the challenge against Curvis, for which he was stripped of his British title, and subsequently retired from boxing.

It occurs in shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific region. The type locality is Mauritius.  Description  Echinometra mathaei grows to a test diameter of about . The colour is quite variable but the test is usually a dark colour. The spines are sometimes green and purple with purple tips or entirely green with purple tips but this sea urchin can be distinguished from other species by a characteristic pale ring at the base of each spine. Echinometra mathaei (3 polymorphes).jpgEchinometra mathaei in their holes in a rock. Reef4081 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg Echinometra_mathaei_Reunion.JPGidem. Echinometra mathaei MHNT Both sides.jpgThe two sides of the same dried specimen (MHNT)  Distribution  Echinometra mathaei is found on reefs in tropical parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean at depths down to . Its range extends from Madagascar, the East African coast and the Red Sea to Hawaii.  Biology  Echinometra mathaei uses its spines and teeth (part of the mouthparts known as Aristotle's lantern) to dig itself into the basaltic and calcareous rock where it lives. It emerges from these hollows at night to graze on algae. As with other sea urchins, breeding involves releasing gametes into the water column. Fertilisation is external and the echinopluteus larvae are planktonic. When these settle on the seabed, they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile sea urchins. In the Gulf of Suez, in the most northerly part of its range, it spawns in the summer and autumn but in warmer waters, breeding takes place at any time of year. Because of its burrowing activities, Echinometra mathaei causes bioerosion of coral reefs. Its natural predators are mostly finfish but there is also some predation by brittle stars and gastropod molluscs. It has been found that in areas where heavy fishing takes place, the number of urchins is increased because their natural predators are less abundant and as a consequence, greater damage to the reef takes place. A commensal shrimp, Athanas areteformi, lives among the spines of this sea urchin and its appearance is mimicked by the mantis shrimp, Echinosquilla guerinii, which conceals itself in a hole in the rock with only its spiny telson visible. Copper is having a detrimental effect to larvae at 0.02 mg/l, and adults have 48- and 96-h TL50 values of 0.54 and 0.30 mg/l.

The houses, constructed in 1848 by Paul Bishop, sit upon the foundations laid by William Jarvis for his home in 1798. Jarvis was a member of the Queen‚Äôs Rifles and Provincial Secretary and Registrar of Upper Canada. He selected a site at what is now the southeast corner of Sherbourne and Adelaide Streets and constructed a 30 by 41 foot building of squared logs that he covered with clapboards which he named Jarvis House. After William‚Äôs death in 1817, his son Samuel divided the two acres of land on which the house sat into smaller parcels and sold them. The house went through a series of owners and was expanded in the early 1820s. During the Cholera epidemics in the 1830s, several people who lived in a rooming house now occupying Jarvis House died. To prevent the disease from spreading, owner James Kidd sealed several of their rooms. After the deaths in the house it gained a reputation in the city as being haunted. During Mr. Kidd's occupancy of the home it was said that on several occasions unearthly noises were heard in the room Secretary Jarvis used as an office. This drove Mr. Kidd out of the house and it remained vacant for a few years. In 1841, James Kidd sold the house to Paul Bishop, a blacksmith who worked in an adjacent building. In his workshop in 1837, Bishop created Toronto‚Äôs first horse-drawn cab based on a design presented to him by Thornton Blackburn. Blackburn operated his taxi business until 1860 and left a considerable fortune upon his death in 1890. His cabs were painted yellow and red, the colors now used by the Toronto Transit Commission. In 1848, Bishop demolished the old house and built the current structure. They consist of two-storey brick houses in the Georgian style with a stone-clad cellar partially above ground. The north facade of each house contained three symmetrical bays with stone lintels and sills framing the windows The houses survived the Great Fire of Toronto of 1849 and in 1860, came under the ownership of Thomas Dennie Harris. Harris died in 1872 and the property again underwent a series of changes. Nearby trees were removed and the small yard around the house was torn-up. The interior was gutted and during the next hundred years, the building served as a machine shop, garage and rooming house at various times. Windows were closed and new doors cut through the exterior walls. According to John Ross Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto (Volume I, 130-132), blacksmith Paul Bishop acquired the property on the corner of Duke (Adelaide) and Caroline (Sherbourne) Streets formerly belonging to Sheriff Jarvis where he erected the subject buildings in 1848. However, historical records indicate that Bishop actually acquired the subject property in 1841, with the house form buildings in place the following year. An 1842 Map of Toronto, which shows the site as developed, also supports this date. Robertson describes Bishop as a French Canadian blacksmith and wheelwright who \\"was the principal workman in his trade in the town, but eventually he failed in business and left Toronto\\". Initially renting the property, Bishop resided on-site in 1843. The next year, he sold the property to Malachy O'Donohue, a local landowner. O'Donohue retained the site until 1846.  Today  The Bishop Houses were declared a historic property through Toronto By-law 895-1998 enacted on December 17, 1998, under the Ontario Heritage Act. At the time, the building had been vacant for an extended time and still bore the alterations made since 1872. These included a three-storey addition to the rear and addition of a gabled dormer on the roof. The houses were restored in 2005-2006 and the addition removed to allow construction of the highrise Kings Court Condominium building to the south.

Johnson gradually expanded these sketches and added transitions between them, writing a piece that is to be played in exactly one hour. Achieving this goal requires an absolutely steady tempo for the duration of the piece, which Johnson has set at quarter note = 59.225 beats per minute. The only recording that is exactly sixty minutes long was recently released by the Irritable Hedgehog label and performed by R. Andrew Lee.An Hour for Piano streamed online, performed by R. Andrew Lee. An Hour for Piano is deceptively simple, with six basic textures that come and go at the composer's whim. There is no order to these textures, and the transitions between them blur significantly the boundaries between them. Kyle Gann writes, \\"It never deviates from the key of G, though some dissonant motives wash through from time to time. The pedal is held constantly, and 99 percent of the notes are in or just above the treble clef.\\"Sixty Minutes to Change Your Life, by Kyle Gann. The effect is one where the past and present become irrelevant and the listener experiences an almost eternal present. In 1974, Johnson also wrote program notes to accompany the piece. These notes are meant to be read while listening to the work, and they encourage the listener to \\"not to allow the program notes to distract you from concentrating on the music. They are intended to increase your ability to concentrate on the piece, and not to distract from it.\\"Tom Johnson's Program Notes These lengthy notes mirror the composition in certain ways, with sentences and entire paragraphs that return frequently and with subtle alterations to the text. The effect is similar to Johnson's landmark article, \\"What is Minimalism Really About?\\"The Voice of New Music, available free as a PDF While An Hour for Piano has not enjoyed the same level of recognition that other standard minimalist compositions have, it still \\"represents many of minimalism's best qualities while avoiding many of its pitfalls. It is an understated watershed of a composition - simple enough to understand on first hearing, complex enough to never fully comprehend, and important enough to usher in a new mode of composition.\\"S.

The episode features a guest appearance by actress Carol Burnett as a Nazi hunter and mother of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who shows up for the first time in years, just in time to attend Sue's wedding to herself. The long- anticipated wedding of Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) and Carole Hudson (Romy Rosemont) is also featured, and the bullying storyline reaches a climax that results in Kurt (Chris Colfer) transferring from McKinley High to Dalton Academy at the end of the episode.

Three were featured during the Hummel‚ÄìHudson wedding sequence, and the two songs by Bruno Mars, \\"Marry You\\" and \\"Just the Way You Are\\", charted both on the Billboard Hot 100 and internationally. Burnett's appearance, and her song with Lynch, were lauded by most critics, as was the central wedding of Hudson and Hummel, but Sue's wedding to herself was widely panned. Additionally, a few reviewers, including The Atlantic Kevin Fallon, thought the bullying storyline had been stretched over too many episodes.

Plot Burt Hummel and Carole Hudson tell their sons, New Directions glee club members Kurt and Finn, that they are engaged. Principal Sue Sylvester announces her intention to marry herself, and glee club member Sam Evans offers fellow member Quinn Fabray a promise ring. Kurt is menaced by Dave Karofsky and badly shaken; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt, she can only punish Karofsky if he physically attacks Kurt. Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry convinces the glee club girls to have their football-playing boyfriends defend Kurt, but her own boyfriend, Finn, refuses, concerned about his position as quarterback. In the locker room Artie Abrams, Noah Puckerman and Mike Chang along with Sam confront Karofsky, demanding he leave Kurt alone. Karofsky retaliates, and Sam fights him. Quinn is impressed by Sam's actions and accepts his ring. Karofsky later sees Kurt and Finn practicing a wedding dance and taunts them in front of Burt. After Kurt admits that Karofsky threatened to kill him, Burt instigates a meeting with Sue, Karofsky's father, and the two boys, at which Sue expels Karofsky. While the Hummel‚ÄìHudson wedding is being arranged, Sue advances her own marriage plans. She is surprised when her mother arrives. Doris, a retired Nazi hunter who was an absentee parent to Sue and her sister Jean, attempts to atone for her long absence, but is so critical of her daughter that Sue calls her a bully and disinvites her. Doris leaves, and Sue and Jean comfort each other. The day of the wedding, Santana Lopez, who wants another chance at Finn, suggests he reveal they had sex to boost his popularity at school.This took place in the season one episode \\"The Power of Madonna\\". He refuses, as he loves Rachel, who admitted to him that she lied when she claimed to have slept with her then-boyfriend Jesse; Finn claimed he never had sex with Santana. At the wedding, New Directions perform \\"Marry You\\" by Bruno Mars as they dance down the aisle, after which Burt and Carole are married. Finn uses his best man speech to apologize to Kurt; he announces that Finn and Kurt are now \\"Furt\\". He and the other glee club members dedicate a performance of Mars' \\"Just the Way You Are\\" to Kurt, and the new stepbrothers dance together. Following the wedding, Kurt and his parents learn that the school board reversed Karofsky's expulsion and gave him a verbal warning. Sue resigns as principal in protest, and Burt and Carole use their honeymoon savings to enroll Kurt at Dalton Academy, which has a zero-tolerance policy against bullying and is also the school that Kurt's friend Blaine attends. Production Sue's parents were mentioned and their occupations as Nazi hunters revealed in the season one episode \\"The Power of Madonna\\". According to Lynch, Sue's mother left her two daughters to pursue her career, and returns home retired after the last Nazi has been captured. On working with Burnett, Lynch said, \\"I'm a little nervous, but I can't wait to get in scenes with her ... It's like playing tennis with a master.\\" The origin behind Sue's antagonistic personality was explored in this episode; plans at the time were for Burnett to reappear on the series in a future episode. This is Burnett's and Lynch's second time working together, the first being the 2009 comedy film Post Grad. In an interview after BAFTA/LA's Brittania Awards, Lynch told People a wedding was in the future for her character. A tracksuit wedding dress was created by personal costume designer Ali Rahimi. Recurring characters in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang and Sam Evans, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), athlete and school bully Dave Karofsky, football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), and local news anchors Rod Remington (Bill A. Jones) and Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis). In addition, Rosemont and Burnett star as Carole and Doris, the respective mothers of Finn and Sue, and Daniel Roebuck plays Karofsky's father, Paul. Four songs were covered on the episode and were all released as singles available for digital download. The song \\"Ohio\\" from the 1953 musical Wonderful Town was covered as a duet between Burnett and Lynch. In an interview with TV Guide, Burnett revealed that her husband suggested the possibility of her doing the song since her character was returning to Ohio after an absence; she then brought it to Glee creator Ryan Murphy's attention. Additionally, two Bruno Mars songs were featured‚Äî\\"Just the Way You Are\\" and \\"Marry You\\"‚Äîas well as Pablo Beltr√°n Ruiz's \\"Sway\\" as covered by Michael Bubl√©. All songs except \\"Ohio\\" are included on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 4. Reception =Ratings and viewership= \\"Furt\\" was first broadcast on November 23, 2010, in the United States on Fox. It was watched by 10.41 million American viewers during its initial airing‚ÄîGlee lowest viewership for the second season to that point‚Äîand was the fifteenth-most- watched show of the week across all channels. It garnered a 4.0/12 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, which made it the highest-rated show in its timeslot, and the third-highest-rated scripted show of the week amongst adults aged 18‚Äì49. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down significantly from those of the previous episode, \\"The Substitute\\", which was watched by 11.70 million American viewers and acquired a 5.0/14 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic upon first airing on November 16, 2010. The episode's Canadian broadcast, also on November 23, 2010, attained 2.10 million viewers, which placed Glee ninth in the weekly program rankings. Viewership declined slightly from \\"The Substitute\\", which was watched by 2.29 million, but also ranked ninth. \\"Furt\\" aired in Australia on November 29, 2010, where it drew 1.33 million viewers, and was the second-most-watched show of the night and third of the week. Here, viewership increased from \\"The Substitute\\", which attained 1.06 million viewers and ranked seventh for the night and nineteenth for the week. David Dale noted in The Sydney Morning Herald that Glee faced weaker competition than usual, as Network Ten was \\"the only commercial network showing new episodes of its top shows\\". In the UK, the episode aired on February 28, 2011, and was watched by 2.43 million viewers‚Äî2.03 million on E4, and 406,000 on E4+1‚Äîwhich made it the most-watched show on both channels and the second-most-watched show on cable for the week. Here again, viewership was down from the previous episode, which drew 2.55 million viewers and was the most-watched show across all cable channels. =Critical reception= \\"Furt\\" received a generally positive reception from critics, though there were some dissenting viewpoints. Meghan Brown of The Atlantic wrote that the episode \\"worked beautifully.\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff called it a \\"largely terrific episode of television\\", and gave it a \\"B+\\". Lisa Respers France of CNN was reminded of \\"how well this show marries plot with music\\", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman concluded, \\"The focus on the show's best characters, Kurt and Sue, kept the show balanced between heart and bite‚Äîjust the way we like our Glee\\". IGN Robert Canning was less enthusiastic; he called it an \\"unfocused jumble of an episode\\" and gave it a score of 7 out of 10. The BuddyTV reviewers were split, with Jen Harper quite happy, and John Kubicek who wrote that he hated the entire episode. Most reviews heaped praise on the guest appearance of Carol Burnett, who played Sue's Nazi-hunting absentee mother Doris. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said Burnett was a \\"well-used guest star\\", and he \\"loved every minute she was on screen.\\" Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times asked \\"who could not be charmed\\" by Burnett, and the Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez lauded the \\"tour-de-force panache and sharp-tongued deadpan by Carol Burnett\\", and called her appearance the \\"best guest casting this season\\". The marriage of Burt Hummel and Carole Hudson received generally good marks. VanDerWerff wrote, \\"it's rare that an episode of television can make a hurried wedding between two middle-aged people who are rarely on the show into something so well-conceived and thrillingly moving.\\" Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times noted, \\"Every character in that family rings emotionally true.\\" Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack was pleased with the performances of Mike O‚ÄôMalley as Burt and Romy Rosemont as Carole; he also welcomed the episode's increased focus on Finn, and praised Cory Monteith as a \\"good, natural actor\\". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic was unhappy with both weddings, and Canning said they \\"took up most of this episode, and unfortunately neither were entirely successful\\". Several reviewers noted the \\"homage\\" of the wedding procession dance, including Hankinson, Anthony Benigno of the Daily News and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post; the Wall Street Journal invited readers to compare the original viral \\"JK Wedding Entrance Dance\\" YouTube video and the subsequent dancing procession from the \\"Niagara\\" episode of The Office with Glee version in \\"Furt\\", while Stack made his own comparison, and said Glee was \\"just about as good\\" as the original, and \\"a blast to watch\\". Sue Sylvester's marriage to herself was lambasted by many critics, including Vanity Fair Brett Berk, who said it \\"was about as compelling as a hair lollipop\\". Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was also unimpressed, especially \\"because the main plot points of this episode are otherwise so effective\\"; his colleague Fallon was brief and to the point: \\"Blergh.\\" There was disagreement on the bullying storyline. Some critics, including Canning and Hankinson, praised it, while others had reservations, such as Brown, who characterized it as \\"heavy-handed\\", and Fallon, who considered it \\"well-acted\\" but \\"far too stagnant\\". The Sam and Quinn storyline was panned by VanDerWerff, who wrote \\"the series has wasted whatever chemistry the two had in 'Duets' on scenes where Sam talks about how he wants to be the most popular kid in school\\", and by Kubicek, who criticized the lack of consistency in Sam's characterization. =Music and performances= The musical performances and cover versions in the episode attracted generally positive reviews, though a few reviewers noted that the program had been on for twenty-three minutes before the first song appeared. While Fallon said it was an \\"interminable wait\\" for the first musical number, \\"Ohio\\", and Reiter cited the delay as flaw, James Poniewozik of Time thought it a \\"credit to the episode\\" that he had not noticed the absence of music to that point. Flandez and Futterman commented favorably on all the musical numbers, though Canning felt the songs were a \\"disappointing aspect of this episode\\", and none were \\"exceptionally memorable\\". The duet of Burnett and Lynch on \\"Ohio\\" was well received. Jean Bentley of AOL TV praised it as \\"simply magnificent\\", Zap2it Hanh Nguyen called it a \\"fantastic job\\" and Flandez said it was \\"lovely\\" and that \\"the bickering interlude was a delight.\\" Others tempered their praise: Berk gave it three of five stars and noted the \\"bland staging\\", and Benigno graded it a \\"C\\" and called it \\"boring\\", though he said \\"their voices work well\\" together; Stack gave it a \\"B+\\" with the caveat that it was \\"a little too theatrical\\". The dancing wedding procession and its accompanying performance of the Bruno Mars song \\"Marry You\\" were mostly praised. Stack gave it an \\"A\\" and Berk five stars out of five, and Amanda Hensel of AOL Music called it \\"easily one of the best performances of the season\\". Benigno gave it a \\"B\\" primarily because the cast didn't \\"do anything particularly interesting with it\\" vocally, but called the performance \\"pure joy\\". Flandez wrote that \\"two Bruno Mars songs that were brilliant in execution and touching in sentiment\\", and Futterman agreed: \\"the Bruno Mars songs gave the show two of its best performances this season\\". While Benigno and Stack also praised \\"Just the Way You Are\\", and both gave the song an \\"A\\", Harper thought Monteith's vocals as Finn \\"aren't the strongest\\" and Bentley also wished Finn had not been the soloist. Additionally, Harper criticized the failure of the show to adjust the song's pronouns from feminine to masculine when Finn was singing to Kurt, and noted that Gwyneth Paltrow had changed pronouns while singing Cee Lo Green's \\"Forget You\\" the week before. Hankinson was more impressed with \\"Just the Way You Are\\", and gave it a \\"slight edge\\" over \\"Marry You\\" for the episode's \\"best musical number\\", \\"given the emotional context\\". Matthew Morrison's performance of \\"Sway\\" received the most divergent opinions. Some reviewers mentioned how closely it resembled Michael Bubl√©'s version: Benigno graded it \\"A-\\" and said \\"Matthew Morrison sounds EXACTLY like Bubl√© here, which is both unbelievably impressive (Bubl√©'s got some pipes on him), and takes a little bit away from the number (easy to write it off as an impression)\\", Stack gave it a \\"B\\" and characterized it as \\"pretty simple, but Matthew Morrison does a mean Michael Bubl√©\\", and Bentley called it \\"a perfectly fine cover\\", though Futterman said it \\"can‚Äôt beat Michael Bubl√©‚Äôs take\\". Among those who did not compare Morrison to Bubl√©, Hensel called it a \\"beautiful solo performance\\", while Berk gave it two stars out of five and wrote \\"Shue sings it just like a real wedding singer\\", and Nguyen said the song felt \\"out of place\\". =Chart history= Only two of the four cover versions released as singles‚Äîthe two songs by Bruno Mars‚Äîdebuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and appeared on other musical charts. On the Hot 100, the show's rendition of \\"Marry You\\" debuted at number thirty- two; it was number nineteen on the Canadian Hot 100. The other song on the Hot 100 was \\"Just the Way You Are\\" at number forty, which also made number twenty- four on the Canadian Hot 100. That same week, Mars's own single of \\"Marry You\\" also debuted on these same charts, though well below the Glee cover version, at number ninety-one on the Hot 100 and number eighty-nine on the Canadian Hot 100; his single of \\"Just the Way You Are\\" was in the top five on both charts that week.Peak chart positions for season two singles in the United States: \\"Marry You\\" and \\"Just the Way You Are\\" Notes References External links * \\"Furt\\" at Fox.com * * \\"Furt\\" at TV.com Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Glee (season 2) episodes Category:Television episodes about weddings Category:Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (writer) ","title":"Furt"},{"id":"29542453","text":"The Coleman Athletic Club of Akron was a professional American football team based in Akron, Ohio in 1913. The team played in the Ohio League and was formed when C.P. Parker, secretary of the baseball's Akron Giants, of the Interstate League, formed a new Akron-based football team to compete with Peggy Parratt and his Indians. Parker first convinced a few of Parratt's regulars to sign with his club. He then loaded the rest of roster with ex- players from the Elyria Athletics, which had just folded a week prior. Unlike many of the Athletic Club teams of the early 1900s, there was no actual \\"Coleman Athletic Club\\" in existence. Instead the name was given to the team, since it played all home games at Akron's Coleman Athletic Field. In Akron, they were sometimes called Coleman's Akron Indians. as opposed to Parrett's Akron Indians. Coleman opened its season against the Canton Professionals (renamed the Canton Bulldogs in 1915). Coleman defeated Canton 26-0, by scoring two touchdowns on recovered fumbles and another on a pass interception. Coleman's halfback, Tony Wein, scored the only offensive touchdown on a goal line plunge. However, two weeks later, Canton defeated Coleman 7-6 as the result of a controversial call by the referee, named \\"Schleininger\\", who claimed that Coleman's Homer Davidson missed a 28-yard field goal that would have given Coleman a 9-6 victory. Davidson disagreed violently with the referee, who just happened to be a Canton resident. However, the earlier loss to Coleman removed Canton from any chance of winning the Ohio League title. The Akron Indians would go on to win the 1913 Ohio League title. However, they did not have an undisputed claim to the Akron City Championship, because they did not play the Coleman Athletic Club. To remedy the situation, Akron's Peggy Parratt scheduled a game between Coleman and the Indians. Coleman then lost to Parratt and the Indians, 30-0.

It was once the main Jesuit institution in the whole of Asia. It housed the first printing press in India, having published the first books in 1556.p.115, O'Malley, J W 1993, 'The First Jesuits', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts The original building, however, was abandoned progressively after the outbreak of plague in 1578, and went into disuse as the college moved to new building known as the New College of Saint Paul.Jos√© Nicolau da Fonseca, An historical and archaeological sketch of the city of Goa: preceded by a short statistical account of the territory of Goa The ruins were demolished in 1832. The only vestige of the original college and of the collegiate church consecrated on 25 January 1543 is the Gate of the College of St. Paul, that can be seen south of St. Cajetan's church. The arch with a niche at the top and a cross crowning it, is built of laterite and flanked by basalt columns. The legacy of St. Paul's College endures until today in the Rachol Seminary. History In 1542 the first Jesuits arrived at India headed by Francis Xavier, co-founder of the new Society of Jesus. They were sent by King John III of Portugal to help on religious issues in the Portuguese Empire, under the Padroado agreement. In Goa, then capital of Portuguese India they established, at first temporarily, in the Seminary of the Holy Faith (Santa F√©) started by Miguel Vaz and Franciscan friar Diogo de Borba, under the patronage of governor Estev√£o da Gama in 1541.Borges, pp.20-21 Soon they renamed it \\"St. Paul's College\\" as it became the Jesuit' headquarters in Asia. The college had classes in grammar, rhetoric, and lectures on classical authors. It had also a school for 450 local students, teaching reading and writing, and an hospital. On 10 March 1554 the college got a grant from king John III of Portugal entitling it to the rents of the temples in Goa and nearby islands. It was also entitled to the gifts from local chiefs to the king. The French traveler Fran√ßois Pyrard de Laval, who visited Goa c.1608, described the College of St Paul, praising the variety of the subjects taught there free of charge. Like many other European travelers who visited the College, he recorded that at this time it had 3000 students, from all the missions of Asia. Its Library was one of the biggest in Asia, and the first Printing Press was mounted there. The first Printing Press Title page of Garcia da Orta's Col√≥quios. Goa, 1563. The art of printing first entered India through St. Paul's College in Goa. In a letter to St. Ignatius of Loyola, dated 30 April 1556, Father Gasper Caleza speaks of a ship carrying a printing press, setting sail from Portugal to Abyssinia (current-day Ethiopia) via Goa, with the purpose of helping missionary work. Circumstances prevented this printing press from leaving India, and consequently, printing operations began in Goa in 1556, established at the Jesuit College of St Paul in Old Goa.ManohararƒÅya SaradesƒÅya, A history of Konkani literature: from 1500 to 1992, Sahitya Akademi, 2000, That year, D.

Gaspar de Le√£o Pereira in 1560. He introduced the printing press to Goa. The individual responsible for the initiation of printing in India was Joao De Bustamante. Bustamante, an expert printer sent accompanying the printing press, along with his Indian assistant set up the new press and began to operate it. Among others, four books are known to have been printed by Bustamante: The first book published that year was called Conclusiones Philosophicas. A year later, the printing press published its second book, Catecismo da Doutrina Christ√£, five years after the death of its author, St. Francis Xavier. This was followed by the printing of Garcia da Orta‚Äôs Col√≥quios dos simples e drogas he cousas medicinais da √çndia on 10 April 1563 by Joao de Endem. In 1568, the first illustrated cover page (the illustration being done with the relief technique of woodblock) was printed in Goa for the book Constituciones Do Arcebispado De Goa.

It is located on Second Cross Street in Pettah. The mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Colombo and a popular tourist site in the city.  History  Construction of the Jami-Ul-Alfar Mosque commenced in 1908 and the building was completed in 1909. The mosque was commissioned by the local Indian Muslim community, based in Pettah, to fulfill their required five- times-daily prayer and Jummah on Fridays. The mosque's designer and builder was Habibu Labbe Saibu Labbe (an unqualified architect), and was based on details/images of Indo-Saracenic structures provided by South Indian traders, who commissioned him. It is a hybrid style of architecture, that draws elements from native Indo-Islamic and Indian architecture, and combines it with the Gothic revival and Neo-classical styles. Originally it had the capacity for 1,500 worshippers although at the time only around 500 were attending prayers. It is a distinctive red and white candy-striped two-storey building, with a clock tower, and is reminiscent of the Jamek Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (constructed in 1910). Before other landmarks were built, some claim that the Jami Ul-Alfar Mosque was recognised as the landmark of Colombo by sailors approaching the port. In 1975 the mosque, with the assistance of the Haji Omar Trust, purchased a number of the adjoining properties and commenced building an expansion to the mosque to increase its capacity to 10,000.

The CAA published the Catholic Art Quarterly, sponsored annual conventions, and hosted workshops until the organization dwindled and eventually dissolved in 1970. History In 1936, Sister Esther Newport saw a need for improved art education in Catholic schools and for a set of standards regarding ecclesiastical art. She drew up an initial proposal for a Catholic College Art Association that year but did not find much support at that time. After a Peter Boswell column in the March 1937 issue of Art Digest addressed similar issues in Catholic art, Newport revisited her idea and sent it to Boswell. He in turn gave the proposal publicity in his April 1937 column and helped to garner public support for the organization. Newport then called for an organizational meeting at Providence High School in Chicago. There she and other interested parties founded the Catholic College Art Association and planned for its first general meeting that October on the campus of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in Indiana. =Philosophical foundation= Newport enlisted art critic and philosopher Graham Carey to provide an underlying foundation for the CAA. Carey was already known for his \\"Catholic Philosophy of Art\\" and agreed to be an advisor to the organization and to speak at its first general meeting. Carey would go on to be a prominent voice in the CAA, advocating for the integration of social thinking with art and religion. The Association was unique in its inclusion of women in the fields of art and architecture. Besides the presence of Newport and many Catholic sisters, the CAA employed three women as its executive secretaries. It also worked closely with lay liturgical artist Ade Bethune, co-founder of the Catholic Worker Movement, and Hildreth Meiere, who helped to found the Liturgical Arts Society.

Family background Caomh√°n mac Connmhach and Dubda mac Connmhach were grandsons of King Donn Cothaid mac Cathail of Ui Fiachrach Muaidhe (died 772). Their father was Connchmach mac Donn Cothaid mac Cathail, who traced his descent back to the semi-legendary Niall No√≠g√≠allach (died c. 450?), via his son, Fiachu mac N√©ill (fl. 507-514). This made Caomh√°n a member of the U√≠ Fiachrach dynasty who produced a number of Kings of Connacht.

The University of Maryland was chartered in 1856 as the Maryland Agricultural College. Charles Benedict Calvert spent $21,000 to purchase 420 acres in College Park, Maryland, and later that year founded the college. The school opened on October 5, 1859 with a total of 34 students. In 1864, the state legislature designated it as a land grant college under the Morrill Act of 1862, which made federal funds available. By the end of the Civil War, the University, having been hit hard by financial problems and a decline in student enrollment, found itself bankrupt. The state legislature assumed half ownership of the school in 1866, which pulled the college out of bankruptcy, and made the college, in part, a state institution. Enrollment slowly increased at the University, and over the next 26 years Maryland gained a reputation as a strong research institution. The federally funded Agricultural Experiment Station was established under the Hatch Act of 1887, and new state laws granted the college regulatory control over several areas of agriculture and public safety. The school has grown over the years, adding several other academic departments. However, it still remains a land grant university, and continues to have a strong college of agriculture and natural resources.

He was in charge of prosecutor's supervision over observance of laws by the agencies of the Ministry of Interior, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), tax police and special units combating organized crime and corruption. He was also responsible for supervision over state customs service and border guard. He resigned voluntarily from his office in December 2004, but returned to the Prosecutor General's Office of UkraineProsecutor General‚Äôs Office of Ukraine at the end of 2006. In November 2010, members of Ukraine's Parliament voted in favor (292 votes) of Viktor Pshonka's appointment as the General Prosecutor of Ukraine. =General Prosecutor of Ukraine= Since his appointment to office, Viktor Pshonka has laid emphasis in his activity on bringing Ukrainian prosecution service in line with European standards. Speaking on the Ukrainian TV channel Inter four days after his appointment, Pshonka called himself \\"a member of President Viktor Yanukovych's team\\". In this regard, V. Pshonka takes active part in consultations and discussions on the issues of improving of the work of prosecution service with experts and representatives of European and international organizations, in particular, the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Venice Commission, etc., as well as exchange of experience with law enforcement authorities of other states. In accordance with the new Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine CPC, which entered into force in 2012, the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine led by Pshonka introduced the Unified Register of Pretrial Investigations (computerized system, where all complaints and applications regarding criminal offences in Ukraine are registered), which is used by Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. In November 2012, the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for employees of the prosecution service was adopted by all-Ukrainian Conference of Members of prosecuting agencies. On 3 March 2012, another innovation during Pshonka's tenure was establishment of the Dnipro Ecological Prosecutor's Office, the main task of which is to oversee compliance with environmental laws in respect of drainage basin of the Dnieper River within the territory of Ukraine. In 2012, Pshonka as the Prosecutor General of Ukraine began investigating Burisma Holdings owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, over allegations of money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption during 2010-2012. = Discovery of Ukraine's Watergate papers = Together, Viktor Pshonka, Viktor Yanukovych, and Vitaly Zakharchenko became guests on the 11th floor of the Hotel Ukraina in Moscow on 25 February 2014. On 21 February 2014, Yanukovych traveled by helicopter to Kharkiv and then to Donetsk but was denied permission to takeoff from Donetsk, so, he drove to Crimea and then left Crimea for Russia on a Russia government boat. Similarly, on 22 February 2014, Pshonka left the VIP terminal at Donetsk airport for Russia by having his security detachment occupy the Ukraine border guards. Upon Pshonka's departure, the luxurious Pshonka mansion near Kyiv at Gorenichi, Kyiv-Svyatoshinsky district () was searched and numerous files were discovered. Revealed on 31 May 2016 by Serhiy Anatoliyovich Leshchenko (), the secret bookkeeping of Viktor Yanukovych and the Party of Regions' Black Ledger () or Barn Book () which implicated numerous persons to improper payments including Paul Manafort for which the book included the handwritten records of 22 payments over five years to Manafort from pro Kremlin and pro Putin sources, nine of which had been signed by Vitaly Anatolyevich Kalyuzhny () who was the Verkhovna Rada's foreign relations committee chairman. On 17 August 2016, Donald Trump removed Paul Manafort as Trump's campaign chairman following Trump's first national security briefing directly because of the records in the secret ledger. In September 2016, Leshchenko referred to these papers as Ukraine's Watergate. = Criminal prosecution = On 22 February 2014, as a part of the Euromaidan Revolution, the Verkhovna Rada ousted Pshonka in a no-confidence vote. On 23 February 2014, an arrest warrant was issued to arrest Pshonka. But, on 5 December 2015, Interpol denied a request to put former Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Pshonka on the wanted list allegedly due to the weakness of the evidence submitted by the competent authorities of Ukraine. Early March 2014, the EU froze Pshonka's accounts. Controversies =Murder of Ihor Aleksandrov= Ihor Oleksandrovych Aleksandrov who was an investigative reporter and presenter for the independent television station TOR TV () in Sloviansk was murdered in 2001 while producing a program for the series \\"Bez Retushi\\" (Without Touching Up) () which was exposing links between politicians, law enforcement, and organized crime in Kramatorsk; Pshonka was one of two men Aleksandrov had identified as godfathering the Kramatorsk underworld. Pshonka then oversaw the investigation of the murder. A homeless man was later charged but acquitted in the case, dying of 'mysterious circumstances' soon after; the same fate that befell the two witnesses and investigating police officer. = Missing GPU files = In early April 2015, Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin stated that the General Prosecutor Ukraine (GPU) files disappeared about criminal orders from former General Prosecutor Pshonka along with Pshonka's secret casework and secret materials: Viktor Shokin: I will tell you more: not only criminal cases, but secret materials are missing - secret casework. Including, as far as Victor Pshonka's orders were concerned.\\" (). During the search for the missing files, the Head of the Special Investigations Division of the General Investigation Department of the GPU, Serhiy Viktorovych Horbatyuk (), believed that Pshonka had ordered those files and many others to be transferred to Crimea. On 10 April 2015, Mustafa Nayyem stated that he was with members of the Right Sector when they entered Pshonka's mansion and that the Right Sector recovered numerous GPU files from Pshonka's mansion including some items from under the tiles in the Pshonka mansion's sauna.

Description Living specimen attached to rock (scale bar: 1.2 cm) The original type specimens for this species have been lost. however the species was re-described in 2009. Individuals vary in colour from red-orange with light red gonads (individuals found at King George Island, Antarctica) to red and/or green (individuals found in Valdivia, Chile). Haliclystus antarcticus has a 'stalk' (peduncle) which is a half to two thirds the length of its calyx. The inside of the peduncle is divided into four chambers. The calyx itself is about 3.5‚Äì16.2 mm tall and 4.1‚Äì23.4 mm wide. It is cone shaped and semi-translucent with a smooth outer surface. The animal has eight arms arranged in pairs which radiate out from a central four sided mouth. The arms are 0.3‚Äì6.0 mm in length. Each arm is tipped by clusters of up to roughly 200 tentacles which are hollow and tipped with a rounded end covered in nematocysts. The arms are connected by a thin membrane. Primary tentacles known as anchors are located on the membrane margin between the arms. The shape of these varies with age. In very young individuals (just after metamorphosis to medusae) they are circular, in juveniles they are triangular, in older organisms they are shaped like the figure '8' and have a longitudinal furrow and a wrinkled surface. Locations where H. antarcticus has been found (stars) Distribution H. antarcticus is one of only two species of Haliclystus which inhabit the Southern hemisphere. It was first identified living in the waters of South Georgia Island, Antarctica. Its presence has since been reported in several locations in Antarctica with probable sightings in Chile and Argentina. Habitat Scientists believe that as H. antarticus individuals grow they become too heavy for the algae to which they attach themselves in juvenile form. They then choose to relocate to another substrate where they are able to attach themselves more firmly. NB. Miranda et al. believe these authors were mistaken in identifying the organisms as H. auricula, identifying them, instead, as H. antarcticus. In a study of individuals in Chile sexually-immature individuals were found exclusively on Ceramium virgatum. Individuals which had reached sexual maturity were found on other substrates including marine eelgrass and other algae. In a study of individuals from South Georgia Island small animals were found on the macroalga Desmarestia menzie while larger animals were found on the underside of boulders. Putative scheme of the life cycle of H. antarcticus, including the ‚Äúmicrohydrula‚Äù phase as proposed by Miranda et al. 2010. Feeding Examination of the contents of H.antarcticus stomachs has revealed that these organisms consume mostly small crustaceans and fly larvae. Individuals with an umbrella height less than 0.4 mm do not appear to eat. These individuals are believed not have yet developed all of their secondary tentacles and they are therefore unable to catch prey. Scientists believe that H. antarcticus eats the largest prey it is able to handle. NB. Miranda et al. believe the author was mistaken in identifying the organisms as H. auricula, identifying them, instead, as H. antarcticus. The largest individuals from South Georgia Island, Antarctica were found to consume calanoid copepods, while smaller individuals ate amphipods. The greatest proportion of the food of individuals from Chile appeared to be harpacticoid copepods followed by gammarid amphipods, chironomid fly larvae and podocopid ostracods. The remainder of the diet included empidid fly larvae, polychaete worms, isopods, juvenile decapod crustaceans and gastropods. Smaller adult individuals from the Chile population appeared to eat mostly copepods, while larger animals ate mostly amphipods. Lifecycle A recent genetic analysis has suggested that Microhydrula limopsicola, originally classified as a member of the order Limnomedusae, is in fact a developmental stage of Haliclystus antarcticus. In its mature form H. antarcticus has eight gonads which are organised into four pairs and run from the central mouth to the ends of the arms. The gonads are approximately 1.6‚Äì12.9 mm in length and are visible through the wall of the calyx. The gonads are mature in specimens which have a calyx height of about 11.72 mm and greater. Predation H. antarcticus is occasionally eaten by the fish Notothenia rossii.

Schulte, Augustin Joseph. \\"Consecration.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 9 Aug. 2014 The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments clarifies that in this context, \\"It should be recalled, however, that the term \\"consecration\\" is used here in a broad and non-technical sense: the expression is use of 'consecrating children to Our Lady', by which is intended placing children under her protection and asking her maternal blessing for them\\". Consecration to the Virgin Mary by Roman Catholics has taken place from three perspectives: personal, societal and regional, and under a number of different titles: the Immaculate Conception, to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, or more recently to Mary, Mother of the Church. Early in the 20th century, Saint Maximilian Kolbe, called the \\"Apostle of Consecration to Mary\\", began a vigorous program of promoting consecration to the Immaculata.Armstrong, Regis J.; Peterson, Ingrid J. and Zagano, Phyllis. The Franciscan Tradition, 2010 p. 51 In Catholic teachings, consecration to Mary does not diminish or substitute the love of God, but enhances it, for all consecration is ultimately made to God.Trigilio, John and Brighenti, Kenneth, The Catholicism Answer Book, 2007 p. 325 Theologian Garrigou-Lagrange designated personal consecration to Mary as the highest level among Marian devotions. Pope John Paul II's motto, Totus Tuus (totally yours), reflected his personal consecration to Mary. He consecrated the entire world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.McLoughlin, William. Mary Is for Everyone, Jill Pinnock 1998 p. 79 History and development The consecrated being sheltered under the protective mantle of the Virgin, Ravensburg, c. 1480. Attributed to Michel Erhart The beginnings of the notion of \\"belonging to Mary\\" can be seen in the writings of Saint Ephrem the Syrian in the 4th century, and a form of personal consecration to Mary dates back to the 5th century, where its practitioners were called \\"servants of Mary\\" and the practice was sometimes referred to as \\"holy servitude\\". However, the first consistent and repeated use of the concept of consecration to Mary was perhaps by Saint Ildephonsus of Toledo in the 7th century, and Pope John VII also referred to it in the 8th century.Calkins, Arthur. \\"Marian Consecration and Entrustment\\", Burke, Raymond L. et al. (2008) Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons pp. 725-737 The notion that consecration to Mary is linked with consecration to Christ and has an ultimate Christocentric goal was already present in the 7th century writings of Ildephonsus, when he wrote: \\"What is delivered up to the Mother rebounds to the Son; thus passes to the King the honor that is rendered in the service of the Queen.\\" In the 8th century, Saint John Damascene continued the theme of consecration to Mary, and when he wrote \\"to you we consecrate (anathemenoi) our minds, our souls and our bodies, in a word our very selves\\" he used the Greek term anathemenoi which indicates \\"the setting aside for sacred use\\". By the 9th century, being a \\"servant of Mary\\" was practiced in Ireland. The act of consecration of cities and regions dates back at least to the 9th century, when Abbo Cernuus of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s composed a poem in which he attributed the failure of the Vikings in the Siege of Paris (885‚Äì886) to the consecration of the city to the Virgin Mary, and her protection over it.Little, Lester K., Plague and the end of antiquity, 2006 p. 139 During the Medieval period, abbeys, towns and cities began to consecrate themselves to the Virgin Mary to seek her protection. In the 12th century C√Æteaux Abbey in France used the motif of the protective mantle of the Virgin Mary which shielded the kneeling abbots and abbesses. In the 13th century Caesarius of Heisterbach was also aware of this motif, which eventually led to the iconography of the Virgin of Mercy. Although previous saints had discussed the notion of consecration, it was only in 11th century France that Saint Odilo at the Cluny Abbey began to spread the formal practice of personal consecration to Mary.McNally, Terrence. 2009 What Every Catholic Should Know about Mary pages 76-78 In the 12th century, the Cistercian orders began consecrating themselves to Mary, first individually and then as a group, and this practice then spread to the Benedictines and the Carmelites. Thurston, Herbert. \\"Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 9 Aug. 2014 The 17th century also saw the adoption of the custom of consecrating the month of May to the Blessed Virgin. During the 18th and 19th centuries the traditions of Marian consecration grew and by 1860 first communion in France included an act of consecration to the Virgin Mary.McGail, Peter. First communion: ritual, church and popular religious identity, 2007 p. 22 By this time Marian consecrations had spread beyond continental Europe and in England Father Frederick Faber had composed a hymn of consecration to the Virgin Mary which included a petition to her motherly role.Doyle, Mary E., Standard Catholic Readers, 2008 p. 33 Since the 19th century, devotions and consecrations to the Immaculate Heart of Mary have been encouraged by several popes including Pius IX, Pius XII and John Paul II.Baker, Kenneth. Fundamentals of Catholicism, 1983 p. 383 Personal consecration Theologian Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, a professor at the Angelicum analyzed various forms and stages of Marian devotions. He designated personal consecration to Mary as the highest level among these devotions. In his theological analysis, Marian devotions are categorized into stages, from beginner to advanced, as follows:Pepinster, Catherine and Wilkins, John. John Paul II: reflections from The tablet, 2005 page 22 :* Occasional prayer, e.g. praying the Hail Mary from time to time. :* Regular and daily devotion, e.g. the devout recitation of the Rosary on a daily basis. :* A formal act of consecration to Mary, and living in habitual dependence on her, as a means of uniting with Christ. The theology of personal consecration to Mary was further explained by Pope John Paul II in Redemptoris Mater where, building on , he stated that the word \\"home\\" refers to the spiritual and inner life of believers, and \\"to take Mary into one's home\\" signifies a filial entrustment to her as mother in every aspect of life. John Paul II suggested Saint John as an example of how every Christian should respond to the gift of the spiritual motherhood of Mary.Pope John Paul II, Redemptoris Mater =Montfort's total devotion and consecration= The practice of consecration to Mary was further promoted in the 18th century by Louis de Montfort. The heart of Montfort's classic work True Devotion to Mary is a formal act of consecration to Mary, so through her, one can be consecrated to Christ. For Montfort, consecration begins a gradual process of sanctification in which a person's focus turns away from self-love and towards God through Mary. In Montfort's view different individuals reach different levels along this scale, depending on their efforts and purity of intentions. Montfort's classification of the multiple levels of spiritual progress is similar to the \\"spiritual dwelling places\\" described by Saint Teresa of Avila in the Interior Castle. Yet Montfort's view differs from Teresa's contemporary, Saint John of the Cross in that Montfort sees the Marian path to Jesus as far more positive, encouraging and smooth than the path followed by Saint John in the Dark Night of the Soul.Raja Rao, Joseph. The Mystical Experience and Doctrine of St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort, Loyola Press, 2005, pp. 265-271 Montfort's concept of consecration was influenced by Henri Boudon's book Dieu seul: le Saint esclavage de l'admirable M√®re de Dieu, (Only God, the Holy Slavery of the admirable Mother of God). By reading Boudon, Montfort concluded that any consecration is ultimately made to \\"God Alone\\", for only God merits the loving servitude of man. Later, \\"God Alone\\" became the motto of Montfort. Montfort's approach followed Boudon very closely, but differed on one element: while Boudon's consecration was founded on the Queenship of Mary, Montfort approach was based on the divine maternity.Boudon, Henri-Marie. Dieu seul: le Saint esclavage de l'admirable M√®re de Dieu, Paris 1674De Montfort, Louis-Marie Grignion God alone: the collected writings of St. Louis Mary de Montfort 1995 p. xvi Pope John Paul II stated that as a young seminarian he had read and reread Montfort many times and \\"understood that I could not exclude the Lord's Mother from my life without neglecting the will of God-Trinity\\".Rossetti, Stephen J. Behold Your Mother, 2007 p. 30Pope John Paul II Reveals Virgin Mary Role in His Life Zenit News, 15 October 2000 =Immaculate Heart of Mary= Francis de Sales began to write on the perfections of the Heart of Mary as the model of love for God in the early parts of the 17th century and his work influenced St. Jean Eudes, who then developed the joint devotion to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary.Mary's Immaculate Heart by John F. Murphy 2007 page 24 Two factors that helped the rapid progress of the devotion were the introduction of the Miraculous Medal by Saint Catherine Laboure in 1830 and the establishment at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, Paris of the Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners. In 1838 Father Desgenettes, the pastor of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, organized the Association in honor of the Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary, which Pope Gregory XVI made a confraternity the same year.Goyau, Georges. \\"Paris.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 9 Aug. 2014 In July, 1855, the Congregation of Rites approved the Office and Mass for the Immaculate Heart.Bainvel, Jean. \\"Devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 9 Aug. 2014 Another driving force for devotions and consecrations to the Immaculate Heart of Mary appeared in the 1917 messages of Our Lady of F√°tima. The three children who reported the messages of Marian apparitions at F√°tima referred to the Immaculate Heart.Youngest Prophet by Christopher Rengers 1998 page 38 The third apparition reported at F√°tima on 13 July 1917, specifically encouraged devotions and consecrations for the triumph of the Immaculate Heart. Although the reports of the F√°tima apparitions were initially met with skepticism, they grew in popularity and were approved by the Holy See in 1930.Patron Saints by Michael Freze 1992 page 211 On 13 May 1967, the 50th anniversary of Our Lady of Fatima, Pope Paul VI visited Fatima, Portugal and issued the Apostolic Exhortation Signum Magnum (meaning a great sign in Latin) in which he asked \\"all sons of the Church to renew their consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary\\".Signum Magnum, 13 May 1967, Vatican In 1986, when addressing the participants in the 1986 International Theological Symposium on the Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, Pope John Paul II stated: \\"Our act of consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary refers ultimately to the Heart of her Son, for as the Mother of Christ she is wholly united to his redemptive mission. As at the marriage feast of Cana, when she said \\"Do whatever he tells you\\", Mary directs all things to her Son, who answers our prayers and forgives our sins.\\"The Alliance of the Two Hearts and Consecration by Msgr Arthur B. Calkins in Miles Immaculat√¶ XXXI (July‚ÄìDecember 1995) pages 389-407. =The Immaculata= Fr.Maximilian Kolbe 1939 In 1854 Pope Pius IX defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus. This greatly helped the spread of devotions and consecrations to the Immaculata.Creeds of the churches: a reader in Christian doctrine by John H. Leith 1983 page 442-446Most, William G., \\"Mary's Immaculate Conception\\", Our Lady in Doctrine and Devotion, 1994 In the early part of the 20th century, Saint Maximilian Kolbe began his efforts to promote consecration to the Immaculata, partly relying on the 1858 messages of Our Lady of Lourdes. He argued that since Mary is Immaculate, by her very nature she is the perfect instrument of the Holy Spirit in the mediation of all graces, given that \\"every grace is a gift of the Father through his Son by the Holy Spirit\\".The Catholic Church: the first 2,000 years by Martha Rasmussen 2003 page 261Encyclopedia of Catholicism by Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton 2007 pages 409-410 Kolbe founded the monastery of Immaculate City and published Militia Immaculatae in multiple languages, which eventually reached a circulation of 750,000 copies a month, until it was stopped when Kolbe was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kolbe's efforts in promoting consecration to the Immaculata made him known as the \\"Apostle of Consecration to Mary\\".\\"Militia of the Immaculata\\", Zenit, 15 June 2006 Societal consecration The Brown scapular has been worn by Carmelites for centuries as a sign of their consecration to Mary.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 365 For many centuries, the Carmelites have worn the Brown Scapular as a sign of their consecration to Mary, and her protection over them.Jackson, Gregory Lee, Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison 1993 page 238 In the 13th century the Servite Order (Servants of Mary), whose focus was on the sorrows of Mary, was approved in Florence, Italy. Over the centuries, a number of Marian movements and societies have been consecrated to the Virgin Mary, e.g. the fourth vow taken by the Marianist Fathers, whose order was formed in the 18th century, during the French Revolution includes a consecration to the Virgin Mary.Biographical dictionary of Christian missions by Gerald H. Anderson 1999 page 124 In the 1948 Apostolic Constitution Bis Saeculari Pope Pius XII encouraged Marian consecrations by the Marian societies such as Sodality of Our Lady.Pope Pius XII, Bis Saeculari Die, 27 September 1948, Vatican On Sunday, 8 October 2000, upon the completion of the ceremonies for the Jubilee of the Bishops, Pope John Paul II and the bishops consecrated and entrusted themselves and the Catholic Church in the new millennium to Mary.\\"Jubilee Entrustment to Mary by Pope John Paul II 2000,\\" All About Mary, International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.Act of Entrustment to Mary, 8 October 2000 at the Vatican website On 12 May 2010 at the Church of the Most Holy Trinity in F√°tima, Portugal, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the beatification of Jacinta and Francisco Marto Pope Benedict XVI consecrated all priests to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.2010 Consecration of priests at the Vatican websiteVatican website: Benedict XVI 13 May 2010 Homily Consecration of locations and regions Statue of Pope Pius XII in F√°tima, Portugal, representing the Marian consecration based on the Our Lady of F√°tima messages.

In the 17th century France was consecrated to the Virgin Mary by Louis XIII and a number of other countries such as Portugal followed that trend.Marian apparitions, the Bible, and the modern world by Donal Anthony Foley 2002 page 69 In the 1917 purported apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima, the Virgin Mary is said to have specifically asked for the consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart.Burke, Raymond L.; et al. (2008). Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, Seminarians, and Consecrated Persons pages 879-889 In June 1938, Portuguese bishops, based on messages reportedly received by mystic Alexandrina Maria da Costa, requested Pius XI to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. This request was renewed several times. On 31 October 1942, Pius XII made a solemn Act of Consecration of the Church and the whole world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, joined by the bishops of Portugal, gathered at the Cathedral in Lisbon.Calkins, Arthur Burton.

Sri 2005 page 13 Mariologist Gabriel Roschini wrote that the 1942 consecration of humanity to Mary can be viewed as an apex for Marian culture.Mary's Immaculate Heart by John F. Murphy 2007 page 105Gabriele Roschini, Compenddium Mariologiae, Rome, 1946, page 512 On 13 May 1982 in Fatima Portugal, Pope John Paul II again consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and said: \\"Consecrating the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary means drawing near, through the mother's intercession, to the very fountain of life that sprang from Golgotha. This fountain pours forth unceasingly redemption and grace. In it reparation is made continually for the sins of the world. It is a ceaseless source of new life and holiness\\". On 25 March 1984, Pope John Paul II again performed the solemn consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary before the statue of the Virgin Mary of Fatima brought to Saint Peter's Square in Vatican City for the ceremony. In his \\"program of Marian consecration and entrustment\\" John Paul II considered consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary as Divinely intended to complement the consecration to the sacred Heart of Jesus.Prayers and Devotions: 365 Daily Meditations by John Paul II 1998 page 357Totus tuus: John Paul II's program of Marian consecration and entrustment by Arthur Burton Calkins 1992 page 106 Pope Pius XII's two consecrations were made in October 1942 and July 1952 and those of John Paul II in May 1982 and March 1984.Burke, Raymond L.; et al.

The \\"Act of Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary\\" appears in the official Raccolta book of indulgenced prayers.The Raccolta by Joseph P. Christopher, Charles E. Spence, D. D. The Rt Rowan 2003 page 390 The prayer originally composed by Saint Louis de Montfort is as follows:Miravalle, Mark Introduction to Mary 1993, , pages 158 > Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in your hands my Baptismal vows; I > renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I give myself entirely to > Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all > the days of my life, and will be more faithful to Him than I have ever been. > With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my > Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, > both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present > and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that > belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time > and in eternity. The prayer used by Pope John Paul II as his act of entrustment of all Bishops to Mary was considerably longer. It began with John 19:26 and included the entrustment as follows: \\"Here we stand before you to entrust to your maternal care ourselves, the Church, the entire world. Plead for us with your beloved Son that he may give us in abundance the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth which is the fountain of life.\\"Vatican website: John Paul II Entrustment of Bishops in 2000 See also * Catholic devotions#Marian devotions * Mother of God (Roman Catholic) * Roman Catholic Marian movements and societies Further reading :* Kalvelage, Francis Mary, 2001.

This film is his longest animation film to date and is described as a \\"lively\\" animated film with adventure, action, and romance centered on a cheerful and spirited girl on a journey to say \\"farewell\\". The film was released in Japan on May 7, 2011. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Japan on November 25, 2011. The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in November 2012. On May 9, 2019 it was announced that Sentai had lost the license, and the film has since been out of print.https://twitter.com/SentaiFilmworks/status/1126520467941203968 Plot Asuna Watase is a young elementary school girl who has been forced to grow up quickly ever since her father had died, while her mother, a nurse, works long shifts at a hospital. Asuna spends her solitary days listening to the mysterious music emanating from the cat's-whisker receiver her father gave to her as a memento, accompanied by pet cat Mimi, who bears strange red markings on her fur. One day, while walking to her clubhouse across a bridge, she is attacked by a fearsome creature and saved by a mysterious teenage boy who calls himself Shun. Asuna treats Shun's wound from fighting the creature and later they both listen to Asuna's radio. Shun tells Asuna he is from another country called Agartha and that he came to this place to find something. He then gives Asuna a blessing in the form of a kiss to the forehead. Asuna leaves hurriedly and tells Shun she'll be back tomorrow. Shun, now alone, looks up at the stars and falls from the ledge to his death. The next morning, Asuna hears from her mother that a boy was found dead in the river, but refuses to believe it's Shun. In school, Mr. Morisaki, a substitute teacher, is giving a lecture on a book which grabs Asuna's attention when he mentions Agartha, the land of the dead. After school, she visits Morisaki and asks him about Agartha. Morisaki explains that long ago when humankind was young, it needed the guidance of Quetzalcoatls, keepers of the dead, until humans matured and no longer needed them. They went underground along with a few humans who joined them. Afterwards, Asuna goes to her hideout to find another mysterious boy who looks like Shun standing on the ledge. Just then, a group of armed men called the Arch Angels appear, and attack both of them. The mysterious boy hides in the underground entrance with Asuna, and the two proceed further into the cave when the cave's entrance is bombed. The two meet a Quetzacoatl who has apparently lost its physical senses and attacks the boy. He refuses to kill the gatekeeper, giving Asuna his clavis, a crystal, and fights back. The Arch Angels interfere, killing the gatekeeper. The Arch Angel commander captures Asuna and uses the clavis to open a gateway to Agartha. The commander and Asuna enter the gateway followed by the boy. Once inside the commander reveals himself to be Morisaki and the boy also reveals himself to be Shin, Shun's younger brother. Morisaki tells Shin that all he wants is to bring back his late wife from the dead. Shin leaves Asuna and Morisaki. Morisaki tells Asuna that she can go back but she decides to accompany him. They both go into the realm via an underwater entrance. Once inside, they journey to the Gate of Life and Death which can bring the souls of people back from the dead, along with Mimi (who had snuck inside Asuna's backpack). Upon arriving in his village, Shin is told he failed his mission to retrieve the clavis, because Asuna has unknowingly returned with a fragment of one. Shin re-embarks to stop Asuna and Morisaki from wreaking havoc in Agartha. Along the way, Asuna is kidnapped by a race of monsters called the Izoku. She awakens in a closed area and meets a young girl named Manna; they both try to escape but are not able to. The day begins to darken and the Izoku begin to appear, but they can only move in the shadows. In their escape attempt they encounter Shin, who helps them but is wounded by an Izoku during the escape. Morisaki finds Asuna and Manna down the river as well as Shin with the help of Mimi. Shin tries to retrieve the clavis crystal fragment that belongs to Asuna. However, he is too weak to put up a fight and Morisaki easily defeats him. Asuna convinces Morisaki to take him with them while Manna leads them to her village. Once there, the villagers are at first reluctant to help the \\"top-dwellers\\" but the village elder convinces the guards to let them in. The elder allows them to stay one night at the village because they have brought Manna back but they cannot stay more than that due to past history in that top-dwellers always bring bad luck to Agartha. Meanwhile, Asuna checks up on Shin but he yells at her to leave him alone. The next morning, Asuna and Morisaki depart from Amaurot by boat, but Mimi no longer wants to accompany them. Shin wakes up later and finds that Mimi has passed; Shin, Manna, and the elder proceed to offer Mimi's corpse to the Quetzacoatl. When Shin sees the villagers riding away to kill them, he decides to follow, in order to protect Asuna. Morisaki and Asuna are walking towards a steep cliff when they are attacked by the villagers but they are saved by Shin. Asuna tries to climb down but is too scared, while Morisaki continues on, after trading his gun for her clavis shard and telling her to go back to the surface. Meanwhile, Shin is fighting the villagers and is about to be killed when the villagers sense that the clavis crystal has reached the Gate of Life and Death. They leave Shin to let him wander aimlessly, having betrayed his country. Asuna, following Morisaki's instructions to stay in the water during nighttime because of the Izoku, walks aimlessly and asks herself why she came to Agartha; she finally accepts that she came to Agartha because she was feeling lonely. When the water dries up, she is attacked by the Izoku but is saved by Shin again. The two return to the cliff after seeing the Ark of Life descending. They encounter a Quetzalcoatl who is about to die. Before he dies, the Quetzalcoatl sings its song to send all its memories into the world; Asuna now understands that the last song she heard in her world was Shun's song before he was to die. The Quetzacoatl offers to take them to the bottom of the cliff. At the bottom of the cliff, they both find the Gate of Life and Death and enter it. Morisaki has already made a wish for his late wife Lisa to return, however, her soul requires a vessel. Asuna and Shin find Morisaki, who tells Asuna she shouldn't have come; she is soon possessed by the soul of Morisaki‚Äôs wife. But this price is insufficient; Morisaki also pays with the loss of an eye. To undo Asuna‚Äôs possession, Shin destroys the clavis crystal, despite Morisaki having a knife to his throat. Breaking the clavis brings Asuna's soul back to her body, after she has had a short reunion with Mimi and Shun. Before Lisa leaves Asuna's body, she tells Morisaki to find happiness without her. Asuna is now back to her normal self but Morisaki is devastated and asks Shin to kill him. Shin tells him that carrying the burden of a deceased loved one is humanity's curse, telling Morisaki to live on. Asuna heads back to the surface and is seen making her farewell to Shin and Morisaki, who chose to stay behind. The film ends with an older Asuna looking out her window at the cliff side where she had met Shun and Shin. She then says her goodbyes to her mother as she hurries to her graduation ceremony.

Development Shinkai spent 2008 in London, after the completion of 5 Centimeters per Second. He returned to Japan in 2009 to start work on his next project. He released two concept drawings for this film in December 2009 and noted that most of his works in the past decade were stories about characters who have to part ways with those they hold dear, but he wanted to take that theme further and wanted to deal more specifically on how to overcome that loss. In November 2010 he revealed critical information about Children Who Chase Lost Voices from Deep Below such as the title, plot summary, release date, and a teaser trailer. As with his previous films, Shinkai is the director and screenplay writer. Takayo Nishimura designed the characters and oversaw the animation process. Takumi Tanji directed the art, and musical composer Tenmon collaborated with Shinkai again. Before the movie's release in May 2011, manga adaptations were set to begin serialization in April 2011 in the first issue of the new magazine Monthly Comic Gene and in Monthly Comic Flapper, both by Media Factory. Release The film's English adaptation was broadcast on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in the United States on November 5, 2016. Critical reception Luke Halliday from Capsule Computers gave the film a perfect score, heralding the film as Shinkai's finest: \\"Children Who Chase Lost Voices is an astonishing film that truly feels like the culmination of Shinkai‚Äôs entire career up until this point. It is his most ambitious work to date and quite simply his crowning achievement in the art form.\\" He continued on to highlight the film's significance to anime as an artform: \\"This is perhaps the most important anime film of the new millennium, because it marks an important changing of tides. It is films like Children Who Chase Lost Voices that remind us of how magical anime can truly be.\\" References External links  * * The Anime Review Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:2011 anime films Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:CoMix Wave Films Category:Drama anime and manga Category:Films directed by Makoto Shinkai Category:Romance anime and manga Category:Sentai Filmworks Category:Toonami ","title":"Children Who Chase Lost Voices"},{"id":"29542938","text":"\\"Heaven Knows\\" is a rock song performed by English rock singer Robert Plant.

She was found guilty of attempted murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years. Choudhry was the first Al-Qaeda sympathiser to attempt an assassination in Britain. Choudhry stated she had been influenced by online sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki, the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Following her trial such material was removed from YouTube.  Background  Choudhry was born in Newham, East London, and lived in East Ham. She was the eldest child and attended Plashet School in East Ham, later studying for her A-levels at Newham Sixth Form College. She had been in the final year of a degree in English and communications at King's College, London, but had dropped out shortly before the attempt on Timms' life. In a police interview, she stated that she dropped out due to finding the university to be anti-Islamic, as they had given an award to the Israeli politician Shimon Peres and ran counter-radicalisation programmes. Choudhry was inspired to attack Timms by the online lectures of Anwar al-Awlaki.  Attack  On 14 May 2010, Timms was approached by 21-year-old Roshonara Choudhry, during his constituency surgery at the Beckton Globe Library in Kingsford Way, Beckton, East London. She acted as though she were going to shake his hand, and then stabbed him twice in his abdomen with a 6-inch kitchen knife, before she was disarmed. She made \\"very full admissions\\" to the police, saying that she had been influenced by dozens of hours of sermons that she had watched of Anwar al-Awlaki, a leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. She said her attack was to punish Timms for voting for the Iraq War, and revenge for the Iraqi people. Choudhry's victim, MP Stephen Timms Timms suffered \\"potentially life-threatening\\" wounds: lacerations to the left lobe of his liver, and a perforation to his stomach. A senior police officer said he \\"was extremely fortunate not to have been killed\\". He underwent emergency surgery at the Royal London Hospital, from which he was discharged on 19 May. Trial Choudhry chose not to attend her trial for attempted murder at the Old Bailey, saying she did not recognise the court's jurisdiction. The prosecutor ruled out any suggestion that she suffered from a mental illness. On 2 November, Choudhry was found guilty of Timms' attempted murder. She was subsequently given a life sentence, with a recommendation that she serve a minimum jail term of 15 years. After the sentence was announced in court, a group of men in the public gallery began shouting \\"Allahu akbar‚Äù and \\"British go to hell.‚Äù A small demonstration took place outside the court. Aftermath After the court case, Timms said he was not bitter, but that forgiveness was not possible until his attacker showed remorse. He was seeking the banning of incendiary material on popular internet sites \\"to protect other vulnerable young people from going down the same road.\\" The Revolution Muslim website described Choudhry as a heroine for stabbing Timms, posted a prayer to destroy the enemies of Islam that named Timms, and responded to her conviction for attacking Timms by publishing a list of MPs who voted in favour of the Iraq War as Timms had, giving advice as to how to find details of their constituency surgeries. Choudhry is incarcerated at HM Prison Bronzefield. As a Category A prisoner, Choudhry must be strip searched before and after being visited. For religious reasons she opposes this and instead chooses to remain in solitude.

Biography Post was born in Gilfach Goch, Wales, the son of a Dutch father of Frisian origin and a Welsh mother. He lived in turns in his native country and in the Netherlands. In 1947 he moved with his mother and sister to his father's home country. His father served with the Princess Irene Brigade, who helped liberate the Netherlands in World War II.  Artistic career  Marten started drawing and painting while still a child and later studied at the art colleges in Arnhem and Enschede. He flourished in the climate of the 1960s. During and after his student years he worked as a designer and performed his own work as a singer/songwriter, accompanying himself on a guitar. At the time he was also exhibiting paintings, pen and ink drawings and graphic work. After teaching art part-time for several years at the Menso Alting college in Hoogeveen, he settled in 1969 as a full-time artist in Holten, in Overijssel province. Besides painting, he carries out assignments in disciplines such as design, illustration and photography. During this period he taught evening classes at an adult education centre in Almelo. His educational aspirations were apparent in his studio where he started an experimental art group for children ages 6 to 9 years, involving their parents in the process. In 1972 he was offered the post of Head of Art at Atlantic College in South Wales, a founder college of the United World Colleges. The decision to accept this post turned out to be one of the most important of his life. It was an inspiring environment opening doors to 30 years of cooperation with young people aged from 16 to 18, from all the corners of the planet. His arrival coincided with the start of the 'Arts and Design‚Äô examination program as part of the International Baccalaureate. His main ambition was to provide his students with structures that would give them the confidence to form a personal basis from which they could explore and develop their own individual talents. Many of his students are now spread around the world as artists in their own right, as painters, sculptors, filmmakers and architects. In 1980, Marten Post and his wife Reina were appointed ‚ÄòHouse Parents‚Äô with responsibility for managing a student house with 48 young people in their care. They continued to fulfil this duty while Crown Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands was studying at Atlantic College. After his retirement from Atlantic College in the summer of 2002, Marten Post and his family returned to the Netherlands. He found a home in Kesteren, situated south of the Rhine river, just opposite the Grebbeberg. His studio is some 10 miles to the west in Tiel, in a former office building near the Waal. Together with a small number of other artists and designers he now occupies a beautiful studio space. The vicinity of water in the form of two great rivers and a nearby hill often trigger associations with his birthplace in Wales.  Visual art  Marten Post writes: > \\"In my studio there are usually four or five paintings ‚Äúwith whom I am in > discussion‚Äù. Sometimes there are long interruptions. The acrylic paint is > build up in many transparent or semi-transparent layers. As visual artist I > mediate between the multi-dimensional and the two dimensional world.

The Danes would then be attacked on three sides: Sten Sture would attack from the south, Nils Sture would flank the Danes and attack from the rear, and Posse would attack the Danes from the east flank. The Danish were completely surprised by Posse's attack. Soon after the battle started, Christian I sent more troops to reinforce their position near Sankta Klara kloster.

The cafe served an all-vegan menu and hosted community-based events, including local benefits, political teach-ins and anarchist infoshop-based classes. The cafe also had wireless internet, fair trade organic coffee, organic wines and local microbrews. History The collective first opened at 2138 SE Division Street, in Portland's Hosford-Abernethy neighborhood, on October 15, 2000. It was originally opened as the Flying Saucer Cafe, which was purchased with loans from members in the community and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). In December 2007, the collective signed a lease at 400 SE 12th Avenue, in the Buckman neighborhood, and opened for business on January 11, 2008. The Red and Black Cafe was a founding member of the Portland Alliance of Worker Collectives (PAWC) and a member of the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC). Red and Black became an IWW union \\"closed shop\\" in October 2009. Effective January 1, 2015, the General Executive Board of the IWW revoked Cooperative Union Shop status. The cafe is highlighted in The Portland Red Guide, a guidebook on radical organizations and people in Portland written by Michael Munk. On March 24, 2015, the cafe announced plans to close indefinitely. =Controversy= On May 18, 2010, Red and Black collective member John Langley asked armed Portland Police Bureau Officer James Crooker to leave the cafe, telling him that he violated the \\"safer space\\" policies of the collective. Various local and national media sources covered the incident including the Portland Mercury, The Oregonian, and CNN. The situation prompted a boycott of the cafe and the creation of Facebook pages both for the boycott, and in support of the collective with \\"Boycott the Red and Black Cafe, Portland, OR\\" and \\"I'm not Boycotting the Red and Black Cafe, Portland OR\\". Subsequently, a press conference was held to address concerns over the decision to ask the officer to leave the premises. Following the controversy, the collective received both verbal and written threats of arson and other violence, but business also increased for the cafe. The cafe was in local news in 2014 when John Langley called 911, for a man who appeared to be having a heroin overdose, and asked the emergency dispatcher explicitly not to send the police. Langley said if they were to arrive they were not to be allowed inside the cafe. Menu The Red and Black Cafe served vegetarian and vegan fare and helped Portland become one of PETA's Most Vegetarian- and Vegan-Friendly Cities in 2010. The cafe purchased produce from Project Grow, an urban farming program that assists developmentally disabled adults. The cafe's menu was predominantly wheat-free and organic.

The team first won the championship in 1972, becoming the first club outside Bucharest to achieve this performance. In the modern format of the SuperLiga, SCM Rugby Timi»ôoara won 4 titles in 6 seasons. The team is colloquially known as \\"Universitatea\\" Timi»ôoara as it has historical ties with the University of Timi»ôoara. In 2014 the club became a partner of London-based Saracens rugby club. In 2020, the club\`s partnership with London-based Saracens rugby club ended making them change their identity to SCM Rugby Timi»ôoara. History In 1949, CSUT (Club Sportiv Universitar Timi»ôoara) played its first match in the city of Sighi≈üoara against the local team, that match was won by CSUT with a score of 34‚Äì0, the team from Timi»ôoara having the following line-up: Liteanu, Antonescu, Popa, Nistor, Haller, Onciul, Zomborian, Georgescu (player-coach), DƒÉncescu, Gurti, Kalincov, Barla, Baruch, Balios and Melinte. =Name change and first National title= Starting with the year 1966 the team changes its name from CSUT to Universitatea Timi»ôoara; MiticƒÉ Antonescu was in charge of the team at that point. The year 1966 was the start of the ascension for the team from Timi»ôoara. In the 1968‚Äì69 championship the team occupies 5th place, in the 1969‚Äì70 championship the team occupies 3rd place, in the 1970‚Äì71 championship the team occupies 5th place and in the 1971‚Äì72 championship, Universitatea Timi»ôoara ‚Äì after 58 years of supremacy from the teams from Bucharest ‚Äì manages to bring the national title to Timi»ôoara. It is said that on 12 June 1972 (the day the team won the national title) the bells of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Timi»ôoara rang one time more than usual, and on the second day at the gate of the boarding house where the majority of the rugby players of Universitatea Timi»ôoara were living, on a board the following could be read: \\"TrecƒÉtorule, opre»ôte-te un moment »ôi √ÆnclinƒÉ-te √Æn fa»õa u»ôii caminului unde trƒÉiesc perlele rugby-ului rom√¢nesc (translation: Passer-by, stop for a moment and take a bow in front of the door of the boarding house where the pearls of Romanian rugby are living)\\", the author of it being, at that time student, Nicolae Benga.

His first attempt to get involved with Romanian rugby was being the technical director for CS Dinamo Bucure»ôti. He was close to taking over the bench of Timi»ôoara in the summer of 2011, but negotiations were put to a hold because of the World Cup that was taking place in New Zealand. Williams brought Timi»ôoara their first league title in 40 years in 2012. He was then replaced by fellow South African Danie de Villiers. In 2014, former New Zealand Heartland XV coach Grainger Heikell took over from De Villiers as head coach of Timi»ôoara Saracens. After two successful seasons for Timi»ôoara, Chester Williams eventually returned to replace Danie de Villiers. =Romanian Cup= In 2011, Timi»ôoara Saracens RCM UVT won the Romanian Cup for the first time, after a 32‚Äì10 victory against CSM Stiin≈£a Baia-Mare. The match took place in Alba Iulia, on the Cetate Stadium. Timi»ôoara Saracens won the Romania Cup once again in 2014 with a victory over CSM Stiin≈£a Baia-Mare on Cluj Arena, and went on to repeat their cup success in 2015 and 2016. =Romanian Rugby Championship (pre-2012) and SuperLiga (2012-)= In 2011, Timi»ôoara Saracens RCM UVT finished in 3rd place. After losing 22‚Äì24 to CSM »òtiin»õa Baia Mare in the semifinals of the Romanian Rugby Championship, the team from Timi»ôoara won the 3rd place final against Farul Constan≈£a (15‚Äì11). Under Chester Williams' management, they won the league in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, Timi»ôoara lost against Farul Constan»õa in the league semi-finals, after the medical visas were allegedly ripped out of the files of Timi»ôoara Saracen's top six players.http://www.gsp.ro/sporturi/rugby/au-disparut-foile- din-carnete-scandal-monstru-in-semifinalele-superligii-nationale-de- rugby-433903.html This is one of many corruption accusations made by the team. Timi»ôoara Saracens won the league again in 2015 and 2016‚Äì17. These two finals, as well as the finals in 2012 and 2013, were played against CSM »òtiin»õa Baia Mare. Timi»ôoara won 8 out of 8 finals (in the SuperLiga, Romanian Cup and King's Cup) they played against Baia Mare. During August 2020, it was announced that Timi»ôoara Saracens RCM UVT will restart in the SuperLiga under the new name of SCM Timi»ôoara Rugby.

He played college football for Stanford where he changed positions from defensive to offensive lineman in 2007. Kopa was signed in 2010 by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent. On November 9, 2010, Kopa was signed by the Miami Dolphins off of the 49ers practice squad. He later played for the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. Early years Kopa earned many accolades as both an offensive and defensive lineman while attending Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove, California. Kopa burst on to the national spotlight during his Junior year following his outstanding performance at the Palo Alto Nike Camp. In 2004, Kopa was ranked as the #82 player in the nation, and the #7 defensive end in the country according to Rivals.com. He played in the CaliFlorida Bowl at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida on January 2, 2005. College career Kopa committed very early in the recruiting process to Stanford, and maintained his allegiance to the Cardinal following the firing of Head Coach Buddy Teevens. He began his career playing on the defensive line for Head Coach Walt Harris. After redshirting his Freshman year, he won the battle for the starting defensive end position in 2006, but suffered a hyperextended elbow during the final week of Training Camp that marginalized his performance until the last month of the season. In 2007, Jim Harbaugh became the new Head Coach at Stanford, and asked Kopa to move over to the offensive line. As a Junior, Kopa played both as a reserve offensive tackle and tight end. Kopa eventually played in 35 career games with the Cardinal. He had seven starts including starting the final six games of the 2008 season, five at right tackle and one at left guard. Kopa was projected to have a breakout season in 2009 and be one of the top offensive tackles taken in the 2010 NFL Draft. Unfortunately, he injured his foot while playing in the 2009 season opener against Washington State and missed the rest of the season after undergoing surgery at Stanford University Hospital. Kopa petitioned the NCAA to play a 6th year, but was denied. Kopa graduated in 2010 from Stanford University with a degree in mechanical engineering. Professional career Kopa attended the NFL Scouting Combine in 2010, but was still rehabbing from foot surgery and did not participate in the on-field drills. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent following the 2010 NFL Draft on June 8, 2010. Kopa was released during final cuts, but was signed to the 49ers' practice squad on September 6, 2010, where he practiced for the first eight games of the season. He was signed by the Miami Dolphins as a free agent off the 49ers' practice squad on November 9, 2010. On September 3, 2011, Kopa was cut by the Miami Dolphins as part of the final roster cutdowns. On September 5, 2011 Kopa was signed to the New England Patriots practice squad. On December 3, 2012, Kopa was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles' active roster off the Patriots' practice squad. Kopa injured his back during the 2013 preseason, and was later released by Eagles when they made their final roster cuts on August 30, 2013. Kopa subsequently had several epidural injections while undergoing physical therapy, but eventually had surgery at Stanford University Hospital to repair two ruptured disks as well as several bulging disks. Not wanting to risk further injury he opted to retire.

He died as a politician in the Swedish government in Stockholm, a proud man.  Support of Sture  Sten Sture was elected as King Charles VIII of Sweden's successor, which was considered rebellion to Christian I of Denmark's legitimate rulership of Sweden. However, Nils Sture was a supporter of Charles VIII, and respected Sten Sture. Nils Sture was also a relative of Sten Sture as his cousin, and his support for Sten was proven family support. Christian I declared war on Sweden, and mobilized his armies. Nils joined Sten's armies in preparation to defend Sweden.  Military career  Nils Sture traveled to central Sweden to recruit more Peasant Militia and Provincial Knights as Sten was doing. When he had recruited enough men, he joined Knut Posse and Sten near Stockholm. Posse was to attack from Stockholm to the east of the Danish Army. Sten was to launch the juggernaut at the Danish front, and Nils was to attack using a flanking movement. All of the Swedes were in position, and when the time came, the battle unfolded.

The Palus Caprae (or Capreae;Ovid, Fasti 2.491. meaning \\"Goat Marsh\\" or \\"the Goat's pool\\"Pierre Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology (Blackwell, 1986, 1996, originally published 1951 in French), pp. 366 and 408.) was a site within the Campus Martius in Ancient Rome. In Roman mythology, the Palus Caprae was the place where Romulus underwent ascension into godhood. Description The marsh was fed by a stream called Petronia Amnis,Nicholas Purcell, \\"Rome and the Management of Water: Environment, Culture, and Power,\\" in Human Landscapes in Classical Antiquity: Environment and Culture (Routledge, 1996), p. 184. but by the Augustan period it had disappeared or been drained.Richardson, New Topographical Dictionary, p. 70. The Palus Caprae was in the small basin where the Pantheon was later built,Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 66. west of the Altar of Mars supposed to have been established by Numa Pompilius, Romulus's successor.Paul Rehak and John G. Younger, Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 11. Ludwig Preller thought it might be the same site as the Aedicula Capraria in Regio VI (Via Lata), as listed by the Regiones,L. Preller, Die regionen der stadt Rom (Jena, 1846), p. 137 online. and Filippo Coarelli conjectured that the mythic significance of the Palus Caprae was the reason for siting the Pantheon there.Filippo Coarelli, Il Campo Marzio: dalle origini alla fine della Repubblica (1997). In myth On the Nones of Quinctilis (July 7), Romulus was reviewing the army on the Campus Martius near the Palus Caprae. Suddenly a storm broke out, accompanied by a solar eclipse, and a deluge consumed the place. When it cleared and the terrified Romans reemerged from their places of refuge, their king was nowhere to be found. Julius Proculus claimed that Romulus appeared to him in a dream and announced that he was henceforth to be known as the god Quirinus, because the gods had taken him up to live among them. Although Romulus is not said to have died, his tomb was supposed to be located on the Comitium under the Lapis Niger.Plutarch, Life of Camillus 33.7 LacusCurtius edition, and Life of Romulus 27.6, here as summarized by Grimal, Dictionary of Classical Mythology, p. 408.

In 1971 he joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he remained until his retirement in 1999. He participated in a number of projects, including Viking, SEASAT, and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). He served as the JPL deputy directory of astrophysics, the manager of the Voyager 2 flight engineering office during the spacecraft's encounter with Uranus, and manager of the Mission Profiling and Sequencing Section. In 1977 he suggested that widely observable celestial events such as nova explosions may be used by hypothetical extraterrestrial intelligences for scheduling the transmission of signals. This would allow receivers in other stellar systems to estimate when the signals would arrive. To test this concept, during a six-month period in 1988, the star Epsilon Eridani was observed using a 40-foot radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, with Nova Cygni 1975 being used as the timer. However, no anomalous radio signals were observed. This does not, of course, preclude the idea from being confirmed at a later date. He received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1984 for his work on the IRAS and the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal for his work on the Voyager encounter with Uranus.

In October 1942, as a NAAFI canteen assistant, he was involved in the action between Petard and , being one of three men to board the sinking submarine in an effort to retrieve vital documents, and was the only one of the three to survive. These documents would later lead the Bletchley Park codebreakers to crack the German Enigma code. After this heroic deed, it was revealed that he was underage to be at sea. He returned home to North Shields. In 1945 he died from injuries sustained while rescuing his sister Maureen from a house fire in North Shields Ridges Estate whilst on leave from HMS Belfast. His family were presented with his medal by King George VI in 1945, and later presented it to the NAAFI in 1985. NAAFI career At the age of 15, Brown joined the NAAFI and was assigned as a Canteen Assistant onboard , a P class destroyer, for service during World War II. Unlike other services, the NAAFI only accepted men from the age of 17 onwards, so Brown had to lie about his age to join. On 30 October 1942, Petard was in the waters off the coast of Port Said, Egypt. They were being sent to relieve , and to investigate radar contact with a submarine along with , , , and Vickers Wellesley light bombers of No. 47 Squadron RAF. After ten hours of depth charge attacks, U-559 came to the surface, it being identified by its distinctive white donkey emblem on its conning tower. Petard fired her 4‚Äìinch guns at the submarine, causing such damage that the crew abandoned ship. Petard then launched a boarding party in a seaboat. Lieutenant Francis Anthony Blair Fasson and Able Seaman Colin Grazier dived into the sea and swam to the submarine, with Brown following them over. The German crew had opened the boat's seacocks, and water was pouring into the vessel. The two Navy men made their way into the captain's cabin where Fasson found a set of keys. They unlocked drawers and found two code books: the Short Weather Cipher and Short Signal Book. Brown carried these documents up the iron ladder of the U-boat's conning tower to Petard's whaler, climbing with one hand while holding the documents in the other. After his third trip down and up the ladder, he called for his shipmates to get out of the boat, but the submarine sank before they could escape. Brown himself was dragged under with the submarine, but managed to fight his way back to the surface and was picked up by the whaler. He was promoted to Senior Canteen Assistant following the incident. Due to the attention arising from his actions in the incident with U-559, his age became known to the authorities. That ended his posting aboard Petard, but he was not discharged from the NAAFI. He returned to his family in North Shields, and later returned to sea on board . In 1945, when he was home on shore leave from Belfast, a fire broke out in the family home at South Shields. Brown died while attempting to rescue his youngest sister Maureen. He was buried with full military honours in Tynemouth Cemetery. Legacy For their actions, Fasson and Grazier were posthumously awarded the George Cross. Brown was awarded the George Medal. His mother Margaret and brother Stanley travelled to London to receive his medal on his behalf after Brown's death in 1945. Prior to being told about the presentation ceremony, his mother hadn't been told that Brown had received a medal for his actions. Unknown to Brown, the documents that he, Fasson, and Grazier retrieved were extremely valuable in breaking the German Enigma code. They allowed British codebreakers to attack the \\"Triton\\" key used by the U-boats, which had been invulnerable for nine months. Allied convoys in the Atlantic could be directed away from known U-boat locations. Winston Churchill wrote that the actions of the crew of Petard were crucial to the outcome of the war. Brown never knew the contents of those documents; information relating to Enigma was not released till decades after his death. In 1985, his brothers Stan and David presented the NAAFI with Brown's medals, to be displayed at the Bletchley Park Museum of codebreaking in Buckinghamshire. In 1987, a stained glass window was dedicated to his memory in his home town at the Saville Exchange building. The museum has since closed, and Brown's medals are now on display at the NAAFI headquarters in Darlington. They were brought there to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the NAAFI in April 2010, with a ceremony being held to celebrate the return of Brown's medal to the North East. In attendance were five of his siblings, Lillian, Sylvia, Norman, Nancy, and Albert.

It is closely related to but stronger than Legendre's conjecture, Andrica's conjecture, and Brocard's conjecture. It is named after Danish mathematician Ludvig Oppermann, who announced it in an unpublished lecture in March 1877. Statement The conjecture states that, for every integer x > 1, there is at least one prime number between : x(x ‚àí 1) and x2, and at least another prime between : x2 and x(x + 1). It can also be phrased equivalently as stating that the prime-counting function must take unequal values at the endpoints of each range.. That is: : œÄ(x2 ‚àí x) < œÄ(x2) < œÄ(x2 + x) for x > 1 with œÄ(x) being the number of prime numbers less than or equal to x. The end points of these two ranges are a square between two pronic numbers, with each of the pronic numbers being twice a pair triangular number. The sum of the pair of triangular numbers is the square. Consequences If the conjecture is true, then the gap size would be on the order of : g_n < \\\\sqrt{p_n}\\\\, . This also means there would be at least two primes between x2 and (x + 1)2 (one in the range from x2 to x(x + 1) and the second in the range from x(x + 1) to (x + 1)2), strengthening Legendre's conjecture that there is at least one prime in this range. Because there is at least one non-prime between any two odd primes it would also imply Brocard's conjecture that there are at least four primes between the squares of consecutive odd primes. Additionally, it would imply that the largest possible gaps between two consecutive prime numbers could be at most proportional to twice the square root of the numbers, as Andrica's conjecture states. The conjecture also implies that at least one prime can be found in every quarter revolution of the Ulam spiral. Status Even for small values of x, the numbers of primes in the ranges given by the conjecture are much larger than 1, providing strong evidence that the conjecture is true. However, Oppermann's conjecture has not been proved .

He was the only prisoner ever to be executed by shooting in the state of Nevada. He had been sentenced to death for the premeditated murder of John Gregovich in Tonopah, Nevada. Mircovich felt that he was owed more money from Gregovich's administration of his late cousin's estate and resorted to settling the matter by stabbing Gregovich to death. A 1911 statute was passed by the Nevada Legislature that allowed a death row inmate to opt to die by shooting or hanging; that statute was repealed in 1921. Mircovich was insistent on shooting, claiming that hanging often took too long. After the Nevada State Prison warden, George W. Cowing, was unable to find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was requisitioned and built to carry out the execution. Background Mircovich's cousin died in the Tonopah Belmont Mine in February 1911. Andriza Mircovich was a 31-year- old miner and a recent immigrant to Nevada from Austria-Hungary. Mircovich spoke little English and was barely literate in his native Serbian dialect. His cousin Christopher Mircovich had died in a fire in the Tonopah Belmont Mine on February 23, 1911. Because Christopher did not have a will, his estate was turned over to Nye County public administrator Arthur H. Keenan. At the recommendation of District Attorney James A. Sanders, Andriza Mircovich and Christopher Mircovich's surviving siblings, Vasso and Maria, met with John Gregovich on May 10, 1911. Gregovich, who also went by the surname Greggory, was a fellow Montenegrin from Castellastva, (now Petrovac), who was handling the cases of other Serbian miners who had died in the fire. Mircovich, who was unfamiliar with the probate laws in Nevada, began cursing Gregovich and Sanders because he was frustrated over being unable to take sole control of the estate. At the time of his death, Christopher Mircovich's estate included $520 in cash, and a settlement of $2,000 from the Tonopah Belmont Company. On July 17, 1911, Gregovich issued a check for $50 to Andriza Mircovich, followed by another check for $1,742.50 to Vasso and Maria on July 22. $507.32 was added to the estate for money orders held in Christopher's name. After legal and administrative fees were paid, $966.25 in undisbursed funds remained in the estate. Mircovich believed that he was owed more money and his demands escalated into threats against Gregovich. On November 14, 1911, Gregovich petitioned District Judge Peter J. Sommers, to be released as executor of the estate. Feeling cheated, Mircovich vowed to take matters into his own hands. At that time, South Slavic immigrants traditionally settled disagreements in mining camps by the use of a knife. Death of John Gregovich Tonopah, Nevada, where Mircovich killed John Gregovich in May 1912. In the early morning of May 14, 1912, Gregovich was at the Tonopah and Goldfield train depot to collect a grocery bill and had engaged a Doctor J. R. Masterson in conversation. Mircovich had come to the depot from the cemetery to see who was arriving on the morning train. When he saw Gregovich on the station platform, Mircovich said, \\"I will get you, you old son-of-a-bitch!\\" He then stabbed Gregovich with a knife in the chest and groin, puncturing his lung and severing his femoral artery. Doctor Masterson was able to clamp the artery with a hemostat from his medical bag. Deputy Sheriff William Walker immediately apprehended Mircovich, who told him that the murder weapon was his and that Gregovich had taken his money. Despite the efforts of a team of doctors, Gregovich died of shock at 1:00 p.m. at Miner's Hospital. At the Nye County Jail, Mircovich told Sheriff Ed Malley that he \\"wanted to make John Gregovich die\\", although Malley did not advise him that such statements could be used against him in court. =Trial and sentencing= Mircovich was convicted at the Nye County Courthouse on June 15, 1912. At the grand jury hearing on the next day, Nye County Judge Mark R. Averill denied bail, as Mircovich's case involved capital murder. George B. Thatcher was Mircovich's court-appointed attorney, but had to leave town on June 1, 1912, for the Democratic State Convention in Fallon. Averill then appointed Patrick M. Bowler on behalf of Mircovich until Thatcher returned on June 5. The case was prosecuted by District Attorney Sanders. Witnesses testified that Mircovich had made threats against Gregovich's life, and was once thrown out of Gregovich's business premises. In his closing statement Sanders challenged the all-male jury to have the \\"manhood\\" to \\"defend the law of my country and its liberty-loving people\\" or else \\"we might just as well dynamite this old courthouse. We might just as well take his Honor off the bench and say we have no law in Nye County.\\" On June 15, 1912, Mircovich was convicted of premeditated murder. He was sentenced to death by Judge Averill. Mircovich boarded a train to Nevada State Prison in Carson City on June 17 while escorted by Sheriff Malley and prison warden George W. Cowing. Mircovich parted with the statement: \\"They will treat me to a shower of cold lead.\\" He became nauseated during the trip and begged his captors to shoot him right away, not understanding that attorneys would pursue appeals on his behalf. Attorney J.E. McNamara argued to the Nevada Supreme Court that Sanders unfairly prejudiced the jury with the statement: \\"Why, gentlemen of the jury, if you cannot pronounce by your verdict the death penalty upon this defendant, I say, let's resurrect old Casey [that killed Mrs. Hislop in Goldfield] and let him live again.\\" However, the appeal was denied and the lower court decision was upheld, with Justice Pat McCarran abstaining from the opinion. Execution Nevada State Prison had been the state-designated facility for hangings since 1903. At the urging of the Mormon population, the Nevada Legislature passed a statute in 1910 that became effective in January 1911, which allowed condemned prisoners to choose between execution by shooting or hanging. Only Mircovich and one other inmate selected shooting. However, the other prisoner's sentence was commuted. Warden Cowing tried to talk Mircovich out of his decision. Mircovich did not want to be hanged and insisted on being shot, claiming it would be quicker. Cowing was faced with a predicament in meeting the scheduled execution date of August 29, 1912, because he was unable to find five marksmen willing to participate in a firing squad. =The shooting machine= Denver S. Dickerson supervised the execution. The state then ordered a rack of rifles that was to be set up on a frame by an Eastern ordnance foundry. The 1000-pound (450 kg) execution machine, which was called the \\"shooting gallery of steel\\", included three Savage Model 1899 .30-30 caliber rifles with Maxim silencers. When the device arrived at the prison, Cowing no longer wanted to have any part of the execution and resigned. Denver S. Dickerson, a former Nevada governor and prison reformer, was appointed as the new warden. On May 13, 1913, Prison Chaplain Lloyd B. Thomas of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Carson City, Nevada, made an unsuccessful appeal for commutation on Mircovich's behalf with the Board of Pardons. The \\"shooting machine\\" was designed to be loaded with two lethal rounds and a blank cartridge, each connected to a coiled spring mechanism. The device could be fired by cutting three strings, only one of which would fire the rifles. This design would prevent the three randomly selected prison guards from knowing who would be responsible for triggering the lethal shot. On the morning of May 14, the three guards entered the firing area and then the 12 invited witnesses were admitted to a designated enclosed space in the yard. Mircovich refused an offer for a blindfold from Warden Dickerson and shook his hand, stating: \\"I much obligated to you. You be good man to me.\\" Mircovich was then strapped to a chair bolted onto a platform in front of the machine. The prison doctor, Donald T. McLean, placed a heart-shaped target on Mircovich's chest. The aim on the loaded rifles were sighted on the defendant's heart, and checked by each guard. Mircovich cursed the name of Judge Averill and said \\"I die like a soldier\\" before he was shot to death. =Aftermath= Nevada State Museum in Carson City. Doctor McLean declared that the death was instantaneous. An autopsy found the two soft-nosed ball cartridges within 2/3 inch (17mm) of each other in Mircovich's heart. Reverend Thomas conducted an informal service at the prison cemetery that afternoon. Mircovich's body was buried in a pine coffin on the same day. In a 1915 report to the Nevada Legislature, Dickerson stated that despite his personal reservations, \\"executions by shooting are a trifle less barbarous than by hanging and have the further merit of eliminating many of the possibilities of bungling.\\" However, the shooting machine was never used again and was placed in storage by the prison quarry. In July 1942, it was donated with 50 tons of scrap metal for a collection drive during World War II.

Sylvia as a private motorboat prior to her U.S. Navy service.Sylvia was built as a private motorboat of the same name by Sam Williams at Marco, Florida. On 6 June 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, J. Alwood of Winter Haven, Florida, for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. She was commissioned as USS Sylvia (SP-471) on 4 September 1917. Assigned to the 7th Naval District, Sylvia operated on patrol duty in Florida waters for the rest of World War I and into early 1919. On 11 April 1918 her name was changed to USS SP-471 to avoid confusion with the first , a patrol yacht which also was in commission at the time. SP-471 was out of commission and awaiting sale when she became one of eight section patrol boats destroyed at North Beach Basin at Key West, Florida, on 9 September 1919 by the 1919 Florida Keys Hurricane. Anchored in the basin when the hurricane struck, she was beaten to pieces against the basins wall and completely wrecked. Sources vary as to when SP-471 was stricken from the Navy List. It may have occurred on 24 April 1919 in advance of her being put up for sale or on 4 October 1919 after her destruction.

He was the cousin of Richard Aldworth of Stanlake Park, paternal grandfather of Richard Aldworth, 2nd Baron Braybrooke. In 1700 Charles succeeded his father, who had secured a long lease on Frogmore, but was forced to move out with his two sisters in 1709. Aldworth was educated at King's College, Cambridge, matriculating there in 1693, after which he studied law at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1703. Recommended by the Duke of Northumberland, he was returned as MP for New Windsor in 1712. He sat as MP until his 1714 death in a duel: Colonel Chudleigh, a whig army officer, accused Aldworth of Jacobitism and profited from Aldworth's physical disability by shooting him dead in the duel which followed. He was unmarried and had provided for his unmarried sisters by selling part of his inheritance.

Only two genera are known exclusively from post Mississippian formations, Knightoceras from Middle Pennsylvania and Foordiceras from Permian.

Background The original Bill was introduced in the Scottish Parliament on 8 March 2000 by Tavish Scott MSP. The existing Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 required that a shellfish farmer seeking a Several Order to allow them to control an area of seabed on which to farm shellfish frequently encountered opposition from fishermen who fish in the area to be covered by the Order. If the Several Order was issued, all fishing was banned within the area covered, regardless of whether or not the fishing operations damaged the interests of the shellfish farmer.Financial Memorandum, Scottish Parliament, 8 March 2000 The amendment to the 1967 Act allows Scottish Ministers making a Several Order to authorise the continuation of specified non-damaging fishing operations within the area covered by the Order. The aim of the Bill was thus to avoid unnecessary and avoidable conflicts of interests between shellfish farmers and fishermen. Provision The purpose of the Bill was to permit Scottish Ministers to authorise the use by fishermen of non-damaging types of fishing gear such as creels in areas covered by Several Fisheries Orders. Thus, in section 7 of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 (c.83) (protection of fisheries), in subsection (4)(a), after sub-paragraph (ii) there was inserted: \\"or (iii) in the case of several fishery, an implement of a type specified in the order and so used as not to disturb or injure in any manner shellfish of the description in question.\\"  Passage through Parliament The Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act 2000 asp 12 was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 28 September 2000. The bill was given the Royal Assent on 2 November 2000.

The Danes invaded Sweden by sea, but were defeated early at the Battle of Brunkeberg, in which King Christian I of Denmark was wounded by a cannonball. The Danish invasion was repelled, and the Swedes were independent from the Kalmar Union.  Background  Margaret I of Denmark created the Kalmar Union, a unified Scandinavian Empire under her rule. Queen Margaret I of Denmark created the Kalmar Union (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) under her rule with Sweden joining voluntarily. After a few years, however, secessionist movements arose among the Swedish noble's council, led by Karl Knutsson Bonde. Sweden became independent and was then re-occupied by Denmark, only to gain its independence again. When King Karl died, the Swedish council elected Sten Sture the Elder as viceroy. Christian I of Denmark then declared war to re-establish the Kalmar Union.  Campaign  Christian I of Denmark. King Christian I had 3,000 Danish troops and 2,000 allied Germans. Sture had only about 400 troops in his army, and the Danish could easily pick a fight. In late July 1471, the fleet of 76 Danish ships with the 5,000 troops set out from Copenhagen harbour to land in southern Sweden. Sture and Nils Bosson Sture went to central Sweden to gather as many men as they could for the defense of Stockholm. The Danish fleet would have to face the murderous flow of the archipelago that blocked off Stockholm, but managed, possibly with the help of a hired Swedish pilot, to anchor between K√§pplingeholm and Wolf's Island (Varg√∂) just across the water from Stockholm Castle. Christian decided that a siege would take too long, so he landed in southern Sweden instead. Sten Sture awaited the Danes, now with 10,000 levied peasants.  The Battle of Brunkeberg  Sture enters Stockholm, victorious; later depiction by Georg von Rosen On Thursday, October 10, Sten Sture and Nils Bosson Sture lead their troops north to the area which is H√∂torget in Stockholm today, near Brunkeberg after which the battle was named. Sten Sture's battle plan was to trap Christian's troops in a vice; Sten would attack from the west, Nils from the east, and Knut Posse would strike out from the city itself. Nils flanked Christian's Army, and delivered a knockout blow. In Sten's sector, he kept on charging again and again, and managed to break through. In the ensuing battle, Christian was hit in the face by musket fire. Losing several teeth, he was forced to retire from battle. The decisive turn of battle in favor of Sture's side occurred when Nils' troops broke out of the forest north of the ridge, as Posse's troops attacked from the city. This cut off a contingent of Danish troops at the Klara monastery north of the town. Posse was killed when a German or Danish soldier hit his head with an axe. However, the Danish were in retreat. Christian retired with his troops towards the island of K√§pplingen (today the Blasieholmen peninsula). However, Sten's troops destroyed the makeshift bridge Christian's troops had built, causing many to drown. The battle ended a victory for Sten Sture. Sture's victory over Christian meant his power as viceroy of Sweden was secure and would remain so for the rest of his life. According to legend, Sture had prayed to Saint George before the battle. He later paid tribute to George by commissioning a statue of Saint George and the Dragon carved by the L√ºbeck sculptor Bernt Notke for the Storkyrkan church in Stockholm, as an obvious allegory of Sture's battle against Christian. An altar dedicated to George was also built in the church. According to a 2019 study, \\"For the victorious Swedes, the battle could be used to confirm a powerful narrative of a long-term, but ultimately successful, struggle against the (Danish) enemies of the realm and the community, most famously represented through the monument of Saint George and the dragon that was erected in 1489.\\"  Aftermath  Now that Christian's invasion was beaten off, Sture had cemented Swedish freedom. He had defeated the Kalmar Union, and Sweden had gained independence. Christian's Denmark still held Iceland, Denmark, and Norway after the war. The two nations that were formed were Sweden and Denmark‚ÄìNorway. Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland died in 1486, Christian in 1481, and Sture in 1503.Devries, Kelly:Battles of the Medieval World  References  Category:1470 in Europe Category:1471 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1470 Category:Conflicts in 1471 Category:Wars involving Denmark Category:Wars involving Sweden Category:Denmark‚ÄìSweden relations ","title":"Dano-Swedish War (1470‚Äì71)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikitable ü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",R]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/21.md","filePath":"quotesmag/21.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/21.md"},x=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,x as default};
