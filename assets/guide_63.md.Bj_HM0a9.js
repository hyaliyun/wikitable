It is based on the belief of the law of attraction, which claims that thoughts can change a person's life directly. The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages. Background The Secret was released as a film in March 2006, and later the same year as a book. The book is influenced by Wallace Wattles' 1910 book, The Science of Getting Rich, which Byrne received from her daughter during a time of personal trauma, in 2004.The Secret, p. ix. New York Times bestselling authors of The Passion Test, Janet Bray Attwood and Chris Attwood, are not featured in the film or the book, but arranged 36 of the 52 interviews for the film, many of which are referenced in the book. The book served as the basis for the 2020 film The Secret: Dare to Dream. Synopsis  Byrne re-introduces a notion originally popularized by persons such as Madame Blavatsky and Norman Vincent Peale that thinking about certain things will make them appear in one's life. Byrne provides examples of historical persons who have allegedly achieved this. Byrne cites a three-step process: ask, believe, and receive.The Secret, p. 47. This is based on a quotation from the Bible's Matthew 21:22: \\"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\\" Byrne highlights the importance of gratitude and visualization in achieving one's desires, along with alleged examples. Later chapters describe how to improve one's prosperity, relationships, and health, with more general thoughts about the universe. ReceptionGross= The book has been translated into 50 languages and has sold over 30 million copies. Due partly to an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the book and film had grossed $300 million in sales by 2009. Byrne has subsequently released Secret merchandise and several related books. =Critical response= US TV host Oprah Winfrey is a proponent of the book. On The Larry King Show she said that the message of The Secret is the message she's been trying to share with the world on her show for the past 21 years. Author Rhonda Byrne was later invited to her show along with people who swear by The Secret. Valerie Frankel of Good Housekeeping wrote an article about her trying the principles of The Secret for four weeks. While she reached some of her goals, others had improved. Frankel's final assessment is: \\"Counting my blessings has been uplifting, reminding me of what's already great about my life. Visualization has forced me to pay attention to what I really desire. And laughing is never a bad idea. If you ignore The Secrets far-too-simplistic maxims (no, you will not be doomed to a miserable life for thinking negative thoughts) and the hocus-pocus (the cosmos isn't going to deliver a new car; it's busy), there's actually some helpful advice in the book. But it's nothing you don't already know.\\" In 2009, Barbara Ehrenreich published Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America as a reaction to self-help books such as The Secret, claiming that they promote political complacency and a failure to engage with reality. Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, is one of the harshest critics, writing that the book is \\"full of misplaced clichés, silly quotes, and superstitious drivel,\\" and calls it a \\"playbook for entitlement and self-absorption,\\" which \\"anybody who reads it and implements its advice ... will likely make themselves worse off in the long run.\\" John G. Stackhouse Jr. has provided historical context, locating Byrne's book in the tradition of New Thought and popular religion, and concluding that \\"it isn’t new, and it isn’t a secret\\". Byrne's scientific claims, in particular concerning quantum physics, have been rejected by a range of authors including Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons at The New York Times and Harvard physicist Lisa Randall.Randall, Lisa. 2011. Knocking on Heaven’s Door: How Physics and Scientific Thinking Illuminate the Universe and the Modern World. p. 10. Mary Carmichael and Ben Radford, writing for the Center for Inquiry, have also pointed out that The Secret has no scientific foundation, stating that Byrne's book represents: \\"a time-worn trick of mixing banal truisms with magical thinking and presenting it as some sort of hidden knowledge: basically, it’s the new New Thought.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2006 non-fiction books Category:Australian books Category:Philosophy of life Category:Self-help books ","title":"The Secret (book)"},{"id":"20844072","text":"Erhard Weiß (May 26, 1914 - July 7, 1957) was a German diver who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

He ended the month as a triple ace. He shot down another dozen enemy planes in August, including another triple on the 9th. Also during July and August, he briefly commanded Jasta 66. In mid-August, he was transferred to command Jagdstaffel 10 in Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1), the Jagdgeschwader von Richthofen. The JG 1 commander was Hermann Göring. Laumann scored his last four victories with Jasta 10, including his final one on 4 September. On 7 September, he was awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. The Pour le Merite, or Blue Max, followed on 25 October, and was the final one awarded to any member of JG I. He's one of the few pilots who scored all of his victories entirely on the Fokker D.VII, along with Georg von Hantelmann, Werner Preuss and Olivier Freiherr von Beaulieu-Marconnay. Service after World War I After the armistice, he was transferred to the Signals Battalion of Military District Command VI until August 1919. From there he was returned to the 83rd Field Artillery Regiment and placed on indefinite leave. He was mustered out on 31 December 1920. In 1932 and 1933, he became an advisor to an aviation group. He was appointed SA- Standartenführer, a paramilitary field officer's rank, on 24 August 1932. From there, he moved to leading a formation of the German Air Sport Formation until 31 March 1935. This led to his entry into the Luftwaffe as a Major on 1 April 1935 as commander of Air Region Reserve 12 in Cologne. Also during 1935, he was appointed to squadron command in II Group of JG 132. He held that post until 1 February 1939, when he moved up to command of II Group. On 4 September 1939, he left his command to become the Air Attache for Yugoslavia and Greece, with his home base being the German Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

Hartley played for Everton as a centre forward for five years in the 1890s. He also played for Merseyside rivals Liverpool and for his local club, Dumbarton. His career also included stints at Southampton, Woolwich Arsenal and Burnley at the end of his career. He appeared on the losing side in the 1897 FA Cup Final while at Everton. Football careerEarly days= Hartley was born in Dumbarton, Scotland and was the son of a tailor. After youth football with Artizan Thistle, he joined Dumbarton, where two of his brothers also played, in 1890. During his time with Dumbarton, he converted from a right back to a forward. While on the books of Dumbarton, the team won the first two Scottish Football League titles in 1891 and 1892 together with the 1891 Scottish Cup. However Hartley was not a regular with the club at this stage. =Everton= He moved south of the border to join Everton in December 1892, making his debut on 18 March when, playing at inside right, he scored in a 4–2 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers.Wolverhampton Wanderers 4 Everton 2 (18 March 1893) Match summary That was his only appearance in the 1892–93 season in which Everton finished third in the table. The following season, he made six league appearances, scoring twice, following this up with five goals from 11 appearances in the 1894–95 season when Everton finished as runners-up behind Sunderland. During this season he remained third–choice striker behind England internationals, Fred Geary and Jack Southworth. Following Southworth's retirement through injury and Geary's move to Liverpool, Hartley played more regularly although the arrival of Scotland international John Cameron prevented Hartley from claiming the centre-forward's berth as his own. In the 1895–96 season he made 15 appearances, scoring seven goals as Everton finished in third place followed by 14 appearances with six goals in the following season. In 1897 Everton reached the FA Cup Final with victories en routeEverton statistics: FA Cup 1896–97 over Burton Wanderers (5–2), Bury (3–0), Blackburn Rovers (2–0) and Derby County (3–2). Hartley played in all five matches in the cup run, scoring against Blackburn (twice) and Derby. In the final Everton came up against Aston Villa who were dominating the Football League season. Although Everton took the lead after 28 minutes with goals from Jack Bell and Dickie Boyle, they were unable to prevent Villa claiming the Double with a 3–2 victory. In the following season, he only made three appearances (scoring a hat-trick against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 September 1897 Everton 3 Wolverhampton Wanderers 0 (18 September 1897) Match summary) before moving across Stanley Park to join Liverpool in December. In his five years at Everton, Hartley made 61 appearances, scoring 28 goals; his appearances were restricted due to the quality of forwards on Everton's books such as Geary, Southworth and Cameron as well as other internationals Alf Milward, Edgar Chadwick (both England) and Jack Bell (Scotland). =Liverpool= Hartley stayed at Liverpool for the remainder of the 1897–98 season. During his time with the club he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 away win at Sheffield United on 29 December 1897. Altogether Hartley was capped a sum of 12 times for Liverpool, scoring once. By now, Hartley was a member of the Association Footballers' Union which was trying to improve player's wages and contract terms. To improve his wages, Hartley decided to join Southampton. =Southampton= Being members of the Southern League, Southampton were not bound by the restrictions imposed on Football League clubs and were quite willing to pay higher salaries for talented players. Southampton had just moved into their new stadium at The Dell and had signed England internationals Arthur Chadwick, Jack Robinson and Harry Wood as well as Scotland's Jacky Robertson. Hartley was ever-present until injury forced him to sit out the last three matches of the 1898–99 season as Southampton claimed the Southern League title for the third consecutive year. Hartley's 14 league and two FA Cup goals made him joint top scorer for the season (with Harry Wood). Hartley would place a hand-rolled cigarette behind his ear prior to kick-off and then smoke it in the changing room at half-time before re-taking the field. =Arsenal and Burnley= Hartley moved to Woolwich Arsenal in July 1899 where he scored once in five appearances. He made his debut away to Walsall on 23 September 1899 and scored his only goal in a 2–1 win over Gainsborough Trinity on 14 October. However that same month Arsenal signed Ralph Gaudie from Sheffield United, who forced Hartley out of the side. Hartley was sold in December, moving back to Lancashire to join Burnley where he brought an end to his playing days. His five goals from thirteen appearances were unable to prevent Burnley being relegated to the Second Division at the end of that season. Later career After retiring from football in 1900, Hartley returned to live in Southampton. He took up employment with the London and South Western Railway but collapsed and died outside the pay office in Southampton Docks on 9 October 1909, aged only 37. A doctor at the inquest attributed his death to \\"syncope, arising from double pneumonia\\". Honours Dumbarton * 1 representative cap for Dumbartonshire in 1892.

He served as President of the New Jersey State Senate and as President of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. Early life Alexander was born in 1806 in Prince Edward County, Virginia, the second son of noted Presbyterian theologian Archibald Alexander and his wife Janetta Waddel. His elder brother James Waddel Alexander (1804-1859) would also become a Presbyterian theologian and minister. Another brother, Joseph Addison Alexander (1809-1860), would become a biblical scholar. Alexander's father was president of Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia before being called to serve as minister of the Third Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia in 1807. The family then moved to Princeton, New Jersey when Archibald Alexander was named the first professor of the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1812. Alexander graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1824 and was admitted to the bar of New Jersey as an attorney in 1828. He opened an office in Princeton and attended to his professional business there for about thirty years. He also joined the militia company known as the Princeton Blues and achieved the rank of colonel. Political career Alexander never obtained his license as counsellor and took a greater interest in politics than law. He entered the New Jersey General Assembly in 1836 as a Democrat from Middlesex County (before the formation of Mercer County). In 1851 he succeeded Charles Smith Olden as a member of the New Jersey Senate from Mercer County, serving as president of that body for four terms. In 1856 he was drafted to run as the Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey. He lost to the Republican candidate William A. Newell by less than 3,000 votes. Alexander was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention and at the second Convention in Baltimore he received one vote for the Vice Presidency. He was a delegate to the Peace Conference of 1861, after which time he withdrew from political life and devoted himself to a career as a life insurance executive. Business career Alexander was chosen President of the Equitable Life Assurance Society when it was organized in 1859. His brother, Presbyterian minister James Waddel Alexander, had become the patron of Equitable founder Henry Baldwin Hyde, and many of the company's original directors were members of Rev. Alexander's Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. Alexander did not assume an active role in management of Equitable business, leaving that to the much younger Hyde, who was named vice president and manager. Alexander served as president until his death at his New York City residence in 1874 at the age of 68. He was succeeded by Hyde and then by his nephew James Waddell Alexander (1839-1915) after Hyde's death in 1899. Alexander never married. He was buried in the family plot at Princeton Cemetery.

In her lifetime she was highly regarded in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) for several reasons. First, she was one of the earliest Latter Day Saints to return to Independence, Missouri, after the American Civil War, when Latter Day Saints still faced some endangering prejudices. Second, she was the first librarian for the historic RLDS Stone Church, and a regular contributor or commentator for the Saints' Herald church magazine. Third, as with her grandfather, her uncle Joseph Smith III, her father, and other relatives in the Latter Day Saint movement, Kennedy produced a number of writings, revelations and prophecies which circulated among church membership. A month before her eightieth birthday in 1949, Kennedy wrote in a letter to a relative: > I just am very much alive in the onward march of this church of ours and > have a gift that helps many, the gift of prophecy. I have foretold some > things and they have come to pass...It sounds rather boasting but I was told > in prophecies I would do this work, as a portion of the mantle of my father > had fallen on me and I must to comfort God's people.

Hill won 15 caps for Wales over a period of ten years and was given the team captaincy on four occasions. Hill was baptised as Alperus Frank Hill according to parish records in Llandaff, and was later educated at Clifton College. He was a solicitor by trade, and had a practice on Cardiff High Street.Jenkins (1991), pg 71. International career Hill was first selected for Wales in a match against Scotland as part of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Newport's Charlie Newman, the game was a dull scoreless draw caused by Welsh attempts to kill the game at any opportunity. Hill played in both Welsh matches of the 1886 Championship, but was not chosen during the next year's tournament. In 1888 Hill experienced his first international win, when he was part of the Wales team that beat Scotland at Rodney Parade. Wales won by a single try, scored by Thomas Pryce-Jenkins in the first half before using the same spoiling tactics they employed in 1885 to prevent Scotland from scoring. In December 1888, Hill was selected to captain Wales against the first Southern Hemisphere touring team to Britain when he faced the New Zealand Māoris. Wales employed the four threequarters system during the game, the first time since it was abandoned after the failure of the tactic against Scotland in 1886. The Welsh were victorious and Hill was given the captaincy for the opening game of the 1889 Home Nations Championship to Scotland. Wales lost the game and Hill was replaced for the final game of the season to Ireland by Daniel Griffiths. Hill regained his position and his captaincy in the first match of the 1890 tournament, though missed the away match to England. When he was reselected for the final game of the championship the captaincy was passed to Arthur Gould. Hill missed the next two tournaments, before playing the entirety of the 1893 tournament which saw Wales win all their matches to take the Triple Crown for the first time. The next season was Hill's last as an international player and although only one of the team that won the Triple Crown the previous year was not reselected, the team was not harmonious. Gould and Hill fell out over scrummaging tactics against England, causing Hill to work against his own packleader,Griffiths (1987), pg 4:7. Jim Hannan, resulting in a massive English victory. Hill's final game was a loss to Ireland in Belfast, in which Hill was given the captaincy. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 466. * 1886, 1893, 1894 * 1888, 1890, 1893, 1894 * 1888 * 1885, 1886, 1888, 1889, 1890, 1893, 1894 As referee In 1889 Hill refereed the encounter between Oxford University and the touring New Zealand Māoris.Maoris v.

Described by French naturalist Jacques Labillardière in 1805, it had first been collected by Archibald Menzies in 1791. Within the genus Adenanthos, it lies in the section Eurylaema and is most closely related to A. barbiger. A. obovatus has hybridized with A. detmoldii to produce the hybrid A. × pamela. Several common names allude to the prominent red flowers of the species. It grows as a many-stemmed spreading bush up to high, and about across, with fine bright green foliage. Made up of single red flowers, the inflorescences appear from April to December, and peak in spring (August to October). The shrub grows on sandy soils in seasonally wet lowland areas as well as hills and dunes. It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground lignotuber. Pollinators include honeyeaters, particularly the western spinebill, which can access the nectar with its long curved bill, and the silvereye, which punctures the flower tube. The most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia, it has a long flowering period and attracts honeyeaters to the garden. It is harvested for the cut flower industry. Description The growth habit of Adenanthos obovatus is that of a lignotuberous shrub, with many stems arising from a single underground lignotuber. It typically reaches about in height, and about 1.5 m in width, but plants occasionally reach a height of .Nelson (1978): 329. The leaves of this species are bright green, oval in shape, up to long and wide, sessile, and arranged in a spiral pattern on the branches. The flowers appear steadily between April and December, and are most frequent between August and October. They are red or orange, and emerge from the leaf axils. They are usually solitary, but occasionally an axil will carry two flowers. As with other Proteaceae species, each flower consists of a perianth of four united tepals, and a single style. In A. obovatus, the perianth is around long, and the style around . Although the flowering period is lengthy (six months), there are generally only a few flowers at any one time, and a seven-year study at Harry Waring Marsupial Reserve south of Perth revealed fairly constant flowering from year to year, even when shrubs were cut back to ground level to simulate a bushfire. The species is very similar to A. barbiger. There are obvious differences in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A. barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A. obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A. barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A. obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A. obovatus and pointed in A. barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A. barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A. obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.Nelson (1975b): 135. TaxonomyDiscovery and naming= alt=an ancient pencil drawing of leaf and flower parts of a plant The first known botanical specimen collection of A. obovatus was made by Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791. However, this collection did not result in publication of the species. Other early collections include a specimen collected by Scottish botanist Robert Brown during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound in December 1801 and January 1802; and, thirteen months later, King George Sound specimens collected by Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour, botanist to Nicolas Baudin's voyage of exploration,Nelson (1975a): 332. and \\"gardener's boy\\" Antoine Guichenot. In his notes on vegetation published in the official account of the expedition, Leschenault writes: The species with rounded leaves was A. obovatus.Nelson (1975b) 1: 27. A description of the species was published by Jacques Labillardière in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, accompanied by a figure drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Plée.Nelson (1975b) 1: 41. Labillardière chose the specific name obovata, in reference to the leaves of his specimen, which were obovate (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base).Nelson (1978): 331.Nelson (1975b) 2: A38. This leaf shape is often seen in this species. The term obovata derives from the Latin ob- (\\"inverse\\") and ovum (\\"egg\\"),Wrigley (1991): 70. and has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.Nelson (1978): 320. Labillardière did not acknowledge any collector, and so it was long thought that Labillardière himself had collected the first botanical specimens in 1792 while naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean- François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. However, this and eight other species described by Labillardière do not occur in any locations that he visited, suggesting that he obtained specimens from someone else whom he failed to credit. Though he did not specify a type specimen for A. obovata, a specimen upon which the accompanying figure in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen appears to be based has been located; it is annotated, apparently in Labillardière's hand, as having been collected by Leschenault. Ernest Charles Nelson states with certainty that Labillardière based this species on specimens collected by Leschenault,Nelson (1978): 331. \\"Labillardière could not have collected this species himself in Western Australia (terra van- Leuwin). The type material was collected by Leschenault de la Tour, and passed to Labillardière who used that material for the type description.\\" and this view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously. =Infrageneric placement= In 1870, George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A. obovata in A. sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with one sterile stamen, and perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle. A phenetic analysis of the genus undertaken by Ernest Charles Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which the members of A. sect. Eurylaema occurred together, with A. obovata appearing most closely related to A. barbigera (now A. barbiger), and then A. detmoldii.Nelson (1975b) 1: 130. A. obovata was therefore retained in A. sect. Eurylaema in Ernest Charles Nelson's 1978 revision of Adenanthos,Nelson (1978): 321 and again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender. Hence the species is now known as Adenanthos obovatus.Nelson (1995): 324. Its placement in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema :::A. detmoldii :::A. barbiger :::A. obovatus :::A. × pamela ::A. sect. Adenanthos (29 species, 8 subspecies) =Hybrids= Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A. detmoldii to produce A. × pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, it was first discovered in 1979, and it is now known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A. obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm. It is also possible that A. obovatus infrequently hybridises with A. barbiger: in 1921, Carl Hansen Ostenfeld described A. intermedia (now A. intermedius), based on specimens found near Ngilgi Cave at Yallingup with leaf shape intermediate between these two species. The new species was rejected in 1924 by Charles Gardner, and again in the 1970s by Nelson, who argued that leaf shape is inappropriate grounds for erecting a new species in this context, and that, in terms of systematically important characteristics, A. intermedius is indistinguishable from A. barbiger. He therefore synonymized A. intermedius with A. barbiger, but noted the possibility that A. intermedius is of hybrid origin.Nelson (1978): 329, 393.Nelson (1975b) 1: 137. Recently, however, a specimen collected by Greg Keighery was held to represent a new species, provisionally named \\"A. barbiger subsp. intermedius (Ostenf.) Keighery ms\\" (later revised to \\"Adenanthos sp. Whicher Range (G.J. Keighery 9736)\\"), suggesting that Keighery, at least, does not consider A. intermedius to be of hybrid origin. =Common names= Common names for this species include basket flower, glandflower, jugflower and stick-in-the-jug. In the King George Sound vicinity the Aboriginal name Cheeuk is sometimes used. Distribution and habitat Distribution of A. obovatus, shown on a map of Western Australia's alt=a map of Western Australia with the floristic regions delineated, and an area in the bottom right marked in red Abundant and widespread, A. obovatus occurs on a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached siliceous sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A. detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.Nelson (1975b) 1: 253, 257. Consistent with these edaphic preferences, A. obovatus is widespread and common in the scrub and heath commonly found on the sandplains of Southwest Australia, and is also common in the sedgelands that develop in moister areas of the region. It is uncommon in forest or woodland areas, because these are usually associated with lateritic soils; but it may be found in stands of jarrah or marri forest where these grow in laterite-free sand. The climate in its range is mediterranean, with annual rainfall from . The species occurs in coastal regions of Southwest Australia, from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east along the south coast to Green Range, east of Albany. It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a possible disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain and substantial disjunction.Nelson (1978): 330. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of A. obovatus would have been much more extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.Nelson (1975b) 1: 313–314. Ecology The western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus) is the most frequent visitor to the flowers. A territorial species, the territories are smaller when they contain more Adenanthos obovatus bushes. Their long curved bills fit the tube-like flowers exactly, so that the pollen-presenter brushes against the spinebill's head while it is probing for nectar. The birds then carry pollen from plant to plant, fertilising other plants. A field study marking the pollen with fluorescent dye found that pollen could be deposited on flowers of plants up to away from the original flower visited. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) have also been recorded with pollen from A. obovatus. The silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) drinks nectar from the flowers, but punctures the tube with its short bill. Larger honeyeaters in one field study tended to avoid A. obovatus, possibly seeking sources of more abundant nectar elsewhere. These species are too heavy for the fine branches and their bills are too large for the tubes. Adenanthos obovatus has been recorded as a source of nectar for the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) in winter and spring (early June to September), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by A. meisneri in late spring and summer (late October to February). Adenanthos obovatus is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi. Specimens in coastal dune vegetation were reported killed by the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina, with mycelial sheaths of the fungus beneath the bark of the root collar. Cultivation Described by Ken Newbey as \\"an outstanding ornamental species with average foliage and very attractive in flower\\", A. obovatus was first grown in Great Britain in 1824, and is the most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia. It flowers for most of the year, is an excellent attractor of honeyeaters, and grows in a range of climates. Propagation is by cuttings of the current season's growth, from which it strikes readily, and subsequently makes fairly quick growth. Despite its natural occurrence in damp locations, in cultivation it grows best in a light, well-drained soil. It prefers a sunny aspect. Regular hard pruning is recommended to maintain an attractive form. Wildflowers of this species are harvested by licensed pickers in the cut flower industry, for sale in both local and export markets. The long, curved stems with flowers in the leaf axils have been described as \\"excellent for picking\\".

The ancient monastery is located in a valley and offers a beautiful view of the surrounding mountains. The monks could meditate in all stillness at this place but were near enough to the city of Sirsukh to go for begging as it is only around 1.5 km away. The city was built in the 2nd century CE and renovated in the 5th century. Thus it belongs to the Kushan age. The ruins consist of three distinct parts, which include the main stupa, a votive stupa and the monastery and have been included in the world heritage list of the UNESCO since 1980 under Taxila. Excavation The ruins of Mohra Muradu were excavated under the supervision of Sir John Marshall by Abdul Qadir in 1914-1915. They consist of a buddhistic monastery and two stupas. The main stupa is built on a foundation more than 4.75 meters high. The smaller, votive, stupa lies behind the bigger one. The monastery The monastery. The monastery consists of 27 rooms for the students and the teachers built around a courtyard with a pool. The large, square shaped pool contained water for ritual washings and was about half a metre deep. Stairs to the pool were present on all sides. The monastery also contained a kitchen and a well for water that still functions today. The rain water was collected into the pool from the roof of the monastery over wooden extensions. Statues of Buddha are found abundantly in the courtyard and the rooms for the students. An assembly hall is also present in one corner of the monastery. The monastery was a double story building. Stairs to the upper story went through one of the rooms. There was additional connection through wooden constructions from the courtyard. The strength of the walls has, however, led to the idea that there might have existed even a third story. The monumental votive stupa The monumental votive stupa in the monastery. The monument is found in one of the rooms of the monastery. It was probably dedicated to the memory of one of the teachers who used to live in the room where it is located. The umbrellas were once colored. The monument is about 4 meters high. Gallery Image:MohraMuraduPlan.JPGPlan of the ruins of Mohra Muradu at Taxila, Pakistan.

It is a study of the processes of discovery, invention, imagination and creativity in humour, science, and the arts. It lays out Koestler's attempt to develop an elaborate general theory of human creativity. From describing and comparing many different examples of invention and discovery, Koestler concludes that they all share a common pattern which he terms \\"bisociation\\" – a blending of elements drawn from two previously unrelated matrices of thought into a new matrix of meaning by way of a process involving comparison, abstraction and categorisation, analogies and metaphors. He regards many different mental phenomena based on comparison (such as analogies, metaphors, parables, allegories, jokes, identification, role-playing, acting, personification, anthropomorphism etc.), as special cases of \\"bisociation\\". Book One: The Art of Discovery and the Discoveries of Art The Act of Creation is divided into two books. In the first book, Koestler proposes a global theory of creative activity encompassing humour, scientific inquiry, and art. Koestler's fundamental idea is that any creative act is a bisociation (not mere association) of two (or more) apparently incompatible frames of thought.Krikmann, Arvo (2006) Contemporary linguistic theories of humour, Folklore 33, 27–57: 29. Employing a spatial metaphor, Koestler calls such frames of thought matrices: \\"any ability, habit, or skill, any pattern of ordered behaviour governed by a 'code' of fixed rules.\\"Koestler, Arthur. 1964. The Act of Creation, p38. Penguin Books, New York. Koestler argues that the diverse forms of human creativity all correspond to variations of his model of bisociation. In jokes and humour, the audience is led to expect a certain outcome compatible with a particular matrix (e.g. the narrative storyline); a punch line, however, replaces the original matrix with an alternative to comic effect. The structure of a joke, then, is essentially that of bait-and-switch. In scientific inquiry, the two matrices are fused into a new larger synthesis.Figure 2 in Terrence Deacon: The Aesthetic Faculty. In: Mark Turner (Ed.): The Artful Mind: Cognitive Science and the Riddle of Human Creativity. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006 The recognition that two previously disconnected matrices are compatible generates the experience of eureka. Finally, in the arts and in ritual, the two matrices are held in juxtaposition to one another. Observing art is a process of experiencing this juxtaposition, with both matrices sustained. According to Koestler, many bisociative creative breakthroughs occur after a period of intense conscious effort directed at the creative goal or problem, in a period of relaxation when rational thought is abandoned, like during dreams and trances.The New York Times: The Genesis of Genius; The Act of Creation. 18 October 1964 Koestler affirms that all creatures have the capacity for creative activity, frequently suppressed by the automatic routines of thought and behaviour that dominate their lives. Book Two: Habit and Originality The second book of The Act of Creation aims to develop a biological and psychological foundation for the theory of creation proposed in book one. Koestler found the psychology of his day (behaviorism, cognitivism) portraying man merely as an automaton, disregarded the creative abilities of the mind. Koestler draws on theories of play, imprinting, motivation, perception, Gestalt psychology, and others to lay a theoretical foundation for his theory of creativity.

Operation The central instruments in a photo player were a piano and percussion; some machines also added pipe organs and methods for manually creating sound effects. Like a player piano, the photo player played music automatically by reading piano rolls (rolls of paper with perforations), but the photo player could hold two rolls: one that would play while the other was prepared. Common sound effects included gunshots, bells and drums, which were generated by pulling chains called \\"cow-tails\\". Some photo players feature electric sound effects, such as sirens, automobile horns, and other oddities. A photo player operator had to load the paper rolls, start the machine and add the manual sound effects and percussion using the cow-tails. History Approximately 8,000 to 10,000 photoplayers were produced during the boom era of silent films, between 1910 and 1928. Around a dozen manufacturers produced the instruments, including the American Photo Player Company, which made the Fotoplayer; the Operators Piano Company of Chicago, which made the Reproduco; The Bartola Musical Instrument Company of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, maker of the Bartola; Seeburg; and Wurlitzer. The popularity of the photoplayer sharply declined in the mid-1920s as silent films were replaced by sound films, and few machines still exist today.

The expressway starts from the Western Peripheral Expressway at Kundli, Sonipat, passing through Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Noida districts in UP and Faridabad district in Haryana before rejoining the Western Peripheral Expressway near Dholagarh, Palwal. Eastern Peripheral Expressway along with Western Peripheral Expressway completes the largest Ring Road around Delhi. Eastern Peripheral Expressway was declared as National Expressway 2 in 2006.Notification dated March 30, 2006 The expressway consists of two sections, the 86 km-long Palwal-Ghaziabad section, also known as Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad Expressway and the 49 km-long Ghaziabad-Sonipat section. It has been constructed at a cost of to relieve traffic congestion in the Faridabad - Ghaziabad stretch and also to prevent pollution causing commercial vehicles from entering Delhi.Government of India approved funding for the expressway in August 2015 on build-operate-transfer mode under NHDP Phase VI. Eastern Peripheral Expressway is expected to divert more than 50,000 trucks away from Delhi and reduce air pollution in Delhi by 27%. It was inaugurated on 27 May 2018 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Baghpat. Eastern Peripheral Expressway will be connected with Yamuna Expressway via an interchange which is being built near Jaganpura –Afzalpur village at Yamuna Expressway in Gautam Budh Nagar district. Salient Features This expressway boasts of many features that are being implemented for the first time in India. * The 135-km Expressway has a closed tolling system in which toll will be collected only on the distance traveled and not on the entire length. * There is a provision for electronic collection of toll to ensure disruption-free movement of traffic. * Weigh-in motion sensors on all entry points which ensure that over-loaded vehicles are not allowed to enter the Expressway. The sensors are installed at all entry points with two gates—one leading to the Expressway and the other redirecting the vehicle if it is over-loaded. * Provision for parking of overloaded trucks where they can unload some of the cargo to satisfy the weight criteria and then move to the Expressway. * To check speeding, cameras have been put up every two kilometers. Over-speeding vehicles will be issued the challan at the toll plaza and the challan amount would be added to the total toll amount. * Facility for rainwater collection at every 500 meters has been made. * 2.5 lakh trees have been planted along the highway along which will be watered through drip irrigation system * A cycle track of 2.5 metre has been developed on both sides of the expressway * Solar panels have been installed at various locations which will provide power to illuminate the expressway. 8 solar power plants with a total capacity of 4000-kilo watt (4 MW) has been made by the side of the expressway to generate electricity. * 33% of the earth work on the highway was done using fly ash from coal power plants thereby compounding its contribution to reducing pollution. * The expressway has 406 structures of which 4 are major bridges, 46 minor bridges, 3 flyovers, 7 inter-changes, 221 underpasses and 8 road over bridges. Project Status Updates PM Narendra Modi inspecting the model during the inauguration of the Expressway. * 2015 Nov: Foundation stone of 135-km long expressway laid by PM of India Narendra Modi. * 2016 Feb: Work started on expressway. * 2017 April: An estimated 60% of the work has been completed. It is expected to be completed by August 2017. * 2017 July 26: An estimated 70% of the work has been completed. It is expected to be completed by March 2018, three months ahead of the deadline of July 2018 set by the Supreme Court of India. * 2017 Oct: Few farmers agitating against land acquisition in Greater Noida area and who forced stop the road construction work were arrested in Sep 2017 and police force are deployed to give cover to road workers so that work can proceed. * Dec 2017: 85% work completed.

He has queried many companies in the area of good corporate governance, ethics, executive compensation, environmental practices and Black Economic Empowerment. He has also criticized South African corporate governance guidelines as too lenient. Theo Botha first decided to pursue shareholder activism after an investment in a small life insurance company (The Sage Group). The company was making huge losses in the United States that it refused to disclose to the South African shareholders.

Ševčík participated in the Czechoslovak Legion during World War I. After the war he studied law and from 1926 to 1934 represented the Slovak People's Party (incl. as secretary of the faction). After that, he worked in the agrarian sector. From 1939 to 1942 he was the head of the YMCA administration in Bratislava. Ševčík was an opponent of fascism and therefore joined the Slovak résistance movement. The Slovak résistance opposed the nominally independent Slovak republic that was established in 1939 by monseigneur Jozef Tiso but to a large extent controlled by Germans. In 1944 the Slovak National Uprising took place, in which Ševčík participated. The résistance forces met an early success in fighting with Slovak fascists and German troops, but later had to retreat. After World War II Ševčík joined the Democratic Party (DS). The DS won the 1946 election in the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia and thereafter had to share power with the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS). Ševčík became a deputy once more. The communists carried out a 'great purge' of DS members in 1946-1948. After the communist coup d'état in February 1948, the DS was banned and replaced by the Party of Slovak Revival (SSO), a pro-communist satellite party. Ševčík became the chairman of the SSO and at the same time vice-premier in Antonín Zápotocký's cabinet. In 1952 Ján Ševčík was arrested and accused of opposition to the socialist development of Czechoslovakia. He was sentenced to imprisonment. In 1960 he was released. On 6 March 1965 Ševčík died.

Plot  Ex special forces mercenary and now hardened criminal Vic, (Michael Lazar) lives in a world of cons, double crosses, crooked cops, mob bosses and drug dealing crime lords. Playing by his own rules, Vic and his partner Frank (Paul Sloan) work both sides of the street, caring only about where they can score and take down the most cash. After a dangerous shootout during a drug deal gone bad, Vic finds himself working for ruthless crime boss Paul Santo (Nick Vallelonga). Santo's being indicted for murder, and he enlists Vic and Frank to kill the three witnesses that will testify against him. Watching Vic's every move is Santo's strongest soldier, Ray, (Michael Madsen) a stone cold killer, who would like nothing better than to whack Vic and Frank the moment his boss gives him the okay. As the Asian proverb says, \\"In the shadow of every crime is a woman\\" and that holds true for Vic as his grifter girlfriend Thea (Lisa Arturo) and Frank's ex, the exotic, sultry, Layla (Michelle Lombardo) have their own agendas as they both try in their own way to use and manipulate their men. As Vic tries to juggle all this as well as kill the witnesses to pay off his debt to Santo, and at the same time avoid Ray's wrath, he is pursued by crooked vice cop Ford (Neal McDonough) who's relentless as he turns up the heat on Vic and Frank. On top of all this, it doesn't help that Asian crime lord, Cho (Garret Sato) and his henchman Butch (James Russo) are applying their own brand of pressure on Vic and Frank. They want to take out Santo and Ray, using Vic and Frank as pawns in their game of revenge and murder.

The show returned to Ten in 2015, after originally airing from 1997 to 2008 on the same network, as well as in 2011 on sister channel One. The show currently airs on Sunday afternoons, having held a variety of timeslots over the show's history. The show's season runs from approximately March to November each year, in line with major events in the Australian calendar such as the Clipsal 500 and Bathurst 1000, as well as the Formula One and MotoGP seasons. The program covers all major forms of motorsport across Australia and the world, with a particular focus on Formula One, MotoGP, NASCAR, Supercars Championship as well as the Australian Rally Championship and World Rally Championship. In recent years, the show has branched out to also cover more general motoring content such as car reviews.  1997–2008 version  RPM was launched in 1997 to accompany Network Ten's newly acquired coverage of Supercars, in conjunction with Foxtel. The original version of the show featured journalist Bill Woods and former MotoGP champion Barry Sheene as hosts. The show would normally air on Sunday afternoons, at varying timeslots and for various lengths, often depending on the network's other motorsport coverage. At the end of 2002, Sheene left the program due to serious health issues, and died in early 2003. Following this, Woods hosted alone with the help of various reporters and specialists including Greg Rust, Neil Crompton and Daryl Beattie. For around six months in 2006, model Grace McClure co- hosted alongside Woods. In 2007, Rust took over from Woods as host, after Woods moved to a position hosting Ten Weekend News bulletins. =Format= Generally, each show began with the 'Circuit' segment, which involved Woods presenting the motorsport news of the past week. This segment included race highlights from the previous week, as well as updates of the progress of various Australians abroad at the time. 'Circuit' also covered rumours, such as potential driver moves for the following season in various categories. Following this, there were usually around four segments, depending on the length of the timeslot. In later years, two of these were always taken up by updates from the MotoGP and Formula One series, either previewing or reviewing recent events. This generally involved the host discussing these events with the respective specialist for each form of motorsport. The other segments were usually taken up by either an interview with a driver or motorsport personality, a 'behind the scenes' report, a technical report, or features on other motorsport series, including smaller and/or junior series. Despite Network Ten and Fox Sports losing the broadcast rights to Supercars in 2006, the series was still regularly covered by the show. =Cancellation= In March 2009 it was announced that the show would not be returning. This was despite the simultaneous launch of One, a 24-hour sports channel created by the network, including expanded coverage of motorsport. However, the network decided to focus on individual motorsports and highlights packages on the new channel rather than a panel show.  2011 version  In March 2011, the show returned on One. Greg Rust returned as host, along with Daryl Beattie as the MotoGP specialist. The only change to the line-up was the addition of Craig Baird, who replaced Cameron McConville as the Formula One specialist, after McConville was removed from the network's motorsport coverage during the show's hiatus. =Format= The 2011 version of the show, recorded live, featured a mix of interviews and pre-recorded stories. The 2011 version moved away from the traditional Sunday afternoon timeslot to air on Tuesday or Wednesday nights. The show used Skype for some of its interviews, such as with F1 correspondent James Allen. The show also featured in-studio interviews, particularly with local Supercars drivers or other Network Ten personalities. The show added some new segments, such as 'RPM Retro', usually featuring clips of Bill Woods or Barry Sheene from past episodes of the show, and prominently featured the latest betting odds due to a sponsorship deal with a bookmaker. The show also added some general motoring segments, such as tips for safe driving on public roads. =Cancellation= In early 2012, it was announced the show would not be returning. This followed One's change of strategy in mid-2011, moving away from being a predominantly sports network to focus on general entertainment content.  2015 version  The show returned on 8 March 2015, following Network Ten regaining the rights to televise Supercars, in conjunction with Foxtel. With Rust leaving the network, Matt White took over as host, joined by Aaron Noonan, Alan Jones and Daryl Beattie, who became the only co-host involved in all three versions of the show. Former Formula One and current FIA World Endurance Championship driver Mark Webber appeared on the show as a special guest host in the first episode of both 2015 and 2016. The show is repeated multiple times during the week on One. =Format= The 2015 version follows a similar format to 2011, with a mix of segments that include both motorsport and a wider motoring focus, and a variety of guests including those from outside the motorsport world. In 2015, the 'Battle of Bathurst' was a recurring segment, challenging various guests, usually current Supercars drivers, to set a laptime on the Mount Panorama Circuit on a simulator in the studio. Chaz Mostert, the 2014 Bathurst 1000 champion, finished the year on top of the guest leaderboard. In 2016, the series extended from 60 to 90-minute episodes. The first half-hour of the show is branded as RPM GP.

IMAGINE Photogrammetry is significant because it is a leading commercial photogrammetry application that is used by numerous national mapping agencies, regional mapping authorities, various DOTs,ERDAS (July 30, 2008). \\"Oklahoma DOT Utilizing ERDAS Technology\\" . [Press Release]. Retrieved January 11, 2009. as well as commercial mapping firms. Aside from commercial and government applications, IMAGINE Photogrammetry is widely used in academic research. Research areas include landslide monitoring, cultural heritage studies, and more.  Capabilities  IMAGINE Photogrammetry is generally used for the processing of raw imagery through to the creation of geospatial data products such as digital terrain models, 3D features, and digital orthophotos. There are a number of approaches for photogrammetric applications. Imagery may come from remote sensing satellites, airborne cameras (film or digital), or ground-based cameras. In the context of airborne film cameras, the workflow would involve scanning the imagery (creating a digital version of the film imagery), solving the interior orientation parameters, and triangulating the images. Once the images are triangulated, image pairs may be viewed in stereo and 3D measurements can be made. The system can automatically generate digital terrain models, which can be reviewed and edited in stereo. Once an accurate 3D surface has been derived, triangulated images may be orthorectified. In addition to this workflow, IMAGINE Photogrammetry supports 3D feature extraction, radiometric adjustment, and a number of additional digital image processing capabilities available from ERDAS IMAGINE, which is included with IMAGINE Photogrammetry.  Other workflows  In addition to the workflows above, IMAGINE Photogrammetry also supports the following applications: * Satellite Photogrammetry * Direct Georeferencing: ground control points (GCPs) are not used because the aircraft is equipped with Airborne GPS and IMU systems. This is an emerging workflow that is suitable for remote area mapping. * Close-Range Photogrammetry  History  While the initial release of IMAGINE Photogrammetry (called \\"Leica Photogrammetry Suite 8.7\\") was in late 2003, it was a combination of new technology as well as software previously developed by ERDAS (which was acquired by Leica Geosystems in 2003).

It started broadcasting in the United Kingdom on CBeebies on 6 April 2009. The show is a spin-off of Shaun the Sheep, in turn a spin off of the Wallace and Gromit film, A Close Shave (1995). The first two series ran for 26 episodes. In the United Kingdom, the show's most recent run began in September 2011 on CBeebies. In Australia, season one commenced in May 2009 on ABC1 and season three started in May 2011 on ABC 4 Kids. The show also broadcast reruns on Disney Junior from its launch in 2012, but the show was discontinued in May 2014. In 2018, Aardman joined forces with the British Council to create \\"Learning Time with Timmy\\", a learning experience to encourage children aged 2–6 around the world to learn the English language, along with a YouTube-exclusive series and 3 apps. Premise and format In this series, Timmy and his friends have to learn to share, make friends and accept their mistakes. They are supervised by two teachers, Harriet the Heron and Osbourne the Owl. The show is aimed at pre- school-aged children, which the company described as \\"a natural next step for Aardman\\". The show is made up of ten-minute episodes, which do not feature much dialogue, much like Shaun the Sheep, Wallace and Gromit and A Close Shave. Shaun, his friends, Bitzer and the Farmer did not appear. A filming of one episode was featured on the Discovery Channel's How It's Made. EpisodesCharacters * Timmy is a male black and white lamb who is the titular character and enjoys being in the spotlight. He is three years old in sheep years and later turns four in the episode Timmy's Birthday. In many of the episodes he gets into trouble; however, he learns from his mistakes, and often tries to help the other characters out when he can. Timmy's noise is baaa. He is best friends with Yabba, and is very close to Finlay. He also appears in Shaun the Sheep. * Harriet is a female pink heron who speaks through caws and clicks. She is one of the two teachers. Harriet's noise is squawk. * Osbourne is a male purple owl who is the other teacher of the class. Osbourne's noise is hoot-hoot. * Yabba is a female yellow duckling who is very similar to Timmy in personality and is best friends with her. Yabba's noise is quack. * Paxton is a male pink piglet who is characterised by his appetite for apples and his weight. He wears a blue sweater and is never seen without it. Paxton's noise is oink. * Mittens is a female orange kitten who is like other kittens: she hates getting her fur dirty or wet and is rather sensitive. Mittens's noise is mee-ew-ew. In some episodes, she seems to have feelings for Timmy. She always loves playing with picnics. * Ruffy is a male brown puppy who is energetic but can be, sometimes, mentally slow, and he is good friend, too. Ruffy's noise is rowf. * Apricot is a female brown hedgehog who is very quiet and skittish. When startled or frightened by someone or something she rolls up into a ball. Apricot's noise is hicoooo, though she rarely speaks. * Stripey is a male black and white badger cub who is a bit sleepy and slow as badgers are nocturnal. Stripey's noise is eh-eh. * Kid is a male blue goat who has a large appetite like Paxton, and chews anything in sight. If the thing he is chewing is taken from him he does not mind; he just moves on to something else. Kid's noise is meh. * Otus is a male purple owlet who enjoys helping and looks up to Osbourne. He can be typically found reading and is very sensitive, sometimes copying Osbourne. Otus is commonly confused to be female due to his feminine voice tone and pink and purple feathers. Otus's noise is too-hoo. * Finlay is a male red fox kit who is excitable and full of energy. Finlay's noise is yip-yap. * Bumpy is a male green caterpillar who is not part of the class but has many background appearances in the show. Bumpy makes a soft purring noise. * Timmy's Mum is a female black and white sheep who is also not part of the class, but does appear in the opening sequence, \\"Timmy's Christmas Surprise\\" and the end credits. She is the only known parent in the show and also appears in Shaun The Sheep.

A member of the family, Matthias Corvinus, was King of Hungary from 1458 until 1490, King of Bohemia (ruling in Moravia, Lower Lusatia, Upper Lusatia, and Silesia) from 1469 until 1490, and Duke of Austria from 1487 until 1490. His illegitimate son, John Corvinus, ruled the Duchy of Troppau from 1485 until 1501, and five further Silesian duchies, including Bytom, Głubczyce, Loslau, Racibórz, and Tost, from 1485 until 1490. The Hunyadi coat-of-arms depicted a raven with a golden ring in its beak. The founder of the family, Voyk, received the eponymous Hunyad Castle (in present- day Hunedoara, Romania) from Sigismund, King of Hungary, in 1409. His ethnicity is the subject of scholarly debate. Some modern historians describe him as a Vlach, or Romanian, knez or boyar, from either Wallachia or Transylvania. Others describe him as a Cuman or Slav nobleman. According to the 15th-century historian, Johannes de Thurocz, Voyk moved from Wallachia to Transylvania. Voyk's oldest son, John Hunyadi, was often mentioned as a \\"Vlach\\" by his contemporaries. John Hunyadi, a talented military commander, became the first member of the family to acquire the status of \\"true baron of the realm\\". He was appointed Ban of Severin in 1439, and Voivode of Transylvania in 1441. He was also granted the title Perpetual Count of Beszterce in 1452, thus receiving the first hereditary title created in the Kingdom of Hungary. At his death, John Hunyadi held many lands throughout the Kingdom. John Hunyadi's fame and fortune led the election of his son, Matthias Corvinus, as King of Hungary in 1458. Matthias ruled Moravia, Silesia, Austria, and other neighbouring regions. He attempted to secure hereditary line of succession for his son, John Corvinus. This did not happen, however, and John was only able to retain the Duchy of Glogau, along with some other family domains in Hungary, after Matthias died in 1490. John's only son, Christopher Corvinus, was the last male member of the family. He died at the age of six in 1505. His sister Elisabeth died during childhood.  Origins  The family was given its land by Sigismund, King of Hungary, on 18 October 1409. On that day, Sigismund granted Hunyad Castle and its demesne to Voyk and four of his kinsmen. In addition to Voyk, the grant lists his two brothers, Magos and Radol, their cousin or uncle also named Radol, and Voyk's son, John, the future Regent of Hungary. The granted said that Voyk's father was named \\"Serbe\\", but did not say anything further about the origins of the family. Sigismund of Hungary's grant of Hunyad Castle to Voyk and his relatives Voyk's son, John Hunyadi, bore the nickname \\"Olah\\", meaning \\"Vlach\\", in his youth, which implied that he was of Romanian stock. The court historian of Voyk's grandson King Matthias Corvinus, Antonio Bonfini, explicitly stated that John had been \\"born to a Vlach father\\". Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III likewise knew that King Matthias had been \\"born to a Vlach father\\", and a Venetian man, Sebastiano Baduario, referred to the Romanians as King Matthias's people. Historians of the 15th and 16th centuries, with perspectives that were either against or in favour of the family, wrote differing reports of the family's status before King Sigismund's grant. Jan Długosz described John Hunyadi as \\"a man of unknown origin\\",The Annals of Jan Długosz (A.D. 1440), p. 484. and he is likewise mentioned as \\"a Vlach by birth, not highly born\\"Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini: Europe (ch. 1.7.), p. 59. by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini. On the other hand, Johannes de Thurocz said that John Hunyadi \\"was descended from a noble and renowned race of Wallachia\\".Thuróczy János: Magyar krónika (ch. 30), p. 42. Gothic and Renaissance Hunyad Castle (in present-day Hunedoara, Romania), built on the demesne that the family was named after Johannes de Thurocz also wrote that King Sigismund, fascinated by Voyk's fame, \\"took him away from Wallachia to his own realm and settled him there\\", suggesting that Voyk moved from his Wallachian homeland to the Kingdom of Hungary. The late 15th-century historian Philippe de Commines referred to Voyk's son John as the \\"White Knight of Wallachia\\". In accordance with these sources, Pál Engel, András Kubinyi, and other contemporary historians have written that the Hunyadi family descended from Wallachian boyars (noblemen). According to another view on the family's origins, which is championed by historians Camil Mureşanu and Ion-Aurel Pop, Voyk did not migrate from Wallachia, but was born in a family of Romanian noble knezes from the region of Hátszeg, or Hunyad. They say that Voyk's grandfather could have been a man named \\"Costea\\", mentioned in a royal charter from 1360, and who fathered a son named Serbe (the name of Voyk's father). According to the charter, Costea and Serbe together established two villages in the region of Hátszeg. Historian Dezső Dümmerth offers a third view of the Hunyadis' ancestry. He said that Voyk was of Romanianized Cuman stock, one of the Wallachian boyars. He attributes Cuman and Tatar ancestry to the Wallachian boyars. Another historian, Miklós Molnár, accepts the Wallachian origin of the family, but also represents a fourth perspective on the origins of the family. He said that they may well have been of Slavic descent. Neither Paul Lendvai nor András Boros-Kazai excluded the possibility of the Hunyadis being of Slavic origin. John Hunyadi's rapid advance, which astonished his contemporaries, and gave rise to legends about his origins. According to one of these stories, recorded in detail by the 16th-century historian Gáspár Heltai, John Hunyadi was the illegitimate son of King Sigismund with a woman named Elizabeth, who was the daughter of a \\"rich boyar\\" from Morzsina in Hunyad County. Antonio Bonfini, on the other hand, wrote that John Hunyadi's mother was an unnamed Greek woman who was related to the Byzantine Emperors. Further legends emerged about the purported Romanian origin of the family. Antonio Bonfini wrote that John Hunyadi \\"traced his kin to the Roman family of the Corvini\\". This story is connected to the Hunyadis' coat-of-arms, which depicts a raven, corvus in Latin, with a golden ring in its beak. Coins minted for Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia in 1365 depict a raven-like bird. Based on this similarity, Zsuzsa Teke and some other historians did not exclude the possibility that the Hunyadis were related to the Basarabs, the ruling dynasty of Wallachia. Another historian, Péter E. Kovács, wrote that that theory needed further verification. Notable membersVoyk Hunyadi= Voyk was born in Wallachia, according to the nearly contemporaneous historians Johannes de Thurocz and Gáspár Heltai. Voyk had been serving as a \\"court knight\\" in the royal court when he received the demesne of Hunyad from King Sigismund, suggesting that he was descended from a prominent Wallachian family. Modern historian Kubinyi wrote that Voyk most probably joined Sigismund in 1395. In this year, Sigismund invaded Wallachia and restored his vassal, Mircea the Old, to the princely throne. He was last mentioned in a royal charter in 1414. Voyk died before 12 February 1419. On this day, a charter confirming the grant of 1409 was issued for Voyk's brother, Radol, and for Voyk's three sons: John the Elder, John the Younger, and Voyk. =John Hunyadi, Sr.= The cover of John Hunyadi's tomb in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Gyulafehérvár (present- day Alba Iulia, Romania) Voyk's oldest son John Hunyadi was born between about 1405 and 1407. In his youth, he served in the court of George Csáky, Filippo Scolari, and King Sigismund's other warlike barons. He married Elizabeth Szilágyi around 1429. Her father owned properties in Bodrog County. John Hunyadi developed his military skills during his journeys in Italy and Bohemia in Sigismund's entourage in the early 1430s. He and his younger brother (who was his namesake) were jointly appointed Ban of Szörény (present-day Drobeta- Turnu Severin, Romania) in 1439 by Sigismund's successor, King Albert. With this appointment, they acquired the status of \\"true barons\\". The senior John Hunyadi became Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys in 1441, with responsibility for the defense of the southern borders of Hungary against Ottoman raids. He defeated the Ottomans in several battles during his \\"long campaign\\" in the Balkan Peninsula in 1443. The Estates of the realm elected him governor for the period of King Ladislaus V of Hungary's minority in 1446. King Ladislaus bestowed the title of Perpetual Count of Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) upon John Hunyadi after he resigned the governorship in 1452. This was the first example of a grant of a hereditary title in the Kingdom of Hungary. John Hunyadi had by that time become the richest landowner in the Kingdom of Hungary, holding about 25 fortresses, 30 towns, and more than 1,000 villages. He died on 11 August 1456, shortly after his greatest victory over the Ottomans at the Siege of Belgrade. =John Hunyadi, Jr.= John the Younger was the younger of Voyk's two sons that shared the name John, and was first mentioned in a charter issued to four members of his family on 12 February 1419. King Albert of Hungary appointed him Ban of Szörény together with his brother, John the Elder, in 1439. He died fighting against the Ottomans in 1441. His brother wrote of him as \\"the valiant of the valiant\\", showing that John the Younger was regarded a brave soldier. =Ladislaus Hunyadi= Ladislaus Hunyadi was the older of the two sons of John Hunyadi the elder by Elizabeth Szilágyi. He was born around 1432. At the age of 20, he was appointed ispán, or count, of Pozsony County, which made him a \\"true baron\\". He became Ban of Croatia in 1453 and master of the horse in 1456. With his father's death, Ladislaus inherited an enormous domain in 1456. The ambitious Ladislaus had his father's main opponent, Ulrich II, Count of Celje, captured and murdered on 9 November. The King, who promised amnesty to Ladislaus under duress, had him arrested in next year. Ladislaus was sentenced to death for high treason. He was executed on 16 March 1457. =Matthias Corvinus= A contemporaneous sculpture of Matthias Corvinus Matthias, the younger son of John Hunyadi the elder and Elizabeth Szilágyi, was born on 23 February 1443. He was arrested upon the orders of King Ladislaus V of Hungary on 14 March 1457, together with his elder brother Ladislaus. Matthias's brother was executed two days after having been arrested. Fearing a revolt, the King fled to Prague and took Matthias with him. The childless Ladislaus V died on 23 November 1457. A Diet was convened to elect the new monarch. Matthias' maternal uncle, Michael Szilágyi, arrived with more than 10,000 armed noblemen under his command, and the Diet proclaimed Matthias king on 24 January 1458. Matthias returned from Prague, but was only crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary on 29 March 1464, because he had spent the previous years with fighting against his opponents. Urged by Pope Paul II, Matthias led a crusade against the Czech Hussites and occupied great parts of Moravia and Silesia in 1468. The Catholic Estates of Moravia proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469. Matthias' reign was also recognized in Lusatia and Silesia, but Bohemia proper remained under the rule of his opponents, Kings George of Poděbrady (till 1471) and Vladislaus II Jagiellon. Through a series of wars, Matthias occupied Lower Austria and Styria between 1480 and 1487. He officially adopted the title of Duke of Austria in 1487. Matthias married his first wife, Catherine of Poděbrady, in 1461. She died in childbirth in 1464. His second wife, Beatrice of Naples, whom he married in 1476, was infertile. In the last decade of his life, Matthias ensured the succession of his illegitimate son, John Corvinus, to the throne of Hungary. Matthias died on 6 April 1490. =John Corvinus= John Corvinus was the illegitimate son of King Matthias and his mistress, Barbara Edelpöck. John Corvinus was born on 2 April 1473. Matthias recognized in public that John is his son and granted him the title of Duke of Liptó (present-day Liptov, Slovakia) in 1481. John Corvinus received a number of land grants from his father in the subsequent years. King Matthias granted him the Duchy of Troppau and five further Silesian duchiesBeuthen, Leobschütz, Loslau, Ratibor, and Tostin 1485. King Matthias' all attempts to secure his son's succession to the throne proved to be useless shortly after his death. The prelates and the barons elected Vladislaus II Jagiellon king on 15 July 1490. He retained his domains and the Duchy of Troppau. The new monarch bestowed the title of Duke of Slavonia upon him, but he renounced of it in 1495. He also renounced of the Duchy of Troppau in 1501. John Corvinus married Beatrice de Frangepan in 1496. She gave birth to two children, Elizabeth and Christopher. John Corvinus died on 12 October 1504. His son died at the age of six, his daughter at the age of twelve.

Common names include coolamon, watermelon tree, durobby and robby; it is also called \\"rose apple\\" but this can refer to many species of Syzygium.  Description  Syzgyium moorei is a beautiful canopy tree of sub tropical rainforest, reaching 40 metres in height, and 60 centimetres wide. The bark is a grey/fawn/reddish colour, not buttressed at the base, some larger specimens are flanged at the base. The leaves are unusual for a New South Wales myrtle, being large, thick and heavy. 8 to 20 cm long with a short blunt point at the tip. Syzygium moorei - fruit showing cauliflory = Flowers and fruit = An unusual factor of this tree is cauliflory. Where flower and fruit form on the main stems or woody trunks rather than from new growth and shoots. This is mostly a tropical feature, and unusual in rainforest trees so far south in New South Wales. In November to February, pink or orange flowers form in dense panicles on mature branches. The berry is white or pale green up to 6 cm in diameter, maturing around Easter time. The fruit is not pleasant to eat raw, but is an excellent ingredient in mixed preserves. The large seed germinates well after many months. Most seedlings appear in November and December.  Location  A few mature specimens can still be seen in the farmland areas in their former range near streams at low altitude. This tree is in many botanic gardens in Australia. The pink flowers and beautiful form make it a popular park and garden tree. There is a superb specimen at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. It's also seen as a street tree in Murwillumbah, Brisbane and other nearby localities.

Its name is derived from Greek: Haima, \\"blood\\", and Proteus, a sea god who had the power of assuming different shapes. The name Haemoproteus was first used in the description of Haemoproteus columbae in the blood of the pigeon Columba livia by Kruse in 1890. This was also the first description of this genus. Two other genera — Halteridium and Simondia — are now considered to be synonyms of Haemoproteus. The protozoa are intracellular parasites that infect the erythrocytes. They are transmitted by blood sucking insects including mosquitoes, biting midges (Culicoides), louse flies (Hippoboscidae) and tabanid flies (Tabanidae). Infection with this genus is sometimes known as pseudomalaria because of the parasites' similarities with Plasmodium species. Within the genus there are at least 173 species, 5 varieties and 1 subspecies. Of these over 140 occur in birds, 16 in reptiles and 3 in amphibia: 14 orders and 50 families of birds are represented. These include gamebirds (Galliformes), waterfowl (Anseriformes), raptors (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes), pigeons and doves (Columbiformes), and perching birds or songbirds (Passeriformes). Taxonomy and systematics Evolution = The earliest known fossil is of a Haemoproteus like organism (Paleohaemoproteus burmacis) was found in the abdominal cavity of a female biting midge trapped 100 million years ago in amber found in Myanmar. =Taxonomic history= The first description of this genus was in 1890 by Kruse who described Haemoproteus columbae in the blood of the pigeon Columba livia. McCallum in 1897 showed that the process of exflagellation was part of sexual reproduction in these parasites and thought it probable that the same process occurred in Plasmodium. The first record of a haemoproteid parasite in a reptile was by Simond in 1901 who gave it the name Haemamoeba metchnikovi. The Sergent brothers in 1906 showed that the ectoparasitic fly Pseudolynchia canariensis was the vector of Haemoproteus columbae. Aragao in 1908 demonstrated the schizogonic stages of Haemoproteus columbae in the endothelial cells of the lungs of nestling pigeons infected by the bite of infected Pseudolynchia. It was generally believed that transmission of the parasites was by regurgitation during a blood meal until Adie showed that the parasites develop in the salivary glands in a fashion analogous to that of Plasmodium in mosquitoes. The genus Halterium was created by the French parasitologist Alphonse Labbe for a species he observed with gametocytes in erythrocytes, with pigment granules, and halter-shaped when fully formed. This genus was soon subsumed into the genus Haemoproteus. The genus Haemocystidium was created to give a name to the haemoproteid of a gecko belonging to the genus Hemidactylus in Sri Lanka by Castellani and Willey in 1904. A second species in this genus was described in 1909 by Johnston and Cleland who found pigmented gametocytes in the blood of the Australian tortoise Chelodina longicollis. These species were transferred to Haemoproteus in 1926 by Wenyon. The genus was resurrected by Garnham in 1966 when he created a new generic name — Simondia — for the haemoproteids of chelonians. He followed the opinions of Wenyon, Hewitt and DeGiusti and suggested that all these parasites belonged to the one species — Simondia metchnikovi. He retained the name Haemocystidium for the haemoproteids of lizards. A different genus of vectors was identified in 1957 by Fallis and Wood when they identified Haemoproreus nettionis in Culicoides downesi Wirth and Hubert in Ontario, Canada. Levine and Campbell in 1971 moved all the species in Simondia and Haemocystidium into Haemoproteus an opinion that was followed by subsequent authors. The genus Haemocystidium was resurrected again by Telford in 1996 when he described three new species of protozoa in geckos from Pakistan. This genus like those of many protozoa may be further modified once additional DNA sequences are available. For instance, many DNA sequences have been identified for Haemoproteus in birds around the world in recent years, leading to new knowledge about the previously unknown diversity of this parasite in different regions =Subgenera= The species infecting avian hosts have been divided into two subgenera — Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus — a division proposed in 1965 by Bennett et al. These may be distinguished as follows: Haemoproteus: Vectors are hippoboscid flies (Hippoboscidae). Exflagellation does not occur below 20 degrees Celsius. Mature oocysts have diameters greater than 20 micrometres. The average length of the sporozoites is less than 10 micrometres. One end of the sporozoite is more pointed than the other. Although the majority are parasites of the Columbiformes, some species from this subgenus have also been reported in the Charadriiformes, Pelecaniformes and Suliformes. Parahaemoproteus: Parasites of birds other than the Columbiformes. Vectors are biting midges (Ceratopogonidae). Exflagellation occurs below 20 degrees Celsius. Mature oocysts have diameters less than 20 micrometres. The average length of the sporozoites is greater than 10 micrometres. Both ends of the sporozoite are equally pointed. While it was thought that Haemoproteus was limited to doves and related species, species in this genus have been isolated from frigatebirds. =Species list= *Haemoproteus aegnithidae *Haemoproteus aegyptius *Haemoproteus africanus *Haemoproteus alaudae *Haemoproteus anatolicum *Haemoproteus anthi *Haemoproteus antigonis *Haemoproteus asturisdussumieri *Haemoproteus attenatus *Haemoproteus balearicae *Haemoproteus balli *Haemoproteus balmorali *Haemoproteus bambusicolae *Haemoproteus bennetti *Haemoproteus brachiatus *Haemoproteus beckeri *Haemoproteus belopolskyi *Haemoproteus bennetti *Haemoproteus borgesi *Haemoproteus brodkorbi *Haemoproteus bubalornis *Haemoproteus bucerotis *Haemoproteus canachites *Haemoproteus caprimulgi *Haemoproteus catharti *Haemoproteus catenatus *Haemoproteus cellii *Haemoproteus centropi *Haemoproteus chelodina *Haemoproteus coatneyi *Haemoproteus columbae *Haemoproteus concavocentralis *Haemoproteus cornuata *Haemoproteus crumenius *Haemoproteus cyanomitrae *Haemoproteus danilewskyi *Haemoproteus desseri *Haemoproteus dicaeus *Haemoproteus dicruri *Haemoproteus dolniki *Haemoproteus edomensis *Haemoproteus elani *Haemoproteus enucleator *Haemoproteus forresteri *Haemoproteus fringillae *Haemoproteus fusca *Haemoproteus gabaldoni *Haemoproteus garnhami *Haemoproteus geochelonis *Haemoproteus greineri *Haemoproteus goodmani *Haemoproteus halcyonis *Haemoproteus handai *Haemoproteus hirundinis *Haemoproteus himalayanus *Haemoproteus homobelopolskyi *Haemoproteus homopalloris *Haemoproteus homovelans *Haemoproteus hudaidensis *Haemoproteus iwa *Haemoproteus janovyi *Haemoproteus jenniae *Haemoproteus khani *Haemoproteus kopki *Haemoproteus krylovi *Haemoproteus lanii *Haemoproteus lari *Haemoproteus lophortyx *Haemoproteus kopki *Haemoproteus maccallumi *Haemoproteus mackerrasi *Haemoproteus macrovacuolatus *Haemoproteus madagascariensis *Haemoproteus majoris *Haemoproteus mansoni *Haemoproteus mathislegeri *Haemoproteus melopeliae *Haemoproteus meleagridis *Haemoproteus meropis *Haemoproteus mesnili *Haemoproteus metchnikovi *Haemoproteus micronuclearis *Haemoproteus minutus *Haemoproteus motacillae *Haemoproteus multipigmentatus *Haemoproteus multivolutinus *Haemoproteus nebraskensis *Haemoproteus nettionis *Haemoproteus nisi *Haemoproteus noctuae *Haemoproteus nucleofascialis *Haemoproteus nucleophilus *Haemoproteus oedurae *Haemoproteus orioli *Haemoproteus oryzivora *Haemoproteus ovalis *Haemoproteus pallidus *Haemoproteus pallidulus *Haemoproteus palumbis *Haemoproteus pasteris *Haemoproteus pastoris *Haemoproteus parabelopolskyi *Haemoproteus paramultipigmentatus *Haemoproteus paranucleophilus *Haemoproteus paruli *Haemoproteus passeris *Haemoproteus payevskyi *Haemoproteus peltocephali *Haemoproteus peircei *Haemoproteus pelouri *Haemoproteus phyllodactyli *Haemoproteus piresi *Haemoproteus plataleae *Haemoproteus pratosi *Haemoproteus prognei *Haemoproteus psittaci *Haemoproteus pteroclis *Haemoproteus ptyodactyli *Haemoproteus quelea *Haemoproteus raymundi *Haemoproteus rileyi *Haemoproteus rupicola *Haemoproteus sacharovi *Haemoproteus sanguinus *Haemoproteus sanîosdiasï *Haemoproteus sauianae *Haemoproteus sequeirae *Haemoproteus serini *Haemoproteus silvaï *Haemoproteus sturni *Haemoproteus sylvae *Haemoproteus syrnii *Haemoproteus tarentolae *Haemoproteus tartakovskyi *Haemoproteus telfordi *Haemoproteus tendeiroi *Haemoproteus tinnunculi *Haemoproteus thraupi *Haemoproteus trionyxi *Haemoproteus turtur *Haemoproteus uraeginthus *Haemoproteus vacuolatus *Haemoproteus valkiūnasi *Haemoproteus vangii *Haemoproteus velans *Haemoproteus vireonis *Haemoproteus wenyoni *Haemoproteus witti *Haemoproteus xantholemae *Haemoproteus zosteropsis  Life cycle  Haemoproteus ilanpapernai The infective stage is the sporozoite which is present in the salivary glands of the vector. Once the vector bites a new host, the sporozoites enter the blood stream and invade endothelial cells of blood vessels within various tissues including those of the lung, liver and spleen. Within the endothelial cells, the sporozoites undergo asexual reproduction becoming schizonts. These in turn produce numerous merozoites which penetrate the erythrocytes and mature into either female gametocytes (macrogametocytes) or male gametocytes (microgametocytes). Gametocytes can then be ingested by another blood-sucking insect where they undergo sexual reproduction in the midgut of the insect to produce oocysts. The oocysts rupture and release numerous sporozoites that invade the salivary gland and serve as a focus of subsequent infection for another host once the insect takes its next blood meal. Description Only gametocytes are found in the blood. Asexual reproduction occurs in body organs especially the liver. The organisms occupy the majority of the cytoplasm, leaving the light magenta, finely granular, pink nucleus centrally located. Taxonomy of this genus is difficult as there are few distinct morphological differences between the recognised species. Many of them were described under the 'one species-one host' hypothesis which is now thought to be potentially misleading. The morphological features most commonly used to describe a species include the number of pigment granules, the degree of encirclement of the host nucleus, the size of the parasite, the degree of host nucleus displacement and the degree of host cell enlargement. DNA studies should help to clarify this area but to date have rarely been undertaken. The gametocytes have five basic forms *thin gametocytes with incomplete margins (H. balearicae, H. pelouri) *halterial gametocytes (H. maccullumi) *thick sausage shaped gametocytes that fill most of the host cell and displace the host nucleus laterally (H. halyconis, H. plataleae) *gametocytes that encircle the host nucleus and fill the host cell (H. telfordi) *straight gametocytes that normally occur in anucleate cells and are almost as long as the host cell (H. enucleator) = Diagnostic criteria = *Gametocytes are only present within erythrocytes * Gametocytes have a \\"halter-shaped\\" appearance with little displacement of the host nucleus * Schizonts are not seen on peripheral blood smears * Multiple pigment granules (hemozoin) are present within the erythrocytes Pigment granules are refractile and yellow to brown in colour.  Pathology  Infections with most Haemoproteus species appear to produce subclinical infections. Post-mortem findings include enlargement of the spleen, liver and kidneys. These organs may appear chocolate-brown due to hemozoin deposition. Cytologic imprints may reveal schizont-laden endothelial cells. Some species of Haemoproteus will also form large, cyst-like bodies within the skeletal muscles that resembling those seen with Sarcocystis species infections. Pigeons infected with Haemoproteus columbae may develop enlarged gizzards; and anemia has been recorded. Flocks of bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) may become infected with Haemoproteus lophortyx. Infected birds may suffer from reluctance to move, ruffled appearance, prostration and death. Other findings include parasitemia and anemia. Large megaloschizonts may be present in skeletal muscles, particularly those of the thighs and back. The average cumulative mortality for flocks experiencing outbreaks may be over 20%. Experimental infection of turkeys with Haemoproteus meleagridis resulted in lameness, diarrhea, depression, emaciation, anorexia and occasionally anemia. Muscovey ducks infected with Haemoproteus nettionis suffered lameness, dyspnea and sudden death. In other avian species, anemia and anorexia have been reported occasionally. Importantly, new records of Haemoproteus are discovered constantly and should still be monitored for effects on host condition Effect on vectors H. columbae infects rock pigeons (Columba livia) and is vectored by a hippoboscid fly (Pseudolynchia canariensis). Both sexes of vector can transmit the parasite. Species of the Hippoboscoidea the superfamily to which Ps. canariensis belongs do not lay eggs. Instead the larvae hatch in utero, are fed internally by 'milk glands' and pass through three morphological stages before being deposited to pupate. The survival of female flies is significantly reduced when they were infected with the parasite. In contrast no effect is seen on male fly survival. Additionally the females produce fewer offspring when infected but the quality of the offspring does not seem to be affected.

Since Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are the presiding deities of the area, it was initially known as Muvalankara, which later became Muvaankara. This temple is situated in a serene atmosphere in the middle of a wooded area (42 cents) resembling that of Sabarimala. The temple belonged to Maravanchery Mana and now it has been handed over to a registered trust of devotees. The beautiful and unique Sri Krishna idol made of jet black stone is in the form of child Sri Krishna with butter in both hands. It is believed to have been the idol worshiped by Vilwamangalam Swamiyar. \\"Sri Vasudevapuram\\" temple is built for Vilwamangalam Swamiyar's mother for offering prayer during her old age. Vilwamangalam Swamiyar was so great a Bhaktha (devotee of) Sri Krishna that he was said to possess the ability to actually \\"see\\" him. He was instrumental in setting up several famous temples in Kerala such as Thiruvananthapuram, Thiruvaarppu, and Cherthala Kaarthiaayani.http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/vilwamangalam- swaamiyaar.htm\\"Aithihyamaala\\" Kottarathil Sankunni. 1909; Latest edition: Oct. 1985; Published by Kottarathil Sankunny Memorial Committee, Kottayam - 686 001.

He worshiped Lord Sri Krishna in child form in a unique idol. After the disappearance of his mortal body, that divine idol was installed in a temple as per temple rituals for the benefit of common people. The village was dedicated to the Lord of this temple and was renamed Vasudevapuram. Later a devotee of Lord Shiva brought a Shiva lingam and installed it in the temple for his worship. Ganapathi and Sastha idols were also installed in the temple.Proceedings of the Deva Prasnam by Jyothisha Panditha Sri. Mezhathur A. P. Kuttikrishnan Nair, 17 May 1985 Festivals Ashtami Rohini in Chingam (August-September) is the birthday of Lord Krishna.http://www.guruvayurdevaswom.org/oreligious.shtml That is celebrated every year with cultural programs, procession, and special poojas including Guru pooja (Yatheeswara pooja). The devotees are given special feast on this day. Niraputhari: This takes place in the month of Chingam. Puthari means new rice. It is the formal beginning of the use of rice after the new harvest season. It is a tradition in Sanatana Dharma that any food, item or work is offered (dedicated) to Lord before it is used. Puthari payasam is offered to Lord. Kuchela Dinam: The first Wednesday of the month of Dhanu (December) is celebrated as Kuchela Dinam. It is based on the belief that it was on this day that Kuchela, an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna offered Avil (parched rice) to him and in return attained eternal bliss and material prosperity . Avil offering is considered auspicious on this day. Vasudevapuram temple See also * Temples of Kerala Notes 6\\\\.

Early years Davidson was the illegitimate son of the Attorney General of Jamaica and a local black woman. At the age of 14 he travelled to Glasgow to study law. In Scotland he became involved in the movement for parliamentary reform. He was apprenticed to a Liverpool lawyer, but ran away to sea. Later, he was press-ganged into the Royal Navy. After his discharge, he returned to Scotland. His father arranged for him to study mathematics in Aberdeen. Davidson withdrew from study, moved to Birmingham, and started a cabinet-making business. He courted the daughter of a prosperous merchant. Her father suspected that Davidson was after her £7,000 dowry, and arranged for Davidson to be arrested on a false charge. When Davidson discovered she had married someone else he attempted suicide by taking poison. Davidson's cabinet-making business failed, and he moved to London. He married Sarah Lane, a working-class widow with four children. They had two more children. Davidson became a Wesleyan Methodist, and taught at the Sunday School. However, he left after he was accused of attempting to seduce a female student. Political activism Following the Peterloo Massacre, William Davidson became involved in radical politics again. In October 1819 Richard Carlile was found guilty of blasphemy and seditious libel, and sentenced to three years imprisonment. Davidson said that this had caused him to lose his belief in God. He joined the Marylebone Union Reading Society, a club that offered a reading room of radical newspapers such as The Republican and the Manchester Observer for a subscription of twopence a week. He also read the works of Tom Paine. Davidson met John Harrison at the Marylebone Union. Harrison was a member of the Spencean Philanthropists in London. Davidson soon became a Spencean. He met Arthur Thistlewood, and after a few months he became one of the Committee of Thirteen that ran the organisation. In February 1820, George Edwards, a government provocateur, drew Davidson and Thistlewood and 27 other Spenceans into a plot to kill government cabinet officers as they dined at the Earl of Harrowby's house at 39, Grosvenor Square on 23 February. Thistlewood selected Davidson as one of an Executive of Five to organise the assassinations. (The dinner was a fictitious construction.) Davidson had worked for Lord Harrowby in the past, and knew some of his staff at Grosvenor Square. His job was to find out more details about the cabinet meeting. One of the servants told him that the Earl of Harrowby was not in London. Davidson relayed this information to Arthur Thistlewood, who believed that the servant was lying, and ordered the conspirators to proceed with the plot. On 23 February the Cato Street Conspiracy met in a hayloft on Cato Street, near Grosvenor Square. However, there was no cabinet meeting: the Spenceans had been set up by George Edwards. George Ruthven led 13 police officers to storm the hayloft. Several revolutionaries refused to surrender their weapons. Thistlewood killed police officer Richard Smithers with a single sword-thrust. When the co-conspirators tried to escape, Benjamin Gill hit Davidson on the wrist with his truncheon, and he dropped his blunderbuss. Four conspirators, Thistlewood, John Brunt, Robert Adams and John Harrison escaped through a window. However, their identities were given to the police by Edwards and they were quickly arrested. Eleven men were charged with involvement in the Cato Street Conspiracy. Robert Adams testified against the other men, and charges against him were dropped. Davidson pleaded innocence and claimed the court was prejudiced against black people. However, his presence at the scene with a blunderbuss led to his conviction. On 28 April 1820, William Davidson, James Ings, Richard Tidd, Arthur Thistlewood, and John Brunt were found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to death. John Harrison, James Wilson, Richard Bradburn, John Strange and Charles Copper were also found guilty. However their death sentences were subsequently commuted to transportation for life. William Davidson, with his four fellow conspirators, was publicly hanged and decapitated outside Newgate Prison on 1 May 1820.

Calcium oxalate (Ca(COO)2, CaOx) crystals are found in algae, angiosperms and gymnosperms in a total of more than 215 families. These plants accumulate oxalate in the range of 3–80% (w/w) of their dry weight through a biomineralization process in a variety of shapes. Araceae have numerous druses, multi-crystal druses and needle-shaped raphide crystals of CaOx present in the tissue. Druses are also found in leaves and bud scales of Prunus, Rosa, Allium, Vitis, Morus and Phaseolus.  Formation  A number of biochemical pathways for calcium oxalate biomineralization in plants have been proposed. Among these are the cleavage of isocitrate, the hydrolysis of oxaloacetate, glycolate/glyoxylate oxidation, and/or oxidative cleavage of L-ascorbic acid. The cleavage of ascorbic acid appears to be the most studied pathway. The specific mechanism controlling this process is unclear but it has been suggested that a number of factors influence crystal shape and growth, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids or macromolecular membrane structures. Druses may also have some purpose in calcium regulation.

The dock connector will typically carry a variety of signals and power, through a single connector, to simplify the process of docking the mobile device. A dock connector may be embedded in a mechanical fixture used to support or align the mobile device or may be at the end of a cable. The dock connector was originally associated with laptops, but other mobile devices use the concept.  Laptops  Docking connectors for laptop computers are usually embedded into a mechanical device that supports and aligns the laptop and sports various single-function ports and a power source that are aggregated into the docking connector. Docking connectors would carry interfaces such as keyboard, serial, parallel, and video ports from the laptop and supply power to it.  Mobile devices  Many mobile devices feature a dock connector. Dock connectors can be used to interface with accessories such as external speakers, including stereo systems and clock radios. Automotive accessories for mobile devices include charging cradles, FM transmitters for playing audio through the car's speakers, and GPS receivers. There are dock connector cables that offer additional capabilities such as direct integration with the car's audio system and controls. =Apple 30-pin dock connector= Apple's proprietary 30-pin connector was common to most Apple mobile devices (iPhone (1st generation), iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, 1st through 4th generation iPod Touch, iPad, iPad 2, and iPad air 4th gen) from its introduction with the 3rd generation iPod classic in 2003 until the Lightning connector was released in late 2012. Originally, the Apple dock connector carried USB, FireWire, some controls and line-level audio outputs. As the iPod changed, so did the signals in the dock connector. Video was added to the connector. FireWire was phased out of the iPods, which led to a discontinuity in usage of the dock connector. As a result of the popularity of Apple's iPod and iPhone devices using the connector, a cottage industry was created of third-party devices that could connect to the interface. With the discontinuation of the sixth-generation 160 GB iPod Classic and the iPhone 4S, the last Apple products to feature the original 30-pin connector, the connector was discontinued in September 2014.Apple iPhone 4s discontinued, iPhone 5c becomes cheapest option =Apple Lightning connector= Apple introduced an 8-pin dock connector, named Lightning, on September 12, 2012. The iPhone 5 and later iPhone models, iPod touch 5th generation and later, seventh generation iPod nano, every iPad mini, iPad (4th generation) and later, iPad Air and the first two generations of the iPad Pro all use the Lightning connector, as do several Apple accessories. Apple Lightning connector pins can be accessed from both sides of the connector allowing insertion with either side facing up. The Lightning connector replaced the 30-pin dock connector used by previous generations of iPods, iPhones, and iPads. =Samsung 30-pin dock connector= The Samsung Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Note 30-pin dock/charging connector is very similar to - although not identical with - the non-proprietary PDMI connector.

Ali was described as great scholar and miracle worker by Sultan Baybars' biographer, Muhyi al-Din (died 1292). According to Mujir al-Din (writing c. 1496), the tomb was visited by Baybars in 1265.

It is a hydroxamic acid and acts as a non-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (pan-HDAC inhibitor).Table 3: Select epigenetic inhibitors in various stages of development from On 23 February 2015 it received FDA accelerated approval for use in patients with multiple myeloma,FDA.gov announcement about accelerated approval of panobinostat (Farydak) and on 28 August 2015 it was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the same use. Medical uses Panobinostat is used in combination with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib and the corticoid dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adults who had received at least two previous treatments, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. Contraindications The drug is contraindicated in nursing mothers. To judge from experiments in animals, there is a risk for the unborn child if used during pregnancy; still, the benefit of panobinostat may outweigh this risk. Side effects Common side effects (in more than 10% of patients) include low blood cell counts (pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia), airway infections, as well as unspecific reactions such as fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and sleeping problems. PharmacologyMechanism of action= Panobinostat inhibits multiple histone deacetylase enzymes, a mechanism leading to apoptosis of malignant cells via multiple pathways. =Pharmacokinetics= Panobinostat is absorbed quickly and almost completely from the gut, but has a significant first-pass effect, resulting in a total bioavailability of 21%. Highest blood plasma levels in patients with advanced cancer are reached after two hours. Plasma protein binding is about 90%. The substance is metabolised mainly through oxidation by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and to a small extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. It is also reduced, hydrolyzed and glucuronidized by unspecified enzymes. All metabolites seem to be inactive. Biological half-life is estimated to be 37 hours. 29–51% are excreted via the urine and 44–77% via the faeces. StudiesClinical trials= , it is being tested against Hodgkin's Lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and other types of malignant disease in Phase III clinical trials, against myelodysplastic syndromes, breast cancer and prostate cancer in Phase II trials, and against chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in a Phase I trial. panobinostat is being used in a Phase I/II clinical trial that aims at curing AIDS in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In this technique, panobinostat is used to drive the HIV DNA out of the patient's DNA, in the expectation that the patient's immune system in combination with HAART will destroy it. panobinostat is being studied in a phase II trial for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). =Preclinical studies= Panobinostat has been found to synergistically act with sirolimus to kill pancreatic cancer cells in the laboratory in a Mayo Clinic study. In the study, investigators found that this combination destroyed up to 65 percent of cultured pancreatic tumor cells. The finding is significant because the three cell lines studied were all resistant to the effects of chemotherapy – as are many pancreatic tumors. Panobinostat has also been found to significantly increase in vitro the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein levels in cells of patients suffering from spinal muscular atrophy. Panobinostat was able to selectively target triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by inducing hyperacetylation and cell cycle arrest at the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint; partially reversing the morphological changes characteristic of breast cancer cells. Panobinostat, along with other HDAC inhibitors, is also being studied for potential to induce virus HIV-1 expression in latently infected cells and disrupt latency. These resting cells are not recognized by the immune system as harboring the virus and do not respond to antiretroviral drugs. A 2015 study suggested Panobinostat was effective in preventing diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo, identifying it as a potential drug candidate.

Life He was born in Aberdeen on 11 March 1934, and first learned to play the practice chanter at the age of four from his father John, who was also a piper. The family moved to Edinburgh when the elder John took up a lecturing position at the Veterinary School. John D. was educated Edinburgh Academy, and tutored by Pipe major Willie Ross of the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming at Edinburgh Castle. He did not play in the school band, for fear that it would damage his technique. In 1950 he became the youngest ever winner of the Gold Medals for piobaireachd at both the Argyllshire Gathering in Oban and the Northern Meeting in Inverness, at the age of 16. He initially intended to pursue piping as a hobby, and pursue a career training horses, but he went on a tour of Canada and the United States with Willie Ross in 1952. Burgess was persuaded by Brigadier Alistair MacLean at the Castle to join the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders as a piper, and spent three years there, reaching the rank of corporal. His choice of regiment did not please Ross, who wanted him to join the Scots Guards. Burgess then joined the Edinburgh City Police, and became pipe major of that band in 1957. Between 1962 and 1965, he was pipe major of the 4th/5th Battalion Cameron Highlanders TA Pipe Band. He then moved to Invergordon in 1966, and played with the Invergordon Distillery Pipe Band for two years, until it was disbanded in 1967. Burgess became a teacher and judge after retiring from competitive playing in around 1979, teaching in schools around Easter Ross. He was awarded an MBE in 1988 for services to piping.

About 30 men are thought to have been killed in the attack, which was a reprisal action for an earlier Aboriginal raid on a flock of Van Diemen's Land Company sheep, but part of an escalating spiral of violence probably triggered by the abduction and rape of Aboriginal women in the area. The massacre was part of the \\"Black War\\", the period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Australians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832. News of the Cape Grim killings did not reach Governor George Arthur for almost two years. Arthur sent George Augustus Robinson, who held an unofficial government role as an Aboriginal conciliator, to investigate the incident, and later statements from company workers, a diary entry by the wife of a ship's captain and the testimony of an Aboriginal woman provided some further information. Despite the witness statements however, detail of what took place is sketchy and Australian author Keith Windschuttle and some other historians have subsequently disputed the magnitude of the massacre or denied it occurred at all. The site of the massacre has been identified as the present-day Suicide Bay, facing the island outcrops known as The Doughboys. Because a number of tribes were in the area at the time, it is uncertain which one was involved in the clash, although historian Lyndall Ryan states that those killed were members of the Peerapper clan. Background Clans of the North West nation had experienced violent conflict with European settlers since 1810 when sealing parties abducted women. In 1820 a group of sealers sprang from hiding in a cave at The Doughboys near Cape Grim and ambushed a group of Pennemukeer women collecting muttonbirds and shellfish, capturing and binding them and carrying them off to Kangaroo Island. Pennemukeer men responded with a reprisal attack, clubbing three sealers to death. Further conflict developed after the arrival of the VDLC in late 1826. The company had been formed in London in 1824 as a joint stock company whose purpose would be to breed and farm Merino and Saxon sheep on a large scale to meet the high demand for wool in England. The company was given a grant to 250,000 acres in the northwest tip of the colony then known as Van Diemen's Land, an area that was home to about 400 or 500 Aboriginals who had cleared the grassy plains of trees through generations of fire-stick farming. Ships then began arriving to offload livestock and labourers – mostly indentured \\"servants\\" or convicts who would work as shepherds and ploughmen on sheep stations at Cape Grim and Circular Head, occupying key Aboriginal kangaroo hunting grounds. Businessman Edward Curr was appointed as VDLC's Chief Agent, answering to a court of directors in London, but his position in the remote part of the colony also gave him the powers and authority of a magistrate. Curr quickly developed a reputation as a cruel and ruthless despot. Within a year of the company establishing a presence in the North West, employees under his direct control had gained a reputation for brutal treatment of the local Aboriginal population. Curr, rather than inquiring into or intervening in such cases, sometimes actively encouraged violence. Rosalie Hare, the wife of a ship's captain who arrived in January 1828 on board the Caroline and remained in the Curr household until March, noted in her journal the frequency of Aboriginal attacks on shepherds, but added: \\"We are not to suppose the Europeans in their turn take no revenge. We have to lament that our own countrymen consider the massacre of these people an honour. While we remained at Circular Head there were several accounts of considerable numbers of natives having been shot by them, they wishing to extirpate them entirely if possible.\\" According to historian Nicholas Clements, the primary cause of conflict was sex: very few white women were in the colony generally, and the shortage was particularly acute in the North West, where only Curr's wife and one other woman lived. The Governor was warned by one worker in 1827 that Curr's shepherds \\"had designs of violating the (native) women\\" and examples were later given to Robinson of female Aboriginals being kept by stock keepers and shepherds, some of them \\"chained up like a wild beast\\" and abused. Another woman was said to have been kept by a stock keeper for about a month, \\"after which she was taken out and shot.\\" Massacre Suicide Bay at Cape Grim, the scene of the events of 10 February 1828.

The Doughboys are on the left.The immediate catalyst of the February killings at Cape Grim was an incident about the beginning of December 1827 during a visit to the area by the Peerapper clan from West Point in search of muttonbird eggs and seals. Convicts who were working as assigned servants for the VDLC were tending to a large flock of sheep and managed to lure some Peerapper women into a hut for sex. When the Peerapper men objected, a skirmish developed during which one of the shepherds, Thomas John, was speared in the leg and several Peerapper men including a chief were shot dead. John was taken back to Circular Head a fortnight later and Curr reported the injury to VDLC directors in London, stating that his shepherd had been speared in an extended conflict that had begun when \\"a very strong party of Natives\\" attacked the men. A party of Peerapper, probably led by Wymurrick, returned to Cape Grim on 31 December, a month after the clash, to seek retribution.The date of 31 December was provided by Curr. See Lennox, p. 170. They destroyed 118 ewes from the company's stock, spearing some, beating others with waddies and driving the rest over a cliff and into the sea. The company vessel Fanny, with its master, Richard Frederick, was then sent to Cape Grim, ostensibly to collect sheep to be transported to Emu Bay (modern-day Burnie). While he was there, Frederick, who was \\"very well acquainted with that part of the country and with the habits of the Natives\\" – helped the shepherds search for the Peerapper clan and located their camp as part of a punitive expedition. Then, according to a journal account by Rosalie Hare, wife of the captain of the Caroline who was staying with Curr and his wife, they killed 12 men in a surprise night time raid. Several days later, on 10 February – about six weeks after the destruction of the ewes – the same four shepherds are believed to have surprised and trapped a party of Aboriginal men, women and children in what is now known as Suicide Bay, as they feasted on mutton-birds the women had caught at the nearby Doughboy Islands. Although there is no single definitive narrative, it is thought that the Aboriginal people, confronted by the armed Europeans, panicked and fled in different directions, with some rushing into the sea, others scrambling around the cliff and some fatally shot by the shepherds. One group – thought to be all men – were killed near the edge of a 60m cliff and their bodies then thrown to the rocks below. Two individuals, one of the convicts involved and an Aboriginal woman, stated that the death toll was 30, a senior VDLC employee described the fatalities as \\"a good number\\" and \\"a great many\\", while Curr initially reported six dead \\"besides several severely wounded\\". Those wounded by shot fired from muskets would have had poor prospects of survival. Investigation In a dispatch to VDLC directors on 14 January Curr reported the voyage of the Fanny and the subsequent night time encounter with Peerapper at their camp by Frederick and the shepherds who had \\"gone in quest\\" of those who had slaughtered the sheep. In Curr's account there were about 70 Peerapper in the encampment, but the shepherds watched and waited until dawn before retreating without a shot being fired, because \\"not a musket would go off\\" as a result of heavy rain during the night. Historian Ian McFarlane has described Curr's account as problematic and less plausible than that of Rosalie Hare: he said the men would have known the Peerapper were reluctant to move during the night, being timid in the dark, and it was improbable that men armed with that knowledge would sit in the cold and rain all night watching the targets silhouetted by campfires, only to await the light of the morning and lose their strategic advantage. Two weeks later, on 28 February, Curr provided the directors with his first, brief reference to the events of 10 February. He reported that he had heard information from the men on the Fanny that shepherds had encountered \\"a strong party of natives\\" and that after a long fight six Aboriginals were left \\"dead on the field including their chief besides several severely wounded.\\" He added: \\"I have no doubt that this will have the effect of intimidating them, and oblige them to keep aloof.\\" Curr reported nothing more on the incident or what had become of those who had been severely wounded, prompting the directors to write back to express extreme \\"regret\\" over the deaths and point out: \\"It does not appear from the account who were the aggressors.\\"VDL Court despatch to Curr, 28 October 1828, as quoted by McFarlane (p. 94). Despite his role as magistrate Curr did not further investigate the clash or notify Governor Arthur of the deaths and outside knowledge of the massacre would have remained negligible had it not been for the decision of embittered VDLC agricultural superintendent Alexander Goldie to write a lengthy letter to Arthur in November 1829 mentioning the encounter. Goldie's letter to Arthur was one of confession of his own involvements in the killing of Aboriginals – notably the shooting and butchering with an axe a woman on a north-west beach two months earlier – and revealed: George Augustus RobinsonIn a separate, scathing, 110-page letter to VDLC directors Goldie said Curr had personally encouraged the killing of other Aboriginals, offering rum on one occasion to any man who could bring him an Aboriginal head. Arthur responded to Goldie's accusations by asking Robinson to discover what he could about the incident when he ventured to the north-west region as part of his \\"friendly mission\\" to Aboriginal Tasmanians. It took until June the following year before Robinson arrived in the area, where on 16 June he interviewed Charles Chamberlain, one of the four convict shepherds involved. He recounted the conversation about events that were by then almost 2 years in the past: Four days later Robinson questioned a group of Aboriginal women at a sealer's camp adjacent to Robbins Passage, east of Cape Grim. Some related the details of the spearing of Thomas John, the subsequent shooting of an Aboriginal chief and the return of tribe members a few days later to drive sheep off the cliff. They also described the massacre of 10 February, recounting how VDLC shepherds had taken by \\"surprise a whole tribe which had come for a supply of muttonbirds at the Doughboys, massacred thirty of them and threw them off a cliff two hundred feet in altitude\\". On 10 August Robinson encountered convict William Gunchannon, another of the four who had been present at the massacre. Gunchannan admitted his involvement, estimating it had happened about six weeks after the destruction of the sheep, but was reluctant to provide detail. He told Robinson that the Aboriginal group attacked on 10 February had included men and women, but denied knowing whether any had been killed. Robinson later wrote that when he informed him that Chamberlain had already admitted a death toll of about 30, Gunchannan \\"seemed to glory in the act and said he would shoot them whenever he met them\\". Robinson did not interview the other two involved in the massacre: Richard Nicholson had previously drowned and John Weavis had since moved to Hobart. Guided by bushman Alexander McKay, Robinson visited Cape Grim and identified the site of the massacre. At the northern arm of what is today known as Suicide Bay, Robinson was able to identify the steep cliff over which the Aborigines drove the sheep. Just south of the cliff was a steep path leading down to the beach the Aboriginal women had identified as the site of the massacre. From the accounts gathered and his visit to the site, Robinson formulated what he believed was the most likely scenario of the day as the women swam across to the Doughboys to gather muttonbirds: =Curr's later explanations= VDLC directors, meanwhile, asked Curr to respond to Goldie's long list of complaints and accusations. His reply, on 7 October 1830, included a more comprehensive report on the events of 10 February 1828. Yet it was markedly different to the accounts Robinson had already obtained. Curr explained to VDLC directors that a \\"very large\\" Aboriginal party had initially assembled at the top of a hill that overlooked the shepherds' hut. He continued: Seven months later, in May 1831, the paths of Arthur and Curr crossed in the central Tasmanian village of Jericho, where the Governor confronted Curr with Robinson's report and told the Chief Agent that if the findings were incorrect then he should say so. In a letter to the Governor, Curr did just that, declaring: \\"I believe it to be untrue. I have no doubt that some Natives were killed on the occasion, my impression is that the real number was three ... as the case was represented to me by the men themselves at the time they had no alternative but to act as they did.\\" Site inspection and speculation The contradictions surrounding accounts of the events of 10 February 1828 have prompted some history writers to carry out their own inspections of the site in order to speculate on the most likely series of events. There is sharp contrast in their conclusions. Based on his visit to Cape Grim, Windschuttle has disputed much of Robinson's description of events, concluding that the shepherds could not have launched a surprise attack if the Aboriginals had been sitting on the beach at Suicide Bay. He explained that because the basalt slope above the beach is too steep to climb down, the shepherds would have had to descend via a steep track halfway round the bay in full view of those on the beach, giving the Aboriginals at least five minutes to flee, either by swimming across the bay or out to sea, or going around the rocks at the base of the cliff. He said Robinson's description of Aboriginals seeking shelter \\"in the cleft of the rock\\" and then being \\"forced to the brink of an awful precipice\\" was equally problematic because of the difficulty for shepherds to force captives up the track while carrying weapons and then – once the Aboriginal people reached the top – the impossibility of preventing their escape over the open grassy land as the shepherds climbed up behind them. He said: \\"If they really were trying to kill them all, they would have done it where they allegedly found them, down near the waterline at the edge of the bay.\\" Windschuttle said the site's \\"extraordinarily difficult terrain\\" coupled with the limitations of 19th century muskets made it beyond belief that four shepherds could have killed 30 Aboriginal people. He said the most credible account was Curr's, in which the shepherds felt threatened by the advancing Aboriginal party and marched from their hut to launch a pre-emptive strike. He also accepted Curr's claim of just six Aboriginal fatalities. Windschuttle said the clash probably took place on the open grassland near Victory Hill (on which he said the hut stood) and if bodies were thrown over a cliff, Victory Hill was the most plausible location from which to do it. A study of the area by McFarlane, however, raises critical flaws with Windschuttle's favoured version in which the convicts responded with gunfire after being threatened at their hut. McFarlane said surveyors' charts placed the shepherds' hut about a kilometre to the northeast of Victory Hill, which allowed the company easy access from the sea via Davisons Bay. The hut was well beyond the range of spears thrown by Aboriginal people on the hill, and McFarlane has argued that abandoning the cover of a hut to engage a vastly greater force of Aboriginal people occupying the higher ground would have been \\"an act of gross stupidity\\", particularly given that one of the convicts, John Weavis, was a former soldier who had served in the 89th Foot Regiment and York Chasseurs, a regiment raised from military deserters. McFarlane said a musket loaded with shot and fired uphill would have been a poor match for spears that could be thrown with great accuracy as far as 90 metres. He wrote: \\"A large number of Aborigines armed with spears on the high ground would certainly have been victorious. That four shepherds could emerge from that shower of missiles unscathed is beyond the bounds of credibility.\\" Additionally, if the fatal encounter had taken place closer to the shepherds' hut they would have had to carry the bodies of their victims almost two kilometres – passing Victory Hill on the way – in order to throw them off the cliffs at Suicide Bay. McFarlane said neither Chamberlain, Gunchannon nor the Aboriginal woman interviewed by Robinson had made any mention of the hut or the hill, with the focus of their accounts solely Suicide Bay. He concluded: \\"Curr's version of events is clearly implausible, without foundation and would appear designed to depict the Aborigines as aggressors by shifting the scene, and thus the nature of the crime, from Suicide Bay to Victory Hill.\\" McFarlane has postulated that the two contradictory witness accounts of events – Chamberlain's admission of men's bodies being thrown from the cliff and the Aboriginal women's account of the whole tribe, including women and children, being attacked on the beach – were two elements of the one story: the convicts attacked and shot a small group of men who were hunting wallaby on the heights and then fired down on to the women, children and elderly who were close to the sea harvesting seafood. The bodies of the men might later have been thrown upon the rocks. He also suggested a second scenario, which he described as more likely, which involved a midden whose remains are about from the top of the path to the beach on a large flattish sandy area. He said if this was the cooking area chosen on the day, the tribe could have been ambushed as they cooked and ate the muttonbirds, and suddenly found themselves trapped between the shepherds and the sea. Alarmed by gunfire, some may have fled down to the beach while others were driven back around the lip of the high ground leading to the cliff top. Aftermath According to McFarlane, most of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania's north west were methodically hunted down and killed by VDLC hunting expeditions, acting under Curr's control. He says between 400 and 500 Aboriginal people were living in the region before the company's arrival, but by 1835 their number had dwindled to just over 100. From 1830 Robinson began rounding up the last survivors of the Aboriginal tribes to take them to a \\"place of safety\\" on an island off Tasmania's north coast; however those in the north-west avoided him. In 1830 at a sealer's camp Robinson found six abducted Aboriginal women, and an 18-year-old man called \\"Jack of Cape Grim\\" from the Parperloihener band of Robbins Island, whose Aboriginal name was Tunnerminnerwait. Robinson threatened the sealers with legal action unless they gave up the Aborigines, and to the Aborigines he promised safety and an eventual return to tribal areas.Jan Roberts, pp. 1–9, Jack of Cape Grim, Greenhouse Publications, 1986 See also * History wars * List of massacres in Australia * List of massacres of Indigenous Australians * Tasmanian Aborigines ReferencesBibliography   * * Category:1828 in Australia Category:Van Diemen's Land Category:North West Tasmania Category:Aborigines in Tasmania Category:Massacres of Indigenous Australians Category:19th century in Tasmania Category:February 1828 events Category:1820s crimes in Australia ","title":"Cape Grim massacre"},{"id":"20845292","text":"Harbans Mukhia (born 1939) is an Indian historian whose principal area of study is medieval India.

In it, all power and wealth is controlled (and distributed) by the Tsar. They had more power than constitutional monarchs, who are usually vested by law and counterbalanced by a legislative authority; and more authority on religious issues compared to Western monarchs. In Russia, it originated during the time of Ivan III (1462−1505), and was abolished after the Russian Revolution of 1905.  Alternative names  This system has also been described by the following terms: Imperial autocracy, Russian autocracy, Muscovite autocracy, tsarist absolutism, imperial absolutism, Russian absolutism, Muscovite absolutism, Muscovite despotism, Russian despotism, tsarist despotism or imperial despotism.  History  The Tatar Yoke and the Sino-Mongol ideas and administrative system are credited with bringing the culture exhibiting some characteristics of an oriental despotism to Russia.Donald Ostrowski, The Mongols and Rus': Eight Paradigms, in Abbott Gleason, A Companion to Russian History, Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, , Google Print, p.78 Absolutism in Russia gradually developed during the 17th and 18th centuries, replacing the despotism of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Ivan III built upon Byzantine traditions and laid foundations for the tsarist autocracy, a system that with some variations would govern Russia for centuries.Peter Truscott, Russia First: Breaking with the West, I. B. Tauris, 1997, , Google Print, p.17 After a period of disorder known as a Time of Troubles, the first monarch of the Romanov dynasty, Michael of Russia, was elected to the throne by a Zemsky Sobor (or \\"assembly of the land\\"). During Michael's reign, when the Romanov dynasty was still weak, such assemblies were summoned annually. However, the Romanov dynasty consolidated absolute power in Russia during the reign of Peter the Great, who reduced the power of the nobility and strengthened the central power of the tsar, establishing a bureaucratic civil service based on the Table of Ranks but theoretically open to all classes of the society, in place of the nobility-only mestnichestvo which Feodor III had abolished in 1682 at the request of the highest boyars.Nicolai N. Petro, The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture, Harvard University Press, 1995, , Google Print, p.34-36David R. Stone, A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, , Google Print, p.59Paul Bushkovitch, Peter the Great: The Struggle for Power, 1671–1725, Cambridge University Press, 2001, , Google Print, p. 80 & 118-119 Peter I also strengthened the state's control over the church (the Orthodox Church). Peter's reform caused a series of palace coups seeking to restore the power of the nobility.Nicolai N. Petro, The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture, Harvard University Press, 1995, , Google Print, p.36-39 To end them, Catherine the Great, whose reign is often regarded as the high point of absolutism in Russia, in 1785 issued the Charter to the Gentry, legally affirming the rights and privileges they had acquired in preceding years, and the Charter of the Towns, establishing municipal self-government. This placated the powerful members of society; however, in fact, the real power rested with the state's bureaucracy. This was built on by later Tsars. Alexander I established the State council as advisory legislative body. Although Alexander II established a system of elected local self-government (Zemstvo) and an independent judicial system, Russia did not have a national-level representative assembly (Duma) or a constitution until the 1905 Revolution.Nicolai N. Petro, The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture, Harvard University Press, 1995, , Google Print, p.48 The system was abolished after the Russian Revolution of 1917.  Features  The person of the tsar himself, a sovereign with absolute authority, stood at the center of the tsarist autocracy.Stephen J. Lee Russia and the USSR, 1855–1991: Autocracy and Dictatorship, Routledge, 2006. , Google Print, p.1-3 The rights of state power in their entire extent belonged to the tsar. The autocrat further entrusted power to persons and institutions, acting in his name, by his orders, and within the limits laid down for them by law. The purpose of the system was to supposedly benefit the entire country of Russia. A metaphor existed likening the tsar to a father, and all of the subjects of the Empire, to his children; this metaphor even appeared in Orthodox primers.Robert D. Crews, For Prophet and Tsar: Islam and Empire in Russia and Central Asia, Harvard University Press, 2006, , Google Print, p.77 This metaphor is present in the common Russian expression \\"царь-батюшка\\", literally \\"tsar-dear father\\". Furthermore, unlike the future theoretical separation of church and state in West European monarchies, the Russian Empire combined monarchy with the supreme authority on religious issues (see Church reform of Peter I and caesaropapism for details). Another key feature related to patrimonialism. In Russia the tsar owned a much higher proportion of the state (lands, enterprises, etc.) than did Western monarchs.Deborah Goodwin, Matthew Midlane, Negotiation in International Conflict: Understanding Persuasion, Taylor & Francis, 2002, , Google Print, p.158Nicolas Spulber, Russia's Economic Transitions: From Late Tsarism to the New Millennium, Cambridge University Press, 2003, , Google Print, p.27-28Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait, University of California Press, 1977, , Google Print, p.356-358Richard Pipes, Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture, Yale University Press, 2007, , Google Print, p.181Catherine J.

Major Russian advocates and theorists of the autocracy included writer Fyodor Dostoyevsky,Peter Viereck, Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill, Transaction Publishers, 2005, , Google Print, pp. 84–86James Patrick Scanlan, Dostoevsky the Thinker: A Philosophical Study, Cornell University Press, 2002, , Google Print, p.171-172 Mikhail Katkov,Richard Pipes, Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture, Yale University Press, 2007, , Google Print, p.124 Konstantin Aksakov,Nicolai N. Petro, The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture, Harvard University Press, 1995, , Google Print, p.90 Nikolay Karamzin, Konstantin Pobedonostsev and Pyotr Semyonov. They all argued that a strong and prosperous Russia needed a strong tsar, and that philosophies of republicanism and liberal democracy did not fit Russia.  Influences  Some historians see the traditions of tsarist autocracy as partially responsible for laying groundworks for the totalitarianism in the Soviet Union.David Lloyd Hoffmann, Stalinism: The Essential Readings, Blackwell Publishing, 2003, , .Google Print, p.67-68Dennis J. Dunn, The Catholic Church and Russia: Popes, Patriarchs, Tsars, and Commissars, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, , Google Print, p.72 They see the traditions of autocracy and patrimonialism as dominating Russia's political culture for centuries; for example, Stephen White is described as \\"the most consistent\\" defender of the position that the uniqueness of Russian political heritage is inseparable from its ethnic identity. In White's opinion, autocracy is the defining factor in the history of Russian politics.Nicolai N. Petro, p. 29 He wrote that Russian political culture is \\"rooted in the historical experience of centuries of absolutism.\\"Nicolai N. Petro, The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture, Harvard University Press, 1995, , Google Print, p.15 Those views had been challenged by other historians, for example, Nicolai N. Petro and Martin Malia (as cited by Hoffmann). Richard Pipes is another influential historian among non- specialists who holds the position about the distinctness of Russian history and political system, describing the absolutism of the Muscovite political system as \\"patrimonial\\", and saw the stability of the Soviet Union in the fact that Russians accepted the legitimacy of this patrimonial organization. Some historians have pointed to a racial element in the concept. For example, American Cold War analysts, including George Kennan, linked the Soviet government's autocratic rule to Tatar influences during its history, and biographies of Russian leaders often stressed their possible Asiatic ancestries. They maintained that Asiatic influences rendered the Russians, along with the Chinese, untrustworthy.  Criticism of the concept  Historians of different backgrounds have criticised the concept of tsarist autocracy in its various forms. Their complaints range from the different names of the model being too vague,C.J. Halperin, 'Muscovy as a Hypertrophic State: A Critique', Kritika 3 3 (2002) 501. to its chronological implications (it is impossible to consider Russia in different centuries the same) as well as to its content (the question how Russian or \\"tsarist\\" autocracy differs from \\"regular\\" autocracy or from European absolutism for that matter). Regarding the substance of the autocracy model, its equation with despotism, its supposed origins in Mongol rule, as well as its supposed rise in medieval Muscovy have been heavily debated.D. Ostrowski, Muscovy and the Mongols: Cross-Cultural Influence on the Steppe Frontier, 1304-1589 (Cambridge 1998) 91-95; M. Poe, 'The Consequences of the Military Revolution in Muscovy: A Comparative Perspective', Comparative Studies in Society and History 38 4 (1996) 603-604; R.O. Crummey, 'Russian Absolutism and the Nobility', Journal of Modern History 49 3 (1977) 456-459. For one, Marxist Soviet scholars were concerned with prerevolutionary absolutism and identified the boyar elites and the bureaucracy as its pillars. For example, Sergey M. Troitskii claimed that the Russian monarchs held sway of the nobility which was reduced to state service. According to Troitskii, absolutism in Russia was the same as everywhere else. This led to a difficult position within Marxism, because absolutism revolves around institutions and laws, which were fundamentally less important than the socioeconomic base of society.A. Gerschenkron, 'Soviet Marxism and Absolutism', Slavic Review 30 4 (1971) 855. This raises the question how absolutism could be the same when socioeconomic circumstances in Russia were not the same as elsewhere. In order to reconcile the non- socioeconomic nature of absolutism with Marxist theory, Soviet scholar Alexander N. Chistozvonov proposed to group the Russian monarchy with the Prussian and Austrian ones, forming a distinct mix of Western European absolutism and \\"oriental despotism\\".Crummey, 'Russian Absolutism', 458-459. In the eyes of Chistozvonov, whatever absolutist or autocratic elements were indeed present in Russia, they were not unique and do not warrant Russia’s exclusive categorization. Similarly struggling with Marxist conceptions, Soviet historians Petr A. Zaionchkovskii and his student Larisa G. Zakharova focused on the importance of political convictions of Russian officials and bureaucrats to explain nineteenth-century political decision-making. By showing that the state was not a unified and powerful whole (commanded by the economically dominant class), they likewise tackled common (Marxist) conceptions of Russian autocracy.P.A. Zaionchkovskii, Otmena krepostnogo prava v Rossii (Moscow 1968); P.A. Zaionchkovski, Pravitel'stvennyi apparat samoderzhavnoi Rossii v XIX v. (Moscow 1978); L.G. Zakharova, Aleksandr II i otmena krepostnogo prava v Rossii (Moscow 2011). While like Troitskii, they studied the nobility and bureaucracy (in a later period), Zaionchkovskii and Zakharova painted a different picture of the tsar's position. Coinciding with Western scholars like Robert Crummey, they lay bare the interdependence of monarch and nobility in the practice of rule.Crummey, 'Russian Absolutism', 466-467. Outside Russia and the Soviet Union, Hans-Joachim Torke among others tried to counter the notion of an all-powerful autocratic state by pointing at the mutual dependency of service elites and the state (coining the term \\"state-conditioned society\\").Crummey, ‘Russian Absolutism’, 466; R.O. Crummey, 'Hans-Joachim Torke, 1938-2000', Kritika 2 3 (2001) 702 Torke acknowledges that the tsars were not reined in by any form of constitution, but he emphasizes for example the limitations of Christian morality and court customs. The so-called \\"American school\\" of the 1980s and 1990s argued for the important role of elite networks and their power at court. Edward Keenan went even further in his well-known piece on Muscovite political culture, claiming that the tsar was merely a puppet in the hands of boyars who wielded the actual power behind the scenes.P. Bushkovitch, Peter the Great: The Struggle for Power, 1671-1725 (Cambridge 2004) 4; E.L. Keenan, 'Muscovite Political Folkways', Russian Review 45 2 (1986) 115-181. For others, like David Ransel and Paul Bushkovitch, it goes too far to portray relations between tsar and nobility like Keenan does, because it does not appreciate their complexity. Bushkovitch argues that the theoretic lack of limitations on the power of the tsar is irrelevant and instead claims that the \\"crucial question\\" is where real power lay. In his view, this can only be shown by the political narrative of events.D.L. Ransel, The Politics of Catherinian Russia: The Panin Party (New Haven 1975); Bushkovitch, Peter the Great: The Struggle for Power, 29. Bushkovitch placed the balance of power between the tsar, the individual boyars and the tsar’s favourites at the centre of political decision-making. In so doing, Bushkovitch found that on the one hand, the tsar's relative power fluctuated per monarch, and on the other hand, that the nobility was all but unified; the balance of power changed with each tsar as well as the rise of boyars and in the case of Peter I even shifted multiple times. Charles J. Halperin cautioned against views that too easily claim tsar and state dominance in politics or society.Halperin, 'Muscovy as a Hypertrophic State', 501-507. While acknowledging the institutional differences between Muscovy and Western European monarchies, Halperin nevertheless stresses that these differences should not be considered absolute. In his view, the practice of rule, a matter of human interactions, is more important than theory and abstractions.

Tsarist can be indeed applicable to the entire period (see also historical usage of the term \\"tsar\\"), but Muscovite is applicable only to the period of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which was replaced by tsardom of Russia, a period for which the words imperial and Russian are applicable. Further, we can look at Muscovite despotism as a precursor for the tsarist absolutism, however, the very use of the word despotism has problems (see following note). Finally, care should be taken with the term autocracy: today, autocrat is usually seen as synonymous with despot, tyrant and/or dictator, though each of these terms originally had a separate and distinct meaning. Overall, out of the available terms, \\"tsarist autocracy\\" is the one which seems most correct for the entire period discussed, but it is worth keeping in mind that there are no ideal types, and that the Russian political system evolved through time. c As used in those publications. d As used in those publications. e As used in those publications. f As used in those publications. g As used in those publications. h As used in those publications. i As used in those publications. j As used in those publications. k The terms oriental despotism and its development, the Muscovite or Russian despotism, have been criticized as misleading, since Muscovy, and Russia, never had characteristics of pure despotism, such as the ruler being identified with a god).Donald Ostrowski, Muscovy and the Mongols: Cross-Cultural Influences on the Steppe Frontier, 1304–1589, Cambridge University Press, 2002, , Google Print, p.85Tartar Yoke Professor Gerhard Rempel, Western New England College. l As used in those publications. m As used in those publications. n As used in those publications.

Like all parvoviruses, it is a small (18–26 nm), spherical virus, and has a single-stranded DNA genome. The signs and symptoms of enteritis usually appear within 4–7 days after infection. The virus replicates in the cells of the crypt epithelium in the duodenum and jejunum and, to a lesser extent the ileum, colon and caecum. The severity of the disease is directly related to necrosis of the crypt epithelium.Collier, Leslie; Balows, Albert; Sussman Max (1998) Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections ninth edition, Volume 1, Virology, volume editors: Mahy, Brian and Collier, Leslie. p. 268 Arnold. Virus enteritis of mink was recognized first in 1947 when epizootics occurred among ranch mink in southern Canada. The disease subsequently spread to the United States and Europe. Signs and symptoms Clinical signs include anorexia, vomiting and severe diarrhoea. Stools of affected animals usually contain large quantities of mucus and intestinal casts or \\"plugs\\" composed of fibrin, mucus and dead cells from intestinal mucosa. In immature animals, anorexia and diarrhoea usually occur about four days after exposure to infectious material and persist for four to seven days. However, infections have been reported in which anorexia was followed by death in 12 to 24 hours without the occurrence of diarrhoea. Mortality of 80 percent or more is possible in newly weaned kits. Mature mink often survive the disease after a period of sickness which may last several weeks. In addition to the overt signs a reduction of the number of leukocytes in the blood may be found in affected animals. Treatment Treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy in addition to supportive care. Surgical removal of necrotic tissue may be necessary.

Port Folio was the most highly regarded and successful literary publication of its time,Spiller 1948, p. 36Horner 1966, p. 581Lora 1999, p.108 and the first important political and literary journal in the United States.Dowling 1999, p. 1 Timothy Dwight IV once referred to Dennie as \\"the Addison of America\\"Lora 1999, p. 107 and \\"the father of American Belles- Lettres.\\"Marble 1907, p. 206  Early life and career  Dennie was born on August 30, 1768, in Boston, Massachusetts to Joseph Dennie, a member of a well-to-do merchant family, and his wife Mary Green, whose father was Bartholomew Green, Jr.Sloane 2016, p. 117Ellis 1915, pp. 12–14 The Greens were a prominent printing family in colonial America; the progenitor of the family, Samuel Green, emigrated from England with John Winthrop and was one of the first printers in the colonies.Thomas 1879, p. 49 Having moved to Lexington at the age of seven, Dennie returned to Boston in 1783 to study bookkeeping and later clerk in a counting house. He began preparing to enter Harvard College in 1785, under the guidance of Reverend Samuel West. West had a significant impact on Dennie, fostering his pupil's interest in literature, as well as instilling in Dennie a decidedly pro-British mindset.McKerns 1989, p. 178 In 1787 Dennie was admitted to the sophomore class of Harvard College, where he was very popular with his peers.Clapp 1880, p. 8 This popularity did not extend to his tutors, and he was suspended in December 1789 for six months after insulting the faculty.Clapp 1880, p. 9 Dennie had difficulty finding suitable employment after earning his degree in 1790, but by 1793 he was practicing law (though earning very little for his work).Clapp 1880, pp. 13–16 In a January 1794 letter to his parents, however, Dennie reports that he had been appointed as a reader for the Episcopalian church in Charlestown, New Hampshire. Nevertheless, he insisted that this new vocation would not deter him from his goal of practicing law, though by then he was planning on remaining in New Hampshire to practice rather than returning to Massachusetts.Clapp 1880, pp. 15–23 Shortly after writing the letter, Dennie was admitted to the Court of Common Pleas and opened a practice in Charlestown.Clapp 1880, p. 23 However, he rarely appeared in open court;Buckingham 1852, pp. 198-199 indeed, he probably made only one appearance.Ward 1896, pp. 667–668  Publishing career  Throughout the 1790s Dennie contributed to various journals, including the Federal Orrery and the Massachusetts Magazine, often using pen names such as Academicus and Socialis.Ellis 1915, p. 42 In 1795, his writing being enthusiastically received, Dennie was persuaded to begin a literary journal, The Tablet. William Spotswood, a Boston printer and bookseller, agreed to oversee the entire enterprise, splitting the profits evenly with Dennie. Such a literary journal was a novel idea at the time, and it was well-received among the city's elite. Despite the initial excitement surrounding the project and content from noted writers such as John Sylvester John Gardiner, The Tablet lasted only a few months before folding,Clapp 1880, pp. 24–25 having published thirteen issues.Lora 1999, p.104 Dennie's disappointment over the failure of The Tablet inspired him to begin work on The Lay Preacher, the first of which appeared in The Farmer's Weekly Museum, a New Hampshire newspaper which was the leading literary journal of the 1790s.Lora 1999, p. 103 After Dennie took over as editor of the paper in 1796, its circulation increased dramatically, stretching, as one commentator put it, \\"from Maine to Georgia.\\"Clapp 1880, p.28 Under Dennie's leadership the paper had a decidedly Federalist slant, supporting both the Quasi-War and the Alien and Sedition Acts. Dennie collaborated often with his friend Royall Tyler;Westbrook 1988, p. 100Richards 1997, p. 1 the two wrote a satirical column by the name of \\"The Shop of Messrs. Colon and Spondee\\" which appeared in the Museum.Tyler 1920, p. 119Ellis 1971, pp. 66–67 In 1798 Dennie lost a considerable amount of money when the paper's printer went bankrupt. He remained as editor for a few months afterward at a reduced salary but was soon replaced by the printer's brother. The paper's circulation dropped precipitously following Dennie's departure. Later in the year Dennie ran an unsuccessful campaign for Congress; following this defeat, he turned down offers to edit several prominent journals, including a generous offer from Boston's Independent Chronicle, as he refused to work for a Democratic paper.Marble 1907, p.216 Instead, he accepted an appointment from Timothy Pickering (at the time United States Secretary of State) to a position as Pickering's personal secretary.Clapp 1880, pp. 31–32 Once in Philadelphia, Dennie resumed his editorial career with the Gazette of the United States, a Federalist-friendly newspaper.Lora 1999, p. 108 In 1800 Dennie, along with Philadelphia bookseller Asbury Dickens, began work on the Port Folio. Under the pseudonym Oliver Oldschool, Esq.,Adams 2006, p. 221Trent 1903, p. 212 Dennie wrote, in 1803, a scathing attack on Jeffersonian democracy, for which he was brought up on charges of seditious libel.Adams 1986, p. 60 Dennie wrote, in part: > A democracy is scarcely tolerable at any period of national history. Its > omens are always sinister, and its powers are unpropitious. It is on its > trial here, and the issue will be civil war, desolation, and anarchy. No > wise man but discerns its imperfections, no good man but shudders at its > miseries, no honest man but proclaims its fraud, and no brave man but draws > his sword against its force. The institution of a scheme of policy so > radically contemptible and vicious is a memorable example of what the > villany of some men can devise, the folly of others receive, and both > establish in spite of reason, reflection, and sensation.Adams 2007, p. 67–68 This paragraph was reprinted in Federalist newspapers throughout the country. While Dennie was acquitted, the severity of the attacks leveled in Port Folio would henceforth be lessened.Marble 1907, p. 216 However, when Dennie criticized democracy, it was not the republican democracy found in the United States today, but rather the \\"democracy\\" found in France under Robespierre and Napoleon. Dennie was invoking Aristotle's argument that \\"an absolute democracy is not to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government. It is the corruption and degeneracy, and not the sound constitution of a republic.\\"Dowling 1999, pp. 2–3  Death  Dennie had health trouble throughout his life, as well as a predilection for wine.Govan 1951, p. 39 His father (who had battled mental illness)Ellis 1915, p. 12 died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not able to attend his father's funeral, as he himself was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief.Ellis 1971, pp. 208–209 He briefly recovered, but succumbed to cholera morbus four months after his father's death.Ellis 1971, p. 211 Dennie died on January 7, 1812, and was interred two days later at St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia.Clapp 1880, p. 36 His epitaph was written by John Quincy Adams.Marble 1907, p. 231 The epitaph erroneously gives Lexington, Massachusetts as his birthplace; in fact, Dennie was born in Boston, but his family moved to Lexington shortly thereafter.Smyth 1892, pp. 110–111  Works  * *  Notes  References    * * Ellis, Harold Milton (1915).

This was his only senior match for the year but returned in 1933 until an accidental knee to the back from Collingwood's Albert Collier in Round 15 left him in severe pain. Dockendorff played in the 1933 semi-final against South Melbourne following a pre-game painkilling injection from Dr Roy Park but later collapsed in a carpark and required emergency surgery, thus missing the Preliminary Final and Grand Final, which Richmond played in. Dockendorff was told he would never play football again. Dockendorff worked as a football commentator for radio station 3UZ for the 1934 VFL season, being required to commentate while sitting on a plank of wood wedged between two ladders in the crowd.Bartlett, R.

It will be fielded in 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and was designed in house by Navair's Human Systems Division. The vests will be manufactured by Peckham Vocational Industries in Michigan and will be fielded to Navy and Marine aircrew in Iraq and Afghanistan. The PRU-70 merges both the aircrew survival vest and the latest in body armor. The new system was developed to fit the entire range of body types represented by the men and women in current U.S. aircrew population. The PRU-70 is also designed to reduce the bulk, weight and heat stressors commonly encountered by helicopter aircrews flying six or more hours on combat missions. The PRU-70 is also constructed from a material called Halo-Tech. Halo-Tech is as fire retardant as the Nomex material used for flight suits and yet is far more durable. The PRU-70 will also be the first of the survival clothing items produced in the new Coyote Brown camouflage color. The Coyote Brown color was developed to blend into the environment of 70 percent of the world's land masses. The PRU-70 replaces three different items of aircrew clothing; the standard AIRSAVE Survival Vest, the separate body armor system that is worn beneath the AIRSAVE survival vest and the current PRU-60B. According to the manufacturer, this results in reduced cost and configuration management for both forces in combat and in logistic terms, due to the PRU-70's ability to be worn as a stand-alone survival vest by simply being configured with or without life preservers (as authorized) and by adding or deleting body armor as needed. The PRU-70 is being replaced by the Aircrew Endurance Vest.

Born a night elf and sorcerer, his pursuit of power led him to commit several horrific acts against his own people, which earned him the nickname \\"the Betrayer\\" and to become the first Demon Hunter. Self-proclaimed the Lord of Outland, he also defected to the Burning Legion and became a partial demon himself. The character is one of the most notable and popular in the Warcraft franchise and has received positive critical reception from video game players. Illidan was voiced by Matthew Yang King in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion The Frozen Throne, and by Liam O'Brien since World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.  Development  In an interview with Warcraft developers Scott Mercer and Greg Street, Mercer mentioned that \\"we realized [...] Illidan had appeared many times in the concept art and the other material surrounding the expansion, but very few players ever actually saw him in the game itself. To most heroes, Illidan was a bit like Sauron from The Lord of the Rings; he was an omnipresent evil that they would hear about, but never actually meet in a face-to-face confrontation.\\" This resulted in the developers putting in more effort to ensure that players experience \\"more personal connection[s]\\" with characters such as Illidan.  Appearances  The night elf was born before the War of the Ancients, a conflict that erupted over 10,000 years prior to the Third War, when the chaotic Burning Legion first invaded Azeroth, attracted by the magical Well of Eternity. Driven by his thirst for power and his desire to impress Tyrande Whisperwind, Illidan made a pact with the Legion to secure the entrance of its leader, Sargeras, into Azeroth, largely by the energy of the Well of Eternity; this act earned Illidan the nickname of \\"Betrayer\\". The efforts of Malfurion Stormrage, Illidan's twin brother, disrupted the Legion's plot, with Illidan himself turning to his side and assisting in the demons' defeat. After recreating the destroyed Well of Eternity, Illidan was imprisoned for thousands of years. During the Third War, Tyrande released Illidan from millennia of imprisonment, hoping that the Betrayer would redeem himself by battling a returned Burning Legion. Though Illidan fought to defend his people, he soon slipped into darkness; after absorbing the energies of the demonic Skull of Gul'dan, Illidan became a demon, an act for which he was banished by Malfurion. Fleeing the wrath of the night elves, the twice- condemned Illidan allied himself once again with the only entity that would accept him—the Legion. Illidan's demonic masters sent him to destroy the Lich King, who had broken free of their influence, but Illidan failed to do so. To protect himself from the Legion's vengeance, Illidan hid on Outland, a destroyed world that he would seek to rule with the help of a few fellow Legion members-turned-outcasts. Illidan is a raid boss and the primary antagonist to the World of Warcraft expansion The Burning Crusade. He was slain by Maiev Shadowsong, his former jailer turned prisoner, in a coup d'état initiated by Akama and player adventurers. Illidan was featured in flashback quests in the two expansion packs immediately following The Burning Crusade. In Wrath of the Lich King, the player plays the role of Arthas in his duel with Illidan outside Icecrown Citadel (from the end of The Frozen Throne); in Cataclysm, the player takes the role of Illidan himself in the Felwood, claiming the Skull of Gul'dan and killing the demon Tichondrius (from Reign of Chaos). He also appears in the Well of Eternity dungeon released later in Cataclysm, where the players travel back in time 10,000 years to the end of the War of the Ancients. Illidan returns in Legion, the sixth expansion to World of Warcraft. A teaser cinematic shows Gul'dan from the alternate Draenor (shown in Warlords of Draenor) discovering Illidan's corpse encased in a crystal prison in the Vault of the Wardens. He appears briefly in cinematic cutscenes during the Demon Hunter introduction storyline (the first half of which begins shortly before Illidan's death in The Burning Crusade), sending his acolytes to a world called Mardum to retrieve a demonic artifact, the Sargerite Keystone, that would allow his forces to attack any world held by the Burning Legion. The Demon Hunters succeed and return to Outland, only to find Illidan has been slain; the Hunters are consequently imprisoned with Illidan's corpse in the Vault of the Wardens. A questline playable by all classes involves the naaru, crystalline beings that embody the Holy Light, seeking to resurrect Illidan as the chosen champion against the Legion. The player takes the role of Illidan during certain climactic battles in his past, including his death at the Black Temple. After Gul'dan's defeat, Illidan is freed from a crystal that Gul'dan had attempted to manipulate; Illidan then kills Gul'dan and challenges the players to join him in defeating the Burning Legion. Illidan is also involved in the final battle against Kil'jaeden aboard his Legion command ship in orbit of Argus, the former homeworld of the Draenei race. When Kil'jaeden is defeated, Illidan uses the Sargerite Keystone (reclaimed by Demon Hunter players in the Vault of the Wardens dungeon) to open a rift back to Azeroth, but the rift remains open, causing Argus to appear in the skies above. After arriving on Argus aboard the Draenei vessel, the Vindicaar, fighting off the Legion's initial attack and meeting up with Turalyon and Xe'ra's Army of the Light (to which Turalyon belongs), Illidan is brought before the Prime Naaru, Xe'ra. Xe'ra offers Illidan a chance to be reborn as a champion of the Light, the Naaru's Chosen One, but Illidan refuses, saying that his scars and his sacrifices make him who he is. Xe'ra restrains Illidan and attempts to force the Light upon him, but Illidan breaks free and destroys Xe'ra, angering Turalyon. He strikes at Illidan, but Illidan catches Turalyon's blade, stating there can be no chosen one for only they can save themselves. During the cinematic following the defeat of Argus the Unmaker, the last boss of Antorus: The Burning Throne, Illidan elects to remain behind with the resurrected titan Pantheon to act as Sargeras' jailer, saying that all he had done in his life had led up to that moment, to face Sargeras one last time. As Sargeras is pulled away from Azeroth, Illidan is last seen with blades in hand, standing before Sargeras' throne in the Seat of the Pantheon. He leaves behind a message crystal explaining his decision to Tyrande and Malfurion, as well as a final message to the player character, leaving Azeroth's future in their hands. = World of Warcraft: Illidan = In the novel World of Warcraft: Illidan, written by William King and published by Del Ray Books in April 2017, more details are revealed about Illidan's intentions than was revealed in The Burning Crusade game. The book's main story covers the time from six months before Illidan is slain by the WoW player characters until Illidan's demise. It covers the buildup of the Demon Hunter forces and Illidan's plans on how to defeat the Burning Legion. = Heroes of the Storm = Illidan appears as a playable character in the crossover video game Heroes of the Storm. He is a melee assassin hero, which trait reduces cooldowns of all his abilities by one second and heals him whenever he uses basic attacks. He also has the ability to move quickly to and jump over his foes, as well as to evade enemy basic attacks for short period of time. Illidan is a mobile, sustained damage assassin with very fast basic attacks and several \\"gap closers\\", who pairs well with heroes that can enable him. \\"Metamorphosis\\" is one of the two heroic abilities which transform Illidan into \\"demon form\\" at the target location. \\"The Hunt\\" is the second heroic ability which enables Illidan to charge to target unit, dealing damage on impact and stunning it. A talent upgrade, called \\"Demonic Form\\", allows Illidan to permanently remain in his \\"demon form\\", making him even more powerful by increasing his attack speed and reducing the duration of disabling effects. = Other appearances = Like many other prominent Warcraft characters, Illidan also appears as a collectible card in the game Hearthstone. Additionally, he also appears as an opponent the player must defeat in the tutorial phase of the game. Illidan also became the first hero character of Hearthstones tenth class, the Demon Hunter, to be introduced in the April 2020 expansion, Ashes of Outland.  Reception  The character has received mostly positive critical reception. Empire listed Illidan #17 on their list of \\"the 50 greatest video game characters\\", writing \\"Illidan was a force to be reckoned with. By the time you and 24 eager guildies had trekked to the heart of Shadowmoon Valley and stood (attuned) at the gates of the Black Temple, ready to face him, it was all the average warrior could do not to soil his chainmail pants.\\" He was also listed #5 on Matthew Rossi of Engadget's \\"Top 10 magnificent bastards of Warcraft\\", since \\"his actions during and after the war were instrumental in the defeat of the Legion and the preservation of magic. If not for Illidan, there would have been no Nordrassil and no Well atop Hyjal, and Hyjal itself would simply be a very tall mountain. Even after enduring a 10,000-year imprisonment for his actions, Illidan managed to take out a key presence in the Legion by himself and claimed the power of the Skull of Gul'dan in the process.\\" Rossi further wrote that \\"He is one of the greatest manipulators of arcane power ever to live, the first to ever seek to stalk and kill demons, a prodigy and a madman. He betrayed his own people in order to save them and the entire world, but he always served himself first. Selfish, mercurial, brilliant, resentful and tormented by himself, Illidan Stormrage helped make Azeroth everything it is today.\\" The encounter with Illidan at the Black Temple raid made the list in Digital Spy's \\"The 10 best moments from World of Warcraft's first decade\\", with Andy Joannou writing \\"Before then came Illidan, the final boss encounter for the Black Temple raid. A fan favourite, Black Temple is hailed as one of the raids to define World of Warcraft.\\" While criticising the constant killing off of villains in Warcraft, Rossi also thought that Illidan's death was unfortunate, as \\"touted and hyped as the major threat of The Burning Crusade, Illidan's death atop the Black Temple is a waste of a major lore figure not because the fight isn't worthy of him or the culmination of an entire tier of raiding, but because with the release of Sunwell Plateau we find that Illidan wasn't actually the major threat—in fact, he was a stewing, impotently insane figure obsessing over his defeat at the end of Warcraft III and it was Kil'Jaeden who posed the true threat all along.\\" Darren Brown of Engadget mentioned the character as one of the \\"ultimate boss encounter[s]\\" in Warcraft. Yannick Lejacq of Kotaku listed the references to the relationship between Tyrande and Illidan as one of the positive aspects of Heroes of the Storm, saying \\"Tyrande Whisperwind and Illidan Stormrage have a tenuous romantic past from their days together in World of Warcraft [...] It's a little nod to the World of Warcraft fans playing Heroes.\\" A popular character, Illidan has also often been featured in various merchandise related to the Warcraft franchise. This includes figurines of the character, as well as Halloween costumes. Illidan is also a popular character to cosplay as.

Following a 2003 feasibility study, the \\"European Global Education Peer Review Process\\" was established to increase and improve the provision of global education in Europe. GENE and the North-South Centre worked closely together to develop this process. The European Global Education Peer Review Process has, since late 2005, been facilitated by GENE, through its secretariat. The funding for the process and the peer review expertise has been provided by GENE participants. The key aim of the Europe-wide process is to increase and improve support for, access to, and the impact of global education in European countries. National reports, and the peer review processes leading to them, act as both a tool to enhance quality and impact nationally, and a mechanism for international comparative analysis, benchmarking and policy making. National reports To date 13 peer reviews have taken place. Estonia (2019), Cyprus (2017), Belgium (2016), Ireland (2015), Portugal (2013-14), Slovakia (2013-14), Norway (2009-10), Poland (2009-10), the Czech Republic (2008), Austria (2006), the Netherlands (2005), Finland (late 2004), and Cyprus (pilot review, early 2004). The first Global Education National Report, on Cyprus, was published in early 2004 as a pilot review being part of the initial feasibility study.

Domaine de Villarceaux, The manor and water garden The Domaine is currently managed by the Regional Council of the 'Île- de-France for 99 years, on an agreement with the owners of the domaine, the Fondation Charles Leopold Mayer. The park contains a manor house from the 16th century and a château in the style of Louis XV from the 18th century. The gardens are classified among the Notable Gardens of France. The gardens contain a rare 18th-century ornamental feature called a vertugadin (eng: farthingale), modelled after the hoop skirts of the 18th century, surrounded by statues brought from Italy.  History  The gardens are located on the site of a medieval castle from the 11th century, built to protect France from the British, who at that time occupied Normandy, the neighboring province. Many vestiges of the medieval fortifications remain in the park. A manor house and French water garden was built there in the 17th century. In the 18th century a château in the style of Louis XV was built on a rocky hill overlooking the water garden. One famous resident in the 17th century was Ninon de Lenclos, the author, courtesan, and patron of the arts. Another was Françoise d'Aubigné, the future Madame de Maintenon and future wife of King Louis XIV, who lived there after the death of her first husband, the poet Paul Scarron, at the invitation of her friends the Montchevreuil, cousins of the Marquis of Villarceaux. The Marquis fell in love with her, and commissioned a full-length portrait of her, nude, which greatly embarrassed her.L'allee du roi, souvenirs de Françoise d'Aubigne by Françoise Chandernagor The portrait can be seen today in the dining room of the house. The house also contains a collection of 18th-century furniture. The domaine has been classified as an historic monument of France since 1941.

It should not be confused with gauge theory gravity, which is a formulation of (classical) gravitation in the language of geometric algebra. Nor should it be confused with Kaluza–Klein theory, where the gauge fields are used to describe particle fields, and not gravity itself. Overview The first gauge model of gravity was suggested by Ryoyu Utiyama (1916–1990) in 1956R. Utiyama, \\"Invariant theoretical interpretation of interaction\\", Physical Review 101 (1956) 1597. just two years after birth of the gauge theory itself. However, the initial attempts to construct the gauge theory of gravity by analogy with the gauge models of internal symmetries encountered a problem of treating general covariant transformations and establishing the gauge status of a pseudo-Riemannian metric (a tetrad field). In order to overcome this drawback, representing tetrad fields as gauge fields of the translation group was attempted.F. Hehl, J. McCrea, E. Mielke, Y. Ne'eman, \\"Metric-affine gauge theory of gravity: field equations, Noether identities, world spinors, and breaking of dilaton invariance\\", Physics Reports 258 (1995) 1. Infinitesimal generators of general covariant transformations were considered as those of the translation gauge group, and a tetrad (coframe) field was identified with the translation part of an affine connection on a world manifold X. Any such connection is a sum K=\\\\Gamma + \\\\Theta of a linear world connection \\\\Gamma and a soldering form \\\\Theta= \\\\Theta_\\\\mu^a dx^\\\\mu\\\\otimes\\\\vartheta_a where \\\\vartheta_a=\\\\vartheta_a^\\\\lambda\\\\partial_\\\\lambda is a non-holonomic frame. For instance, if K is the Cartan connection, then \\\\Theta=\\\\theta=dx^\\\\mu\\\\otimes\\\\partial_\\\\mu is the canonical soldering form on X. There are different physical interpretations of the translation part \\\\Theta of affine connections. In gauge theory of dislocations, a field \\\\Theta describes a distortion.C. Malyshev, \\"The dislocation stress functions from the double curl T(3)-gauge equations: Linearity and look beyond\\", Annals of Physics 286 (2000) 249. At the same time, given a linear frame \\\\vartheta_a, the decomposition \\\\theta=\\\\vartheta^a\\\\otimes\\\\vartheta_a motivates many authors to treat a coframe \\\\vartheta^a as a translation gauge field.M. Blagojević, Gravitation and Gauge Symmetries (IOP Publishing, Bristol, 2002). Difficulties of constructing gauge gravitation theory by analogy with the Yang-Mills one result from the gauge transformations in these theories belonging to different classes. In the case of internal symmetries, the gauge transformations are just vertical automorphisms of a principal bundle P\\\\to X leaving its base X fixed. On the other hand, gravitation theory is built on the principal bundle FX of the tangent frames to X. It belongs to the category of natural bundles T\\\\to X for which diffeomorphisms of the base X canonically give rise to automorphisms of T.I. Kolář, P. W. Michor, J. Slovák, Natural Operations in Differential Geometry (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1993). These automorphisms are called general covariant transformations. General covariant transformations are sufficient in order to restate Einstein's general relativity and metric-affine gravitation theory as the gauge ones. In terms of gauge theory on natural bundles, gauge fields are linear connections on a world manifold X, defined as principal connections on the linear frame bundle FX, and a metric (tetrad) gravitational field plays the role of a Higgs field responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking of general covariant transformations.D. Ivanenko, G. Sardanashvily, \\"The gauge treatment of gravity\\", Physics Reports 94 (1983) 1. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a quantum effect when the vacuum is not invariant under the transformation group. In classical gauge theory, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs if the structure group G of a principal bundle P\\\\to X is reducible to a closed subgroup H, i.e., there exists a principal subbundle of P with the structure group H.L. Nikolova, V. Rizov, \\"Geometrical approach to the reduction of gauge theories with spontaneous broken symmetries\\", Reports on Mathematical Physics 20 (1984) 287. By virtue of the well-known theorem, there exists one-to-one correspondence between the reduced principal subbundles of P with the structure group H and the global sections of the quotient bundle . These sections are treated as classical Higgs fields. The idea of the pseudo- Riemannian metric as a Higgs field appeared while constructing non-linear (induced) representations of the general linear group , of which the Lorentz group is a Cartan subgroup.M. Leclerc, \\"The Higgs sector of gravitational gauge theories\\", Annals of Physics 321 (2006) 708. The geometric equivalence principle postulating the existence of a reference frame in which Lorentz invariants are defined on the whole world manifold is the theoretical justification for the reduction of the structure group of the linear frame bundle to the Lorentz group. Then the very definition of a pseudo-Riemannian metric on a manifold X as a global section of the quotient bundle leads to its physical interpretation as a Higgs field. The physical reason for world symmetry breaking is the existence of Dirac fermion matter, whose symmetry group is the universal two-sheeted covering of the restricted Lorentz group, .G.

After Southworth In August 1906, a group of Cleveland Baptists incorporated an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who was a Baptist. With the aid of local churches, the home was opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, the Baptist Home served fourteen residents at the end of 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000.United States Census Bureau.

The former Southworth residence was not long a retirement home: the Baptist Home moved to a new location in 1919 and sold the Southworth House in the same year. Since that time, the house has been used for a wide range of purposes. During the 1950s and 1960s, various businesses had offices in the house, which was then called the \\"Edelmar Building\\" or the \\"Accountants Building.\\" In 1973, the Southworth House was purchased by Pi Sigma Tau Alpha, a fraternity based at the nearby Cleveland State University; it later served as the fraternity house for Cleveland State's chapter of Delta Sigma Phi.

Founding and clients The firm was founded by two Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration officials, Francis M. Shea and Warner W. Gardner. After World War II, Shea and Gardner decided to form a firm with an unusual emphasis on the brilliance of the individual attorneys. Shea and Gardner became a highly respected Washington institution, known for its litigation, lobbying and regulatory expertise. Its client list included many regulated industries, including railways, insurance companies, mutual funds, maritime companies, mining companies and airlines. Notable clients included Prudential, American President Lines, Cassiar Mining, Fidelity Investments, Peadody Coal, Freeport-McMoRan, U.S. Gypsum, Newmont Mining, and the National Railway Labor Conference. The Firm also represented the Iraqi National Congress, a U.S.-supported opposition group. The firm registered as a foreign agent in order to represent the Iraqi exiles.Jim Lobe, 'New champions of the war cause,' Asia Times, Nov. 6 2002. Another notable representation was a successful challenge to the FDIC's brokered deposit regulations. During the late 1980s the firm handled major bank failure cases including First Republic(then the largest bank failure in US history) and Bank of New England. The firm was old fashioned in that many lawyers were generalists more than specialists. And although there were adjustments, compensation was largely tied to seniority. The firm did take on diverse and big projects, like emergency boards in railway labor disputes, cleanup of superfund sites, compliance programs to remediate legacy computer systems, and national asbestos-related litigation and claims. The firm prided itself on its pro bono work and generally left the selection of pro bono up to individual partners. One partner, William Sheehan, for example, was allowed to represent a Georgia inmate on death row. Another partner, Jeff Martin, was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's. The firm encouraged Martin 's advocacy for patients and Martin became Chairman of the Board of the Parkinson Action Network and a member of the NIH's National Advisory Council on Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Martin also litigated to uphold embryonic stem cell research and became a leading advocate for increased funding of medical research. The 2003 book \\"Merchants of Immortality\\", by prize-winning science writer Stephen Hall, describes Martin's activity in great detail. The firm supported those activities. Around 2003, despite strong financial performance,Shea & Gardner began to look for a merger partner in light of the changing marketplace for legal services and the challenges facing mid-sized firms. The partners settled on Goodwin Procter because that firm had a small Washington, D.C. office of only 12 attorneys and the legacy Shea partners could play a large role in shaping and growing the profile of the combined firm in the nation's capital.Lauren Bayne Anderson, 'D.C., Boston Law Firms to Merge,' Washington Post, July 14, 2004, E01. Shea and Gardner for many years hosted the offices of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless. Warner Gardner Warner Gardner's memoir, \\"Pebbles From the Path behind,\\" discloses that the ill-fated FDR court-packing scheme was a brainchild of his. During Gardner's last Supreme Court argument—which he won—Lockheed v. Thomas, Chief Justice Burger allowed Gardner to continue speaking a full five minutes after the red light went on, a gesture of respect virtually unprecedented. Frances Shea Shea was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, He was a son of New Hampshire state senator and attorney Michael Shea and Margaret (Muldoon) Shea. He attended and graduated from Dartmouth College (A.B., 1925) and Harvard Law School (LL.B., 1928). Following law school, Shea obtained, through a referral from his law school professor Felix Frankfurter, a position practicing law with a prominent attorney, John Lord O'Brian, in Buffalo, New York. From 1929-1933, Shea lived in Buffalo and practiced with the law firm of Slee, O'Brian, Hellings and Ulsh. During the Great Depression Shea served in many government posts.

It was at Wittemberge until 12 May and from 18 May to 15 June at the central railway station at Münster. Stop-overs in Cologne, Frankfurt, Dresden and Munich followed. From the 14 to 26 November, it was at the central railway station at Mannheim. The Deutsche Bahn estimated that by April 2008, 30,000 people had visited the exhibition. For the year 2008, around 80,000 visitors were expected. In 2009, the exhibition was planned to continue and be lent to cities which were interested. The first location was Hanau in January 2009. From 22 January, it was at Chemnitz, from 15 February at the Jewish Museum in Dorsten. The exhibition was designed by the Deutsche Bahn in cooperation with Beate and Serge Klarsfeld together with a cititzen's initiative, and included elements of the exhibition Enfants juifs déportés de France, which was shown for over three years in railway stations of the French SNCF. 15 of the 40 information boards are based on the collection of the French exhibition.  Discourse on the exhibition  Milles and Drancy internment camps in France Corpses of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto who died inside sealed boxcars before reaching Treblinka extermination camp, August 1942 The exhibition was preceded by a public argument between Beate and Serge Klarsfeld and the Deutsche Bahn after the company had refused to show the French exhibition at German railway stations. In an interview in November 2006, Hartmut Mehdorn, the chairman of the Deutsche Bahn, justified the refusal of the exhibition: \\"At railway stations, there is haste and hurry. They are not locations for a topic as serious as the Holocaust. There can't be any serious and deep study of such a topic at railway stations. We know our stations and the people who pass through them. I even tend towards saying that it would be counterproductive to realize it. \\"Shock and go\\" doesn't work any more.\\" Furthermore, he stated that the Deutsche Bahn \\"has portrayed its history in an exemplary manner compared with other big companies.\\" He referred to a permanent exhibition in the DB- museum Nuremberg which has 200,000 visitors per year, the participation at the \\"Entschädigungsfonds für ehemalige Zwangsarbeiter\\" (a fund which compensates former forced laborers), the education of the company's apprentices and its support of the movie \\"Der letzte Zug\\" (The last train). He claimed that Beate and Serge Klarsfeld had tried to \\"force the exhibition on the company\\". After the company had refused to let this happen, it claimed to have read in the press that it had tried to block the examination of the Nazi era. Mehdorn announced the establishment of a touring exhibition which should be located close to railway stations. On 1 December 2006, the German federal minister of transport, Wolfgang Tiefensee, and Mehdorn agreed upon the establishment of a touring exhibition about the deportations to be located at railway stations .

She was the fourth wife and widow of actor Hugh Lloyd. She grew up in Sheen in London, the second daughter of Margaret and Jack Davies, a bank manager. She attended the Richmond County School for Girls; wanting to be a journalist, she left school at 16 in order to train in shorthand and typing at the Anne Godden Secretarial College in Putney, where her mother was a teacher. These new skills obtained her an apprenticeship at the Kilburn Times. Having done work for the Sunday Mirror as a freelancer, Shan Davies, as she then was, started work at the Sunday People in 1976, eventually becoming Fleet Street's first female crime correspondent. She met Hugh Lloyd in 1978, at Allen's, a famous restaurant in London's West End, while he was performing in No Sex Please, We're British. Hugh Lloyd was already dining there when his friend waved to Shan Lloyd as she was entering the restaurant. The two soon realized that they lived around the corner from one another. Hugh Lloyd, who was in his fifties at the time of their first meeting, had already been married and divorced three times by this time. In his autobiography, Hugh Lloyd described his future wife as \\"a scatty, blondehaired Fleet Street tabloid journalist\\". Hugh and Shan married in 1983. They moved to Worthing, West Sussex, in 2003. Shan Lloyd continued to pursue a professional career as a freelance showbiz reporter for the Brighton and Hove Leader. In her later years, Lloyd became an active member of the Red Hat Society. Shan Lloyd died on 13 December 2008 at Worthing Hospital, 6 months after the death of her husband. She was 55.

Originally built as a TT racer, and Norton's first design of an overhead cam engine, it proved successful as a TT Replica road bike. After the early 1930s redesign of Norton's cammy models by Arthur Carroll, the CS1 became an upmarket road bike. The 500 cc CS1 and its smaller sibling 350 cc CJ1 continued on until the outbreak of WW2 in 1939. Many later touring CS1 models were upgraded for racing, by adding and subtracting all the optional racing bits for Internationals. The Norton catalog had a long list of such parts available. The identifying feature of 1930s CS1 Models is the stub fitted carburettor - Inter models had a bolt-on TT carburettor. Development The Norton Camshaft Senior Model 1 (CS1) engine was designed by Walter Moore in 1927, based on the Norton ES2 pushrod engine and re-using many parts. The frame was a new full cradle design and with a close-ratio kickstart-less gearbox, 8 inch brakes, Amal TT carburettor, Lucas Racing magneto and a 3 gallon petrol tank. The CS1 was the standard for racing Nortons for the next 20 years. The magneto was moved to the rear of the engine and the bottom end was a traditional Norton design, but in the side of the crankcase was the oil pump housing and a pair of bevel gears to drive the long shaft which ran in a tube up the side of the engine to a second pair of gears driving the overhead camshaft. Racing success Alec Bennett riding the CS1 on its first race won the Isle of Man Senior TT in 1927 and Stanley Woods set the fastest lap at 70.99 mph before retiring. Unknown rider Tim Hunt won the Amateur TT in following year on a Norton CS1, setting a new TT record. He later used the same motorcycle to win the Gold Medal in the Scottish Six Days Trial. In 1928 a Junior version of the CS1 with a 348cc engine and designated the Norton CJ was entered for the Isle of Man TT. The bore and stroke of this engine was 71 x 88 mm and it looked promising but 1928 proved to be an unlucky year for Norton, as there were technical problems with Walter Moore's redesigned cambox and only one major race was won that year. 1929 also went badly with reliability problems and only one win in the Spanish GP of 1929. In March 1931 on Pendine Sands Joe Craig and Tim Hunt achieved a best speed on the CS1 of 118 mph. Also in 1931 the Norton CS1 took the first five places in Junior and Senior events, starting what was to prove Norton’s most successful period, and until the end of the 1930s Norton dominated international events with wins in both classes throughout the decade. Tim Hunt became the first rider to win two TT races in one week, with success in the Junior TT Race in 3 h 34 min 21 s at an average speed of 73.4 mph and also the Senior TT Race in 3 h 23 min 28 s at an average speed of 77.90 mph.

The original members were Iain MacKenzie (rhythm guitar), Jimb (guitar), Chuckles the Clown (drums and voice), Greg Cruse (bass) and DJ Implant (voice and turntables). This incarnation was short-lived and Implant and Cruse left the band; Iain MacFrenzy assumed the position of lead vocalist and Nixo (bass) became a full- time member. The band expanded to include Mickey Bones (trombone, voice) and Tiny Tommy Toot-Fruit (Arif Driessen, trumpet and voice, now of UK/US ambient rock band *Shels). Toot Fruit left the band in 2008 to be replaced by T-Cass (trumpet, voice). The line-up at that time consisted of Iain MacFrenzy (rhythm guitar and voice), Chuckles The Clown (drums and voice), Jimb (lead guitar and voice), Oz (bass guitar and voice), Mickey Bones (trombone and voice) and T-Cass (trumpet and voice).thedisplayteam.com, The Display Team website, retrieved 26 December 2008 This personnel recorded the album, Drones, in mid-2008 which was released on the Genin label - home of Djevara, Elephant Vs Leopard, Thumpermonkey, Claypigeon, Frowser and Pigshakle - on 1 February 2010. Due to his commitments elsewhere, T-Cass left in early 2010 to play in alt-rock band They Came From Japan, and was replaced by Samwise, formerly of ska-punk band The Lovespuds, at the end of April. In November 2012, Joshing joined the band on guitar and voice, replacing MacFrenzy who had departed in 2011. In 2014, the band successfully led a crowd-funding campaign to record a new album, entitled \\"Shifts\\", which was released in April 2016 on their own label, \\"Opposing Forces\\". Produced by the band and Paul \\"Tip-top, you don't stop, tip 'o the morning to you, day-tipping\\" Tipler, who also engineered the album, this was the last foray for Ozrick, who subsequently left the band in 2016 and was replaced by Stanley Elvis. Since then, the band has continued to rehearse and write in anticipation for a new release, as well as perform with artists such as Babar Luck, the Perhaps Contraption, and scando-prog allstars Major Parkinson.

Early life William Woodworth was born around 1780, probably in Massachusetts. He later moved to Hudson, New York where he was a carpenter and carriage maker. He worked on the Livingston family estate as a superintendent of their mill.Early American, p. 296 He was the father of William W. Woodworth. Woodworth Planing Machine Drawing of the Woodworth Planing and Matching Machine as seen in patent USI1X0005315. After spending years working around wood, Woodworth would design and then patent the Woodworth Planing Machine in 1828.Early American, p. 295 Hailed as the greatest improvement to the planing machine so far and one of the most important inventions of the century, it added speed and efficiency to the process of creating lumber for domestic usage.Great Inventions, p. 303Descendants, p. 101 The invention could perform the output of 25 laborers, cheapened finished lumber, and greatly increased the supply.Footprints, p. 516 In 1829, the Franklin Institute praised the invention.Early American, p. 300 The United States Congress would praise the invention in 1850 along with Eli Whitney's Cotton Gin as the great labor savings inventions of the country. =Patent law impact= The Woodworth planing machine had a direct impact on patent law in the United States. Because Woodworth and his heirs repeatedly attempted, and succeeded many times in having the patent extended by Congress, it was attacked politically as a monopoly. Woodworth's heirs were subjected to one of the earlier special interest, community organizing campaigns in the country, as lumber merchants and carpenters, growing tired of paying a royalty to Woodworth's heirs, mounted a public campaign to have the extension of the patent blocked.Early American, p. 313 The Patent Law of 1836 allowed for inventors to receive a seven-year extension after the expiration of the 14-year term permitted at that time. In 1842, Woodworth's son William W. received an extension, and successfully lobbied Congress in 1845 for another extension, thus extending the patent until 1856.Early American, p. 312 William W. then petitioned Congress in 1850 for another full-term extension, which would have allowed a claim until 1870. This resulted in a public firestorm, leading to mass protests and accusations of monopolization and fraud.Early American, p. 314 The city leadership of Philadelphia organized a mass meeting rallying support against Woodworth's heirs. Literature from Philadelphia against the patent extension showed up in Harrisburg, in which the State Assembly demanded their federal representatives block Woodworth's attempt. It was noted that much of the anti-Woodworth literature was printed, rather than written, indicating an orchestrated community organizing effort to block Congressional legislation extending the patent. Many letters were associated with the special interest groups against Woodworth's heirs, such as the \\"Select and Common Councils, Board of Trade, Wardens of the Port, Aldermen, and Recorder\\", as well as from 14 commissioners of the Northern Liberties district and 15 commissioners from the Spring Garden district in Philadelphia. Another group called the \\"Builders and Lumbers Group\\" was documented as lobbying against the extension. The letters against the Woodworth heirs also flooded into the Congressional patent committees from all over the country during the 1850, 1852, and 1854 sessions.Early American, p. 315 The Woodworth heirs had their own set of supporters ranging from lawyers, editors, doctors, and treasurers, with their letters handwritten, indicating a genuine concern about the protection of inventors' rights and reward for their heirs of their labor and genius. They also had their supporters in Congress, who reintroduced the legislation that would have granted the extension during every session after the request was made.Early American, p. 316 The Woodworth heirs' stake in the extension was enormous, along with other patent assignees, as the patent generated $15 million annually in royalties, including $2.1 million over 24 years for one assignee named James G. Wilson. Ultimately in 1856 the patent expired following Congress's failure to grant the extension. The Woodworth episode, coupled with other patent issues, resulted in patent law amendments passed in 1861 that extended the term of claims from 14 years to 17, without the possibility of further extensions.

During its heyday the club staged concerts by performers including Louis Armstrong, Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Roy Orbison, Eartha Kitt, Morecambe and Wise, Gene Pitney, Neil Sedaka, Ken Dodd and many more. At the peak of its success, the club had 300,000 members. It closed in about 1978 and reopened as \\"Crumpets\\" night club. It closed again shortly afterwards and its contents were auctioned off. It reopened as \\"The Frontier\\" in the early 1980s and this eventually closed in 2016. On hearing the news that the building was no longer to be used as a venue, singer Shirley Bassey commented, \\"I have many happy memories of singing at the Batley Variety Club so sorry to hear it is closing.\\" The building was converted to a gym in 2017. Origins The club was designed and built by James and Betty Corrigan in early 1967 on top of a disused sewage site on Bradford Road in Batley. The build took three months from start to finish, with floodlights erected so construction workers could work through the night to hit the deadline for opening on Easter Sunday. The build was interrupted when local authority inspectors discovered that the building was six inches too close to the road. Demolition took place and work continued but, despite this setback, the club managed to open on 27 March 1967 as planned. The headline act on opening night was The Bachelors. James and Betty Corrigan had traveled to Las Vegas to research how the clubs worked there in order to work out a design for Batley. The ground floor of the club was excavated so that on entering, the public would walk down to their tables which would be arranged in tiers, five in all, forming a horseshoe embracing the stage from the bottom up, thus giving the audience unobstructed views. The ceilings were low, offering an intimate atmosphere, and the resident band was situated at the back of the stage rather than in a traditional orchestra pit so that the artistes could be closer to the audience. The club held 1,750 people seated, with standing room for more, and it was this large capacity which facilitated low admission prices for top quality acts. Food was served in baskets with plastic cutlery to avoid clinking noises that could disturb the acts on stage. There were two long bars than ran down either side of the club. Heyday The club was known as the ‘Las Vegas of the North’ and attracted the best acts in show business, both from the UK and USA. Proprietor James Corrigan traveled with booking agent Bernard Hinchcliffe to the USA to attract major acts, and famously offered Dean Martin's manager £45,000 for a booking, but the manager replied that Martin wouldn't 'get out of bed for a piss for that amount'. Undeterred, Corrigan and Hinchliffe travelled to New York to meet Joe Glaser of Associated Booking Corporation and secured the booking of Louis Armstrong for £27,000. Corrigan revealed this figure to the press and later claimed that this was a big mistake as it led other agents to believe that 'Batley had very deep pockets' and would ask for bigger fees for their artists and subsequently cause problems for the club. When Corrigan traveled to Capri to bring Gracie Fields out of semi-retirement to play at the club, Fields asked Cilla Black what fee she thought she should ask for. Cilla Black’s husband Bobby Willis recommended that she asked for 'the same as Satchmo got'. The format of the nights would generally be a specialty support act followed by the headline act, and all would be held together by a compère. The regular compère at Batley Variety Club was Jerry Brooke. Headline artists would be booked for a week-long run, from Sunday night to the following Saturday, sometimes longer. The biggest draw to the club, Shirley Bassey, was sometimes booked for three-week runs. Many of the artistes stayed as guests of the Corrigans at their home in Batley, Oaks Cottage. Dame Vera Lynn and Eartha Kitt cooked for their hosts. During her stay in Batley, Eartha Kitt sampled tripe at the local market and joined the shoppers in a chorus of \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\". During one of Shirley Bassey's appearances, James Corrigan invited her out for dinner, and she got dressed up in a fur coat thinking she was being taken to a restaurant, but instead it was a fish and chip shop she was driven to in the back of Corrigan's Rolls-Royce. The club acted as a boost to the local economy, with nearby restaurants, flower shops, clothes shops and taxi firms benefiting financially from the attraction of the club. Roy Orbison's album Live From Batley Variety Club was recorded on 9 May 1969. It was re-released as Roy Orbison - Authorized Bootleg Collection by Orbison Records in 1999. BBC Radio recorded a performance from the first week of Gracie Fields' first performance, which was broadcast on 5 January 1969, and Philips made a recording of a performance from the second week, with a view to a commercial issue, which Fields later rejected. Her original Philips demonstration disc is now part of a private Gracie collection. The only song not broadcast by the BBC was Fields’ encore of \\"There'll Always Be an England\\". Some of the recording made by the BBC was later issued on the album, The Best of the BBC Broadcasts. In 1974, Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees met his future wife Yvonne Spenceley while he was playing at the club and she was working as a waitress. Gibb said \\"I just saw her eyes and said to myself, 'This is the woman I'm going to marry'.\\" A week later Spenceley handed in her notice at the club and announced she was going on tour with the band. In 1977 the club hosted Katharine, Duchess of Kent for a charity night to raise funds for the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Appeal. Closure Batley Variety Club closed its doors for the final time in 1978 when James and Betty Corrigan separated. The club re-opened briefly as ‘Crumpets’ night club by Betty Corrigan and her son Jamie, before reopening as the Frontier Club in the early 1980s. The Frontier remained open until 2016. The building still stands and has been converted to a gym. There is a campaign for civic recognition for the contribution that James Corrigan and Batley Variety Club made to the area. A Facebook group has been created to facilitate patrons of the club to share their memories. King of Clubs The 2017 published book, King of Clubs, by Maureen Prest, told the inside story of James Corrigan and Batley Variety Club. Prest was the promotions manager at the club and a lifelong friend of Corrigan. The book told the story of Corrigan's early life on a travelling fairground, the development of the Batley Variety Club and his turbulent marriage to Betty. Prest describes the book as 'A story of rags to riches and back to rags. With a twist.'

Christoph Merian (22 January 1800 – 22 August 1858) was a banker and businessman. He was the owner of a large estate, agriculturist and rentier. He was one of the richest Swiss men of that time. He was honorary citizen of Münchenstein (1854) and the canton of Basel-Country (1855) and the founder of the Christoph Merian Stiftung.Leitbild der Christoph Merian Stiftung, 2007, S. 4. Biography Christoph Merian stemmed from the Merian family, one of the most distinguished aristocrat families in Basel. He was the son of Christoph Merian senior (1769–1849) and Valeria Hoffmann (1773–1834) and married in 1824 to Margarethe Burckhardt (1806–1886) from Basel. His father, Christoph Merian senior, was a merchant who started with handling raw cotton, later with shipping/transport, banking and various speculative businesses. Christoph Merian senior ended his venturous businesses in 1810 and subsequently invested in the industry and banking activities. Christoph Merian was educated in Basel. He served his apprenticeship as banker. He also visited the \\"Landwirtschaftliches Institut Hofwil\\" (agricultural institute of Hofwil) near Berne and the \\"Landwirtschaftliche Akademie\\" (agricultural academy) in Hohenheim by Stuttgart. His education as an Agronomist was concluded in England and France. He lived as a banker, businessman and agriculturist on the farming estate of Brüglingen in Münchenstein near Basel. He achieved large financial gains with his firm \\"Frères Merian\\" in by-passing the Napoleonic Continental System. In 1824 he married Margarethe Burckhardt, the daughter of an industrial. As a wedding present, they received the country estate in Brüglingen and the country house Villa Merian. Today, he is remembered mainly for founding the Christoph Merian Stiftung, a highly visible non-profit entity that continues to support social, cultural, ecological and economic projects to the benefit of the general population in the Basel region to this day. As of 2006, its worth was 289 Million Swiss Francs, in addition to the 900 ha of land it owns. The institution was founded in Christoph Merian's Testament (dated 26.03.1857), in which he made an endowment/beneficence to the city of Basel. This came into legal effect when his widow Margaretha (1806-1886) died on 3 May 1886.

History The mosque was built in 1758 by the Arab ruler of Acre, Zahir al-Umar. It was built in a courtyard on the site of a structure commissioned by the Crusaders and which later became the gate to the Genoaese quarter of the city. Up until 1746, the structure was used as a synagogue by Acre's Jewish residents,Sharon, 1997, p. 38. called the Ramchal Synagogue. The Jews still owned the building when Zahir chose to transform it into a mosque, but compensated them with a different building located in Acre's Jewish quarter. Leftover features of the synagogue include the niche for the Holy Ark and inscriptions in Hebrew. Architecture The mosque is positioned along the edge of Acre's Old City market, situated between Khan al-Umdan and Khan al-Ifranj, and is risen over the street. From the outside, the main indicators of the mosque are its low- lying dome and the round base of its former minaret. The mosque's entrance is located beneath the original minaret's base. This minaret was demolished by the municipality of Acre in 1950, citing a public safety risk. The body of the mosque is mainly constituted by a large, square-shaped prayer hall, A triple- domed portico precedes the prayer hall's entrance. Beside the prayer hall is a smaller room that is currently used as a library. A stairway beneath a covered entryway leads into the courtyard.

(Ireland ca 1775 — Philadelphia, 18 September 1816) was an Irish-American horticulturist settled in Philadelphia, who served as one of the stewards of the plant collections from the Lewis and Clark expedition and was the author of The American Gardener's Calendar: Adapted to the Climates and Seasons of the United States (1806 and following years).Ann Leighton, American Gardens in the Eighteenth Century: 'For Use or for Delight' (University of Massachusetts Press) 1986, pp319–322; Allen Lacy explores the Calendar in his essay \\"Bernard M'Mahon's Declaration of Independence\\", collected in Farther Afield: A Gardener's Excursions (Macmillan) 1986. He circulated the first extensive gardener's seed list in the United States, which he attached as an appendix to his Calendar. McMahon's most enduring contribution was his Calendar, the most comprehensive gardening book published in the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century.(Mann Library, Cornell University) \\"Harvest of Freedom: The history of Kitchen Gardens in America\\" It finished in its eleventh edition in 1857. It was modeled on a traditional English formula, of month-by-month instructions on planting, pruning, and soil preparation for the \\"Kitchen Garden, Fruit Garden, Orchard, Vineyard, Nursery, Pleasure Ground, Flower Garden, Green House, Hot house and Forcing Frames\\". In some particulars, McMahon followed his English models so closely that J. C. Loudon suggested in 1826 that the derivative character of the Calendar was such that \\"We cannot gather from the work any thing as to the extent of American practice in these particulars.\\"(Thomas Jefferson Center) Peter J. Hatch \\"Bernard McMahon, Pioneer American Gardener\\" 1993 Ann Leighton notes the absence of Indian corn among the \\"Seeds of Esculent Vegetables\\" in 1806, though he lists old-fashioned favorites like coriander, corn-salad, orach, rampion, rocambole and skirret.Leighton 1986:320 McMahon emigrated in 1796. By 1800 he was in Philadelphia, working for William Duane and the newspaper the Aurora. He entered the nursery and seed business by 1802-1803, when he issued his broadsheet Catalogue of Garden Grass, Herb, Flower, Tree & Shrub-Seeds, Flower Roots, &c; which comprised 720 species and varieties of seed. This was the first published seed list in the United States. In 1804 he published another catalogue, of thirty pages, mostly devoted to native American seeds.(Thomas Jefferson Center) \\"Bernard McMahon, Pioneer American Gardener\\" Through the Calendar McMahon was Thomas Jefferson's gardening mentor; a steady stream of correspondence passed between them. Jefferson selected him in 1806 as one of two nurserymen to receive and grow the seeds and roots collected by Lewis and Clark.(American Horticultural Society) Rita Pelczar, \\"The Plants of Lewis and Clark\\" , The American Gardener, November/December 2000. In 1807, when it came time to find a draftsman to illustrate the published journals of Lewis and Clark, it was M'Mahon who recommended the German-born botanist Frederick Pursh, who found himself with the botanical materials when the natural history publication did not materialize, and took them with him to London, where he published 130 plants from the Lewis and Clark expedition in Flora Americae Septentrionalis, 1813.(American Horticultural Society) Rita Pelczar, \\"A Tale of Specimens Lost and Found\\" , The American Gardener, November/December 2000. Jefferson received from McMahon seeds for Monticello. In 1808 McMahon purchased twenty acres on the Germantown Road, in Penn Township, Philadelphia for a nursery and botanic garden that would enable him to expand his business. He named it “Upsal Botanic Garden” in commemoration of Linnaeus' connection with Uppsala University. It was located at the north edge of the then urban part of the city. Part of the M’Mahon garden is currently occupied by Fotterall Square, a small park in Philadelphia. In 1818 botanist Thomas Nuttall complimented McMahon's role in bestowing the genus name Mahonia on a group of West Coast broadleaf-evergreen shrubs still popular in American gardens. McMahon, growing the seedlings that were protected from commerce as Federal property, had the mortification to see published in British journals, and to see Mahonia nervosa itself introduced by Prince Nurseries, Flushing, Long Island, at twenty dollars a plant.Leighton 1986:319. At his death the nursery business was left to his wife, Ann McMahon (d. 1818), and their son, Thomas P. M'Mahon, who continued to revise and republish The American Gardener's Calendar.

Technical information The Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX DG HSM is constructed with a plastic body and a metal mount. This lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 1.4 gives the lens the ability to create shallow depth-of- field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains eight lens elements, including one aspherical lens element. This lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a ring USM motor. Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the outer body barrel is longer than the inner lens barrel, when the inner lens barrel is at its longest extension. This results in the lens maintaining the same overall length no matter where the point of focus lies.Sigma Corporation of America 50mm F1.4 EX DG HSM When used on a digital crop body with a field of view compensation factor of 2× (Four Thirds body), it provides a field of view equivalent to a 100 mm lens mounted in a 35 mm body.

The episode first aired in the United States on November 5, 2000, on the Fox Network. It was written by executive producer and series creator Chris Carter, and directed by Kim Manners. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.5 and was watched by 15.87 million viewers, marking a slight increase from the previous season's finale \\"Requiem\\". \\"Within\\" was largely well-received by critics, although some fans felt alienated by the addition of Robert Patrick to the cast. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode—continuing from the seventh season finale \\"Requiem\\" when Mulder was abducted by aliens who are planning to colonize Earth—an FBI taskforce is organized to hunt for Mulder but Scully suspects the taskforce leader, Special Agent John Doggett (Patrick), and instead chooses to search for her lost partner with Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Scully and Skinner travel to Arizona, only to be followed by Doggett's task force. There, they find Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) and someone who they believe may very well be Mulder. \\"Within\\" was a story milestone for the series. It introduced several new character changes for the season, including the departure of Mulder and the inclusion of Doggett as a main character to the cast. The episode was written as a way to both explain Mulder's absence as well as appease fans who would otherwise lament the loss of Duchovny. \\"Within\\" also marked the first major change to the opening credits since the show first started, with new images and updated photos for David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, and the addition of Robert Patrick. \\"Within\\" has been analyzed due to its themes of death and resurrection. In addition, the experiments performed on Mulder after his abduction have been thematically compared to the Crucifixion of Jesus.  Plot  Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) has been deeply distraught since Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) was abducted by aliens. One morning, she arrives in her partner's office to find it being searched by FBI agents. Scully subsequently learns that the Bureau's newly promoted deputy director, Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), has launched a manhunt in search for Mulder. The investigation is being led by an FBI special agent named John Doggett. Scully and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) are taken to the task force's field office to be questioned, despite protests that they would be the most qualified to lead the manhunt themselves. As Skinner is being interrogated, Scully is accosted by an unnamed person who starts asking her about Mulder. When Scully finds out that he is actually Doggett (Robert Patrick), she angrily throws water in his face and leaves. Back at her apartment, Scully runs a background check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside the window to see if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that he had seen Mulder. Meanwhile, Skinner visits the Lone Gunmen, who are monitoring UFO activity in the United States in the hopes of tracking down Mulder. Skinner later finds out that someone has used Mulder's FBI pass to gain access to the X-Files, and that the Bureau task force considers him the main suspect. Meanwhile, Doggett has gathered enough evidence to track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona, is found by the Lone Gunmen. Concurrently, Doggett receives information about Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) when someone slips his file under his door. Scully and Skinner leave for Arizona without giving any of their information to Doggett. At the same time, Doggett believes that to find Mulder they must first find the whereabouts of Praise. They locate him in Flemingtown, Arizona, at a remote school for the deaf. By the time Doggett's taskforce arrives, he has already escaped via a window and is leaving for a desert hill top with another person: Mulder.  Production  Casting and development = Robert Patrick made his first appearance with \\"Within.\\" The seventh season was a time of closure for The X-Files. Characters within the show were written out, including The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and Mulder's mother (Rebecca Toolan), and several plot threads were resolved, including the fate of Fox Mulder's sister Samantha. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season, contributing to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, and so Carter wrote \\"Requiem\\", the final episode of season seven, as a possible series finale. But seeing as how there was still interest from the Fox network in making an eighth season, Carter also sought to construct the finale in such a way that it could segue into another season. However, the producers found it difficult to convincingly write Duchovny's character out of the script, and explain Mulder's absence in the episodes of the upcoming season. Eventually, it was decided that Mulder's character would be abducted by aliens in \\"Requiem\\", thereby leaving it open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year. When an eighth season was green-lit, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, including Lou Diamond Phillips, Hart Bochner, and Bruce Campbell. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode \\"Terms of Endearment\\", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, \\"I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party.\\" Later in Campbell's satirical autobiography Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way (2005), he joked that Patrick \\"stiffed him out of the role\\".Campbell (2005), p. 9 In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast due to his role in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), as Fox believed he would attract 18- to 35-year-old males to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in this demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.Kessenich (2002), p. 144 =Writing and filming= Carter was inspired to write the scene in which Scully splashes water into Doggett's face, since he was aware that Patrick would be facing opposition from some members of the fan community.Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 185–86 The scene was even the first filmed, in order to truly introduce Patrick to the series. After the conclusion of The X-Files in 2002, Patrick commented that this part of the episode had been his favorite scene in the series, and admitted that he could not think of a better way to introduce his character. Tom Braidwood, who appears in this episode as long- running recurring character Frohike, similarly remarked that the first meeting of Doggett and Scully was one of his favorite scenes from the entire series. Both Robert Patrick and the director of this episode, Kim Manners, felt that it was the perfect way to introduce John Doggett, and that Patrick injected a new \\"sense of energy\\" into the show, since it had basically used the same characters for the first seven years. Because the script of the episode does not specify the identity of the person who slides a file about Gibson Praise under Doggett's door, Kim Manners later had to ask the writers who the mysterious visitor was; the director was eventually told by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz that the unseen person was actually Kersh. Robert Patrick asked the same question of Manners, but the director—not yet sure of the answer himself and hoping to avoid looking foolish—never gave the actor an answer. Patrick thought the reason that Manners was being purposefully secretive was that the director wanted Patrick to still \\"be in wonderment\\" as to the mysterious visitor's identity, thereby aiding his performance. On the audio commentary for \\"Within\\", Manners teased Patrick that the reason he had not answered the question was that he had not liked Patrick at the time. Kersh's actions are later revealed and explained in the ninth season premiere \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\". On the episode's commentary, Patrick revealed that he was \\"nervous\\" for the shooting of the episode, since he was a big fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of its cast. Before shooting the episode, Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in \\"good shape\\". The majority of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed in and around the Los Angeles, California, area.Fraga (2010) The ending of the episode, as well as a majority of its follow-up \\"Without\\" were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park.Fraga (2010), p. 181 According to producer Paul Rabwin, an \\"incredible heat wave\\" hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a \\"one in twenty-five\\" chance that someone would be bit by a rattlesnake. Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes all he could think about was stumbling upon a snake. Jim Engh, a member of the production crew of The X-Files, died during the filming of this episode via electrocution, an accident that injured six other crew members. This episode was dedicated to his memory. The original opening visual sequence for the show had been made in 1993 for the first season and remained unchanged until \\"Within\\". The opening sequence then was modified to include new images, updated FBI badge photos for Duchovny and Anderson, as well as the addition of Patrick to the main cast. (Duchovny would only be featured in the opening credits when he appeared in an episode.) The opening also contains images that allude to Scully's pregnancy and, according to Frank Spotnitz, show an \\"abstract\\" explanation for Mulder's absence, with him falling into an eye. Themes right As The X-Files entered into its eighth season, \\"human resurrection and salvation\\" as well as \\"disease, suffering, and healing\\" became an increasingly central focus of the show. \\"Within\\", along with various other episodes during the eighth season of the show, would be the first to explore themes of birth, death and resurrection. The sub-theme of birth first emerged in this episode during Scully's opening dream of an abducted Mulder, which \\"invok[es] strong birth imagery of the amniotic sack and fluid.\\"Bush (2008), p. 147 Then later in the episode, the themes of death and resurrection are touched upon when Scully is shown Mulder's tombstone. This arc would continue in \\"The Gift\\", where Mulder's inoperable brain tumor and the resurrection of John Doggett is explored. In \\"Deadalive\\", the theme reappears in full-force: Billy Miles is found dead but resurrects, Mulder is buried for three months, and later, is brought back to life. This sub-theme would continue well into the ninth season, in entries such as \\"Audrey Pauley\\".Kellner (2003), p. 155. The episode is one of many to feature Mulder as a Christ-like figure. These comparisons were first purposely inserted during the seventh season episode \\"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati\\", in which Mulder is placed on a cross-like table, symbolic of the wooden cross that Jesus was nailed to.Donaldson (2011), p. 186Donaldson (2011), p. 209 Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X notes that Mulder's torture scenes in \\"Within\\" bear a resemblance to the Crucifixion of Jesus. She argues that the metal bars piercing his wrists and ankles are similar to the nails that held Jesus, the metal straps imbedded in his head are similar to the Crown of Thorns, and that his vivisection is reminiscent of the wound made by the Holy Lance. Furthermore, Bush parallels Jesus' \\"horrific death in order to rise again\\" to Mulder's abduction, death, and resurrection later on in \\"Deadalive\\", which would further make allusions to the Christ-like nature of Mulder.Donaldson (2011), p. 11Bush (2008), p. 148  Reception Ratings= \\"Within\\" first aired on Fox on . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.5, meaning that it was seen by 9.5% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 9.58 million households and 15.87 million viewers. The episode marked an 11% decrease from the seventh season opener, \\"The Sixth Extinction\\", but a slight increase over the seventh season finale \\"Requiem\\", which was viewed by 15.26 million viewers.Shapiro (2000), p. 281 As soon as both \\"Within\\" and Without\\" were completed, Carter screened them at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The two were played back-to-back \\"like a feature film\\", according to Patrick. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"The new case is a manhunt. The new agent is a mystery. The new X-File is Mulder.\\" The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 – Colonization, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist's plans to take over the earth. =Reviews= Overall, the episode received positive reviews from critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a rare \\"A+\\". The entry's follow-up, \\"Without\\", would also receive a second \\"A+\\", making them the only two episodes of The X-Files to receive the prestigious rating from the site. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an A-. He said that Patrick's portrayal of Doggett was \\"hardboiled alertness,\\" giving mostly positive reviews about his inclusion. Furthermore, he noted that Anderson enacted all \\"her queasiness\\" in this episode and its follow-up, \\"Without\\". Tom Janulewicz from Space.com also reacted positively toward the episode, enjoying the idea of making the character of Skinner into a \\"true\\" believer. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized both the unnatural elongation of Scully's pregnancy and the glimpses of Mulder that are shown, calling both \\"little more than lip-service.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that \\"the episode sings when it reinvents the old and introduces the new.\\" However, Shearman and Pearson criticized the bringing back of Gibson Praise, noting that \\"the return of Gibson Praise almost derails the episode altogether […] he only manages to make an episode that seemed as if it was giving The X-Files a bold new beginning feel like it's about to offer more of the same old stooge.\\"Shearman and Pearson (2009), p. 239 Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a moderately positive review of the episode. He noted, \\"In many ways, 'Within' reminded us why we tune into The X-Files every week. However, it also reminded us why the road ahead will be difficult. Fox Mulder may be gone, but he will never be forgotten. Or replaced.\\"Kessenich (2002), p. 153 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote that both \\"Within\\" and \\"Without\\" form \\"a great way to pick up after the cliffhanger ending of the previous season\\" and that \\"the pair of episodes [...] work well as an introduction to the new narrative status quo.\\" He awarded both entries a \\"B+\\" and praised the characterization of Doggett, writing that \\"Robert Patrick brings a distinct, charismatic energy to the part.\\" However, he was slightly critical of some of the episode's features, such as the \\"trope\\" of Scully being sad or \\"melodramatic gloom and overheated monologues\\". Some fans, however, criticized the introduction of Doggett; claiming that the character had been intentionally created to replace Mulder. Carter responded to this in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR) by stating, \\"What he brings is a different approach to The X-Files. First of all, he’s a knee jerk skeptic so he couldn’t be more different than the character of Mulder. He’s an insider at the FBI, well liked, has buddies. Mulder, of course, he’s been banished to the basement along with all of his X-files. So when he’s put together with Agent Scully, who has become something of a reluctant believer, the dynamic on the show changes completely\\".

It has been dated paleographically to the 9th or 10th century).  Description  The codex contains the entire New Testament with only one lacuna (Matthew 1:23-2:16). The books follow in this rather strange order: Gospels, Acts, Catholic epistles, Revelation of John, Pauline epistles. The text is written in one column per page, 29-33 lines per page. The tables of the (tables of contents) are placed before each book, the Eusebian Canon tables, numbers of the (chapters) at the margin, the at the top of the pages, a division according to the Ammonian Sections, with a references to the Eusebian Canons, and the Euthalian Apparatus. There are marginal commentaries on the Gospels (Chrystostomos), Acts and Epistles; only the Book of Revelation lacks commentaries.

Aleksej Vladimirovich Vysotsky (Алексе́й Владимирович Высоцкий) (18 July 1919 in Kiev – 28 October 1977 in Moscow) was a Soviet Union journalist and author, as well as a hero of World War II who attained the rank of Colonel.  Biography Childhood= Alexey Vysotsky was born in Kiev into an educated Jewish family. His father was Volf Shliomovich Vysotsky (born 1889 in Brest-Litovsk— died 1962 in Moscow) immortalized as \\"Velvl\\" in a song by his nephew Vladimir Vysotsky), who was from a family of glass blowers. Volf had studied in a commercial school in Lublin from where he moved in 1911 to live in Kiev and study at the Kiev branch of the Odessa commercial institute contemporarily with the Soviet journalist, playwright, and short story writer Isaac Babel, then studied with the faculty of law of Kiev University. During Lenin's New Economic Policy he organised a workshop for manufacture of theatrical make-up and a law office. Alexey Vysotsky's mother, Dora Ovseevna Vysotsky (née Dora Ovseevna Bronstein, the foster daughter of physician to the Kremlin, Lev Grigorievich Levin) was born 1891 in Zhytomyr and died 1970 in Kiev. She was the birth daughter of a deceased teacher at the state Jewish school, and finished her coursework to qualify as a physician's assistant (Feldsher) and worked as a pharmacist, and subsequently as a cosmetician. In 1926 the family relocated to Moscow; after the divorce of his parents Alexey Vysotsky initially lived in Moscow with his father, but beginning in the 1930s relocated to Kiev with his mother. During his school days Vysotsky was friends with Gulya Korolova and Alyosha Pyatakov (the son of Georgy Pyatakov, who was tried for anti-Soviet activity, sentenced to death and executed in 1937), his memoirs were included under the pseudonym L.J. Prajs in Elena Ilina's book \\"Fourth Height\\". =Red Army service during the German-Soviet War= In 1939 Vysotsky studied at the Podolsk artillery school. He was called to active duty in the Red Army that same year as the commander of an artillery platoon of 165th Howitzer Artillery Regiment, which took part in operations of the Soviet-Finnish Winter War. In 1941, after completing school he participated in the German-Soviet War (Eastern Front of World War II). As a part of 18th Guards Artillery Regiment he participated in defense of Odessa, Kerch and Sevastopol, as well as military operations on Don River and in the North Caucasus. He was then ordered to join the artillery battery of 265th Artillery Regiment of 3rd Ukrainian Front. In the autumn of 1943 he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, serving first as Chief of Staff of 124th Howitzer Artillery Brigade of the 20th Heavy Artillery Division reserves at General headquarters and then with the 6th Artillery Division of the Reserve Supreme Main Command (RVGK) on the 1st Belorussian Front. He participated in the liberation of Ukraine and Poland from German forces, as well as the final capture of Berlin. He appeared several times in war reports from the front, as printed in the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner three times for extraordinary accomplishments of military valor during combat operations, including for the defense of Odessa in 1941 and the defense of Sevastopol in 1942. =Post-German-Soviet War service= After the termination of the German-Soviet War military operations, he remained on active service in Germany. In 1949 he was posted to serve as commanding officer of the Haisyn operations section in Ukraine. In 1951 he was posted to Mukachevo, Ukraine where he studied philology at Uzhhorod State University. In 1956 he relocated to Moscow at the Lomonosov Moscow State University, where he finished a degree in journalism. He was demobilized in 1959 with the rank of colonel. Publications Alexey Vysotsky was the author of four books on military subjects, including the collection of stories \\"И пусть наступит утро\\" (And let it be morning) about his military commander and Hero of the Soviet Union, artilleryman N. Bogdanova's actions during the defense of Odessa and Sevastopol; Дороги огненной земли (Roads of the fiery earth) about the defense of Kerch; Горсть земли (Handful of earth) about the defense of Odessa; and Горный цветок (Mountain Flower) about the struggle of Soviet border guards with bandits in the post-war period. Discographic contributions In 1962 Alexey Vysotsky produced the first professional- quality tape recording of his nephew, Vladimir Vysotsky, at the House of Technology of the Ministry of River Fleets of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic where he then worked. Vladimir Vysotsky's work from that period had not received official recognition and thus he had no contract for recording from Melodiya, the monopolist of the Soviet recording industry, so his work was unsanctioned. With this recording and the advent of portable tape-recorders in the Soviet Union, his music became available to the masses in the form of home-made reel-to-reel audio tape recordings. Together they produced the breakthrough record \\"For uncle\\"; one piece was based on an essay by Aleksey Vysotsky about two-time Hero of the Soviet Union, NM Skomorohove and was included in a later formal release as Vladimir Vysotsky's \\"Song of the lost pilot\\" (1975). Family His son, Alexander Vysotsky (1945-1992), was a journalist, writer, and held a doctorate of philological sciences, as well as being international class in men's eight competitive rowing, winning a silver prize at the World Cup of 1970 in St. Ketrinse, Canada. His daughter, Irena A. Vysotskaya (b. 1953), is a children's book writer and author. His paternal uncle Leon Solomonovich (Leybish Shliomovich) Vysotsky (1886-1974), was a prominent Kiev chemical engineer and inventor, founding the Kiev factory «Himefir». His half brother on the maternal side was the well-known music administrator (manager) and the poet-songwriter Paul L. Leonidov (1927-1984). His nephew Vladimir Vysotsky (1938-1980) was a poet, author, singer, as well as a theater and film actor. Vladimir's wife was the French actress Marina Vlady (Marina Polyakova-Baydarova). His maternal grandfather, Lev Grigorievich Levin (1870-1938) was physician and health-care consultant to the Kremlin, serving as physician to leaders of the party and government, including Lenin, Molotov and Maxim Gorky. He was shot 15 March 1938 on charges of involvement in the putative Trotsky conspiracy to eliminate prominent Soviet leaders. Death Alexey Vysotsky died in 1977, and is buried on the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow, as is his nephew, Vladimir Vysotsky.

It stands on one of the oldest parcels of consecrated land on the island, often known in Barbados as \\"God's acre\\". Part of the Diocese of Barbados in the Church in the Province of the West Indies, St. James Parish Church is just north of Holetown, beside Folkstone Park. Daily tours are conducted to share the church's rich history. There are many beautiful monuments, and items of historical value, some dating back to the 1600s. Two services are held every Sunday: a spoken Eucharist at 7:15 am and a sung Eucharist at 9 am. On months with a fifth Sunday, there is one service at 8 am. There are also morning matins on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 am. As well as being a heavily visited tour spot, St. James is also a very popular choice for conducting weddings. History The first settlers landed on the island on February 17, 1627 at Holetown not far from the site where the church was eventually built. The settlement there expanded rapidly and it became necessary to erect a place of worship. In 1628 the settlers constructed a wooden building on this site. St. James Parish Church was one of the original six parishes later created under the administration of Sir William Tufton, the sixth Governor of Barbados. After a hurricane on August 31, 1675 which devastated most of the island, a stone structure replaced the former wooden building in the early 1690s. This stone structure was made from coral and limestone from which this non-volcanic island is made. Another violent hurricane struck in 1780 and according to Robert Hermann Schomburgk's History of Barbados only two churches and one chapel remained; St. Andrew, St. Peter and All Saints. There is no specific record of what happened to St. James in the storms of 1675 and 1780 but after the hurricane of 1831 St. James was not among the churches listed as having been destroyed. Schomburgk states that in 1846 at the time of his writing this book, the building was 54' X 40' in size with a seating capacity of 550 and a congregation of approximately '360 souls'. After nearly 200 years the walls of the original stone building began to decay and were partly demolished and replaced by a larger, more substantial structure in 1874. In 1874, the nave roof was raised on new pillars and arches. The enlarged building was consecrated by Bishop Mitchinson on Easter Tuesday, 1875. Except for the sanctuary and north porch, added in 1900s, this is substantially the building still in use today. Points of interest The Devil's Gate Many of the original settlers and various noted Barbadians were laid to rest in the Church and its yard. The dates on the grave stones, vaults and memorial plaques reflect this history. The church's first organ was ordered and built by the English firm, Hill & Son, at a cost of 320 pounds. After it arrived in January 1876 and was assembled, the first organist was Charles A. Greenidge and the bellows blower, Reynold W. Gillman. Over time this organ was replaced, with various upgrades performed over the years until the existing instrument was completely rebuilt from 2006–2007 and rededicated in 2008. Some of the pipes and structure still date back about one hundred years. The present organist is Philip Forde FRCO. The original bell, the oldest in Barbados, carries the inscription \\"God Bless King William 1696\\". It was manufactured by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry that also produced the American \\"Liberty Bell\\" and \\"Big Ben\\". It fell from the belfry in 1881 and was badly cracked but a benefactor donated a new bell. However, considering its historic value the old one was sent to England for repairs and returned to Barbados to be retained as a monument, which predates the American \\"Liberty Bell\\" by 56 years. The Baptistery, on the ground floor of the belfry, contains the original font which is over 300 years old and bears the inscription \\"Debit Richardus Walter to the Church of St. James Anno 1684.\\" There is a popular legend attached to St. James' Church, that a gate in the north wall surrounding the churchyard, referred to as 'The Devil's Gate' is opened about one hour before service. When the bell is rung the Devil leaves the church by this gate, and it is closed as the service is about to begin, so that the Devil is excluded from the area. This is presumably derived from the old belief that church bells were rung to drive the devil out of the building.

Since 2000, the IC3 has received complaints crossing the spectrum of cyber crime matters, to include online fraud in its many forms including intellectual property rights (IPR) matters, computer intrusions (hacking), economic espionage (theft of trade secrets), online extortion, international money laundering, identity theft, and a growing list of Internet facilitated crimes. It has become increasingly evident that, regardless of the label placed on a cyber crime matter, the potential for it to overlap with another referred matter is substantial. Therefore, the IC3, formerly known as the Internet Fraud Complaint Center (IFCC), was renamed in October 2003 to better reflect the broad character of such matters having an Internet, or cyber, nexus referred to the IC3, and to minimize the need for one to distinguish \\"Internet Fraud\\" from other potentially overlapping cyber crimes.

History The 80 billion baht (US$3.2 billion) project was approved on 9 November 1990, without a feasibility study or clear timeline for completion,\\"Thais Revisit a Troubled Mass-Transit Project\\", International Herald Tribune, October 10, 1998. Mr. Wu's Hopewell Holdings Ltd. received approval for the project in 1990 without conducting a feasibility study. It began construction before securing ownership of land along the route. Without any clear timetable for completion, Mr. Wu had running public disputes with officials over the speed of construction. Last year, with less than 10 percent of the project completed, the government canceled Hopewell's contract. Thai officials said Mr. Wu had run out of money, while he blamed government instability for slowing land acquisition. Since 1990, Thailand has had one coup and an average of a government a year--besides numerous leadership changes at the Ministry of Transport and Communication. Mr. Wu is threatening to sue the government for breach of contract, and Mr. Akapol said the government would seek compensation for incomplete work. as a joint project of the Thai Ministry of Transport, the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), and the Thai subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong.\\"Studying the '7-Generation Project'\\"(translated from Thai), Matichon, June 7, 2001. The Hopewell Project was signed by MOTC (Mr. Montri Phongphanit), SRT and Hopewell (Thailand) Co.Ltd. (Mr. Gordon Woo) on November 9, 1990 during the tenure of the late Montri Phong Phanit (Minister of MOTC), amid controversial rumours of corruption and unusual land deals. Hopewell had to find financial resources (about 80 billion baht - then US$3.2 billion) to back up the project for the right to develop real estate along the SRT lines. However, there were so many obstacles to deal with--including blueprints, land transfers, the routes which go parallel to other projects, and a financial crunch--that the project bogged down. There were also many committees dealing with the Hopewell project.... After September 1997, Mr. Suwat Liptaphallop (MOTC Minister during the Gen. Chawalit Yopngjaiyut government) sent the issue of the project delay to the cabinet and Mr. Suthep Thueaksubun decided to terminate the project in 1998. Even though several groups offered to revive it, controversies still haunt the project, earning it the nickname \\"the 7-generation project.\\" There were to be three phases: the first a north-south line from Hua Lamphong Railway Station, Bangkok's main train station, to Don Mueang International Airport; the second an east-west line from Taling Chan District to Hua Mak; and the third a spur to the port. Totaling 60 km, all three were to be built on top of existing SRT train lines. Rumors of corruption swirled around the project from the outset. The first part of the project was due to be in operation by December 1995, with the rest completed by December 1999. However, construction ceased in August 1997 during the Asian financial crisis, with only around 10% complete. Gordon Wu of Hopewell blamed slow land acquisition on the Thai government, while Thai officials stated that Hopewell had simply run out of money. Both sides demanded financial compensation and threatened to sue the other for breach of contract, with Hopewell claiming the work had cost it US$575 million. The project was formally terminated by the Cabinet in 1998. Physical status Pillars near Ngam Wong Wan intersection in 2009, along the future alignment of the SRT Red Lines The project left over 1,000 concrete pillars standing idle along the planned routes, described by the Bangkok Post as \\"a Bangkok version of Stonehenge\\".\\"Bangkok 1999 Economic Review: They said pigs would never fly\\", Bangkok Post, Poona Antaseeda & Krissana Parnsoonthorn. \\"Like a Bangkok version of Stonehenge, about one thousand tall concrete pillars stand mysteriously idle from the North of Bangkok to the inner city. They are the remnants of the Hopewell elevated road and train project. Revivals of the project were proposed periodically by both Hopewell and SRT, but were always shot down by the government of then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\\"Thaksin halts SRT's plan to revive Hopewell project,\\" Business Day, 28 September 2001, by Siriphan Pongthanee. \\"Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has turned down the State Railway of Thailand's (SRT) proposal to revive the Hopewell project, and ordered the agency to cut back on future investment.\\" According to an Asian Institute of Technology study, the vast majority of the pillars remain structurally sound and in usable condition, and it has been proposed to use them to build an extension of the BTS Skytrain. Much of the Uttaraphimuk Elevated Tollway on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road parallels the BERTS north-south alignment, with some flyovers since built that obstruct parts of the route. All of the BERTS east-west line's pillars were demolished from 2005 to 2007 during the construction of the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link, which opened to the public in August 2010. The planned SRT Red Lines would cover the rest of the BERTS north-south line, and the project has been described as a \\"Hopewell revival\\".\\"Reviving the former Hopewell route\\", translated and summarized by Wisarut Bholsithi from Prachachart Thurakij, March 4–7, 2004. A section of the Hopewell structure collapsed onto the main northern line on 1 March 2012. A massive concrete slab 50m by 20m collapsed near Wat Samian Nari temple in Chatuchak District. The northern SRT Dark Red commuter Line which will run from Bang Sue to Rangsit started construction in May 2013. The \\"Hopewell revival\\" as some term it, will be an elevated line. Shared tracks or separated tracks for high speed rail, DMU/Diesel Tracks, an Airport Line extension and a Dark Red Line commuter line will eventually be constructed. Though some of the BERTS structures may be used for the Dark Red Line, most will be demolished. Demolition of the pillars on the north-south line started in 2013. Removal of the pillars will cost 200 million baht. Legal status On 23 April 2019, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court upheld an arbitration committee's ruling in favour of Hopewell, contractor for the 80 billion baht project killed by the government in 1998. The court ordered SRT to pay Hopewell compensation of 11.88 billion baht, plus 7.5% interest per year. The interest, totaling 13 billion baht, brings the total to nearly 25 billion baht, payable within 180 days. In October 2019 the transport ministry announced that it will seek a reversal of the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling ordering it and the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) to pay compensation to Hopewell. The ministry will file a lawsuit asking the civil court to look into irregularities that the SRT has uncovered concerning Hopewell's registration as a contract competitor. Hopewell may have been ineligible to win the contract from the outset, according to the transport minister.

From January 2005 until June 2016 the head teacher was Ronnie Ross. In June 2012 Fife Council proposed that the school should merge with neighbouring Buckhaven High School to create Levenmouth Academy. The plans were approved in April 2014 and the new school opened to pupils on 17 August 2016. In September 2015 the student roll was 421, less than half of the roll of 900 the school had in 2000. History The Kirkland Junior High School was established in 1963 to accommodate the extra influx of pupils to the existing Aberhill Secondary. It was built on the 13th-century land of Michael of Methil, a relative of the famous MacDuff. It was officially opened in 1965. The school had served alongside Buckhaven High School as the high schools for the Levenmouth area since the closure of Aberhill Secondary. In 1970, it became a fully comprehensive school. In 1990, a community college was opened within the school, from then on known as Kirkland High School and Community College. In 2006, the school was made one of the Scottish Government's Schools of Ambition. The school had three houses, 'Caldcoits', 'Kinnarchie' and 'Pirnie'. However, due to reduced numbers on the school roll, in the last few years of the school's operation, only the latter two houses were used in the system. In 2015, the Kirkland College was closed, in preparation for the move to the new Levenmouth Campus. The college merged with Fife College, who were built their own specialised facility on the grounds of the new school, meaning that the Levenmouth Campus is the largest of its kind in Scotland, educating over 2,000 students in total. The buildings were vacated by pupils in July 2016. Demolition work on the old facilities was scheduled for September 2016, beginning with the former games hall. The site was completely demolished by December 2016, and the cleanup operation is ongoing. =Headteachers= *1963 - 1966: William Reid *1966 - 1977: Dai Davies *1977 - 1979: J. F.

From there, it headed to the northeast, following the two-lane Noeltner Road on a linear alignment for roughly across rolling, open fields. It broke from the straight path near a junction with CR 120, turning northward into a brief but dense wooded area. The route continued through the narrow forest to a more open area just south of the Mohawk River and the New York State Thruway, where it ended at a junction with NY 5S east of the hamlet of Auriesville.

History Hunt Country Vineyards was founded in 1981 by Arthur C. Hunt and Joyce H. Hunt. The property was first purchased by Arthur Hunt's great great grandfather, Ambrose Hunt (b. 1803) in 1852 and has been farmed continuously by his descendants until the present day. The oldest grapevines on the vineyard were planted in 1904 and are of the concord and Niagara varieties. When the current generation of Hunts took over the farm in 1973, there were of the two varieties planted. In 2008, of grapes were harvested. Geography The farm is located west of Branchport, New York. The vineyard soils are glacially deposited gravelly loam, with a 5–7% slope. Viticulture The Hunts enrich the soil with natural compost made from the grape pomace (seeds and skins) left after pressing the grapes, mixed with manure from a neighboring farm. Between 1984 and 1988, the Hunts collaborated with Cornell Cooperative Extensionhttp://www.cce.cornell.edu/ Grape Specialist Dr. Tom Zabadal to convert undesirable grape varieties to more promising wine varieties by the use of field grafting in cold climate vineyards. Under normal conditions, it takes seven years to convert a vineyard to a new variety. This includes removing old vines, planting other crops to replenish the soil and remove all traces of the old root stock, replanting new vines and allowing them to grow to maturity. The field grafting process reduced the time to two years. The vineyard produces several French-American varieties, including Seyval blanc, Vignoles, Vidal blanc, and De Chaunac, as well as three Cornell varieties: Cayuga White, Horizon and Valvin Muscat. Two Vitis vinifera varieties are also produced: Riesling and Cabernet Franc, and three native varieties: Concord, Niagara and Delaware grape. The vines yield an average of 4-6 tons of grapes per acre. Experimental and sustainable practices Hunt Country Vineyards current experimental agricultural techniques include English ground ivy (partly funded by the USDA SARE program, planted under and between rows of grapes to reduce the need for herbicides and mowing), biodiesel from waste grease (to power tractors), along with a small wind turbine for producing electricity, and bat houses to encourage natural insect predators. In 2020, the New York Wine & Grape Foundation awarded Hunt Country Vineyards the Sustainability Award for “noteworthy sustainable practices and a commitment to conserving natural resources, protecting our environment, and contributing to the overall success of the New York State economy.” Wine production and distribution Hunt Country Vineyards produces an average of 12,000 cases per year of 21 different wines, and has a production capacity of 70,000 gallons.Hunt Wines The winery is perhaps best known for its Vidal Ice Wine, which is a dessert wine produced in colder wine regions when grapes are left on the vine late into the winter. The grapes are hand picked and pressed frozen, leaving the water behind as ice. The concentrated juice is then fermented to produce this intensely sweet dessert wine. The Vidal ice winehttp://eastcoastwineries.blogspot.com/2006/03/hunt-country-vineyards- appears-in-nbcs.html was featured on NBC's Today Show in 2006.

Bhir Mound, along with several other nearby excavations, form part of the Ruins of Taxila – inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. Context The Bhir Mound archaeological remains represent one stage of the historic city of Taxila. The first town in Taxila was situated in the Hathial mound in the southwest corner of the Sirkap site. It lasted from the late second millennium BCE until the Achaemenid period, with the Achaemenid period remains located in its Mound B. The Bhir Mound site represents the second city of Taxila, beginning in the pre-Achaemenid period and lasting till the early Hellenistic period. The earliest occupation on the Bhir mound begins around 800-525 BC, and what now appears to be the second phase might date to the late 6th and 5th centuries BC, as originally suggested by Marshall.Petrie, Cameron, (2013). \\"Taxila\\", in D. K. Chakrabarti and M. Lal (eds.), History of Ancient India III: The Texts, and Political History and Administration till c. 200 BC, Vivekananda International Foundation, Aryan Books International, Delhi, p. 656 - 657. Excavation The ruins of Bhir Mound were excavated from 1913-1925 by Sir John Marshall. The work was continued by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in 1944-1945 and by Dr. Mohammad Sharif in 1966-1967. Further excavations were performed in 1998-2000 by Bahadur Khan and in 2002 by Dr. Ashraf and Mahmud-al-Hassan. Marshall came to the Bhir Mound project from earlier work in Athens, expecting very much to find a Greek city in Taxila. Klaus Karttunen says that he became more objective later on, but scholars mention various problems with his results. In his report, Marshall proposed that the Bhir Mound city of Taxila was founded by Darius I as the capital of the Achaemenid province of Hindush. Scholar David Fleming says that the identification was based on 'classical sources and a frankly pro-western bias'. The excavations were conducted without much regard to stratigraphic recording, and the pottery finds were published in such a manner as to preclude a detailed analysis. The results of Mortimer Wheeler's excavations were never published. Later excavations by Mohammad Sharif were done more carefully with regard to chronological considerations, and they form the basis for the modern assessments.

Persian, Greek and Indian coinage.jpgBhir Mound coin hoard sample, with Achaemenid, Greek and Indian coinage Ruins The ruins of the town form an irregular shape measuring around 1 km from north to south and about 600 meters from east to west. The streets of the city show that they were narrow and the house plans were very irregular. There is little evidence of planning - most of the streets are very haphazard. The houses had no windows to the outside. They opened towards inner courtyards. The courtyard was open and 15 to 20 rooms were arranged around it. History John Marshall stated, based on his excavations during 1913–1934, that heavy masonry of the Achaemenid buildings formed the earliest stratum of the Bhir Mound site. He believed that Taxila formed part of the 20th satrapy of Darius I (called Hinduš by the Persians or Indos by the Greeks). This claim was considered dubious by several scholars.Pierfrancesco Callieri, India iii. Relations: Achaemenid Period, Encyclopedia Iranica, 15 December 2004.: \\"There was little in his discussion of archaeological material that would support such an identification, and the Elamite evidence was not available to him.\\" and it is invalidated by the current dating of the Bhir Mound site as beginning before 525 BCE as Cameron Petrie suggests. Other scholars doubt if Taxila ever belonged to the Achaemenid Empire.: \\"With a certain geographical recklessness many have supposed, that as an important early centre Taxila must have been the capital of the Indian dominions of the empire. Taxila, however, did not belong to Gandhara proper, which had a more westerly location, and elsewhere I have tried to show how it is well possible that Taxila never belonged to the empire.\\" In 326 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the area. Raja Ambhi entertained the Greek king here; he surrendered to Alexander and offered him a force of soldiers mounted on elephants. In 316 BCE, Chandragupta of Magadha, the founder of the Mauryan dynasty, conquered Panjab. Taxila lost its independence and became a mere provincial capital. Still, the city remained extremely important as centre of administration, education and trade. During the reign of Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka, Buddhism became important and the first monks settled in Taxila. Ashoka is said to have resided here as the vice-king of his father. In 184 BCE, the Greeks, who had maintained a kingdom in Bactria, invaded Gandhara and Panjab again. From now on, a Greek king resided in Taxila, Demetrius.

Many of these coins are similar to the local coins struck in Kabul, and found in the Chaman Hazouri hoard. This is the case in particular for the Achaeminid siglos type of coins of the 5th century,: Picture of Achaemenid siglos coin (this type of coin) with caption \\"Coins of this type found in Chaman Hazouri (deposited c.350 BC) and Bhir Mound hoards (deposited c.300 BC).\\": \\"The silver coins were a Persian siglos, tetradrachms of Alexander the Great and of Philip III Aridaeus, thirty-three silver bars with wheel symbols.\\" as well as the Gandharan bent-bar punch-marked coins, found in large quantities at Bhir Mound.: Picture of Gandharan bent-bar punch-marked coin(this type of coin), with caption \\"Silver bent-bar punch-marked coin of Kabul region under the Achaemenid Empire, c.350 BC: Coins of this type found in quantity in Chaman Hazouri and Bhir Mound hoards\\" Modern numismatists tend to consider that these Gandharan bent-bar punch-marked coins are the precursors of the Indian punch- marked coins.: \\"the local coins of the Achaemenid era (...) were the precursors of the bent and punch-marked bars\\": About the hoard in Kabul: \\"In the same hoard there were also discovered two series of local silver coins which appear to be the product of local Achaemenid administration. One series (...) was made in a new way, which relates it to the punch-marked silver coins of India. It appears that it was these local coins, using technology adapted from Greek coins, which provided the prototypes for punch-marked coins made in India.\\"; \\"In the territories to the south of the Hindu Kush the punch-marked coins, descendants of the local coins of the Achaemenid administration in the same area, were issued by the Mauryan kings of India for local circulation.\\" Coins of Philip III and Alexander the Great were also found in Bhir Mound.: \\"The hoards from Babylonia, Susa, and the Bhir Mound (40-2) included coins of Alexander and of Philip III (Bhir Mound only), and their few sigloi are all of type jy\\" Many Indian punch-marked coins were also found. Other sites in the area There are important ancient Buddhist sites in this area, such as Dharmarajika, Mohra Muradu, and Jaulian. Also, there are the remains of other ancient cities that were founded after Bhir Mound, such as Sirkap and Sirsukh.

Early life  Richard Spurr was born son of Christopher Spurr and Christian Richards in 1800 in Truro, Cornwall, where he became a cabinet maker and carpenter. He was married on his 21st birthday in Saint Helier, Jersey to Ann Mary Babot who was born there in 1803. In 1840, now living in London, he was one of eleven signatories to Henry Vincent's address on teetotalism who described themselves as political victims. Note: it is possible that Henry Vincent and Richard Spurr were related by marriage (cf. Oliver Spoure married Temperance Vincent in 1640 at North Hill, Cornwall, England; also John Vincent married Mary Spoure on 24 August 1661 at North Hill, Cornwall, England)  Involvement in the Chartist Movement  He became interested in promoting peoples’ rights whilst operating from premises in Pyder Street, Truro, and was a leader of the Chartist Movement in Cornwall.Comments on the Chartists' visit to Cornwall in the local newspapers: \\"Mr Heath, an operative, was called to the chair, and the meeting was then addressed by Mr Spurr, who read and proposed the adoption of the national petition.

A new life in Australia  By 1848 Chartists were being hunted down, imprisoned and deported. In 1850, possibly after being tipped off as to his impending arrest, Richard Spurr migrated to Australia together with his wife and children aboard the Trafalgar.List of People Embarking on the Trafalgar, arrived South Australia March 1850. Ref 513/50/3 frame 6 maritime museum in Port Adelaide,South Australia. Richard Spurr paid £19 for the passage, which may have been under the Wakefield Assistance Plan for skilled migrants. According to \\"Victoria and its Metropolis\\" Richard Spurr built the first Police Barracks in Melbourne, near his business premises at the corner of Elizabeth Street and Flinders Street. There is a possibility that he was at Eureka Stockade as he was in Ballarat for a while at that time, and the rights being fought for at the Eureka Stockade were very similar to those sought by the Chartists. Many of the leaders at the Eureka Stockade were Chartist members. The nights before the military attack on the stockade there were up 1,500 people there, but dropped to about 150 on the day of the attack.  Death  Richard Spurr died in January 1855 (within 2 months of the Eureka Stockade) and so never saw true democracy introduced to England or Australia. However as a result of the Eureka Stockade democratic reform became a reality in Victoria over the next couple of years.

She is a bit of a tomboy--acting as captain of the dinghy, Amazon and usually directing her friends in their various adventures. Nancy apparently has no real-world counterpart as an inspirational source for Ransome but appears to be completely the author's creation. Nancy is sometimes critically viewed as a subversive character for girl readers. The character appeared in a 1963 BBC television adaptation of Swallows and Amazons as well as in the 1974 and 2016 film adaptations of the book. Role in the series At the opening of the series in Swallows and Amazons, Nancy is 12 years old and lives with her younger sister Peggy and her widowed mother in a large Lakeland house called Beckfoot. In common with his treatment of many of his other characters, Ransome does not give a detailed description of Nancy, merely describing her as \\"bigger than John\\" (Walker). She is something of a tomboy who captains a dinghy called Amazon, usually wears a red pirate cap and often uses nautical or piratical words in her speech, such as \\"Jibbooms and bobstays\\" or the classic \\"shiver my timbers.\\" In her first appearance in Swallows and Amazons, Peggy reveals that \\"Nancy\\" is itself a nickname derived from her affection for pirates: her real name is Ruth, which she changed to Nancy after her Uncle Jim pointed out that pirates are \\"ruthless.\\" Nancy is the elder of the Amazons and older than the Swallows. She usually takes the lead in their adventures. Nancy has a lively imagination and usually thinks up adventures for her friends which she makes more exciting by imagining an exotic background such as climbing Kanchenjunga in Swallowdale instead of just a local mountain. Nancy is still a prime mover of the action even when she is prevented from taking direct part in the action such as when she is quarantined with mumps in Winter Holiday, or when she and Peggy are kept at home when the Great Aunt comes to stay in The Picts and the Martyrs. Character summary \\"Nancy takes charge - loading Captain Flint\\" Detail of an illustration by Arthur Ransome from Swallowdale showing Nancy as visualised by her creator Her upbringing in a single-parent household with only intermittent male influence of her uncle has been suggested as a contributing factor towards her independence and sturdy self-reliance.Thompson, p. 16 Unlike John Walker, the Captain of Swallow, who defers to his father's judgements and seeks approval before acting, Nancy makes and acts on decisions for herself. For some, Nancy has an immature view of the world while John is more mature, dismissing Nancy's suggestion that they could live on Wildcat Island all year round as impractical.Hunt, p. 92 Nancy matures through the series and latterly uses her energy to support the needs of the younger members of the group. Nancy is not without fault and her flexible standards of honesty, particularly when contrasted with the rigid code of John and the Swallows has been suggested as one of the reasons for her popularity as it makes her seem \\"more alive for today's reader\\". Origin Unlike a number of his other characters whose origins were firmly rooted in reality, no direct original has been identified for Nancy, although there have been a number of unproven suggestions, including Dora Collingwood, daughter of writer William Collingwood, whom Ransome first met on Peel Island in 1896, and Taqui Altounyan, daughter of Dora Collingwood and the oldest of the Altounyan children who were models for the Swallows.Hardyment, p. 40 Ransome himself was never explicit about the inspiration for Nancy, saying only that he had once seen two small girls in red caps playing on the shore of Coniston Water near his house.Wardale, p. 21 Another suggestion is that she was based on Georgina Rawdon Smith, whose father had been at Rugby with Ransome, and who, with her sister Pauline, met and played with the Altounyan children on the shores of Coniston.Marshall, p. 5 Ransome's own relationship with Nancy was complex. He recognised that her character defined and led the plots but also acknowledged that other characters were dominated and diminished by her presence. Discussing the plot of Winter Holiday in a letter to his mother dated 2 March 1929 he wrote \\"the main point of the new book is that two other children turn up... ...and then get involved in one of Captain Nancy's colossal plans for adventure\\" but later in the same paragraph he mentions the more prominent role that Peggy will play \\"who in previous books has never really had a fair chance, being so much dominated by Nancy\\".Brogan, p. 331 Critical commentary When Ransome was first writing Swallows and Amazons in 1928, it was unusual for a female character to display such active leadership over males as Nancy Blackett does in the whole series of books and whilst children in children's literature had become increasingly self-motivated towards the end of the 19th century, they were, until Swallows and Amazons, still largely bounded by a \\"closed nursery-orientated world\\".Hunt, p. 161 In Secret Water, Daisy the leader of the \\"Eels\\" is their leader, although younger than her brothers Dum and Dee. Nevertheless, despite writing Nancy in an unconventional role, Peter Hunt suggests that Ransome can still be accused of sexism as Susan Walker's domesticity reinforces the common views of the time; however, he points out that gender is unimportant in Ransome's work.Hunt, p. 165 Despite ageing from about twelve to fifteen over the series Nancy, in common with all the children in Ransome's books, shows no sign of developing any interest in sex; in this Ransome is merely reflecting the historical and cultural context of the time, as \\"Children's fiction in the 1930s had found no way of writing about sex.\\"Watson, p. 69 Victor Watson, a critic of children's fiction, proposes that Nancy's principal role in the books is to open up \\"possibilities\\" and \\"disrupt the comfortable certainties of the Walker family\\". He observes that she is a force of goodness, especially in the way she deals with her adult counterpart, the Great Aunt, in The Picts and the Martyrs. Nancy shares many characteristics with the Great Aunt, but she displays a \\"heroic generosity\\" which the Great Aunt does not have, and does not share the adult's innate cruelty.Watson, p. 65 In 1960, a possible path for Nancy's adult life was proposed when critic Hugh Shelley postulated that she might have found the Second World War liberating and become a WREN. He suggested that \\"as a character one feels she could not be transmuted into a normal, satisfactory adult\\".Shelley, p. 19 Recent analysis of Shelley's work by Katherine Holden has concluded the suggestion is a veiled reference to lesbianism and this, as well as his idea that Nancy would have eventually grown to be like her spinster Great Aunt Maria, has been dismissed as reflecting the homophobia of the time when Shelley was writing.Holden, p. 170 Today, Nancy is viewed as a subversive figure who, in the context of interwar Britain, offered young girls the possibility of an alternative route to adulthood.Holden, p. 171 The character has been cited by feminist author and academic Sara Maitland as a childhood role model \\"who transcended the restriction of femininity without succumbing to the lure of male- identification\\" and a \\"hero who had all the characteristics necessary for the job; who lived between the countries of the material and the imaginary\\".Wardale p. 20 Film and television Nancy Blackett has been portrayed in television and film. Amanda Coxell (now known as Mandy Harper) played the character in the 1963 BBC television adaptation of Swallows and Amazons. A little over ten years later, Kit Seymour portrayed Nancy in a 1974 film adaptation. She was played by Seren Hawkes in the Swallows and Amazons 2016 film adaptation.

He was Keeper of the Madras Record Office and was tasked with responsibility for documenting ancient inscriptions and remains in the region, As with other British administrators of his type at that period, his purpose was not scholarly but rather to bolster administrative control by constructing a history that placed British rule as a virtue and a necessity rather than something to be denigrated. Portrayal of historic factionalism among local figureheads and dominion by alien despots would, it was thought, enhance the perception that only the British could rescue the country from its past. Sewell's specialism was the Vijayanagara Empire, about which he authored A Forgotten Empire Vijayanagar: A Contribution to the History of India (1900). Burton Stein described this book as Sewell's Sewell undertook archaeological work, including at the Buddhist stupa at Amaravati, which had already been largely destroyed prior to his arrival. The site had previously been surveyed by Colin Mackenzie and Walter Elliot. His record-keeping at that site in 1877 has been criticised for making an already-bad situation worse, adding to the problems that meant it was impossible to correlate the finds made.

The mountain which is located 30 km east- northeast of Fort William is one of several of the same name in the Scottish Highlands and should not be confused with another well known Beinn a’ Chaorainn in the Cairngorms. Overview Beinn a’ Chaorainn reaches a height of 1052 metres (3451 feet) and qualifies as both a Munro and a Marilyn. It stands in a section of the Grampian Mountains often known as the Loch Laggan Hills these include the Creag Meagaidh range five km to the NE and the adjoining Munro of Beinn Teallach which is just over two km to the west. Beinn a’ Chaorainn is usually climbed in conjunction with Beinn Teallach in a 13 km horseshoe walk around the Allt a’ Chaorainn, starting at Roughburn on the A86 road. The mountains name translates from the Gaelic language as “Mountain of the Rowan Tree”.\\"The Magic Of The Munros\\", Irvine Butterfield, Page 78 Gives details of name translation. Geography Beinn a’ Chaorainn is basically a north-south orientated ridge which looks quite an undistinguished bulk when viewed from Roughburn (see picture), the best view of the mountain being from the east where the crags of Coire na h-Uamha give the mountain some character. This corrie’s name translates as the Corrie of the Cave although no significant cave is known in its environs although there are several small lochans within its higher recesses. It is drained by the Allt na h-Uamha whose glen separates the mountain from Creag Meagaidh massif to the east. Part of these eastern flanks of the mountain are clothed in coniferous woodland below the 550 metre contour. Coire na h-Uamha is split into two distinctive parts by an eastern ridge which gives a feasible route of ascent from the foot of the coire directly to the main summit, however some care is needed and in Winter conditions it is ranked as a Grade I route.\\"Hamish‘s Mountain Walk\\", Hamish Brown, Page 183 Gives details of Coire na h-Uamha. Coire Buidhe (Yellow Coire) stands at the northern end of the mountain, this corrie is drained by the Burn of Algie, part of the headwaters of the River Roy. Two routes down the ridges on either side of this corrie connects to the adjoining Munros. One route goes NW and links to Beinn Teallach at a col with a height of 614 metres. The other route goes NE down to the Bealach a’ Bharnish (824 metres) before ascending onto the Creag Meagaidh plateau. The southern flank of the mountain descends to Glen Spean with more coniferous plantations below 400 metres while the western flanks are very steep as they fall to the glen of the Allt a’ Chaorainn. All drainage from the mountain finds its way to the west coast of Scotland via the River Spean, going either south directly to Glen Spean or north and going via Glen Roy before joining the Spean at Roybridge.\\"The Central Highlands\\", Peter Hodgkiss, Page 179 Gives details of mountain and routes. =Summit ridge= Beinn a’ Chaorainn’s summit ridge is approximately 1.5 km in length and made up of three high points. The middle of the three tops is now regarded as the highest point, the South Top (1049 metres) was regarded as the highest point until 1974 when re-surveying downgraded it to a “Top” in the Munros Tables and elevated the middle of the pinnacles to the recognised summit. The North Top (1044 metres) is also a “Top” in the tables and has been so ever since they were first published in 1891. The summit ridge of Beinn a’ Chaorainn has the reputation as a potentially dangerous place for walkers under winter conditions with at least one fatality in 1994. The problem arises with certain sections of the eastern corrie which bite far back into the ridge and can be snow covered in winter forming cornices. Walkers taking direct compass bearings between the high points on the summit ridge have fallen through the cornices by underestimating the distance that the corrie bites into the ridge. Ascents The most popular route of ascent starts at Roughburn on the A86 at grid reference , there is parking at the Loch Laggan Dam, 700 metres to the SW. Forest roads and fire breaks take the walker through the forest to emerge onto the open hillside at a height of 400 metres. The route then goes NE up a broad ridge on the west side of the shallow Coire Clachaig. The view from the summit gives an excellent perspective of the Munros around Loch Treig.\\"The Munros\\", Donald Bennett (Editor) et al., Page 139 Gives route information and mountain description.

His given name sometimes appears as 'Renkin'. Portrait of Rennequin Sualem attributed to Le Brun Achievements In 1667−68 the lieutenant-governor of the castle of Huy ordered the building of an hydraulic machine to pump up the water of the Hoyoux river to his castle in Modave, higher. Rennequin Sualem was commissioned to build the mechanism. In 1678 the French king Louis XIV called for a competition to construct an effective pump system to bring water from the nearby Seine river to his chateaux at Versailles and Marly in order to supply the fountains there, and Sualem resolved to present his model, a scaled-up version of his pump system at Hoyoux. The presentations by the other inventors were so unconvincing that the king had decided to discontinue the competition and was about to leave the room, but Sualem managed to persuade him to stay to hear his plan. When he presented his imposing wooden model he impressed the king with his detailed description of its operation, and convinced that Sualem understood the problem to be tackled, Louis XIV commissioned him to immediately begin construction. The resulting huge Machine de Marly, engineered by Arnold de Ville, lifted the waters from the Seine to the Versailles palace, in this case higher. The machine included 14 paddlewheels to power over 200 pumps that forced water up a network of pipes to an aqueduct. It took 30 years to complete in 1684 and remained in use until 1817 before subsequent modification.

He was tutored privately and obtained a degree in medicine from Transylvania University. On January 15, 1805, he married Maria Barr, with whom he had ten children. Their daughter Mary Jane Warfield married Cassius Marcellus Clay, who became a prominent politician and abolitionist in Kentucky. Warfield became a very successful medical practitioner in Lexington. He was selected as the first Professor of Surgery and Obstetrics at the newly established medical school at Transylvania University. Active in community development, in 1830 Elisha Warfield was a founding shareholder of the Lexington & Ohio Railway Company. In 1834 it connected Lexington to the state capital of Frankfort, Kentucky. Thoroughbred horses Around the time of his marriage, Elisha Warfield began racing and breeding Thoroughbred horses. In 1809 he was one of the founding members of the Lexington Jockey Club, consisting of owners of the racehorses and breeding farms. In 1821 Warfield decided to devote his energies to breeding, training and racing Thoroughbreds full-time. In 1826, he was one of the founders of the Kentucky Association, which built a horse racetrack on land adjacent to his stud farm. Known as The Meadows, Warfield's stud farm was located on Winchester Pike on the Northeast side of Lexington. It was where he bred Lexington, a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred stallion. Foaled at The Meadows on March 29, 1850, and originally named Darley, the colt was very successful on the racetrack, winning six of his seven starts. As a breeding stallion, he is considered one of the greatest in United States history. Between 1861 and 1878, Lexington was ranked as the leading sire in North America a record sixteen times, of which fourteen were consecutive years. As of 2008, Lexington's record remains intact. Warfield and his brother Benjamin, an attorney, were members of the group that founded Lexington Cemetery in 1849. Elisha Warfield was buried here following his 1859 death at his Lexington home. The Meadows stud farm was eventually sold, with portions of the property parceled off. Prominent Kentucky horseman Daniel Swigert owned the stud for a time before selling it in August 1888. Increased population in the city put pressure on surrounding real estate. Developers acquired the property in 1945 and subdivided it for residential use as The Meadows.

Active both in New York and Paris, he was the younger brother of Leon Dabo. Both artists were Impressionist landscape painters, who shared in a similar manner in style and tone. During the period when they worked together, their subjects were usually landscapes and seascapes in the early morning or evening at twilight, they utilized spare composition and reductive color schemes to evoke what they termed, mood. The Dabo brothers style that had a Whistlerian quality, and like James McNeill Whistler both would come to be labeled Tonalist. The youngest brother in the family, Louis, a writer and publicist, also used the name Scott Dabo. History The Dabo family lived in Detroit, Michigan between 1870 and the early 1880s under the surname of Schott.1880 US Census, Michigan, Wayne Co., Detroit, E.D. 274 p.64A Both Theodore and his elder brother Leon were painters and received their initial artistic training from their father, Ignace Schott. Theodore's work, and that of his brother Leon, show the influence of James McNeill Whistler and J. M. W. Turner, whom the brothers discussed in their correspondence.\\"ART OF THE TWO DABOS\\" The New York Post (March 23, 1907)  Life  Theodore was the second of eight children, he and his older brother Leon were apprenticed to an artist according to the 1880 U.S. Census. The artist was of course their father. Ignace was primarily a church decorator, and did much work through his association with the Detroit Stained Glass Works, where he was employed until a year before his death, March 3, 1883. The brothers last appeared as Leon and Theodore Schott in the J. W. Weeks & Co., Detroit City Directory of 1883. In the late 1880s, Theodore relocated with the rest of the family to New York City and soon began using the hyphenated surname of Scott-Dabo, perhaps as a tribute to their father's birthplace Dabo, Moselle. Theodore and Leon joined together and utilizing the training they received from their father, formed L. D. & S. Dabo Decorator's. Leon, the motivating force of the two, developed a fairly successful business decorating Brooklyn churches and other institutions.\\"IT IS A MAJESTIC EDIFICE\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle (December 24, 1893) p11 Theodore, thought to be more of the family genius, was encouraged to pursue landscape painting. Though he signed his paintings, T. Scott-Dabo, most people referred to him simply as Scott Dabo. The brothers Dabo shared a studio in Greenwich Village, first on Broadway then on 14th Street. Constantly having his work rejected from the juried exhibitions mounted by the art bodies of the day, Theodore struggled for many years without recognition. The art gallery owners would take no risk on an unknown person. With no outlet for exhibition, Theodore and his brothers, mounted private exhibitions of his work at the 14th St. studio. Finally, his work caught the attention of a few art critics who began to praise his paintings. The French artist Edmond Aman-Jean had also taken noticed of his work and persuaded Theodore to return with him back to France. In Paris, Theodore opened his studio at 8 Rue de la Grande Chamiere near the Luxembourg Garden. In the early weeks of October 1905, Theodore's paintings had their first public showing, beginning with the Salon d'Automne in Paris, then in a landscape exhibition at the National Arts Club in New York and in the Michigan Artist show at the Detroit Museum of Art. Much of this happened through the efforts of his brother Leon, who arranged joint exhibits of their work in New York, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles. During much of 1905, Leon corresponded with the Director of the Detroit Museum of Art and offered Theodore's painting \\"The River Seine\\" as a gift for the Museum's collection. Sadly, the brothers' partnership was not to last as in early 1907, there was a highly publicized feud between Theodore and Leon, which was really more of a stunt arranged by the youngest brother, Louis Scott Dabo to aid the promotion of Theodore's work. Unfortunately, the publicity failed and records show that in the subsequent years only a single one-man exhibition of Theodore's work was mounted at the Morrey Art Galleries in Washington, D.C.

Their aim was to be the first to reach the North Pole. The expedition ended in disaster, with the deaths of the five member crew.  Expedition  In 1892, 21-year-old Alfred Björling organized an expedition to be the first to reach the North Pole. Björling convinced fellow countryman and zoologist Evald Kallstenius to join him on what was described as a \\"botanizing expedition to northern Greenland\\".Mowat, p. 224 The expedition was mounted on a very low budget and is considered to have been a romantic, even foolhardy, attempt at the Pole.Harper, Ken.

The explorers purchased the schooner Ripple in St. John's, hiring a crew of three; a Dane and two Newfoundlanders. In June the expedition left St. John's and July 28 reached Godhavn in Greenland. The exact history of the expedition is not well known, however it appears that their plan was to sail to Etah and hire local Inuit to help them reach the Pole. While stopping at the Carey Islands in Baffin Bay to pick up supplies at a cache there, the Ripple was driven on shore and wrecked. The men attempted to sail a small sloop (also purchased in Newfoundland) back to Etah but were forced to return to the Carey Islands. According to letters left in a cairn on the Carey Islands, the four men attempted to sail their open boat 80 miles to Ellesmere Island: In June 1893, the crew of the Scottish whaler Aurora spotted a wreck on the Carey Islands. They found the Ripple and a man's body buried under a pile of stones. They found as well Björling's letters. In July 1894, a Swedish search expedition led by explorer Axel Ohlin (1867–1903) went to the area and located the wreck and related tracks on the Carey Islands. No trace of the other four men, or the small boat, was ever found.

As a research programme, it was started by Mikio Sato in 1959.  Microfunction  Let M be a real-analytic manifold of dimension n, and let X be its complexification. The sheaf of microlocal functions on M is given as :\\\\mathcal{H}^n(\\\\mu_M(\\\\mathcal{O}_X) \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{or}_{M/X}) where *\\\\mu_M denotes the microlocalization functor, *\\\\mathcal{or}_{M/X} is the relative orientation sheaf. A microfunction can be used to define a Sato's hyperfunction.

The books revolve around the mysterious magic supplies store run by an old man named S.H. Elives. Each book follows a child who stumbles into the store and acquires a magical being or object of tremendous magical strength and abilities. The author Christopher Paolini has cited the book Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher as an inspiration for his Inheritance Cycle, as he \\"began to wonder what kind of land a dragon would come from, who would find a dragon egg and who else would be looking for a dragon egg\\", stating \\"Trying to answer those three questions has resulted in over 1,000 pages in print\\".  Books  The Monster's Ring (1989) = A boy named Russell Crannaker enters Elive's Magic Supplies while running from a bully who is chasing him and is given a magic ring that can turn him into a monster and back to a boy. This was later adapted into an episode of CBS Storybreak. = Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher (1992) = While running from two bullies and a girl who wants to kiss him, Jeremy Thatcher finds the Magic Shop and leaves with a mysterious, magical crystal orb. The orb turns out to be a dragon egg, which hatches into a female dragon that Jeremy develops an unusually strong empathic/telepathic connection with and whom he names Tiamat. = Jennifer Murdley's Toad (1993) = A plain and unattractive girl named Jennifer Murdley encounters the Magic Shop and is given a wisecracking talking toad, Bufo, who gradually reveals his complicated history and its relation to a growing danger in the present and the secrets about the magical, mystical Jewel of Perfect Happiness in his forehead. = The Skull of Truth (1999) = Charlie Eggleston, a notorious liar, comes into the Magic Shop and unintentionally steals the Skull of Truth, the wisecracking remnant of the jester Yorick that bears a dark curse, forcing anyone around it to tell the absolute truth. = Juliet Dove, Queen of Love (2003) = The Greek goddess of strife Eris breaks into the Magic Shop while Mr. Elives is away and gives the shy but acid-tongued Juliet Dove a crystal amulet containing Cupid that causes every boy she meets to become truly, madly and strongly in love with her. With Elives himself unsure of what to do, Juliet is forced to team up with the rats Jerome and Roxanne to prevent Eris from causing worldwide discord and chaos. = Short stories = Short stories about Elives' Magic Supplies store have appeared in Coville's Oddities anthology books. These stories include: *The Metamorphosis of Justin Jones *The Mask of Eamonn Tiyado Characters *Mr. Elives - A mysterious and crotchety old man who runs a magic supplies store. He is implied to be capable of great magic, though his exact origins and capabilities are left very vague. *Roxanne and Jerome - A pair of talking Immortal Rats. They are introduced at the end of Jennifer Murdley's Toad when a cursed witch spews them from her mouth, and serve as Elives' messengers for much of the rest of the series. Jerome is often shown to be more gruff and easily offended while Roxanne is portrayed as more warm, caring, kindly and motherly. *Hyacinth Priest - A librarian and storyteller who appears throughout the four-book series. She is implied to be a close friend and associate of Elives, giving the children the necessary information about their purchases and occasionally serving as a more levelheaded offset to Elives' gruffness. *Russel Crannaker - a boy obsessed with Halloween who is given a magically powerful ring capable of turning him into a vicious monster every full moon. *Jeremy Thatcher - an under- appreciated artistic prodigy who hatches and develops a telepathic/empathic connection with his pet dragon. *Tiamat - Jeremy's female pet dragon, named for the chaos monster in Babylonian mythology. She has quite a strong psychic connection to Jeremy and is invisible to almost everyone but him. She is largely portrayed as naive and childlike, though she occasionally displays a mischievous streak when her master is in discomfort. *Mr. Kravitz - Jeremy's art teacher. He is mostly portrayed as hostile toward Jeremy and unappreciative of his artistic skills, though he at one point admits that Jeremy is his most talented student, lacking only proper discipline, and it is suggested that he is actually jealous of Jeremy's talent. *Charlie Eggleston - a boy who had a habit of lying about everything. He steals the Skull of Truth from the Magic Shop, causing himself and everybody around him to only be able to speak the truth. *Jennifer Murdley - a plain girl who wishes she was beautiful and who buys a talking toad from the Magic Shop. *Juliet Dove - an extremely shy girl with a \\"killer\\" tongue from Venus Harbor who is given a locket that seemingly causes all the boys at her school to fall in love with her. Reception Critical reception for the Magic Shop series has been mostly positive. The Reading Teacher, Horn Book Guide, and Booklist all reviewed The Monster's Ring, with The Reading Teacher commenting that it was \\"hard to believe that a story can be both funny and suspenseful, yet this one is.\\" Publishers Weekly reviewed the audiobook of Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher, praising it for its cast of performers. Kliatt would later also praise the audiobook narration of another book in the series, Juliet Dove, Queen of Love. Publishers Weekly later wrote a mixed review for The Skull of Truth, stating \\"Though the tale itself is lackluster, Coville does keep readers engaged with tight plotting and an otherworldly climax.\\" Danielle Bienvenue Bray examined the book Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher in her 2015 article \\"Sissy Boy Mothering: Male Child Mother Figures in Middle-Grade Fantasy Literature\\" in Children's Literature in Education.

It is raised throughout the island, particularly in the provinces of Cagliari and Nuoro. It is an ancient breed that has been influenced by the Maltese goat. The Sarda is one of the eight autochthonous Italian goat breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders. The herdbook was established in 1981. In 1998 the total population was 260,000, of which 6577 were registered in the herdbook; at the end of 2013 the registered population was 11,121. Characteristics The animals are of medium build, long-necked and deep-chested; the does have well-developed udders. The breed is particularly hardy and well-suited to being raised in a wild or semi-wild state in tough conditions. As much of the available pasture is used by the Sarda sheep, goats are marginalised and allowed only the poorest terrain; they are fed little or nothing over and above what they can graze. Use The milk yield of the Sarda per lactation of 220–240 days is 173 ± 62 litres for primiparous, 215 ± 98 l for secondiparous, and 237 ± 109 l for pluriparous, nannies. The milk averages 3.94% protein, and is used to make Gioddu, a fermented milk product; Casu Axeddu, a mixed pecorino–caprino cheese; and ricotta. Kids are slaughtered at a weight of 7–10 kg.

It is the first book by Walliams, a television comedian best known for the cult BBC show Little Britain. It tells the story of a twelve-year-old boy who enjoys cross-dressing, and the reactions of his family and friends. It is aimed at readers aged eight to twelve, and is intended to teach children that cross-dressing is a healthy and acceptable hobby and not something to be ashamed of. It has been adapted into a television film and a musical.  Plot  The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Dennis and his 14-year-old brother John, whose parents divorced when Dennis was only 7. The boys remain with their father, who resorts to comfort eating after his wife leaves. Dennis is talented in football, and is one of the best on his team. However, he deeply misses his mother, who left their family about five years ago, and finds comfort remembering his mother's yellow dress in an old picture. Dennis sees the same dress on the cover of a Vogue magazine, and buys a copy from Raj, the local shop owner. But when Dad finds the magazine, he is furious. John teases him by calling him \\"Denise\\". At school that day, Dennis is given detention for kicking a football through a window. While in detention, he talks to a girl named Lisa James, the prettiest and most fashionable girl in the school. Lisa invites him over to her house, and dresses him up in girls' clothing. The two decide to go out in public, with Dennis, in an electric blue dress, under the alter ego of \\"Denise\\", a French exchange student who speaks very little English. They go to Raj's corner shop. Raj does not recognise Dennis, believing he is \\"Denise\\". Following their success in fooling Raj, Dennis goes to school with Lisa – as \\"Denise\\". Dennis upsets his French teacher by criticizing her French accent. At break, Dennis kicks a football, slips, and is revealed to be a boy. Mr Hawtrey, the headmaster, expels him from the school for cross-dressing. Dad is furious, and sends Dennis to his room. Darvesh, Dennis's best friend, comes over, but is sent back to his home by Dad. Pushed by Darvesh, Dennis goes to an important football match on Saturday, where his entire team encourages him to play in a dress. The team wins against Maudlin Street, the rival football team. Dennis's dad attends the match, forgives Dennis and defends him from Mr Hawtrey. On an early Sunday morning, Raj informs Dennis that Mr Hawtrey's sister, Doris, buys the Telegraph now instead of him. He adds that there is \\"something funny about her\\". Lisa and Dennis go to Raj's shop and find out that Doris is actually Mr Hawtrey cross-dressing in a skirt. The two threaten that unless Dennis is readmitted to the school, they will tell everyone about Mr Hawtrey's cross-dressing habits. Mr Hawtrey agrees to reinstate Dennis. At the end of the story, Dennis, his dad, and his brother get over the pain of the loss of Dennis's mother, Dennis and Lisa stay friends, and John starts to look out for his younger brother more.

Literary significance and reception  Reviewers and the press noted the book's resonance with Walliams's own cross- dressing. Philip Ardagh in the Guardian noted the novelty of Walliams's light- hearted approach to the themes, compared with treatments in earlier children's books on the subject like Terence Blacker's 2004 title Boy 2 Girl. Nicolette Jones in the Times praised Blake's illustrations and, though she called Walliams' writing \\"not the finest\\", noted \\"Everyone is on the side of freedom and tolerance by the end, for which the book must be applauded.\\"  Controversy  The Boy in the Dress has been the subject of some controversy. In September 2017, during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, retailer Aldi was criticised in Australia by some customers for selling the book. One customer claimed the book had an \\"agenda\\" to \\"groom and sexualise\\" children, while another accused Aldi of \\"child abuse\\", with some threatening a boycott. Other customers defended the company.  Allusions  Dennis's father tells him \\"No more Small England, or whatever it is\\". French teacher Miss Windsor cuts short a school detention, hoping to get home in time to watch Neighbours, though in America this reference has been changed to The Young and the Restless. On page 104, it is mentioned that Lisa has a purple dress she'd copied from one she'd seen Kylie Minogue wear at an awards do.  Publication history  The book was published in hardcover by HarperCollins in October 2008, with a paperback release scheduled for May 2009. Walliams and his comedy partner Matt Lucas recorded an audiobook of the story, also for HarperCollins, which was released in November 2008. HarperCollins were reported to have signed Walliams for a two-book deal. Film adaptation A television film adaptation was produced for BBC One, and aired on Boxing Day 2014 at 6:55pm. Filming began on 19 October 2014, according to Walliams' Official Twitter page. Casting for the episode was later announced on 21 October 2014.  Stage musical adaptation  A stage musical adaption of the book has been produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon for Christmas 2019 (with an anticipated West End transfer in 2020). The musical is adapted by Mark Ravenhill, features music and lyrics by Guy Chambers and Robbie Williams, and is directed by RSC artistic director Gregory Doran.

HistoryDevelopment= Following the successful inauguration of the Intercity- Express system in 1991 and the order to develop the ICE 2, in 1994 DB started plans to upgrade long-distance services using conventional lines, with comfort level raised near the ICE standard and higher speeds, with tilting electric multiple units to replace locomotive-pulled InterCity (IC) and InterRegio (IR) trains. DB assigned the name IC T to the project, with \\"T\\" standing for Triebzug (multiple unit). This development resulted in the ICE T. Later, Deutsche Bahn also saw the need for a similar new train on its non-electrified routes, and started the ICT-VT project, with \\"VT\\" standing for Verbrennungstriebwagen (internal combustion motor car). Deutsche Bahn pursued the development of the ICE 3, IC T and ICT-VT projects in parallel. The trains share a general styling concept, most prominently a lounge section in the front cars with a view forward at the tracks, being separated only by a glass wall from the driver's compartment. Technically, the trains share a lot of components and technical layout, as well as the concept of distributed traction: in contrast to the ICE 1 and ICE 2 designs, the new units were planned not with powerheads, but with peripheral underfloor motors, in order to reduce axle load (quite important for tilting trains) and increase tractive effort. For the ICT-VT, a four-car configuration was chosen, without a restaurant car, otherwise, Deutsche Bahn aimed for a common appearance and the greatest possible technical commonality with the IC T. Even the possibility of coupling together an electric and diesel train and operate them jointly was to be provided. =Production= In 1996, Deutsche Bahn placed an order for 20 diesel multiple units with a consortium led by Siemens. As for the ICE T, DWA (Bombardier) produced the end cars and Siemens produced the middle cars. The ICE TD was fitted with an electro-mechanic tilting actuator system developed by Siemens, rather than the Fiat (Alstom) Pendolino hydraulic system used in the ICE T. Also, the secondary suspension between bogie and carbody is air springs rather than metal coils for higher ride comfort. A characteristic element of the Siemens system visible on the outside is the crescent-shaped top of the outer carbody supports (above the bogie center). The tilting system also left room for electric motors on both axles in a bogie, thus every car of the diesel-electric train has an unpowered bogie and a powered bogie (2′Bo′ configuration). The power for the electric motors of the class 605 is generated by four diesel engines, one on each car, with 560 kW power each. These engines are based on engines for trucks. Electrically, the two halves of the train form two independent power units of two cars each, with the theoretical possibility of the addition of a fifth car as middle trailer. The first train was assembled in 1998, trials on track started in April 1999. During a test run on 13 January 2000, 222 km/h was achieved. Shortly before the first IC T entered service in 1999, the names of the electric and diesel trains were changed to ICE T and ICE TD respectively, with \\"T\\" now standing either for the English word tilt(ing) or the German Triebzug (trainset, trains with underfloor-engines as opposed to the older ICEs which consisted of carriages coupled between locomotives), and \\"TD\\" for tilt(ing) / trainset diesel. =Operations= 2nd class interior of the ICE TD An ICE TD aboard a ferry between Puttgarden and Rødby An ICE TD in DSB livery, seen in 2014 In 2001, all 20 units were commissioned for Deutsche Bahn, who took them as class 605. After pilot runs, the trains entered regular service on the new ICE line 17 between Dresden and Nuremberg on 10 June 2001. Shortly after, the trains were also used between Munich and Zurich as a replacement for EuroCity trains. Both of these routes between the major cities are partially not electrified, explaining the usage of diesel powered trains. The service life of the class 605 was rather ill-fated. The ICE TD units were plagued by technical problems from the start. After the breaking of an axle on 2 December 2002, all remaining 19 units (one fell off a working platform during maintenance) were grounded. Even though one year later the trains were admitted to service again, DB judged their operation to be overly expensive. DB must pay full diesel tax for the fuel. The trains were re-activated for a short time in anticipation of extra traffic during the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. From 2006, they were used for charter and relief trains. From the end of 2007, the class 605 was used in regular service on the Berlin-Hamburg-Copenhagen route, as a replacement for the Danish IC3 trains in Hamburg-Copenhagen service (Vogelfluglinie), due to delays in the introduction of DSB's IC4 trains, due to technical problems. The ten class 605 used in these services were equipped with the Danish ATC safety system. From 2008, the Denmark-compatible 605 were also used for Berlin-Hamburg-Aarhus services (previously, IC3 was used on the Flensburg-Aarhus route, and regional trains on Hamburg-Flensburg services). From mid-2009, three more ICE-TD units were used on Germany-Denmark services, allowing DSB to free up more IC3 trains for domestic use. On 11 December 2016, most class 605 trainsets were taken out of service.http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/deutsche-bahn-direktverbindung-nach- daenemark-droht-das-aus/11915488.html DB did not want to invest in the necessary major overhaul procedure where all components are checked and replaced if needed. DSB was offered the opportunity to buy the trainsets, but declined to do so. The trains suffered from overall high maintenance and operation costs.railjournal.com - DSB to withdraw ICE-TDs as DB terminates lease 1 June 2015 The Vogelfluglinie between Hamburg and Copenhagen continues to be operated with Danish IC3 trainsets as well as the Aarhus-Hamburg route, however both with fewer departures.

Life and career Born in Breslau (now Wroclaw) in Silesia in 1891. Between 1909 and 1911 he studied at the Königliche Kunst- und Kunstgewerbeschule (Royal Art and Crafts School) in Berlin. After World War I he worked briefly at the office of expressionist architect Erich Mendelsohn. In the 1920s he was active in the modernist architectural movement in Berlin, and associated with Bauhaus architects such as Walter Gropius and Ernst May. He was a member of Der Ring Berlin architectural collective. He published his influential work Glas. Im Bau und als Gebrauchsgegenstand (published in English as Glass in Modern Architecture) in 1929. After the Nazi rise to power he was forbidden to practice as an architect in Germany on account of being Jewish. He moved first to Yugoslavia, then, in 1938, to London. There he joined the Modern Architectural Research (MARS) Group where, as chair of the town planning subcommittee, he was involved in drawing up the modernist MARS plan for post war London published in 1942. Between 1941 and 1945 he taught architecture and planning at the Oxford School of Architecture, then in London from 1945, not only at the Architectural Association, where his teaching contribution became widely known, but also at the Hammersmith College of Art and Building, for whose School of Architecture he is credited as being one of the major influences in its re-emergence after the Second World War.http://www.hfhbg.org.uk/newsletters/Newsletter-15-Aut-06.pdf He was for many years a resident in the Isokon flats in Lawn Road, London, and retired in 1965 before moving to Austria in 1969.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/60598, accessed 27 December 2008.

The MARS Plan for London :\\"The plan for London issued by the Mars Group (the English wing of CIAM) and prepared by their Town Planning Committee was a marked contrast to anything that had gone before and, one might add, anything produced subsequently. It was frankly Utopian and Socialistic in concept.\\" Dennis Sharp, 1971. Influenced by the pan European CIAM (Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne), the MARS (Modern Architectural Research) Group were interested in applying the ideas of the modernist movement in Britain, most notably in a post war plan for London. As chair of the plan's governing committee at MARS, Arthur Korn worked with what was described as a 'small and devoted' group including architects Arthur Ling and Maxwell Fry, the latter who worked as secretary, and fellow Jewish emigre, engineer Felix Samuely.Pp 165–6 in Fry E. M. 1971, ' The MARS Group plan of London in Arthur Korn, Maxwell Fry, Dennis Sharp. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London.

R. 2000. 'Towards the functional city? MARS, CIAM and the London plans 1933–42. In Thomas Deckker, The Modern City Revisited. Oxford: Taylor and Francis. Influenced by the Soviet urbanist Milyutin, the plan essentially conceived the centre of the city remaining much the same but with a series of linear forms or tongues extending from the Thames, described as like a herring bone, composed of social units and based around the rail network.P. 167 in Sharp S. 1971.

Habitation in each social unit was to consist mainly of flats and owed much to Le Corbusier's notion of the Unite d'Habitation. Described as 'unworkable' by Dennis Sharp, in his 1971 essay on the plan, he concedes it 'was not a concrete scheme but a concept that would by its very nature produce interpretations'. Marmaras and Sutcliffe argue the plan 'saw London almost entirely in terms of movement ...[being] presented primarily as a centre of exchange and communications'.Pp. 434–40 in Marmaras E. and Sutcliffe A. 1994. Planning for post-war London: the three independent plans, 1942-3. In Planning Perspectives, 9, (1994) 431–453.

Samuely, A master plan for London, Architectural Review, 91, January (1942). 143–150. Korn's initial chairmanship of the plan was interrupted by his 18-month internship in the Isle of Man from 1939, on account of his German citizenship and perceived Communist sympathies, the period during which work on the plan fissled out. On his release, in 1941, work recommenced, an exhibition of the plan was organised and a 'description and analysis' was published under the joint authorship of Arthur Korn and Felix Samuely in the Architectural Association journal in 1942. Teaching years at the Architectural Association Arthur Korn taught at the Architectural Association in London, from 1945, for over 20 years. A year after his retirement, a collection of essays was published, edited by Dennis Sharp, to mark his time spent there. Sharp's preface referred to Korn's 'quiet achievement in influencing generations of architects and planners', through his work and his teaching.P.9 in Sharp D. 1967. 'Preface' in Dennis Sharp (ed.). 1967. Planning and Architecture. Essays presented to Arthur Korn by the Architectural Association.. London: Barrie and Rockliff. Edward Carter's introduction writes of Korn as teacher, who, at this best, gave the impression of 'a great performance', and describes how: :\\"The widening of his exposition from some explicit detail to a comprehensive view of life as a whole, illustrated with athletic gesture and by drawings which extended exuberantly across the blackboard to comprehend in one diagram a whole wealth of ideas, and all the time the flow of his emotive, witty multilingual words…\\".P.13 in Carter E. 1967. 'Introduction' in Dennis Sharp (ed.). 1967. Planning and Architecture. Essays presented to Arthur Korn by the Architectural Association.. London: Barrie and Rockliff.

'Arthur Korn: Man and Teacher' in Dennis Sharp (ed.). 1967. Planning and Architecture. Essays presented to Arthur Korn by the Architectural Association.. London: Barrie and Rockliff.

'Arthur Korn: Planner' in Dennis Sharp (ed.). 1967. Planning and Architecture. Essays presented to Arthur Korn by the Architectural Association.. London: Barrie and Rockliff. Whilst contributing to a retrospective analysis of the MARS plan for London, in 1971, Korn describes architecture as something in which: :\\"The battle between the machine-man and the analytical artist, between the collective and the individual, putting itself in order like the voice of music – free and according to mystic laws – repeats the ascension from the necessity of the constructive-analytical to the intuitive-artistic reality.\\".P.164 in Korn A. 1971, 'Arthur Korn' in Arthur Korn, Maxwell Fry, Dennis Sharp. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London.

The 1918 election took place in the heady atmosphere of victory in the First World War and the desire for revenge against Germany and its allies. Receiving the coupon was interpreted by the electorate as a sign of patriotism that helped candidates gain election, while those who did not receive it had a more difficult time as they were sometimes seen as anti- war or pacifist. The letters were all dated 20 November 1918 and were signed by prime minister David Lloyd George for the Coalition Liberals and Bonar Law, the leader of the Conservative Party. As a result, the 1918 general election has become known as \\"the coupon election\\". The name \\"coupon\\" was coined by Liberal leader H. H. Asquith, disparagingly using the jargon of rationing with which people were familiar in the context of wartime shortages. Text of the letter The letters all contained the same simple text: Some coalition candidates included the wording of the letter in their election addresses.Roy Douglas, History of the Liberal Party: 1895-1970; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p.121 Who received the Coupon? Following confidential negotiations between Lloyd George's coalition Chief Whip, Freddie Guest, and George Younger, Chairman of the Conservative Party, over the summer of 1918, it was agreed that 150 Liberals were to be offered the support of the prime minister and the leader of the Conservative Party at the next general election.K.

A few of these were Independent Liberals, supporters of Asquith. Of those Liberals receiving the \\"coupon\\" 136 were elected, whereas only 29 who did not receive the \\"coupon\\" were returned to Parliament.Wilson, op cit p393 In addition to the Liberal and Conservative candidates who received the \\"coupon\\", some letters were also sent to Labour supporters of the Coalition (although most were repudiated by the official Labour Party)David Powell, British Politics, 1910-1935; Routledge, 2004 p80 and some to members of the patriotic, working class party the National Democratic Party. Impact on Liberal candidates As Margaret Cole’s memoir of the time makes clear, many competent and patriotic candidates who did not receive the coupon, including sitting Liberal and Labour MPs, found themselves categorised as somehow anti-war or pacifist as a result.Margaret Cole, Women of Today; Nelson & Sons, 1938 republished by Read Books, 2007 p126 Percy Harris, who had been MP for Harborough since 1916 recorded that once the coupon had been allocated to his Conservative opponent it was interpreted as a personal reflection upon him by his constituents who assumed he must have done something wrong for the Liberal Prime Minister to be seen offering his open support to a rival.Percy Harris, Forty Years In and Out of Parliament; Andrew Melrose 1949 p76 Most historians have since agreed that the coupon essentially sealed the fate of those Liberals who were not fortunate enough to receive the Coalition's backing. Those Liberals that Lloyd George chose to abandon were left defenceless against Coalition candidates, who had a full claim on the spirit of national unity and patriotism that characterised Britain's war weary mood following the end of hostilities.The 1918 coupon election; Liberal Democrat History Group website, 2008: http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=58&item;=history The election result was catastrophic for these Asquithian Independent Liberals, who were decimated in the Coupon election. Only 28 were returned, and even Asquith lost the seat he had held in East Fife since the 1886 general election.The Times, House of Commons 1919; Politico’s Publishing, 2004 p10 References Category:Coalition governments Category:1918 in the United Kingdom Category:1918 in British politics Category:Liberal Party (UK) Category:History of the Conservative Party (UK) Category:Political terms in the United Kingdom Category:1918 United Kingdom general election ","title":"Coalition Coupon"},{"id":"20846973","text":"Panayannarkavu is a small village on Parumala Island in the Pamba River in Thiruvalla taluk of Pathanamthitta district in Kerala, India.

Rugby league career Born in Queensland but raised on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Bliss, nicknamed Blistering for his outstanding speed, was a scrawny Manly district junior who started out as a with the North Narabeen Surf Club. He was shifted to the as 16-year-old after his coach Tom Ballard saw him packing into a scrum and then showing incredible pace in general play. Ballard told him \\"You're too fast for a hooker boy - you're now on the wing\\". As the Manly club wouldn't have a first grade team until 1947, he was graded with Balmain in 1939. He went to North Sydney in 1941 but the Tigers claimed him on residence grounds for the 1942 and 1943 seasons (at the time a player was bound to play for the club in whose city zone he lived and a transfer involved proving residence for 12 months prior). Bliss's general play, speed and try scoring ability was first recognized in 1945 when he was chosen for City firsts in the annual City vs Country match. He would go on to play four games for City (1945, 1947, 1948 and 1951), scoring three tries. In 1947 he moved to Manly and played on the wing in their first ever premiership match against Western Suburbs at Brookvale Oval, scoring a try in the teams hard fought 13–15 loss to Wests. Bliss topped the try scoring for the North Sydney Bears in 1944 scoring seven tries, including a club record 5 tries in the 51–10 win over Easts in round 9 at North Sydney Oval, and again topped the list in 1945, scoring nine tries. He would also top Manly's try scoring list in 1947 and 1950, scoring 10 tries in each season. In 1947 he played the first of six games for New South Wales, scoring a total of nine tries between 1947 and his last game in 1951. He was selected to represent Sydney against France during their 1951 tour of Australasia in a match that ended in a 19-all draw. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo number 281.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 53 Also in 1951, Bliss was selected on the wing for Australia for the first test against the Puig Aubert led France at the Sydney Cricket Ground. France ran out easy 26-15 winners in front of 60,160 fans. Following a poor game in which he, along with several teammates were criticized for 'timid tackling' (even though he twice ran down French players saving what looked to be certain tries), Bliss was one of six players dropped for the second test held in Brisbane. This was to be the only international match Bliss was selected for in his career. Unfortunately for Bliss, his form dropped off after his one off test appearance and he was dropped from first grade before the semi-finals. He returned to the side for the final but missed selection in Manly's first ever grand final appearance against South Sydney that year through injury, the Sea Eagles going down 14–42 to the Rabbitohs at the Sydney Sports Ground. In total Bliss played 121 games and scored 78 tries during his NSWRL career. After his retirement, Bliss was the speed guru to several Manly players, including Bob Fulton, Graham Eadie, Russell Gartner and fellow beach sprint champion Nick Yakich. Beach sprinting Bliss was also a beach sprint champion. He won 12 Australian championships in a row from 1939 to 1952. He attempted a comeback at the age of 38 to win the 1960 NSW title. Bliss was an exceptionally fast runner. During the 1947 season, decked out in full football gear including heavy leather football boots and carrying a football, Bliss clocked 11.1 seconds over 110 yards and also recorded 9.9 seconds over 100 yards. Personal life and death Bliss was also a success in the world of men's toiletries and women's perfumery, working for two of the biggest names in the business, Faberge and Christian Dior. Bliss, who was known as a practical joker and someone who loved life, died from the effects of a brain tumor on 9 September 1974, at the age of 52.

There are forty-nine full-time academic staff and over one thousand students. The current Head of the School of Law is Professor Iain MacNeil. The 2019 Complete University Guide league rankings placed Glasgow at 2nd in the UK while the 2019 rankings from The Guardian placed Glasgow at ninth in the UK. The 2018 The Times league rankings placed Glasgow at 4th in the UK. History At the University's foundation in 1451, there were four original faculties: Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. Both Canon and Civil Law were taught, however by the sixteenth Century, instruction in both of these had fallen out of practice. It was during this time that James Dalrymple of Stair came to Glasgow to study for an M.A. (1633–1637) and then became a regent (1641–1647) teaching philosophy. He went on to become Lord President of the Court of Session in 1671, and published his Institutions of the Law of Scotland in 1681, the first systematic exposition of Scots Law. The Stair Building, where the School of Law is housed, is named in his honour. In 1713, Queen Anne endowed the Regius Chair of Law at the University. The first occupant of the Chair (from 1714) was William Forbes, and subsequent notable Professors have included John Millar, William Gloag, David Walker and Joe Thomson. This revived the teaching of Law at Glasgow, and subsequent Chairs included the Chair of Conveyancing, established in 1861 by the Faculty of Procurators; the Douglas Chair of Civil Law in 1948; the Chair in Jurisprudence (1952); in Public Law (1965); and the John Millar Chair of Law in 1985, named for the previously mentioned Regius Professor of Law. In 1984, the Faculty of Law became the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies, and in 1992, the individual legal departments were grouped together into the School. In 2005, the Faculty merged with the Faculty of Social Sciences, becoming the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences. On 1 August 2010 the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Science was combined with the Adam Smith Business School, the School of Social and Political Studies, the School of Education and the School of Interdisciplinary Studies into a new College of Social Sciences. Academia The School of Law is housed in the Stair Building (named for Viscount Stair), a row of internally connected terraced houses on The Square opposite the University Chapel. The School is associated with traditional Scots law teaching and with internationally recognised research across a wide range of subjects including Corporate Law and Financial Regulation, Intellectual Property Law, and Law and Security. CREATe CREATe is the RCUK research centre for copyright and new business models in the creative economy. With an ambitious programme of 40 projects delivered by an interdisciplinary team of academics (law, cultural economics, management, computer science, sociology, psychology, ethnography and critical studies), the centre is a pioneering academic initiative designed to help the UK cultural and creative industries thrive and become innovation leaders within the global digital economy. CREATe will examine the business, regulatory and cultural infrastructure of the cultural and creative industries by exploring cutting-edge questions around digitisation, copyright, and innovation in the arts and technology.

The School comes within the College of Social Science constituency on the Students' Representative Council. =Law Society= The Glasgow University Law Society organises social activities for students at the School of Law, including the annual Law Ball, held every February. The event is of a comparable size to the GUSA Ball, and because of the number of students attending it is necessary to hold the event in city centre hotels as there is no hall in the University large enough to accommodate it. The Society co-ordinate various different events, focusing around being either social, academic or charity, headed by their respective Convenor. Membership is open to all students of the School of Law, and the Society is affiliated to the SRC. The Society publishes the Glasgow University Law Review, an annual publication containing legal articles written by members of the Society. =Mooting= The School of Law has a student-run Mooting Society, which runs an internal competition, The Dean's Cup, as well as organising the Alexander Stone National Legal Debate. All Scottish universities offering the LL.B. are entitled to enter this, although the competition is generally between Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities. The final is held in February or March each year in the Alexander Stone Court Room on the ground floor of the Stair Building. University of Strathclyde currently holds the trophy. The Sheriff's Cup, organised by Glasgow Sheriff Court, is an inter-varsity event held between Glasgow and Strathclyde and judged by a Senator of the College of Justice. The moot is held annually and takes place in one of the larger court rooms at Glasgow Sheriff Court.

However, there are some differences between standard methods that can influence the results obtained: for example, some calculations assume that nitrogen released from organic compounds is generated as ammonia, whereas others allow for ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Therefore, in expressing results, the calculation assumptions should always be stated. In order to determine the ThOD for glycine (CH2(NH2)COOH) using the following assumptions: #In the first step, the organic carbon and nitrogen are converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia (NH3), respectively. #In the second and third steps, the ammonia is oxidized sequentially to nitrite and nitrate. #The ThOD is the sum of the oxygen required for all three steps. We can calculate by following steps: #Write balanced reaction for the carbonaceous oxygen demand.

From there it has spread to other parts of Puglia and to neighbouring regions. History The Garganica is indigenous to the Gargano, and derives from cross-breeding of local animals with goats imported from western Europe, probably at the same time as the importation of Merino sheep that led to the formation of the Gentile di Puglia sheep breed. The Garganica is one of the eight autochthonous Italian goat breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders. The breed standard was approved in 1976. Numbers have fallen sharply in recent years; In 1870 there were 33,725 head; by 2002 this had fallen to 18,000. The conservation status of the breed was listed as \\"endangered\\" by the FAO in 2007. In 2008 the total population was estimated at 3000, of which 511 were registered in the herdbook. At the end of 2013 the registered population was 773. Characteristics The animals are of medium height and not heavy: adult males typically weigh 65 kg, and females 50 kg. The heads are rather small and adults have long, coarse black or dark chestnut hair. The skin of the kids are prized for their curly, raven-black hair. The breed is noted for its toughness and is well suited to being raised in a wild state in very difficult habitats. Use The milk yield of the Garganica is reported as 120 litres in 180 days for primiparous nannies, and 170 l in 210 days for pluriparous ones, in one source; another gives a yield of 180–250 l. The milk is used to make the traditional regional cheeses of the Gargano, including canestrato and cacioricotta del Gargano. The meat is used to make muscisca, a traditional food of transhumant pastoralists. Strips of goat's meat are salted, flavoured with garlic, and air- or sun-dried.

It was located in Lund, Skåne, now southern Sweden, formerly part of Denmark.  History  St. Peter's Priory was established before 1166 during the tenure of Eskil, Archbishop of Lund, for Benedictine nuns. It was originally dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Peter, but by 1200 it was simply referred to as St. Peter's Priory. The original church was built in the latter half of the 1160s of sandstone with the rounded arches of the Romanesque style. The church was rebuilt in brick and expanded about 1300 in the Gothic style. The entire complex consisted of three ranges with the priory church forming the fourth side of a quadrilateral enclosure. The complex included a dormitory, refectory and cellars, and a wing for lay sisters. The church over time came into possession of many income properties which paid rents to sustain the priory. There are records of several exchanges of farms between St. Peter's Priory and the chapter of Lund Cathedral. In the course of the Reformation Denmark became officially a Lutheran kingdom in October 1536. All religious houses and their many acquired income properties reverted to the crown. The entire archive of the priory was lost except for a few letters regarding the disposition of the priory near the time of the Reformation. The last letter of the prioress, dated 1537, giving up the priory is found among them. The estate was given to Eskil Oxe by the crown until 1565 when it passed into the possession of Jorgen and Inger Brahe, the maternal uncle and aunt of Tycho Brahe, the famous Danish astronomer. About 1600 all the conventual buildings were demolished, leaving the priory church to serve as the parish church of St Peter's. The burial ground continued to be used for burials until modern times.

At the age of 17, Leming dropped out of high school and began traveling across the United States to play shows while living out of his car. He eventually caught the eye of executives at Warner Brothers Records who signed him to his first major label record deal in 2008. Leming's debut album, Come On Kid, from Warner Bros. came out September 13, 2010. His main influences are Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Ryan Adams and The Rolling Stones. Biography Josiah Leming was born in Morristown, Tennessee. He was raised by his mother and stepfather alongside four brothers and four sisters, six of whom are adopted. Leming first learned the piano when he was eight years old, after his mother purchased a Casio keyboard for nothing. He also played his grandmother's piano during visits to her house, and participated in school musicals and choirs. Described as \\"self-taught\\", he also credits an \\"elderly piano instructor\\" for his early musical education. By 13, Leming was writing his own music. A friend introduced him to musicians DC Talk, Coldplay and Travis, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Ryan Adams, and The Smiths at 15. They had some influence on Leming's musical style. When he was 16, Leming began to perform locally. He dropped out of high school and left Morristown at 17, in an attempt to both make it as a musician and find a way to support his large and struggling family. Leming played in clubs and coffeehouses throughout the Southeast while working at restaurants and temp agencies to pay for food and gas.\\"Josiah Leming Completes His Debut Album for Warner Bros.

Leming is the self- proclaimed \\"biggest fan\\" of Lena Dunham's HBO series Girls. Musical career In 2007 Leming self-released The Paperplain EP and Her EP on his MySpace page for digital download—neither EP is available now. Leming signed a record deal with Warner Bros. in 2008 and began work on his debut album Come on Kid. To promote the album, Warner Bros. released Angels Undercover EP in 2008 and Punk Ass Rain EP in 2009. Meanwhile, Leming recorded Come on Kid in London and Los Angeles, with the help of producers Jesse Owen Astin, Martin Terefe, Warren Huart and David Kosten. Two songs from Angels Undercover EP are featured on the album--\\"To Run\\" and \\"Arctic Outcry Wind\\". Come on Kid was released on September 13, 2010, after some delays. \\"It was emotional, and it took a long time,\\" Leming tells Billboard.com. \\"In order to make an album that everybody was happy with, and also that I felt good about, it took the good part of two years to kind of wrangle that in.\\"Former 'Idol' Standout Josiah Leming to Drop Debut Album in September  Billboard.com While these delays were rumored to have been caused by contract disputes with 19 Entertainment,\\"American Idol Producers Never Intended To Block Josiah Leming's Debut Album\\", November 11, 2008, by James Montgomery for MTVNews.

Come on Kid failed commercially, which prompted Warner Bros. to drop Leming from the label in late 2010. Leming recorded music independently in Burbank, California for three years before returning to Tennessee in early Fall 2011. He released a new single \\"What You've Taken\\" on February 6, 2011, in conjunction with the launch of his official website. The single was available on his website for free download until March 6, 2011. Leming plays in different venues across the country to promote his music. In addition, he does a live 30-minute broadcast on Stickam usually every Sunday at 6:30 PDT, performing his songs and updating viewers on the progress of his musical career. He also regularly updates his Facebook and Twitter page. During a live Stickam broadcast on July 24, 2011, Leming announced he will self-release his second album September 2011; however, he later pushed the release date to October or November 2011. Leming released three singles from his second album in anticipation of its release. On September 24, 2011, he released a studio recorded version of his well-known song, \\"One Last Song\\". \\"Too Young\\" was released on October 24, 2011, followed by \\"Another Life\\" on November 10, 2011.

Leming's \\"To Run\\" is the only song written by an American Idol contestant to be covered in the Kidz Bop series. On American Idol Leming is the only contestant in the history of American Idol to not make the 'Top 24' and land a major label record deal.\\"‘American Idol’ Bigwigs Threaten Legal Action Over Contestant Josiah Leming’s Major Label Debut\\" He was a contestant on Season 7 of American Idol; the producers were interested in his life as a traveling musician living out of his car. In an interview with MTV News, Leming said he was disappointed with how they portrayed his life as a \\"sob story\\". \\"I wanted to stand on my voice, and my own two feet,\\" he explained, \\"but they wanted to know about the story and they wanted to use it. I definitely wasn't going for the sympathy vote.\\" He became a popular contestant after singing his rendition of \\"Grace Kelly\\" by English singer Mika. However, Leming did not make it to the top 24 for his performance of \\"Stand by Me\\" by Ben E. King; Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul refused to side with Simon Cowell in his wish to see Leming advance to the semi-finals. Leming later admitted the performance was poor. \\"I didn't know that song, so I was trying to make it my own, and I focused more on the words than the melody. And that's why it was kind of all messed up.\\" He wanted to sing \\"Take Me Out\\" by Franz Ferdinand, but was not allowed to—Leming did not know why. Cowell is on record saying that he feels it was a mistake not to put Leming through to the next round, having stated: \\"We should have put him through. I was all for it.

Leming's controversial ouster is widely believed[by whom?] to be one factor behind the return of wild cards to the selection process in Season 8.

In addition, many label representatives called him, and producers of The Ellen DeGeneres Show invited Leming to make a guest appearance, which he accepted.

Selected 39th overall in the 2009 NFL draft, he spent four years with the Jacksonville Jaguars followed by two with the Chicago Bears, last playing football in 2014. Britton started 23 games at right tackle, 7 at left guard, and 4 as a sixth eligible lineman, for a total of 34 career starts in 60 games played. He played college football at Arizona. High school career Britton attended John Burroughs High School in Burbank, California. As a senior in 2004 he was named Foothill League co-Lineman of the Year and was an All-State second-team selection. Other recognition included Los Angeles Times All-Region San Fernando Valley, Super Prep All-American, and PrepStar All-West honors. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Britton was listed as the No. 16 offensive tackle prospect in the nation. In addition to playing football, Britton also lettered in basketball and track, setting school records in shot put and discus. College career Britton played college football at the University of Arizona, redshirting his first year in 2005. During his first year of athletic competition in 2006, Britton recorded 83 knockdowns and 11 touchdown-resulting blocks while playing at the right tackle position. His blocking consistency grade of 84.5 percent was the second-highest in the Pac-10 and he earned first-team Freshman All-American honors. In 2007, Britton established himself as one of top pass protectors in college football, earning All-American and All-Pac-10 Conference recognition. He led the nation's right tackles in blocking consistency grading and his 15 touchdown-resulting blocks were tied for most by an active NCAA Division I-A player. Playing the 2008 season at left tackle, Britton registered 111 knockdowns and 17 touchdown- resulting blocks, leading the conference as well as setting school records in both categories. He was recognized with All-American honorable mention and first-team All-Pac-10 accolades for his efforts. Following the season Britton decided to forego his final year of athletic eligibility and enter the 2009 NFL draft. Professional career2009 NFL draft= In a draft loaded with talented offensive linemen, Britton was considered to be one of the better players available, drawing comparisons to Joe Thomas. He was deemed \\"not athletic enough to be a consistent pass blocker against the faster pass rushers\\" at left tackle however, and therefore was projected to \\"have a long, solid career on the right side\\". Initially thought of as a potential first- rounder, Britton fell to the second round, where he was selected 39th overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars. Reportedly angry about not being drafted in the first round, Britton said: \\"I'm gonna work my ass off for the Jacksonville Jaguars and people are gonna regret it. I've got my own agenda, and that's first and foremost to take the Jacksonville Jaguars to the Super Bowl. Secondly, I'm gonna be the greatest offensive tackle to ever play this game.\\" =Jacksonville Jaguars= In an effort to rebuild their offensive line, the Jaguars selected Eugene Monroe and Britton with their first two picks in the 2009 NFL draft. After signing a four-year, $4.6 million deal with the Jaguars on August 1, 2009, Britton entered into a preseason battle with Tony Pashos for the starting right tackle position. After winning out the competition, Britton and Monroe became the first pair of rookie offensive tackles to start together on opening day since the 1982 NFL season. Britton started 15 games on the year, missing only the fourth week due to a knee injury. Britton remained a starter on the Jaguars offense through the first seven games of the 2010 season. During week 7 against Kansas City his right shoulder popped out multiple times however, eventually requiring three team doctors to pop it back in. The injury was subsequently determined to be a torn labrum, requiring surgery and an end to his season. Britton missed the entire 2011 preseason and the first game of the regular season after undergoing surgery during training camp to repair a herniated disc. He then played in weeks 2 through 5, splitting time at the left guard and right tackle positions. Prior to the sixth game his back problems worsened however, to the point that he was barely able to walk. The problem was eventually determined to be an infection stemming from the back surgery he underwent earlier in the year. Britton missed the rest of the season recovering. Starting the 2012 season at left guard, Britton suffered an ankle injury during the season opener and missed the next two games. He lost his starting job after the sixth game of the season and finished the year with 5 starts in 11 games played. =Chicago Bears= Britton signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Bears in April 2013. He appeared in 13 games and started four, spending the majority of his playing time as a sixth eligible lineman. Britton signed another one-year contract with Chicago in April 2014. After missing most of training camp and the preseason with a hamstring injury he was released as part of final roster cuts, only to be re-signed one week later after two of the Bears starting offensive lineman were injured in the season opener. Britton appeared in 10 games for the season but did not start any. He missed five games due to appendix surgery. In April 2015 the NFL announced that Britton would be suspended four games for an unspecified policy violation. Britton later revealed he had tested positive for Ritalin during the 2014 season, the circumstances of which he explained in an essay penned for The Cauldron. Britton never served the suspension however as he did not sign with any team after his 2014 contract expired. Cannabis use and advocacy Britton is an advocate for removing cannabis from the list of banned substances in the NFL. Britton says he used cannabis as a preferred method of pain management during his football career, and has cited the health risks associated with pharmaceutical painkillers as a reason why players should not be punished for choosing a natural alternative. Britton is a member of the Gridiron Cannabis Coalition, a group that advocates for the NFL to change its policy on cannabis. He is also a member of the Doctors for Cannabis Regulation NFL steering committee. Britton revealed in a September 2016 interview with the New York Post that he used cannabis before three of the NFL games he played in. Britton says that in addition to relieving the pain of his injuries, cannabis also improved his mental concentration on the football field, and that the games he played after using were some of his best performances. Britton also estimated that over 50 percent of current players use cannabis and that the number could be as high as 75 percent. Britton is a board member of Athletes for Care, a group that advocates for athletes on various issues of health and safety including the use of cannabis as medicine. Through Athletes for Care, Britton co-hosts the Caveman Poet Society podcast along with Nate Jackson. Personal life Britton graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in creative writing. As a writer he has contributed essays to Leafly, Playboy, and The Cauldron. In April 2012, Britton began hosting a radio show on NPR affiliate WJCT-FM in Jacksonville, Florida. Named Number 73 in reference to his jersey number, it featured a mixture of music and literary material woven together around a central theme that varied with each show. Some of the writings featured were composed by Britton himself. Britton's maternal grandparents are author Richard Gehman and actress Estelle Parsons, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1967 for her role in Bonnie and Clyde, and who furthermore gained recognition for her role as Bev Harris in popular situation comedy television program Roseanne. His aunt is actress Martha Gehman. He is named after his great-grandfather Eben Parsons, the father of Estelle. Britton's father Jeff is a painter and played college basketball at Jacksonville University. His mother Abbie is a journalist and owns a personal training business. In 2018, Britton appeared in the Netflix documentary Take Your Pills in which he discusses his use of Adderall to treat ADD and to improve focus while he was in the NFL. In 2019, Britton began co- hosting the Hotboxin' with Mike Tyson podcast.

Background  After the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, the Primera Junta government invited the other cities and provinces to join the revolution. Any intent of preserving the local governments previous to the revolution were considered hostile; and as a consequence two military campaigns were launched to suppress the resistance, one to Upper Peru and another to Paraguay, whose Spanish governor, Bernardo de Velasco, had refused to recognize the Junta and had received political support from the Cabildo of Asunción. General Manuel Belgrano, a member of the Junta, was named commander of the expedition with only 700 men, half of them without military experience. Even though his forces were small, the extreme prudence of Velasco got them to fight first at Paraguarí, near Asunción, where he was defeated with relative ease. Forced to retreat, Belgrano marched to the Tebicuary river, where he was joined by 400 men from the Guaraní militias from Yapeyú and some men from the Fatherland Cavalry Regiment (ex-Blandengues). As noted in his Memoirs, the Paraguayans did not pursue, and he could continue retreating to the town of Santa Rosa. There he received news that the situation was worsening at the Banda Oriental, so the Junta was ordering him to end the Paraguay campaign soon so he could help in the new theater of operations. On his part Belgrano requested reinforcements and decided to stop the retreat at the Tacuarí river and establish a defensive position. He was confident that with reinforcements from Buenos Aires he could maintain the position.Instituto Nacional Belgraniano The help sent by the Junta consisted of a small naval squadron travelling north on the Paraná River. This flotilla, composed of three small ships under the command of Juan Bautista Azopardo was defeated on March 2, 1811 at San Nicolás de los Arroyos, so Belgrano was left without reinforcements. The Paraguayans advanced after Belgrano, expecting he would retread without combat after the defeat at Paraguarí. The vanguard was under the command of Fulgencio Yegros and the main army under General Manuel Cabañas, with a total of 3,000 men, plus a reinforcement of three pieces of artillery.  The battle  Military operations in Paraguay (December 1810 − March 1811 Velazco had communicated to Cabañas by letter on January 29: The Paraguayan forces under Cabañas consisted of a total of 1,400 men and 10 artillery pieces. Cabañas directly commanded 1.000 men with a division under commander Blas José de Rojas, 200 men from Villarrica with 7 pieces of artillery, an advance force under commander Fulgencio Yegros with two squadrons of cavalry (urban militias from Villarrica, Villa Real de Concepción and Caazapá) and five companies of infantry under captain Pedro Juan Caballero, captain Antonio Tomás Yegros, commander García, commander José Mariano Recalde and sub-lieutenant Pedro Pablo Miers. These forces were complemented by 400 men under commander Juan Manuel Gamarra with three pieces of artillery under the command of Pascual Urdapilleta. On the morning of March 7 the Paraguayan troops joined in one place with the arrival of Gamarra's forces to the right side of the Tacuary river. Cabañas wrote that day to Velazco:Fulgencio Yegros On March 8 a bridge over the river was finished and the Paraguayan troops commenced to cross. On March 9, the Paraguayans attacked the front of Belgrano's position. He was reinforced behind the Tacuarí river, forcing Cabañas's forces to cross the river under enemy fire, but Cabañas left only part of his forces to cross directly, including all the artillery, and advanced with the rest through a man-made path through the jungle. Through a path opened specifically for this operation, Cabañas attacked the enemy at their flank. Colonel José Machain moved to the side to repel them, but was surrounded by Paraguayan cavalry and forced to surrender. Therefore, Belgrano left only a few men in a defensive position and marched to help Machain. Commanding the defenders at the river crossing was major Celestino Vidal, who was left almost blind by cannon fire. Belgrano refused to surrender under Cabañas request, and maintained a steady resistance, which forced the Paraguayans to stop their advance. Rapidly, Belgrano retreated with the remainder of his army to a nearby hill. From there he sent a communication to Cabañas, saying Cabañas took that communique as a request for armistice, and ordered Belgrano to abandon the province completely in one day.  Consequences  Manuel Belgrano and Manuel Cabañas embraced after the battle. Even though his army suffered a serious defeat, there are some accomplishments by Belgrano from his defense at Tacuarí. In first place, he succeeded in extracting an important part of the army from Paraguay, about 400 men, including the prisoners captured with Machain. These men would form the future United Provinces army that would fight at the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay), supporting the local militia commanded by José Artigas. Belgrano wrote a proposal that general Cabañas took to Asunción to form the base for a peace treaty between Asunción and Buenos Aires; this included free commerce between the two capitals and the formation of a new local government in Asunción. He also requested this new government to send a representative that would form part of the Government (Junta) in Buenos Aires and would negotiate all the reparations that would be paid by Buenos Aires for the war they took to Paraguay. Belgrano made the condition that this would require at the formation of a local autonomous government (outside of Spain and the Royalists) and that it recognized the rebel government in Buenos Aires. His best success, in any case, was to have Paraguay start to seriously consider independence from Spain, even without joining the United Provinces. In effect, shortly after May 14, the Paraguayans declared their independence from Spain (on May 17) and formed their first government after a peaceful rebellion at Asuncion that forced the resignation of the entire city and provincial councils, after a plan to have Portuguese troops from Brazil as reinforcements to the Spanish troops as counterweight to the Argentine troops was exposed. Among their first proponents were several of the victors at Tacuarí, especially Fulgencio Yegros. Belgrano's campaign did not accomplish their goal of having Paraguay to form part of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, joined by the other ex-provinces of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. Due to his military defeat in Paraguay the Primera Junta in Buenos Aires opened a Court Martial for Belgrano on June 6, 1811, even though they did not have a definite charge against him, instead a people's petition (petición del pueblo) to make the charges that would be appropriate. Nobody presented any charges against him, and the officers under his command in the Paraguay campaign did not have any complaints and defended his patriotism and irreproachable conduct. Finally, the government decided on August 9, 1811 to absolve him of all charges and published the verdict in the Buenos Ayres Gazettebased on the excerpt El proceso a Belgrano, in Crónica Histórica Argentina, Tome I, page 253, (1968) CODEX. The Drummer boy of Tacuarí The Drummer of Tacuarí. There is an Argentine myth about a child called the \\"Drummer of Tacuarí\\" who would have been involved in the battle. It is said that it was a 12 years old child, acting as military drummer in the first lines of battle, being guide of the above-mentioned commander Celestino Vidal and was playing a snare drum. It is also said that his name was Pedrito Ríos, that he was born in Concepción del Uruguay and that he died in the battle. However, this child is not mentioned in battle reports of the time, either the immediate ones or others made days or months later. The first mention to the drummer of Tacuarí was formulated 45 years after the battle, and depicted shortly after in a portrait with a 50-year-old blind man (however, Vidal was nearly 21 years old when the battle took place). This portrait would be based on many improbable ideas: that the army was led by a blind man (in real life Vidal was almost blind due to cannon fire), that a 12 years old child would be allowed in the front lines, and that a child might be able to serve both as guide of a blind man and a military drummer in the middle of a battle between Argentines and Spanish royalists. This myth has made way into Argentine military history, a legend told through the years. In light of this, today, the \\"Tacuari Drummer\\" Regimental Band of the 1st Regiment of Foot Infantry \\"Patricios\\" has a young snare drummer in its ranks, bringing this story to the 21st-century Argentina. This is the only Argentine Military band to have a child play as a military musician, in tribute to the young drummer from Concepcion del Uruguay who used his talent, at the cost of his life, to bring victory to the Argentine forces and would result, indirectly, in Paraguay's independence days after, with several of the victorious royalist officers and soldiers supporting it.

Given name was traditional for Volga Bulgarians for centuries, family name appeared in the end of the 19th century, when it replaced patronymic. In fact, usage of family name appeared when Russian scribers gave documents to Bulgarians. Later, being adapted to Soviet tradition, Volga Bulgarians started to use patronymic as third element, especially in informal communication. Given first name As in Western cultures, a person has a first name chosen by his or her parents. The first name is used before the last name (surname) in most cases and is given so into the main European languages. For usage in other cases see: Names in Russian Empire, Soviet Union and CIS countries. For Tatars living or born in Russia, every Tatar name has a transliteration in Russian language, due Tatarstan citizens use passports where their names are written in both official languages, Tatar and Russian. Russian version of Tatar name could significantly differ from original Tatar pronunciation, it also could be transliterated into different ways. So, English spelling depends on language from which text is translated. This situations isn't common for all non-Slavic people of Russia. Chuvashes and Keräşen Tatars, for example, use Russian (Orthodox Christian) names as official, but they also has their own renderings, that they use as informal. Modern Tatar names could be divided into several groups by their origin: Bulgar names, Oriental names, European names, \\"revolutionary\\" names, that appeared in the early Soviet Union, but are still popular. The usage of Slavic or Christian name is uncommon. Examples (most popular) are shown later. Cyrillic and various Russian variants of names are shown in brackets. Translation or some comments are given later. Bulgar names Bulgar names are names that could be translated from Bulgar language. Sometimes Mongolian and the earliest Arabic and other loans also are described as Bulgar. A significant part of those names were used since pre-history. After the islamization of Volga Bulgaria Arab names were spread among nobility, but some of them also had Bulgar names. Example is a gravestone of noble woman Altın Börtek (Golden Seed) that was found in Qaban settlement and dates back to the 12th century. Often some person has two names. The real name was probably Islamic, but Bulgar name was used to scare away spirits, that may plunge child into woe. Some of those Bulgar names that are still in common use could mean that this child is strong and healthy. For example, name Mintimer could be translated as I'm iron. During the 19th century Bulgar names were dislodged by Perso-Arab names. In the 1920s during the repressions of religion Tatars returned to Bulgarian names (some of them were just now invented, such as Aygöl). In modern history the most popularity of Bulgar names had fallen on 1980s-1990s. =Male names= *Alim (Алим) - Wise *Almas (Алмас), sometimes could be confused with Almaz, that has Arabic origin and means brilliant.

Male names often ended with -ulla (Allah), -din (religion), -abd (slave of the God), -can /spells: -jun/ (soul): Xäliulla, Islametdin, Sabircan. Also popular were different variants of the name Mohammad: Dinmöxämmäd, Möxämmätsafa, Möxämmätcan. Female names often were chosen from Mohammad's wives' and daughters' names: Ğäyşä, Zäynäp, Fatíma.

A major part of them were names of famous persons, so the name Albert became popular after Albert Einstein. Sometimes names or surnames of revolutionaries were chosen as given name, such as Ernest after Ernst Thälmann or Fidel after Fidel Castro Ruz. Some of them, such as Erot, Adolf, Klara and Roald, are no longer popular, others were adopted and non-Tatar populations refer to those names as Tatar names. Urban legend says that European names were loaded from a group of Genoese merchants, which merged with Tatars in the Middle Ages.

Reading has a Glyph mode, which gives the player a word that has a prefix and a suffix. Next to the word are several images that can be used to construct the word. In the other Reading mode, Predictions, sentences with two words missing are shown to the player, who must fill in the blanks. The Writing section contains the Ante Up Grade and Writing Wrong modes. In Ante Up Grade, the player is given one part of a sentence and three possible phrases that can complete it. The Writer Wrong mode provides a sentence and asks the player to identify if it has any errors; if there is one, then the player must identify where it is. Afterward, the player must choose the phrase that corrects the sentence. The Math section features the Grid Swap mode that gives the player four math questions and a grid with scrambled numbers; the solutions to each question are found in the grid. The Connection mode lets the player choose one of two problems to solve; four possible solutions are then presented, requiring the player to choose the correct answer to each question. Reception futureU was given a score of 6.8 of 10 from video game critic website IGN, which found that the game was a decent and affordable SAT preparation program, despite several interface issues.

It is the largest distillery owned by Scotch whisky producer Distell Group Limited, who also own Bunnahabhain Distillery on the Isle of Islay and Tobermory distillery on the Isle of Mull. Deanston Distillery started life in 1785 as a cotton mill designed by Sir Richard Arkwright, and remained as such for 180 years until it was transformed into a distillery in 1966. The constant supply of pure water from the River Teith contributed to the decision to turn the mill into a distillery and Deanston is now the only distillery in Scotland to be self-sufficient in electricity, with power generated by an on-site hydro-energy facility. Deanston sits in the Highland single malt region of Scotland and produces whisky which is handmade by ten local craftsmen, un-chill filtered, natural colour and bottled at a strength of 46.3% ABV. History Deanston first acquired its name in 1500, when Walter Drummond (the Dean of Dunblane) inherited the lands now known as Deanston from the Haldanes of Gleneagles. The Scots word ‘dean’ was coupled with the Scots Gaelic term ‘toun’, meaning farm/settlement, to make Deanston. Deanston was largely an agricultural area until John Buchanan and his brothers from Carston had the foresight to convert an existing flax mill into a water- powered carding and roving factory with the latest machinery. Designed by Arkwright, inventor of the water-powered spinning frame, the mill was opened in 1785 as the Adelphi Mill, after the Greek word adelphoi meaning ‘brothers’. The mill was powered by the River Teith and was one of the first half-dozen mills of this type to be built in Scotland. Its opening signalled the start of a period of great change for Deanston, which was inhabited with Highlanders who had been evicted in the Clearances and were reluctant to work in the mill. After a difficult start, the mill's fortune was transformed by the arrival of Kirkman Finlay (of Glasgow merchants James Finlay & Co) and the vibrant James Smith, who was installed as manager in 1806/7, aged just seventeen, and remained at the helm for 35 years. Smith embarked on a massive modernisation of Deanston between 1811-1833, building a new spinning mill, a village, housing, roads, a new weir, new gas works, a large weaving shed, Deanston School, and a fish-ladder to give salmon access to the upper reaches of the river - the original model of which can be seen at the distillery today. His biggest innovation was the engineering works which built machinery for Catrine Mill, as well exporting to all parts of Britain and Europe. Smith's talents did not end with the modernisation of the mill, as he also became famous for his deep soil drainage system known as ‘Deanstonisation.’ Innovation In its early days, Deanston Mill was at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland and developed a number of nationally important innovations which continue to impact the distillery today. Due to a shortage of currency at the time, Deanston was the first major industrial works to produce its own currency. The French Revolution and Napoleonic War meant that silver and gold were drained away to pay for hostilities and as a result, Deanston Mill countermarked Spanish and French coins and issued them to workers and suppliers as pay. Very few of these coins still exist, however one is currently on display at the distillery. The mill and village houses were originally lit by candles and oil lamps but in 1813, Deanston Mill was lit by gas – said to be the first gasworks in the west of Scotland and ahead of Westminster Bridge, which was not lit until the end of December that year. By 1833, Deanston was powered by four large water wheels - the first two small wheels were reconstructions of the original Adelphi Mill wheels and the third wheel was called Samson. The fourth wheel (named Hercules) measured 36 ft 6in in diameter, was of 300 horse power, and was the largest waterwheel in Europe and the second largest in the world. Original footage of these colossal wheels in operation was recently unearthed and can now be viewed at the distillery. The wheels were dismantled in 1949 and replaced by a more efficient hydro- turbine and steam electricity generating plant, which currently provides enough energy for all of the distillery's requirements, as well as producing a surplus which is sold back to the National Grid. Deanston Mill was heavily influenced by Arkwright's classical style of architecture and this is a striking feature of the distillery today. The elegant 204 ft long, 136 ft wide vaulted warehouse, previously the weaving shed, is recognised to be one of the greatest surviving Regency industrial buildings in Scotland, and is now used to mature Deanston Single Malt whisky. Construction began in 1834; its remarkable cast-iron cupola roof was insulated with soil to bring it up to the best temperature for weaving cotton (80 degrees Fahrenheit) and also helped to deaden the noise of the hundreds of working looms inside. The soil on the roof was utilised as a community vegetable garden. Deanston Village In a similar way to David Dale's model community at New Lanark, Deanston village was built by mill owners James Finlay & Co to provide housing for the workers. The first houses were erected in 1811 - common entrances gave way to self- contained apartments, with attics for drying clothes and storage, and good coal-burning ranges were provided. Nearly every able-bodied woman worked in the mill; therefore easily run homes were an investment for the company. A local school was provided and is still educating the future generation to this day. Young children attended school from age five and were expected to read and do sums before entering the mill when they were nine. Children between the ages of 13-16 attended an evening school four days a week. A communal washhouse, drapery, post office, savings bank and grocery shops were also built in Deanston. By 1844, the mill employed 1100 people, many of whom were women and children. Little has changed in Deanston village since the days of the cotton mill. A large proportion of the village is currently listed, marking its special architectural and historic interest. The vaulted warehouse, weir, and old spinning mill are category A listed buildings, and Deanston School and the village cottages are category C listed. The distillery still keeps the river bank tidy, cuts the grass on behalf of the village, and is still very much an integral part of the Deanston community. Conversion In 1841 James Smith retired from the mill. Operations continued but by 1848, production at Deanston was in decline. The turn of the twentieth century saw a further decrease in demand for cotton and the workforce was scaled down from 1500 to 500 people. Things steadily got worse until the mill was closed on 2 April 1965. It was the collective efforts of James Finlay & Co, Brodie Hepburn & Co, and A.B (Sandy) Grant, known together as Deanston Distillers Ltd, who converted Deanston Mill into a malt whisky distillery in 1965. The soft, fast flow of the River Teith and a whisky boom in Scotland at the time made the site ideal for whisky production. The distillery was opened on 17 October 1966 after an extensive refurbishment costing £300,000, employing 20 local people, but taking just nine months. Three floors were removed to make room for four copper stills and a mash tun. The constant, cool temperature of the weaving shed made it ideal for whisky maturation. The only completely new building was the tun room – where eight huge fermentation vessels now stand. When full each of these weighs 60 tonnes and they stand on top of the mill's four tunnels leading from the turbine house back to the river. The distillery was formally opened on 30 January 1967 by the actor Andrew Cruickshank, the star of the BBC's ‘Dr Finlay's Casebook’ series. Deanston started bottling in 1971 and the first single malt was named Old Bannockburn. Teith Mill, a blended whisky, was also produced at this time - a kiosk was set up at Blair Drummond Safari Park which sold Old Bannockburn and Teith Mill in take-away cartons. At this point, although it made business sense to sell Deanston as a single malt, it was mainly produced for blending purposes. In 1971, Invergordon Distillers (bought by Whyte & Mackay in 1990) bought Brodie Hepburn Ltd, with Tullibardine Distillery and a 30% share in Deanston Distillery. A year later, Invergordon purchased Deanston outright and the first single malt bearing the name Deanston was produced in 1974. After a downturn in the whisky industry, Deanston Distillery ceased production in 1982 for eight years, before being purchased by current owners Burn Stewart Distillers Limited in 1990 (now part of Distell_Group_Limited). Visitor Centre In June 2012, Burn Stewart Distillers opened a new visitor centre at Deanston. The visitor centre is located in the former cotton mill canteen, with many original features being retained, and created seven new jobs for local people. It hosts a gift shop which sells exclusive Deanston bottlings, a café, tasting and presentations areas, and a variety of intimate distillery and tasting tours. As the visitor centre opened, the distillery and a number of staff had already attracted international attention as Deanston featured as the distillery location in the Ken Loach film, The Angels' Share, released in May 2012. One of the stars of the film, Jasmin Riggins, was also present at the opening. Production and character Deanston Distillery looks very unlike a traditional Scotch whisky distillery and has a number of unique production features which contribute to its distinct character in taste and look. The spirit is handmade by a small team of local craftsmen who rely on traditional distilling techniques; no technology or computers are used. Deanston uses only Scottish-grown barley and in 2000, was one of the first distilleries in Scotland to start producing organic whisky, certified by the Organic Food Federation and using barley grown in specially selected sites, free from pesticides and chemicals. The distillery also uses an 11-ton open-topped mash tun - the only one of its size in Scotland - and four unique pot stills with upwards sloping lyne arms and boiling balls, which help give the whisky its light character. The spirit is matured in the original weaving shed built in the 1830s, which holds a capacity of 45,000 casks.

With the rise to power of the Nazis, faith-based and left-leaning worker's sports organizations were disbanded as politically unpalatable to the regime and the Herzlake club disappeared in 1934.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag The end of World War II and the collapse of the Third Reich saw many previously banned clubs re-established, including Herzlake, which was reformed as Verein für Leibesübungen Herzlake in 1946. The team enjoyed its first successes in local level play in the early 70s, advancing to the Landesliga Niedersachsen (V) in 1975, and from there in 1982 into the Verbandsliga Niedersachsen (IV), where they won titles in 1985, 1987, and 1988. A successful promotion round playoff in 1988 advanced VfL to the Oberliga Nord (III) where they were an unremarkable lower-tier side through their first four seasons of play. In 1993, they claimed the division title and took part in the promotion round for the 2. Bundesliga but fared poorly. The team remained competitive through the mid-90s in what was now the Regionalliga Nord (III), before being renamed VfL Hasetal Herzlake in 1997. They spent two more seasons in the Regionalliga before finishing in the relegation zone at the end of the 1998–99 season. The poor financial condition of the club drove them all the way down to the Kreisliga Emsland (VIII) and they resumed the name VfL Herzlake. They slipped further still, to the Kreisklasse Weser/Ems (IX) in 2000, and recovered briefly to play in the Kreisliga and Bezirksliga before being relegated to the Kreisliga again in 2013, where they play today.

Biography He was born in Medford, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard in 1708, and was minister at Newbury, Massachusetts, from 1714 until 1738, where he preached sermons that disparaged music illiteracy. He wrote the first American textbook meant to solve the problem, An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes, with a Collection of Tunes in Three Parts (Boston, 1715). He also published a sermon, “Humble Call to Archippus” (1829). He died in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Music book The appendix of An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes presented the rudiments of music, instructions for tuning the voice, musical notation, intervals, scales, clefs, and meter signatures. The book became the prototype for numerous other books written during the 18th century. The third edition, published in 1726, is the earliest still in existence. It contained 37 English psalm tunes with two harmony voices. In Music and Musicians in Early America, pp. 53–55, Irving Lowens suggests that \\"100 Psalm Tune New\\" was probably written by Tufts. If so, it could be the first published composition by an American-born composer. Tufts was the first American to devise an innovation in musical notation to simplify music reading. He abandoned the traditional round notes and substituted the first letters of the four solmization syllables (fa, sol, la, mi) on the staff. Thus, every note in Tufts' notation was labeled F, S, L, or M for fa, sol, la, or mi. For Tufts, the syllable mi was located on the leading tone. For example, the C major scale would be sung to the following syllables: C, fa; D, sol, E, la; F, fa; G, sol, A, la; B, mi. Tufts indicated duration with punctuation. For example the letter F indicated the solfege syllable fa to be sung for one beat. The letter F followed by a dot (F.) indicated that the note was to be held for two beats. The letter F followed by a colon (F:) indicated that the note was to be sung for four beats. If two letters were written closely together and had a slur mark over them (which Tufts called a bow), they were eighth notes. The pioneering work of Tufts led to the singing school, which influenced American music and music education for over one hundred years. Tufts was the most significant figure in American music education until the 1820s, when Lowell Mason led it in a new direction. Legacy His house, the Rev. John Tufts House, is now on the National Register of Historic Places. The section of Newbury where he lived is now incorporated as West Newbury. NotesReferences *Gary, C.L. and Mark, M.L. (2007).

Today, fragments of the stone walls and the foundation can be seen on the ancient castle hill. History Castle plan in 1889. Archeological excavations reveal that between the 9th and 12th centuries a Latgalian wooden fortress was situated in the place where the castle ruins now stand. It is unknown when the Latgalian fortress was destroyed, however in 1285, the master of the Livonian Order Vilhelms Šurborgs built a stone fortress on the Rositten stone hill. The fortress consisted of a two-story brick and stone castle with a three-storey towers and thick brick walls, functioning as the administrative seat of Rezekne. The castle was ravaged and rebuilt many times. Between 1577 and 1579, it was occupied by Czar Ivan IV Vasilyevich, and after the war it became part of the Duchy of Livonia. During the Polish-Swedish War in 1601, and again from 1625 to 1626, the Rezekne castle was occupied by the Swedish army, during the Second Northern War.

The snout and premaxilla are also smoother than that of most crocodyliforms, without foramina or the typical rugose texture. There are six valid species within this genus, all with slightly differing maxillary or dentary structure. A. gomesii, A. wegeneri and A. tsangatsangana all have a mild concavity of the external alveolar margin of the premaxilla as viewed from the ventral surface; A. rattoides may also have this feature, although this part of its skull is not known, as the dentary suggests that this would be the case. A. rattoides also had the distinctive feature of a highly enlarged and forward-pointing first dentary tooth referred to as an incisiform, resembling the elongated incisors found in rodents (hence the specific epithet). All species of Araripesuchus had relatively large orbits and hence eyes. They also had thin osteoderms that covered the entire body, multiple rows of them across the back and paired dorsal ones along the tail. Each side of the tail also had a single row of osteoderms, and there were paired ventral osteoderms across most of the belly and underside as well. The osteoderms were not strongly keeled, which, along with the long limb bones and shoulder, hip and ankle joints that suggest upright posture, indicate that Araripesuchus was probably more active on land than on water. Discovery and history Block containing multiple specimens of A. wegeneri The name of the genus was coined in 1959 with the description of the type species Araripesuchus gomesii, a notosuchian crocodylian from the famed Santana Group of the Araripe Basin in Brazil. The holotype used to describe the genus, 423-R is currently in the care of the Divisão de Mineralogia e Geologia do Departamento Nacional da Produção Mineral in Rio de Janeiro. 423-R consists of a single skull articulating with part of a lower jaw. A more complete specimen, AMNH 24450 is held by the American Museum of Natural History. A second species, A. wegeneri was described in 1981. This species was discovered from Early Cretaceous deposits of Niger on the African continent, as opposed to the South American paleodistribution of the other species in the genus. The type specimen for the species, GDF-700 consisting of a few, fragmentary jaw elements, reside at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. The holotype's fragmentary nature meant that its placement in the genus was disputed until more remains were found in 2009 by Sereno and Larsson; these, along with the specimens of A. tsangatsangana, confirmed its place. Araripesuchus patagonicus was described from a patagonian specimen (MUC-PV 269) in 2000. Another species to be assigned to the genus, was Araripesuchus buitreraensis, described in 2005. This species was described from a single skull (MPCA-PV 235) retrieved from Late Cretaceous deposits in what is now Argentina. At 130 millimeters, the skull is the largest Araripesuchus specimen discovered to date. A fifth species, Araripesuchus tsangatsangana was described in 2006. This species' type specimen was discovered from latest Late Cretaceous deposits from the African island of Madagascar. Analysis of this specimen solidifies the position of A. wegneri as a member of the genus. A. tsangatsangana is the geologically youngest known of this genus. The sixth species, A. rattoides, was found in the Kem Kem Beds of the Sahara in a similar location to the specimens of A. wegeneri found by Sereno and Larsson, and is known only from parts of dentary bones, up to the fourteenth alveolus. It was described in the same paper as Kaprosuchus, Laganosuchus and Anatosuchus; the four were therefore popularized by the authors as 'RatCroc', 'BoarCroc', 'PancakeCroc' and 'DuckCroc' respectively. Classification Restoration of an adult A. wegeneri There are currently six recognized species within the genus Araripesuchus: A. patagonicus, A. buitreraensis, A. tsangatsangana, A. wegeneri, A. rattoides and the type species A. gomesii. The placement of the first African species discovered, A. wegeneri was questioned for a while by various authors. Ortega et al. argued for the assignment of the errant species to another genus based on phylogenetic analysis Further analysis, combined with the discovery of the second African species A. tsangatsangana has shed more light on the placement of A. wegeneri within the genus. When analyzed together, the African species support the inclusion of all five first described species into the same genus. The genus was originally assigned by Price to the family Uruguaysuchidae in the original 1959 description. This classification was followed by Buffetaut in 1981 with the description of A. wegeneri also within the same family. However, in their 2000 description of A. patagonicus, Ortega et al. avoided placing the species within the family. Instead, it was simply noted that Uruguaysuchus was a possible close relative of the genus. Ortega et al. and several other studies place Araripesuchus outside Notosuchia. In some phylogenetic analyses, it is placed closer to the clade Neosuchia, which includes modern crocodilians. In most recent analyses, however, Araripesuchus is placed as a basal notosuchian. The phylogenetic analysis of Soto et al. (2011) joined Araripesuchus with Uruguaysuchus, reinstating the family Uruguaysuchidae. This family was found to be the most basal group of Notosuchia. Below is a cladogram from the analysis: Holotype left dentary of A. rattoides Paleoecology Artist's impression of A. patagonicus Araripesuchus remains have been recovered from the continents of South America and Africa suggesting a Gondwanan origin for the evolution of the genus. At around the time of Araripesuchus existence, South America and Africa were physically adjacent to each other. The various species evolved from the same stock in the general area, radiating outward from a yet-unidentified origin point. The presence of specimens from Madagascar further strengthens this evolutionary radiation model.

The West Side, can be defined as encompassing the area north of the Susquehanna River, east of the neighboring village of Johnson City along Margaret Street and Floral Avenue, west of the Chenango River and south of the Norfolk Southern tracks. The area's \\"main drag\\" is Main Street which carries NY-17C. It runs from the foot of the Court Street Bridge west and into Johnson City. It is lined with retail, consisting of several large supermarkets, churches, pharmacies, bank branches, a few bars and restaurants as well as a few mom and pop shops. Other important streets in the neighborhood are Riverside Drive, Front Street which carries US-11, Leroy Street, Grand Boulevard and Floral Avenue. The West Side is home to Lourdes Memorial Hospital, Recreation Park, Binghamton High School, Seton Catholic Central, and St. Patrick's Church. The American Civic Association, on Front Street, was the site of the Binghamton shootings in 2009, where 13 people were killed by a shooter before he committed suicide. Apart from commercial Main Street and some industrial buildings one block north of it along the Norfolk Southern tracks, the Westside of Binghamton is primarily an urban residential neighborhood. The housing stock ranges from small to large, detached, single and double-family houses to attached row-houses and larger apartment buildings. Generally, the area south of Main Street towards Riverside Drive and the Susquehanna River is inhabited mainly by people of lower middle to upper-class. The area north of Main Street is inhabited by people of a lower income. Many college students also live in the area south of Main Street near/around Recreation Park.

Voigts, B. Schaff &M.; Pietrzak-Franger (Eds.). Reflecting on Darwin. Farnham, London: Ashgate. refers to a variety of approaches that extend the theory of Darwinism beyond its original domain of biological evolution on Earth. Universal Darwinism aims to formulate a generalized version of the mechanisms of variation, selection and heredity proposed by Charles Darwin, so that they can apply to explain evolution in a wide variety of other domains, including psychology, economics, culture, medicine, computer science and physics. Basic mechanisms At the most fundamental level, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution states that organisms evolve and adapt to their environment by an iterative process. This process can be conceived as an evolutionary algorithm that searches the space of possible forms (the fitness landscape) for the ones that are best adapted. The process has three components: * variation of a given form or template. This is usually (but not necessarily) considered to be blind or random, and happens typically by mutation or recombination. * selection of the fittest variants, i.e. those that are best suited to survive and reproduce in their given environment. The unfit variants are eliminated. * heredity or retention, meaning that the features of the fit variants are retained and passed on, e.g. in offspring. After those fit variants are retained, they can again undergo variation, either directly or in their offspring, starting a new round of the iteration. The overall mechanism is similar to the problem-solving procedures of trial-and-error or generate-and- test: evolution can be seen as searching for the best solution for the problem of how to survive and reproduce by generating new trials, testing how well they perform, eliminating the failures, and retaining the successes. The generalization made in \\"universal\\" Darwinism is to replace \\"organism\\" by any recognizable pattern, phenomenon, or system. The first requirement is that the pattern can \\"survive\\" (maintain, be retained) long enough or \\"reproduce\\" (replicate, be copied) sufficiently frequently so as not to disappear immediately. This is the heredity component: the information in the pattern must be retained or passed on. The second requirement is that during survival and reproduction variation (small changes in the pattern) can occur. The final requirement is that there is a selective \\"preference\\" so that certain variants tend to survive or reproduce \\"better\\" than others. If these conditions are met, then, by the logic of natural selection, the pattern will evolve towards more adapted forms. Examples of patterns that have been postulated to undergo variation and selection, and thus adaptation, are genes, ideas (memes), theories, technologies, neurons and their connections, words, computer programs, firms, antibodies, institutions, law and judicial systems, quantum states and even whole universes.Campbell, John (2009). Bayesian Methods and Universal Darwinism. AIP Conf. Proc. 1193, 40, . 40-47.  History and development  Conceptually, \\"evolutionary theorizing about cultural, social, and economic phenomena\\" preceded Darwin, but was still lacking the concept of natural selection. Darwin himself, together with subsequent 19th-century thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, Thorstein Veblen, James Mark Baldwin and William James, was quick to apply the idea of selection to other domains, such as language, psychology, society, and culture.Hodgson, G. M. (2005). Generalizing Darwinism to social evolution: Some early attempts. Journal of Economic Issues, 899–914 However, this evolutionary tradition was largely banned from the social sciences in the beginning of the 20th century, in part because of the bad reputation of social Darwinism, an attempt to use Darwinism to justify social inequality. Starting in the 1950s, Donald T. Campbell was one of the first and most influential authors to revive the tradition, and to formulate a generalized Darwinian algorithm directly applicable to phenomena outside of biology.Gontier, N. (2006). Evolutionary Epistemology. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/evo-epis/ In this, he was inspired by William Ross Ashby's view of self-organization and intelligence as fundamental processes of selection.Campbell, D. T. (1960). Blind variation and selective retention in creative thought as in other knowledge processes. Psychological Review, 67(6), 380–400. His aim was to explain the development of science and other forms of knowledge by focusing on the variation and selection of ideas and theories, thus laying the basis for the domain of evolutionary epistemology. In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of \\"blind-variation-and-selective-retention\\" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of \\"universal selection theory\\"Campbell, D. T. (1990). Epistemological roles for selection theory. Evolution, cognition, and realism: Studies in evolutionary epistemology, 1–19. or \\"universal selectionism\\"Hodgson, G. M. (2005).

Richard Dawkins may have first coined the term \\"universal Darwinism\\" in 1983 to describe his conjecture that any possible life forms existing outside the solar system would evolve by natural selection just as they do on Earth.Dawkins, R. (1983) Universal Darwinism. In: Evolution from molecules to man, ed. D. S. Bendall. Cambridge University Press. This conjecture was also presented in 1983 in a paper entitled “The Darwinian Dynamic” that dealt with the evolution of order in living systems and certain nonliving physical systems.Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RA, Vemulapalli GK. (1983) The Darwinian Dynamic. Quarterly Review of Biology 58, 185-207. It was suggested “that ‘life’, wherever it might exist in the universe, evolves according to the same dynamical law” termed the Darwinian dynamic. Henry Plotkin in his 1997 bookPlotkin, H. C. (1997). Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge. Harvard University Press. on Darwin machines makes the link between universal Darwinism and Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. Susan Blackmore, in her 1999 book The Meme Machine, devotes a chapter titled 'Universal Darwinism' to a discussion of the applicability of the Darwinian process to a wide range of scientific subject matters. The philosopher of mind Daniel Dennett, in his 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, developed the idea of a Darwinian process, involving variation, selection and retention, as a generic algorithm that is substrate-neutral and could be applied to many fields of knowledge outside of biology. He described the idea of natural selection as a \\"universal acid\\" that cannot be contained in any vessel, as it seeps through the walls and spreads ever further, touching and transforming ever more domains. He notes in particular the field of memetics in the social sciences.Dennett, Daniel C. (2005), Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Touchstone Press, New York. pp. 352-360. In agreement with Dennett's prediction, over the past decades the Darwinian perspective has spread ever more widely, in particular across the social sciences as the foundation for numerous schools of study including memetics, evolutionary economics, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary anthropology, neural Darwinism, and evolutionary linguistics.Oudeyer, P.-Y. and Kaplan, F. (2007) Language Evolution as a Darwinian Process: Computational Studies. Cognitive Processing, 8(1):21-35 Researchers have postulated Darwinian processes as operating at the foundations of physics, cosmology and chemistry via the theories of quantum Darwinism, Blume-Kohou, Robin and Zurek, Wojciech.

A 73, 062310 (2006) observation selection effects and cosmological natural selection. Smolin, Lee (1997). The Life of the Cosmos. Oxford University PressSmolin, Lee (2008), Scientific Alternatives to the Anthropic Principle, Contribution to \\"Universe or Multiverse\\", ed. by Bernard Carr et al., to be published by Cambridge University Press. Similar mechanisms are extensively applied in computer science in the domains of genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, which develop solutions to complex problems via a process of variation and selection. Author D. B. Kelley has formulated one of the most all-encompassing approaches to universal Darwinism. In his 2013 book The Origin of Everything, he holds that natural selection involves not the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, as shown by Darwin, but the preservation of favored systems in contention for existence. The fundamental mechanism behind all such stability and evolution is therefore what Kelley calls \\"survival of the fittest systems.\\" Because all systems are cyclical, the Darwinian processes of iteration, variation and selection are operative not only among species but among all natural phenomena both large- scale and small. Kelley thus maintains that, since the Big Bang especially, the universe has evolved from a highly chaotic state to one that is now highly ordered with many stable phenomena, naturally selected. Examples of universal Darwinist theories The following approaches can all be seen as exemplifying a generalization of Darwinian ideas outside of their original domain of biology. These \\"Darwinian extensions\\" can be grouped in two categories, depending on whether they discuss implications of biological (genetic) evolution in other disciplines (e.g. medicine or psychology), or discuss processes of variation and selection of entities other than genes (e.g. computer programs, firms or ideas). However, there is no strict separation possible, since most of these approaches (e.g. in sociology, psychology and linguistics) consider both genetic and non-genetic (e.g. cultural) aspects of evolution, as well as the interactions between them (see e.g. gene-culture coevolution). =Gene-based Darwinian extensions= *Evolutionary psychology assumes that our emotions, preferences and cognitive mechanisms are the product of natural selection **Evolutionary educational psychology applies evolutionary psychology to education **Evolutionary developmental psychology applies evolutionary psychology to cognitive development **Darwinian Happiness applies evolutionary psychology to understand the optimal conditions for human well-being **Darwinian literary studies tries to understand the characters and plots of narrative on the basis of evolutionary psychology **Evolutionary aesthetics applies evolutionary psychology to explain our sense of beauty, especially for landscapes and human bodies **Evolutionary musicology applies evolutionary aesthetics to music *Evolutionary anthropology studies the evolution of human beings *Sociobiology proposes that social systems in animals and humans are the product of Darwinian biological evolution *Human behavioral ecology investigates how human behavior has become adapted to its environment via variation and selection *Evolutionary epistemology of mechanisms studies how our abilities to gather knowledge (perception, cognition) have evolved *Evolutionary medicine investigates the origin of diseases by looking at the evolution both of the human body and of its parasites *Paleolithic diet proposes that the most healthy nutrition is the one to which our hunter-gatherer ancestors have adapted over millions of years *Paleolithic lifestyle generalizes the paleolithic diet to include exercise, behavior and exposure to the environment *Molecular evolution studies evolution at the level of DNA, RNA and proteins *Biosocial criminology studies crime using several different approaches that include genetics and evolutionary psychology *Evolutionary linguistics studies the evolution of language, biologically as well as culturallySchleicher, August.

Published by DC Comics, the arc appeared in Green Arrow (vol. 3) #1-10. Plot summary Having learned of Green Arrow's recent death during his return to Earth in the Final Night crisis, Hal Jordan revives Green Arrow from the dead, but the resurrected Green Arrow only possesses Oliver's memories up to the events prior to The Longbow Hunters, with an examination of his body revealing that he is missing several old scars sustained after that point. As the resurrected Ollie Queen tries to figure out his place in this new world (aided by the seemingly benevolent Stanley Dover, who took him in after he rescued Stanley from a mugging), he interacts with important people from his past, including Black Canary, the Justice League, Batman, and Roy Harper. He also takes on a ward, Mia Dearden, who becomes the new Speedy. As it turns out, Green Arrow was revived in body but not soul— due to Oliver Queen himself preferring to remain in Heaven but recognizing his friend's need to bring something back, the body's memories stopping when they do because Queen felt that things went wrong for him after he took a life when he killed a rapist—resulting in him being attacked by Etrigan the Demon due to his status as a 'hollow' (a soulless being who can be used by some demons to gain access to Earth). Jordan, as the Spectre, transports Ollie out of Etrigan's reach and brings him to Heaven to talk with his soul. However, when the soul prefers to remain in Heaven, Ollie is sent back and captured by Dover, really a practitioner of the black arts who intends to transfer his soul into Oliver's body (a spell only possible due to Oliver's lack of a soul) and then use the JLA Watcher's monitoring systems to track down a benevolent demon he summoned to grant himself immortality. As Connor Hawke fights to save his father-the house being protected by a blood seal that prevents anyone from entering it if they are not related to an inhabitant-Ollie makes contact with his soul while Dover attempts the ritual to take control of Ollie's body, convincing the soul to leave Heaven and rejoin with his body to save their son. With the two Green Arrows having fought off Dover's demons, they are saved by the Beast With No Name, which returned them to the Hell dimension they were summoned from. The Beast subsequently devours Dover, who leaves Ollie and Connor in Dover's house, revealing that Dover left everything to Ollie—back when he believed he would be inheriting Oliver's body—and encouraging Oliver to use Dover's house and resources to fight evil in Star City.

CareerRoyal goldsmith= Brandon became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies or craft guilds of the City of London, by redemption (paying an entrance fee) on 3 February 1548. He advanced to liveryman of the Goldsmiths' Company on 5 May 1561 and served as its Prime Warden 1582–83, chairing the Court of Wardens or governing body of the company. Brandon was one of the queen's two royal goldsmiths from c. 1558 to 1580.The other royal goldsmiths were Affabel Partridge c. 1558–76 and Hugh Keall 1577–80 (H. D. W. Sitwell, 'The Jewel House and the Royal Goldsmiths', Archaeological Journal, cxvii, 1960, p. 150, cited in Masters) Royal goldsmiths of this era \\"were often selected more for their financial skills than their craftsmanship\\", often acting as agents for other members of the company.Campbell, p. 53 As royal goldsmith, Brandon made or supplied gold chains and the gold and silver-gilt cups, bowls, and other forms of plate that were given as New Year's gifts by the queen to members of her court and as gifts to foreign princes and their servants.These gifts are recorded in detail in signed and witnessed inventories.

The chamberlain was responsible for enrolment of apprentices and admission of freemen; for the safekeeping and return of the goods and monies of orphans; and for the management and maintenance of City properties. The chamberlain reported fees, rents, and lease payments collected for tenements and lands, as well as monies paid out for their repair. \\"In the sixteenth century the chamberlain was held personally responsible for the Chamber's solvency; indeed the Chamber Accounts were designed to show whether the chamberlain owed the City money, rather than reveal the true financial state of the corporate body.\\"National Archives,City Lands Grant Books There were many worries about the finances of the chamberlain's office during the later years of Brandon's tenure, especially concerning the management of City lands. Although he was never formally charged or censured, in his will, drawn up three weeks before his death in 1591, Brandon was moved to defend himself: Marriages and progeny Brandon married twice: *Firstly to Katherine Barber (d.1574, buried at St Vedast), at St Mary Woolnoth in 1548.

Initially, it is used for preliminary reconnaissance in collecting pertinent information about the beachhead in its permeability and usability for main landing assaults. Specialized recon patrols skilled in boatswain and combatant diving using either amphibious vehicles or rubber crafts to obtain and collect information on the enemy, the topology ashore and inland, and hydrographic surveys for underwater obstacles and mines, and for the purpose of affecting a deception.  History  Evolution of the doctrine = The turn of the 20th Century, amphibious reconnaissance was first conceived from an idea from a United State Marine officer by then-Major Dion Williams. Williams referenced the purpose of amphibious reconnaissance by standardizing the 'official' naval doctrine of amphibious reconnaissanceDion Williams, Naval Reconnaissance, Instructions for the Reconnaissance of Bays, Harbors, and Adjacent Country, 1906. of American amphibious warfare in 1906. The scope of the doctrine outlined every aspect that involved recognition of intelligence gathering and planning, the cornerstone of America's present-day methods in amphibious reconnaissance.Naval Reconnaissance Second Edition (1917); Maj. Dion Williams, USMC Although very little effect was made in creating a formidable unit capable of utilizing amphibious reconnaissance tactics in the outset of World War I and the Gallipoli Operations due to the lack of Marine Corps personnel by the United States isolationism of the 1920-30s. Also drawbacks concurred while most of the Marine forces were engaged in conflicts in China and in Nicaragua. By 1933, December 7, when the Fleet Marine Force was formed at Headquarters Marine Corps at Marine Corps Base Quantico, VA combining the roles of the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps into an integrated naval assault force. Shortly after, a new naval doctrine, the Fleet Training Publication 167FTP 167, Landing Operations Doctrine, Office of Naval Operations, Division of Fleet Training, United States Navy, 1938 was created to ensure long-term purposes. With this new amphibious reconnaissance doctrine, the United States Navy and Marine Corps began to consider establishing reconnaissance units. The origins of reconnaissance within the United States Marine Corps had evolved from an idea by Major Dion Williams who, in 1906, wrote the first American doctrine concerning amphibious reconnaissance. He specified in his thesis that \\"...talented and experienced men should be assigned to this work, listing among the requisite qualities a thorough technical knowledge, a quick and energetic nature to ensure the work is accomplished without unnecessary delay, a sufficient resourcefulness to overcome unexpected obstacles, a reticence to ensure results are kept confidential, and above all, exactitude of work\\". These Marines particularly needed to be competent in surveying, cartography, and recording observations, as well as reading previous maps and surveys of various types. Williams' doctrine outlined a wide spectrum of reconnaissance, which consisted of range determination, topography, configuration of the ground, cities, towns, roads, trails, railroads, telegraph cables, telephone lines, wireless telegraphy, rivers, canals, resources (coal, repair facilities, land transportation, electric plants, food supplies, water supply, and hospitals), conditions of the harbor and harbor steamers, wharves, docks, water service, the population (secret service, professions and occupations, naval and military forces), existing defenses (location, form and description, armament, fieldworks, mines and mine fields, searchlights, plans and sketches, garrisons and forces available, methods of attack, adaptability of the defenses). And the most important he listed was hydrographic reconnaissance: > In order to prepare intelligent plans for the attack or defense of a harbor > or bay, it is necessary to have at hand a comprehensive description of the > hydrographic features and accurate charts showing the depths of water at all > points, the reefs, rocks, shoals, and peculiar currents which constitute > dangers to navigation, and the tributary streams and channels which may form > avenues of attack or furnish anchorages for a portion of the floating > defenses or auxiliaries of the defenders. After World War I, three significant aspects of the second edition of Williams' Naval Reconnaissance included (1) discussion of additional capabilities of observation from airplanes and submarines, (2) promulgation of the book under authority of the Secretary of the Navy instead of under the auspices of the President of the Naval War College, and (3) emphasis on information acquisition for long-term planning. It was this latter emphasis on obtaining information long before hostilities that was perhaps of greatest significance. Rather than obtaining information solely for military operations in progress, Williams now enunciated a more comprehensive mission: > The object of the naval reconnaissance of any given locality is to acquire > all of the information concerning the sea, land, air and material resources > of that locality, with a view to its use by the Navy in peace and war, and > to record this information that it may be most readily available for: the > preparation of plans for the occupation of the locality as a temporary or > permanent naval base; the preparation of plans for the sea and land defense > of the locality when used as such a base; or the preparation of plans for > the attack of the locality by sea and land should it be in possession of an > enemy. Twenty years later, another Marine Intelligence Officer, Earl H. Ellis, put most of William's concept to effect.Maj. Earl Ellis, http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/ref/AdvBaseOps/index.html After fighting in the trenches in World War I, Ellis submitted a request to Headquarters Marine Corps for special intelligence duty in South America and the Pacific; the Director of Naval Intelligence diligently accepted. It was during his special duty that introduced the most profound accounts of Ellis's intelligence reports. He submitted a 30,000 page Top Secret documentOperations Plan 712, Advance Base Operations in Micronesia (28 Jan 21); HisDiv, HQMC, Archives 9558, Box 4, Folder 712 ^ \\"Ellis\\" File, Advanced Base Defense During the Present War, HisDiv, HQMC concerning his detail discussion of local sea, air and the climate, various land terrain types, the native population and economic conditions. He discussed his reports on strategically seizing key islands as forward- operating bases for project naval forces effectively into the area. His time- tables, mobilization projections, and predictions of manpower necessary to seize certain targets. The earliest activities in amphibious reconnaissance was largely limited in surveying of ports, uncharted islands and adjacent beaches or coastlines. Most of these duties were billeted by senior Naval Intelligence Officers that were prerequisited in topography, hydrography, impermanent construction of fortification with the means of rapid encampment and mobilization of troops to operate in their area.FMFRP 12-20, Naval Reconnaissance,(4 January 1989), Reprint of BGen William's naval doctrine of 1906.  World War II in Europe  Two canoeists in a COPP (Combined Operations Pilotage Parties) canoe The development of amphibious reconnaissance in the early stages of the Second World War during the European campaigns were largely dominated by Lt. Commander Nigel Clogstoun-Willmot RN, who developed what would become the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPPs) while conducting raids on the Aegean Islands in 1941.The Oxford Companion to World War II, 2001 Following Operation Torch, which was carried out without proper reconnaissance, it was proposed that 50 of these parties would be needed; however, the shortage of necessary personnel meant that in all only eleven teams were trained. The Beach Pilotage School was set up on the Kyles of Bute in Scotland. The COPP Depot was set up in 1943 on Hayling Island based at Hayling Island Sailing Club. In preparation for the invasion of Normandy, the British carried out Operation Postage Able, in which a midget submarine took a team close in to the planned landing sites. The team took samples from the beach to determine its ability to bear vehicles, and, together with depth soundings and other observations, large-scale models of the beaches were constructed to aid planning. In addition, American combat swimmer teams from Naval Combat Demolition Units conducted nighttime reconnaissance on possible landing sites, mapping underwater obstacles and helping to clear obstacles during the invasion. Following the war, the secrecy surrounding beach recce continued, and mention of the COPPs did not appear in the press until the late 1950s. By then their knowledge and role had been passed on to the (then) Special Boat Squadron.  Mission role  Specific missions for amphibious reconnaissance patrols included: *To determine characteristics of beaches available for landing, and report same to commander at sea. #By hydrographic reconnaissance of water near the shore line. #By examining terrain in immediate vicinity of beach. #By noting beach defenses, such as wire, mines, and other obstacles; troops in immediate vicinity; other defenses. *To report landmarks for assisting in locating landing beaches. *To mark beaches and landing points during landing. *To determine location, strength, and composition of troops in landing area. *To take and hold in concealment a prisoner or prisoners and be prepared to turn them over to Headquarters Landing Force. *To spot observers to report enemy activity by radio or by panel. *To determine road net and be prepared to meet and guide elements of landing force. *To determine practicability of terrain for air landings. *After the beachhead has been established, to contour the sea floor beginning at the ten-foot line and using a two-foot contour interval in order to expedite the unloading of supplies by locating most advantageous channels and beaches. Also assigned were the following non-intelligence missions: #To create a diversion from proposed landing point. #Minor night attacks. #To assist a landing by executing light demolitions. #To disrupt enemy communications by wire cutting and jamming radios. #To set flares for naval gunfire at night, or to smoke a beach in order to screen a landing wave, or to otherwise mislead the enemy.

The first commercial radio station, Radio HRN, began broadcasting in 1933. History In August 1920 a group known as Los Chicos del Coliseo began broadcasting from Teatro Coliseo in Buenos Aires, but it would take many years for radio to arrive in places such as the isthmus of Central America. In Honduras, radio experimentation had begun with local transmissions. American companies (known as bananeras) were just a few of the companies providing employment before and after World War II. In 1928 the Tela Railroad Company (one of the two major railroads) had received a license to establish a radio station (known as Tropical Radio). It broadcast on the 51-meter shortwave band, and HRB (La Voz del Trópico) was the first radio station in Honduras. HRB was not a \\"commercial\\" radio station. It was a medium for the Tela Railroad Company to broadcast its own bulletins. It also played recorded music and featured live performances by local talent (including the Sisters Cordova and pianist Guadalupe Ferrari Hartling), marimba bands, singers, poets and other artists. HRB did not last long, but it inspired several individuals to keep the broadcasting flame alive. Rafael Ferrari Garcia, an entrepreneur with great ambitions but little money, sold everything he owned to embark on a risky plan; he received permission to install the first commercial radio station in Tegucigalpa. It was known as La Voz del Comercio; to maintain its operation, he obtained commercial sponsorship from local businesses (retail and professional) and government agencies. From this HRN (La Primera Emisora del País) was born; Ferrari was credited as the first radio personality in Honduras. The station was founded on November 1, 1933. Kenneth See and Paul John were the principal technical engineers and attorney Manuel Bonilla Rodriguez, Nicholas Odeh, Rodolfo Brevé Martinez and Ferrari were the station’s staff announcers. Bonilla Rodriguez was the first to broadcast a soccer game in 1935 between a Costa Rican team and Club Motagua, a renowned Honduran team. Assisting Bonilla as engineer was Nat Lopez Fuentes, from a family radio dynasty known nationwide. There were only a handful of radio receivers and in order to reach a wide audience Ferrari installed loudspeakers at various locations in Tegucigalpa. This was a daily pastime, an occasion for locals to meet and enjoy the programming. At first the programming was limited to news, government bulletins and recorded music. However, during the 1940s the station acquired a more powerful transmitter, reaching audiences in faraway countries with its shortwave signal. HRN was important during War World II, since it rebroadcast information from the BBC in London and NBC in the United States. Ferrari continued his support of local talent with broadcasts including pianists, marimba bands, orchestras, singers, poets, composers, comedians and amateur artists. After the war, Europe, Asia and North America began to rebuild their economies and Honduras enjoyed some prosperity and tranquility under the Carias Andino regime. HRN became one of many private enterprises which enjoyed a modest increase in business. During this time, the station replaced La Voz del Comercio for its current slogan, La Voz de Honduras. Ferrari expanded the station, providing opportunity to a new generation of promising talent; some became household names, solidifying HRN's position as a powerhouse of Central American radio. ;Top 20 Honduras Radio Personalities #Rafael Ferrari García #Antonio Mazariegos Velasco #Nicholas Odeh #Manuel Bonilla Rodriguez #Rodolfo Brevé Martinez #Rigoberto Cuellar Cerrato #Gustavo Acosta Mejía #Raul Agüero Neda #Christina Rubio #Manuel Villeda Toledo #Francisco Rolando Ramos #Nahum Valladares #Ruben “Chito” Fuentes Flores #Moisés Ulloa Duarte #Orfa Mejía Arauz #Jorge Figueroa Rush #Sigfrido Munez #Roberto Diaz Lechuga #Carlos Eduardo Riedel Morales #Hector Maradiaga Mendoza {The writer; Roque Morán Hernandez, was the youngest announcer during the late 1950s}. = Radio America = 1948 marked the birth of Radio America. At that time Tegucigalpa (the capital) comprised two cities, divided by the Rio Choluteca. It was a small metropolis, both geographically and in population. Radio America broadcast with three kW of power; small by later standards, but sufficient for experimentation. Soon it increased its power to 10 kW, easily reaching audiences in the twin cities of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela. The station was first owned by Sergio Castellón who, within a few years, sold it to Cuban entrepreneur Rafael Silvio Peña. Peña, bringing the Cuban concept of radio as a fresh approach, began with live performances (especially radio-novelas, or soap-operas). Peña brought in Emilio Díaz; the two developed programs popular in Cuba such as \\"La Tremenda Corte\\", which was known throughout Latin America. Subsequently Dr. Andonie Fernandez bought the station, maintaining its tradition while ushering in a new era. Several changes took place, the most important of which was the addition of well-known radio personalities and the highest-rated program (“Platicando con mi Barbero”, after the cast left HRN). This program featured a group headed by humorist Herman Allan Padgett, considered a genius for his comic range and originality. Padgett had gathered the best-known talent of the time, including Julio Lopez Fuentes, Abelardo Enrique Avendaño and Ricardo Antonio Redondo Licona. Like HRN, Radio America strives to improve; Fernandez created a conglomerate within the communications industry in Central America.Radio America history (Spanish). Retrieved 2011-04-02.

It concerned rescission for misrepresentation and how the impossibility of counter restitution may be a bar to rescission. It is also an important illustration of how promoters of a company stand in a fiduciary relationship to subscribers. Facts Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger was a Parisian banker. He bought the lease of the Anguilla island of Sombrero for phosphate mining for £55,000. He then set up the New Sombrero Phosphate Co. Eight days after incorporation, he sold the island to the company for £110,000 through a nominee. One of the directors was the Lord Mayor of London, who himself was independent of the syndicate that formed the company. Two other directors were abroad, and the others were mere puppet directors of Erlanger. The board, which was effectively Erlanger, ratified the sale of the lease. Erlanger, through promotion and advertising, got many members of the public to invest in the company. After eight months, the public investors found out the fact that Erlanger (and his syndicate) had bought the island at half the price the company (now with their money) had paid for it. The New Sombrero Phosphate Co sued for rescission based on non-disclosure, if they gave back the mine and an account of profits, or for the difference. Judgment The House of Lords unanimously held that promoters of a company stand in a fiduciary relationship to investors, meaning they have a duty of disclosure. Further, they held, by majority (Lord Cairns LC dissenting), that the contract could be rescinded, and that rescission was not barred by laches. Lord Blackburn decided that delay did not bar rescission. As a general \\"condition to a rescission there must be a restitutio in integrum.\\" There was a question over this, since phosphate had been mined, and it was not so easy to put the phosphate back. He observed it would \\"be obviously unjust that a person who has been in possession of property under the contract which he seeks to repudiate should be allowed to throw that back on the other party’s hands without accounting for any benefit he may have derived from the use of the property… [or] making compensation for that deterioration.\\" In this case, however, adequate compensate could be paid. So there was no impossibility in counter restitution. His judgment ran as follows.(1877-78) LR 3 App Cas 1218, 1269-1283 Lord Penzance, Lord Hatherley, Lord O'Hagan, Lord Selborne and Lord Gordon concurred.

Luigi D'Andrea made the first plastic guitar pick out of celluloid in 1922. In October 2007, D'Andrea celebrated 85 years of designing and manufacturing professional guitar picks and music accessories, making it one of the oldest companies in the musical accessory industry.It's also the first company to make custom guitar plectra.  Introduction  The tonal effect of a musical piece can depend as much on the selection of pick as it does on the choice of strings, amplifiers, effects, or guitar. Many players keep a variety of types and gauges available for varied sounds and playing styles.  History of the plastic pick  Up until 1922, most picks were handmade from real tortoise shell - the carapace of the Atlantic Hawksbill turtle. It provided the finest tonal quality but it had some drawbacks. It was very expensive, had a tendency to break, and was scarce. People had tried other materials such as bone, stone, and ivory but none had been particularly successful. Luigi D'Andrea punched the little disks out of celluloid by hand, with a heavy mallet and a variety of knife edged dies which he designed. The cut edges were then finished by hand with sand paper. He also made the traditional tortoise shell picks the same way. The real shell came from Europe in irregularly shaped \\"plates\\" which were then soaked in oil and pressed between heated stainless steel plates for days. The plates were regularly tightened with a hand wheel. The pick material was then taken off the press hot and cut by hand with a steel die and wooden mallet, to get as many good picks as possible from the irregular plate. They had to work quickly because if the shell cooled or dried out, it would shatter when cut. The edges of the plate made thin picks, further in was medium, and the center supplied the thick gauge. They were then either tumbled or finished by hand on a sanding wheel. Some would have to be re-pressed flat again at the end of this process, for the gauges were never uniform. By comparison, the celluloid process was slightly simpler because the 2'x5', sheets were flat and uniformly gauged. It was readily available in the U.S. until the late 1960s, and only from Italy and Japan. During this early time he experimented with different shapes and sizes. Guitarists he knew would visit him, and bring their special needs to his attention: making the picks bigger, smaller, longer, more round, sharper, point two sides, then three. He started numbering the styles. Soon he had created 23 shapes in tortoise and 56 shapes in celluloid. Among them is the famous #351 which eventually becomes the 'standard' \\"Fender\\" pick. One of the oddest was the #84, a combination of 3 #353 picks in thin, medium and heavy, beveled on one edge, and joined by a rivet. It could be flipped out like a pocket knife to the desired thickness when needed. Because he tried to please so many of the players with modifications to pick styles, most of today's pick \\"inventions\\" were already included in the D'Andrea catalogs of the 1920s! The problem of holding on to a pick was also addressed. There is a whole line with shaped cork cushion grips, including a heart shaped grip for a heart pick, in several sizes. One line also had notches in the sides of the picks that held tiny rubber bands. That look actually became part of the D'Andrea logo from the 1920s to the 1950s. Some picks even had 1/4\\" holes in the centers for grip. When imprinting became an integral part of pick manufacturing, different \\"patterns\\" were embossed for grip. Some styles were actually struck with a die which embedded tiny ridges in the tops to \\"corrugate\\" them. By the 1970s, D'Andrea introduced yet another innovation addressing the grip problem—PRO-GRIP celluloid. This treated the normally polished surface with a resin coating. The shiny pick was now dusty looking but it stayed put. In the 1990s that treatment was used on the molded Delrin PRO-GRIP BRITES pick line. By 1928, Luigi D'Andrea was the Henry Ford of guitar picks, with semi-automated equipment to punch, tumble and imprint as many as 59 differently shaped picks in both celluloid and real tortoise shell. His New York City factory produced flat picks, thumb and finger picks, pick guards, as well as guitar, bass, sax, accordion & drum bags, and cases. In the 1930s, Luigi's son Anthony joined the business and began some innovations of his own. Not only the production, but the marketing of picks became his forte. He took his cue from the candy business and secured some surplus compartmentalized boxes with glass tops which he filled with pick assortments. Picks were soon sold by the gross and half gross in 4\\" square plastic 'jewel' boxes with separate lids. These eventually evolved into the clear plastic compartment boxes we see today. He put picks on cardboard displays, die-cut point of purchase counter easels, and pop-up boxes. The 1930s \\"Nick Lucas\\" picks on a card were an example of his packaging ideas. The picks originally made in the 1920s were used on mandolins, banjos and acoustic guitars. The early blues and jazz players used the picks back then. In the 1950s they were used by early rockers. As more and more folks began playing guitar, the demand grew rapidly. Anthony (Tony, Sr.) then began the search for new materials for picks. Tortoiseshell was hardly available, and by 1975 would be on the endangered list and no longer used. Celluloid always was an expensive and a difficult material to handle. The lead times were tremendous and erratic. To meet the demand, he introduced a molded nylon pick with circular patterns for grip.  Tony D'Andrea Jr.  In 1962, Tony Sr.'s son, Tony Jr., joined the company. Coming out of the Aircraft industry and familiar with industrial plastics, he pioneered the use of some of the plastics still used in modern picks. A Dupont acetal polymer, Delrin was introduced as the D'Andrea Delrex line. A colorful sheet plastic, it had some of the tonal qualities of celluloid, excellent endurance, but could not be colored in shell patterns. As a sheet plastic however, it could easily be produced in many shapes. Today, D'Andrea offers it in seven shapes and six gauges. The same material is also able to be molded. So Tony Jr. developed uniquely designed molds to accommodate the needs of the faster paced music of the Rock revolution. His molds had innovative sharply beveled edges to provide fast release with clearer tone. Those molds are used to produce the three Delrin lines: Jetex with a multi-leveled gripping surface, and the Brites and Pro-Grip Brites lines with Fluorescent pigmented colors. A new stronger Nylon formula was also developed and used in these sharp edged molds. As the \\"standard\\" #351 pick emerged as the dominant pick shape, the need for 59 shapes diminished, but Tony wanted to increase its versatility. In 1974, he introduced the 4th and 5th sound: .58mm Thin /Medium and .84mm Medium/Heavy. Today picks come in 8 gauges, up to 2.00mm super heavy. As for shapes, 10 still remain from the early days. Still the professionals favorite for its unique sound quality, the breadth of the celluloid material was necessarily reduced. Because of its constantly increasing cost, many colors have been eliminated. To fill players' need for an economical pick, Tony introduced a polymer plastic, V-Resin. It mimics most celluloid properties, but its lower material cost, domestic availability, and familiar colors make it widely popular. It is available in jewel like transparent hues and stone patterns. Variations of it are used for several premium pick lines: SPECTRA-PLEC, SPECTRA SHARP-transparent jewel colors, ULTRA PLEC in burled wood, malachite and crystal patterns and PRO PLEC, a super heavy, rich shell patterned pick in vintage shapes. Another area of innovation for Tony Jr. has been the pick imprinting processes. From the very beginning, simple hot stamping had been used to identify the picks, first with a D'Andrea logo and then simple block letter dies for a player name. These were originally imprinted in one shot, foot pedal operated machines. One of the first to make the player imprint popular was Nick Lucas. In the 1930s, using the old round top #351 pick Luigi developed for him, each pick was imprinted with his logo and sold as a \\"Nick Lucas\\" pick. The 1950s saw the advent of mass-producing private labeled picks for guitar companies, requiring sophisticated automated printing and packaging. The 1960s was the heyday of rock and every player and store wanted their pick personalized. Tony developed some of the fastest multi-shot equipment for punching, imprinting and bagging. In the 1990s he revolutionized the imprint process with the introduction of pad printing. It overcame some of the speed and design limitations of hot stamping. Now very intricate logos can be produced by computer generation and they can be multicolored. By 1996, even a photograph could be imprinted on a pick!  D'Andrea today  D'Andrea manufactures twelve D'Andrea brand pick lines, private label picks for many prominent guitar makers, custom imprinted picks for thousands of music retailers worldwide, and most of the veteran and contemporary artists. Among the many endorsees are Al Di Meola, Lee Ritenour, Richie Sambora, Bon Jovi, Slayer, and The Ventures — representatives of a variety of musical styles. There are over 50,000 imprint dies in the D'Andrea archives. After 85 years of producing, developing and innovating, picks are now made from five plastics including celluloid. When Luigi’s son, Anthony, took over the business in the 1940s, it was expanded into cases and other guitar accessories. Today, his grandson Tony, operates the family business, along with his brother-in-law, Charles Lusso as general Mgr. In 2002, they expanded by purchasing the Snarling Dogs line of signature wah pedals and amp emulators, and the rights to the Snarling Dogs Brain Pick. In 2003, D'Andrea began distributing products from other manufacturers. Today, celluloid has very few uses other than guitar picks, pickguards, other guitar related parts, ping pong balls and accordion shells. Large commercial sources of it have vanished except for one in Italy. There is new hope as, thankfully, mainland China has taken on the task of keeping celluloid alive and is now a viable and fairly abundant resource of the substance. It is produced from cotton cellulose (nitrocellulose) and camphor, in huge vats which take months to cure. The lead time is anywhere from four to six months for production alone. It is then made into 300 lb. blocks, skived into sheets and shipped from overseas—a costly and time consuming process in the era of overnight delivery. Update As they celebrated their 90th year, effective July 1, 2012, D'Andrea USA was purchased by Delmar Products, a plastics company in Berlin, CT. Though Tony D'Andrea is in contact with the company and brother-in-law, Charles Lusso continues to work at the company, the D'Andrea family is, theoretically, no longer involved.

Rules The idea of Ristiseiska is to build a rectangular grid of cards on the table, according to specific rules.http://www.korttipelit.net/ristiseiska At the start, the entire deck is dealt out among the players. The person holding the seven of clubs must begin, and play proceeds clockwise from there. On each player's turn, they must place a card from their hand on the table if at all possible. The grid on the table is divided by suit, with each suit consisting of three parts: the seven, a pile growing from the six downwards, and a pile growing from the eight upwards. Aces rank low. The first card to be put on the table must be the seven of clubs. A suit may only be started with a seven. If the seven is already on the table, a six may be added, and if a six is already on the table, an eight may be added. The two piles corresponding to the suit then grow number by number, one towards the king, the other towards the ace. If a player has any card that can be played, he/she must play it. Otherwise he/she has to take a card from the previous player, this is selected by the previous player and given face down. Upon playing a king or an ace, a player can choose to play an additional card as well. The first player to run out of cards wins. The best number of players is from three to five. =Example of play= Visual illustration on how to play Ristiseiska #Player who has seven of the clubs in their hand, starts the game by placing the card on board. # Next players may either place another seven if they have it (e.g. seven of hearts) or card number 6 beneath the 7, if corresponding 7 has previously been placed on table. # Only after 6 has been placed under 7, corresponding 8 may be placed on top of 7. Before 8 has been placed on board, 5 may not be played on top of 6. # After both 6 and 8 have been placed on board, players may start placing larger and smaller cards from their hands (e.g. 5 or 9). # Cards are placed in number order first 8, then 9, then 10, continuing with jack and queen. # After ace (1) is placed on top of lower pile, it will be turned over. Player may continue and play another card if they wish. # King will turn the upper pile over. The player may choose to continue playing if they want and place another card on table. In this simulated game situation, the player could first place ace of hearts on top 2 of hearts, then continue by placing king of hearts and continue their turn by placing a third card, say 4 of spades. Therefore, player would have eliminated three cards from his hand in a single turn.  Scoring  It is possible to play Ristiseiska several rounds and count the score. The players can decide before starting, that they will play until someone reaches certain score, say for example, 100 or more points. The game rounds are scored after someone wins the game: * The winner gets 0 points (no cards in hand) * Other players score is the combined value of their cards in their hand: If player has cards 2, 3 and 8 in their hand their score for the round is 13 points (2+3+8). * Ace is 1 point (as its value is one), Jack is 11 points, Queen 12 points, King 13 points. In one variant of the card game, if a player passes their turn, they will not receive card from previous player but a token (e.g. coin). When someone else passes, the token is moved. As someone wins the game and the round ends, the player who was left with the token gets penalized with extra points (50 and 21 extra points are common).

Foreign workers  Since the 1980s, the Kuwaiti government annually announces that Kuwait will reduce the number of expatriates. A recent proposal by a Kuwaiti lawmaker restricts all expats to only five years residence in Kuwait, all expats will be deported after living 5 years in Kuwait. Another Kuwaiti lawmaker recently called for the deportation of 1.4 million expats, the lawmaker believes 280,000 expats should be deported annually. Kuwait also banned expatriates from driving. In August 2008, MP Abdullah Al-Roumi declared that he was going to draft a law to scrap Kuwait's \\"kafeel\\" foreign worker sponsorship system, under which expatriates must be sponsored by a local employer to get a work permit: \\"The government should be the only kafeel... We have scores of bachelors residing in Kuwait with an equal number of crimes. Many are caused due to the 'trading with humans' issue which taints the reputation of Kuwait.\\" In the parliamentary debates over the Kuwaiti minimum wage, MPs Askar Al-Enezi and Sadoon Al-Otaibi have dismissed past wage increases as \\"too small\\" and not enough to meet the steep hikes in consumer prices. On February 21, 2008, the parliament approved a 120 dinar ($440) monthly pay rise for nationals in the public and private sectors after inflation hit 7.3%, a 15-year high. It also decided to raise by 50 dinars ($183) the pay of foreigners employed by the government. In response, Al-Enezi said, \\"We reject this increase because it is well below expectations. We urge the government to review its decision.\\" On September 22, 2008, MP Saleh Al-Mulla demanded from Minister of Social Affairs and Labor Bader Al-Duwailah a list of companies involved in human trafficking. Mulla also asked about the measures taken against the violating companies and other steps that would be taken in the future to prevent such violations from taking place. On October 2, 2007, Waleed Al-Tabtabaie called for the interior ministry to draw up a blacklist of employers who mistreat their domestic helpers and urged stiff penalties for physical abuse. Al-Tabtabaie said that employers who abuse their maids \\"physically or morally\\" should be added to the blacklist and prevented from hiring new maids. Al-Tabtabie, a member of parliament's human rights panel, argued that the phenomenon of maid abuse \\"has lately increased to a disturbing level and a large number of abuses are committed annually, with most cases failing to reach the court.\\" In September 2007, Kuwait opened a temporary shelter to house runaway maids until their disputes with employers are resolved. The Kuwaiti government plans to open two permanent centres for males and females to be housed separately. Bedoon In March 2015, MPs Hassan Jawhar, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq AlـHubaini, Ali Al- Deqbasi, and Abdullah AlـBarghash submitted a draft law calling for the granting of Kuwaiti citizenship to all Bedoon residents in the country. The bill proposes that citizenship be granted to all bidun who were included in the 1965 census and who have no criminal record. The new draft law differs from previous bills as it does not impose any restrictions on the naturalization of bidun and does not set a ceiling for the number of bidun that can be granted citizenship. They also suggested that the families of individuals who have died in service to the country be naturalized. In addition, the lawmakers affirmed their belief that the families of POWs and the children of those who were martyred during the invasion be granted citizenship. The latest statistics reveal that more than 80,000 bidun currently reside in Kuwait.  Election reform Redistricting= In 2004 there was a push by the Kuwaiti parliament to reorganized Kuwait's voting districts. At the time, each of Kuwait's twenty-five districts had only about 10,000 voters. The plan was to cut down on vote-buying by reorganizing Kuwait into five districts with about 50,000 voters each. Although the redistricting reforms eventually went through, the Emir initially opposed them. At that time, Al-Awadhi stood with the Emir and against the majority in parliament, saying \\"I don't believe reducing the number will eliminate electoral malpractices such as vote buying and bribery. These violations should be dealt with using other effective methods rather than reducing the number of constituencies.\\" On May 13, 2007, the parliament voted 60–2 to reduce the number of districts from 25 to five. Ashour was critical of the redistricting on the grounds that the districts were uneven in size: \\"No one in the chamber is opposed to the five constituencies, but there are differences about the geographic distribution.\\" Later that week, Ashour held a rally outside the parliament building, telling the crowd: \\"The government bill is unfair and racist. It discriminates between Kuwaitis. It gives 70,000 Kuwaiti voters twenty MPs and the remaining 250,000 thirty MPs. Is this fair?\\" Ashour also argued that the redistricting would promote tribalism. A grassroots campaign called Nabeeha 5 meaning we want it five in Arabic was formed, which was spearheaded by the National Democratic Alliance and some independents, and the Youth Association of Kuwait (then National Democratic Youth Association) opposed the redistricting, claiming that it marginalizes sects of society and it is unfair to the people, adding that it is a government idea to take over parliament. =Political parties= In an August 11, 2008, interview with the Arab Times, Al-Mulla underscored the importance of recognizing political parties in Kuwait, arguing that these parties have been operating unofficially in the country since the 1930s: \\"The time has come for the enactment of a law to recognize and legalize political parties in the country.\\"  Education Government funds for college tuition= In 2002 Kuwait started opening private universities in the country, beginning with the Gulf University for Science and Technology. On September 28, 2008, MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Marzouq Al-Ghanem, Ali Al-Rashid, and Adel Al-Saraawi proposed a law to have the government pay half of Kuwaiti students' tuition at these private colleges.http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20080928041835/Govt%20funding%20for%20Kuwaiti%20students'%20higher%20education%20at%20private%20colleges/ =Mandatory retirement age for teachers= On November 28, 2008, MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Khaled AlـSultan Bin Essa, Hassan Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq AlـHubaini Al-Azmi proposed a law to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years. The MPs argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent professors by restricting the retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. =Coeducation= Coeducation in Kuwait has been a contentious issue since the Islamists gained slight power in parliament in the 1990s. In 1996, lawmakers attempted to ban coed classes at universities in Kuwait. However, the government has opposed the ban and does not adopt the ban thus universities are still co-ed.  Women's rights Women's suffrage= When voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the right to vote. This right was later removed. In May 2005, the parliament re-granted Kuwaiti female suffrage. The bill, which passed with 35 votes for and 23 against, allows women to vote again and run in parliamentary and local elections. In an August 11, 2008, interview with the Arab Times, Al-Mulla said, \\"Accepting women in the police force is a step in the right direction. We also hope to see women in the army soon. Like men, women are capable of securing the nation and its people. The Interior Ministry is the sole authority for determining the security duties of women.\\" On November 28, 2007, the Interior Ministry announced that the first group of female police force were to begin. Face-veils will not be allowed. The female police force came in implementation of Amiri Decree number 221 of 2001 and cabinet decision number 109 of 2001.  Individual rights Gun control= In February 2005, in the wake of a wave of Al-Qaeda violence, the parliament unanimously passed a law giving police wide powers to search for and seize illegal weapons. MP Abdullah Al-Roumi was one of the main proponents of the bill, which makes it easier for police to obtain a warrant to search a private house for illegal weapons. The law also allows female inspectors to search women's quarters in private homes—quarters which are off limits to men according to Islamic rules. The parliament passed a similar law in 1992 to deal with a jump in gun ownership after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Lawmakers refused to extend that law in 1994, arguing that possession of weapons was a right.  Banking and finance Stock-market bailout= Al-Qallaf criticized the government's October 2008 stock-market bailout, alleging that it short-changed small investors and reasoning that the bailout money would be better spent on social allowances for the masses.Al-Qallaf on the bailout, Al Watan newspaper =Debtors bailout= On December 19, 2006, parliament voted 39–20 to reject a bill that would have seen the government write off $27bn of its citizens' private debts. Al-Rashid voted against the bill, accusing its proponents of succumbing to pressure by constituents so that they would be re-elected: \\"It is very easy for me to become a hero and to forget Kuwait, public money, the interest of our children and future generations.\\" =Guaranteeing bank deposits= On October 28, 2008, the parliament voted 50–7 to insure all types of deposits in all local banks within Kuwait. Al-Qallaf opposed the bill, along with Jabir Al-Azmi, Daifallah Bouramiya, Mohammed Al-Obaid, Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi, and Musallam AlـBarrak and Waleed AlـTabtabaie. Al-Qallaf accused the Cabinet of speeding up the bill's passage for the benefit of monetary tycoons. =Future Generations Fund= In November 2008, Al-Saraawi submitted a request for an expanded debate on the impact of the global financial crisis on Kuwaiti investments abroad, specifically the Future Generations Fund and the State Reserves Fund. The two funds are managed by Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the country's sovereign wealth fund, mostly in the United States and Europe. Its assets were estimated at close to $300 billion before the outbreak of the global crisis. Saraawi said that it is no secret that there is a direct impact from the global financial meltdown on Kuwaiti investments. He added that MPs also want to know the extent of this impact on the country's financial surpluses in the past few years. A number of top officials, including the finance minister and the governor of the Central Bank, have explicitly said that Kuwaiti foreign holdings have been impacted by the crisis but stressed that the effect has so far been \\"small.\\" CorruptionKuwait Airways investigation= On September 9, 2007, Kuwait Airways' board of directors, headed by ruling family member Sheikh Talal Mubarak al-Sabah, resigned following differences with the government over a multibillion-dollar deal to buy new aircraft. In July, Al-Awadi had accused the corporation of squandering public funds and led the parliament to approve a recommendation by a three-MP inquiry committee, which called for top airline executives to be referred to the public prosecutor over alleged financial and administrative irregularities. =Falcon smuggling= on April 17, 2007, Al- Harbash and other MPs submitted documents to parliament claiming that several falcon shipments for \\"influential people\\" had been imported recently without proper testing. Kuwat banned bird imports as an avian influenza precaution, but the ban was eased since July 2006. Al-Harbash sees the smuggling as an example of corruption that puts the country at risk for bird flu: \\"Lifting the ban on falcons was a catastrophe. Why were they exempted from the ban despite warnings by doctors?\\" Al-Harbash says he will ask the parliament's health committee to study the situation and report back. Kuwait reported 20 birds, including 18 falcons, were tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu on February 25 and so far the bird flu cases have risen to 132. In November 2005, Kuwait detected the first case of a bird infected with the H5N1 strain—a flamingo at a seaside villa. =FIFA reforms= On February 8, 2008, Al-Ghanim, as head of the Youth and Sports Committee, agreed to reform the Kuwaiti football program in line with the recommendations of FIFA. In November 2007, FIFA had suspended Kuwait from all international matches because of governmental interference in the national football program. The dispute originated with Kuwait's October 9 elections for key posts in the country's soccer federation. FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) refused to recognise the polls. FIFA said Kuwait had ignored the two bodies' \\"road map\\" of reforms requiring them to set up an interim board to organize fresh elections and draft new guidelines to prevent governmental interference in the game. Oil industryProject Kuwait= Project Kuwait is a $7 billion, 25-year plan, first formulated in 1997 by the SPC, to increase the country's oil production (and to help compensate for declines at the mature Burgan field), with the help of international oil companies. In particular, Kuwait aims to increase output at five northern oil fields (Abdali, Bahra, Ratqa, Raudhatain, and Sabriya) from their current rate of around to within three years. Al-Sane opposes Project Kuwait and allowing foreign oil companies into Kuwait. On December 23, 2005, Al-Sane told the press that he opposed the entry of these foreign companies because it is barred by the constitution: \\"The step the government wants to take is against the law, and we have to stand against it strongly... The constitutional issue is the main one. We're not against foreign investments, but the problem is that you have to stick to the constitution.\\" =Proposed joint venture with Dow Chemical= On December 28, 2008, Kuwait's Supreme Petroleum Council scrapped a $17.4 billion joint venture with U.S. petrochemical giant Dow Chemical. The Cabinet argued that the venture, known as K-Dow Petrochemicals, was \\"very risky\\" in light of the global financial crisis and low oil prices. The move came just days before Jan 1 startup date for the joint venture. The project, in which Kuwait was to hold a $7.5 billion stake, had been criticized in the country as a waste of public funds, and lawmakers threatened to question the prime minister in parliament if it was launched. As criticism over the deal mounted in Kuwait, Oil Minister Mohammed al-Eleim defended the venture as profitable, saying it was carefully studied by international consultants for over two years. Relation between the Parliament and the Ruling FamilyGrilling of Prime Minister Nasser= In November 2008, Al-Mutairi joined with fellow Islamist MPs Waleed AlـTabtabaie and Mohammed AlـMutair in filing a request to grill Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah for allowing prominent Iranian Shiite cleric Mohammad Baqir al-Fali to enter Kuwait despite a legal ban. =Dissolution of the Parliament= On November 21, 2008, AlـShayji criticized calls for unconstitutional dissolution of Parliament, saying that such a move would avail thieves to plunder public funds: \\"Despite all the drawbacks within the National Assembly, the Parliament plays a crucial role in serving the country and the people.\\" References Category:Politics of Kuwait ","title":"Political issues in Kuwait"},{"id":"20847869","text":"The Kingston upon Hull Central by-election, 1919 was a parliamentary by- election held for the House of Commons constituency of Kingston upon Hull Central on 29 March 1919. The by-election was the fifth to be held during the 1918-1922 parliament. Vacancy The seat had become vacant when the Coalition Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Mark Sykes died on 16 February 1919 aged 39, a victim of the Spanish flu pandemic. He had held the seat since winning the 1911 Kingston upon Hull Central by-election on 5 July 1911. Electoral history The result at the last general election in 1918 was; Sykes Candidates Percy *The Unionists selected 32-year-old Lord Eustace Percy as their candidate to defend the seat. He was the seventh son of Henry Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland, and Lady Edith, daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. Percy had served in the Diplomatic Service since 1911. He had not seen war service. He was standing for parliament for the first time. *The Liberals selected 33-year-old Lt-Comdr. Joseph Kenworthy as their candidate to challenge for the seat. He was born at Leamington in Warwickshire and educated at the Eastman's Royal Naval Academy in Winchester. He joined the Royal Navy in 1902 and left the service in 1920 after serving in the Admiralty war staff in London. Kenworthy first tried to enter Parliament at the 1918 general election fighting Rotherham as a Liberal but came third. Campaign Polling Day was set for 29 March 1919, 41 days after the death of the former MP. Nominations closed to confirm that the election would be a two-way contest. Percy immediately received the official endorsement of the Coalition Government. As with the Leyton West by-election 6 weeks earlier, the dominant issue of the campaign was the idea being floated by the Coalition Government of retaining Conscription during peacetime. Kenworthy took a strong line in opposition to continuing conscription. He also argued against the imposition of impossible reparations against Germany. Percy's campaign did little other than express support for the Coalition Government.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies, p30 Result According to reports in The Times newspaper, the by- election proved largely uneventful and the parties were expecting a small poll.The Times, 29 March 1919 In the event there was a turnout of 51% which although on the lower end of the spectrum for by-elections of the day, was not the lowest experienced during the 1918–1922 Parliament.Chris Cook and John Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 pp271-272 Popular opinion was swinging against the coalition government of David Lloyd George and Bonar Law and particularly against the Conservative half of the coalition.The Times, 12 April 1919 As a result, the Liberal candidate, Joseph Kenworthy, gained the seat for his party with a majority of 917 over his Coalition Conservative opponent, Lord Eustace Percy. Kenworthy British Pathe has newsreel footage of Joseph Kenworthy taken after his election victory. http://www.britishpathe.com/video/commander-kenworthy/query/election Aftermath Kenworthy went on to hold the seat for the Liberals at the subsequent general election. The result at the following general election in 1922 was; Percy was to find electoral success elsewhere and go on to sit in the Conservative Cabinet of Stanley Baldwin. The proposal for retaining Conscription during peacetime was quickly dropped.

Facts Braithwait killed a man called Patrick Mahume unlawfully. He asked Lampleigh to ride to the King and petition for a pardon. Lampleigh was successful and, delighted, Braithwait promised £100 to Lampleigh; but he never paid up and Lampleigh sued. Braithwait said that because the service had been performed in the past, there was no good consideration at the time for the promise, regardless of the fact that Lampleigh was successful in securing a pardon.

Its range consists of parts of Colombia and Venezuela. The exact classification of the gray-handed night monkey is uncertain. While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey, A. lemurinus, other authors consider it a separate species, A. griseimembra. In Colombia, its range consists of the northern portion from the Sinú River (or perhaps further east) to the Venezuelan border, including the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Magdalena River, Cauca River and Sao Jorge River valleys. In Venezuela, it is found to the west and south of Maracaibo. The gray-handed night monkey is a relatively small monkey, with males weighing approximately and females weighing about . It has short, tight fur. The fur on the back ranges from grayish brown to reddish brown. The belly is yellowish. The hair on the back of the hands and feet is the color of light coffee with darker hair tips, a key distinguishing feature from other A. lemurinus subspecies. The gray-handed night monkey is arboreal and nocturnal. It and the other members of the genus Aotus are the only nocturnal monkeys. Laboratory experiments indicated lower levels of activity even in lighting conditions consistent with a full moon. It is found in several types of forest, including secondary forest and coffee plantations, although one study indicated a preference for highly diverse forest. It lives in small groups of between two and six monkeys, most typically two to four, consisting of an adult pair and one infant and several juveniles and/or subadults. Groups are territorial, and groups occupy ranges that overlap only slightly. One study found a population density of 1.5 monkeys per square kilometer, while another found a density of 150 monkeys per square kilometer. The latter figure occurred in a forest remnant that had served as a refuge, which may account for the extremely high density. In common with other night monkeys, the gray-handed night monkey is one of the few monogamous monkeys. The monogamous pair generally gives birth to a single infant each year, although twins occasionally occur. The gestation period is about 133 days. The father carries the infant from the time it is one or two days old, passing it to the mother for nursing. Average interbirth interval for the mother is 271 days. The gray-handed night monkey is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is believed to be particularly threatened in Colombia. This is in part due to habitat loss, but also because many were captured in the 1960s and 1970s for malaria research.

In the late 1960s, the party contested elections in Sudan seeking autonomy for South Sudan within a federal structure. The exile branch of the party meanwhile supported full independence. A party with this name was represented in the Southern Sudan legislature in 2008. Origins Some time after the army took power in 1958, William Deng fled into exile, as did other southern politicians including Fr. Saturnino Ohure, Joseph Oduho and Alexis Bakumba. Saturnino Ohure and Joseph Oduho moved from Uganda to Kinshasa, Zaire, where they were joined by William Deng and founded the Sudan African Closed Districts National Union (SACDNU) in 1962. The exiles moved back to Kampala in Uganda in 1963 and shortened the movement's name to Sudan African National Union (SANU). Joseph Oduho was the first president of SANU (1962-1964). The new name was designed to show solidarity with other African nationalist movements of the period. Party in exile In Kampala, SANU became the voice of the 60,000 refugees who had fled to camps in Zaire and Uganda, but was unable to establish a political presence in Sudan. The SANU leaders did manage to organize a loose guerrilla movement, the Anyanya, which began operating in Equatoria in 1963, conducting isolated raids and largely remaining independent of the politicians in Kampala. Attempt at democracy In February 1965 William Deng split with the exiled SANU leaders and returned to Sudan, causing a split into SANU-inside and SANU- outside wings, with Deng leading the \\"inside\\" wing and Aggrey Jadein leading the \\"outside\\" wing. SANU was formally registered as a political party in Sudan at a rally in Omdurman on 11 April 1965 attended by about 2,000 southerners. Deng's wing of SANU and the Southern Front, a mass organization led by Stanislaus Paysama, contested the April 1965 parliamentary elections. SANU was an active force in Sudanese politics for the next four years, advocating southern autonomy within a federal structure. In the 1968 election, William Deng won his seat by a landslide, but was assassinated just as the results were announced. Later years The exiled SANU leaders did not accept Deng's moderate approach, and formed the Azania Liberation Front in Kampala, Uganda. Between 1965 and 1967 Joseph Oduho was president of the Azania Liberation Front. He finally broke with the exile groups in 1971 due to disagreement with Joseph Lagu, commander of the Anyanya guerrilla fighters, who wanted to subordinate the political wing of the movement to the military wing.

It is a non-profit Institute created in 1984 with the aim of promoting research and developing postgraduate programs in diverse technological fields through participation in projects funded by the industry and administrations. The applied research at IIT is project oriented and results in doctoral dissertations and scientific publications, technical reports, and software products and applications. It also provides specialized training in Master and PhD programs and in-house courses. IIT is completely self-financed through externally funded research activities, creating a strong nexus to the Industry and Administrations; it responds thus to a clear social demand. About 70% of all research projects carried out are privately financed by the Industry. IIT has proven that a project-based research is sustainable and that this applied research allows self-financing the IIT. Several models and tools of the IIT such as the Reference Network Model (RNM) or its off-spring the Rural Electrification Model (REM), SPLODER, an in-house developed AGC controller, iSLA, etc. are widely used throughout the Industry and Administrations. IIT has a strong presence in international organizations and associations. IIT research staff is currently leading the Electric Energy Systems – University Enterprise Training Partnership (EES-UETP) network or the International Smart Grid Action Network (ISGAN) academy. IIT is also actively involved in working groups of Conseil International des Grands Réseaux Électriques (CIGRE) and Congrès International des Réseaux Electriques de Distribution (CIRED).  History  IIT was created on March 6, 1984. As indicated in the minutes of the meeting of the Governing Board, the core initial investigators formed the group dedicated to the area of energy in the late Technological Institute for Postgraduates (ITP). The ITP project emerged in 1974 to bring to Spain the academic-business collaboration structure from the American postgraduate. The ITP was funded by Spanish companies and driven by Antonio Barrera de Irimo, Minister of Finance, President of Telefónica and the Board of trustees at ICAI. He sent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston about 40 graduates in engineering and applied sciences to study and research in that institution and bring to Spain its innovative spirit and quality of research, to make them serve a thriving industry Postgraduates Institute of Technology. The group completed their training, but did not finish their final purpose, as Spain in the 70's and 80's was focused on political change and lacked public instruments to support research. Ignacio Pérez Arriaga, ICAI engineer and professor at the School of Engineering (ICAI), was in the group sent to MIT. Since his return in 1981, he had made compatible lectures at ICAI and research for ITP. He had innovated in his subject, Projects for Power System Specialty, and had some emerging research projects with ITP in collaboration with his students. These group will constitute the first nucleus of the IIT. In February 1984, Pérez Arriaga proposed to the Board of the university to create an own institute. His idea was accepted immediately. IIT was created and Pérez Arriage as promotor was nominated for director, and started with the researchers Emilio Buquerín, Antonio Fernández, Tomás Gómez San Román, Carmen Illan, Javier Jarauta, Daniel Lanzas, Antonio Lozano, Francisco Nieto, Andrés Ramos, Carlos Román and María Jose González Balandín. Most of them were ICAI engineers, and also from Polytechnic and science graduates. Alongside previous research projects with ITP, the first project of IIT was on methods of pricing power in the United States, José María Arraiza developed for Union Fenosa and would be the starting point for the new Spanish regulatory framework of 1987. More projects for Endesa, Spanish Hydroelectric, Iberduero and Red Electrica follow that initial project on pricing. New courses and studies for institutions and Latin American companies also started, being the interconnection of Central America power systems the most relevant project. Meanwhile, thesis were becoming similar in quality to those of best foreign universities.  Research activities  IIT's research activities are divided into 8 research units: Electric Power Systems, Energy System Models, Energy Economics and Regulation, Smart and Sustainable Grids, Intelligent Systems, Railway Systems, Bioengineering, and Fire Safety, Thermal and Fluids Engineering. The units are self-sustained by funds obtained by projects for private and public institutions and companies. Nonetheless, a strong collaboration exists between the units due to their inherent synergies and complementarities. The units have developed a set of tools and technologies used by the industry and administrations. = Electric Power Systems = The Electric Power Systems research unit is a multidisciplinary group made up of professors and researchers of the IIT. Its central focus is research related to the analysis, control and modelling of electricity power systems and its work has largely been carried out in collaboration with industry, and national and European public research bodies, whose financial support enables the group to do its work. The unit has also developed several software, among other a software implementing an AGC controller or a tool for the tuning of frequency protections. Research lines include: * Steady-state * Automatic generation control * Stability * Electromagnetic Transients * Quality * Isolated systems: islands, microgrids, off-grid * Power electronics * HVDC/FACTS = Energy System Models = The Energy Systems Modeling unit is constituted by expert researchers in developing models for efficiently supporting decisions and techno-economic analysis of generation, transmission and distribution systems in the energy sector. A fundamental aspect is the modelling of energy markets and the associated operative, tactical and strategic decisions. The unit's research is the cornerstone of disciplines such as operations research, energy economics and power systems operation. The unit's work is focused on the creation of numerous computer models and on providing complementary analysis, advice and consulting services. The unit is a relevant leader and participates in European projects with public or private support and in many national and international projects. Research lines include: * Unit-commitment in electricity markets with high RES penetration * Network constrained optimal generation scheduling for hybrid AC/DC systems * Strategic bidding models * Short and Medium term hydro and hydrothermal scheduling * Integrated water and energy models * Electricity and natural gas market models * Risk management models * Generation and transmission planning co-optimization * EPEC and MPEC models = Energy Economics and Regulation = The activities of Energy Economics and Regulation research unit are centered on the design and analysis of the regulative measures which make possible the incorporation of strategic, economic and environmental considerations into the management of the energy sector in order that they may guide the technical and financial decisions of buyers and sellers in the energy market with the final objective of maximizing net social benefit. The unit is particularly active in the Electricity Sector. The unit offers an important range of activities, making a significant research contribution both nationally and internationally through national and European, privately and publicly funded research and development projects. It has also carried out advisory and consultancy work commissioned by regulating institutions, operators/traders and by private companies in a wide range of countries (Spain, Holland, Italy, France, Russia, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama and so on). The unit has also a close collaboration with the training courses for European regulators which are organized by the Florence School of Regulation and are supported by the European Union. Research lines include: * Energy markets design and regulation * Analysis of sustainable energy policies * Regulation of energy network infrastructures * Network regulation and tariff design with large shares of DER * Long-term energy scenarios * Energy poverty: indicators, policy and regulation * Innovative business models in the power sector = Smart and Sustainable Grids = The Smart and Sustainable Grids research unit is an interdisciplinary group at the IIT which is focused on the analysis and development of models for the simulation and optimization of future electricity networks. These networks will enable to ensure the viability of the model of sustainable energy required by society in the 21st century. This model is characterised by the centrality of the role of renewable energies with distributed characteristics, by a flexible energy demand and the capacity to meet that demand, and by a quality of service which meets the expectations of the digital society. The unit offers an important range of activities, making a significant research contribution both nationally and internationally through national and international, privately and publicly funded research and development projects. The unit has also developed a software tool, the Reference Network Model, designed for the planning of large scale distribution networks and for assessing the impact of Distributed Energy Resources. Research lines include: * Smart grids * Green energy integration * Planning and operation of DER * Universal energy access and rural electrification * Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) * Smart grid data modelling (CIM, 61850, other ontologies) * Data exchange protocols * Sustainable mobility and electric vehicles * Representative electricity networks and applications = Intelligent Systems = The Intelligent Systems research unit is an interdisciplinary research group which is focused on the study and application of advanced techniques to facilitate decision making in the exploitation and planning of systems, equipment and industrial processes. Making use of the most advanced techniques and technology, we design, develop and put into operation ‘made to measure’ systems to facilitate decision making in complex problems. The area carries out most of its activities in the electrical, gas, agricultural transport and health sectors. The fields of activity of the area and the techniques employed are rapidly selected and modified in accordance with changes in technology and the interests of industry. Research lines include: * Smart client, building and districts * Smart industry: security and asset control * Smart industry: life cycle analysis and asset management * Smart industry: maintenance, reliability and diagnosis with self and deep learning techniques * Advance data analytics in distribution networks * Energy data analytics = Railway Systems = The Railway Systems research unit is an interdisciplinary research group specifically focused on the railway sector. The unit is led by Dr. Paloma Cucala. The principal activity of the unit is the development of models and advanced applications for the system optimization. The rapid expansion and modernization of railway technology requires a capacity to rapidly update the research techniques applied: simulation, optimization, numerical modeling, data analysis, control, digitalization and artificial intelligence.

The claimed territory was the land from the Delmarva Peninsula to southern Cape Cod. The settled areas are now part of the Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey, and Delaware, with small outposts in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Its capital of New Amsterdam was located at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan on the Upper New York Bay. The region was initially explored in 1609 by Henry Hudson on an expedition for the Dutch East India Company. It was later surveyed and charted, and was given its name in 1614. The Dutch named the three main rivers of the province the Zuyd Rivier (South River, now the Delaware River), the Noort Rivier (North River, now the Hudson River), and the Versche Rivier (Fresh River, now the Connecticut River). They intended to use them to gain access to the interior, the indigenous population, and the lucrative fur trade. International law required discovery, charting, and settlement to perfect a territorial claim. Large scale settlement was rejected in favor of a formula that was working in Asia of establishing factories (trading posts with a military presence and a small support community). This period is sometimes referred to as the Dutch Golden Age, despite on-going wars on the European continent, and it was difficult to recruit people to leave the economic boom and cultural vibrancy of Europe. Mismanagement and under-funding by the Dutch West India Company hindered early settlement, as well as misunderstandings and armed conflict with Indians. Liberalization of trade, a degree of self-rule, and the loss of Dutch Brazil led to exponential growth in the 1650s. Transfers of power from the Netherlands to England were peaceful in the province, the last one formalized in 1674. Forts and Factorijen The first of two Forts Nassau was built in Mahican territory during the first decade, where commerce could be conducted with Indians, and factorijen (small trading posts) went up at Schenectady, Schoharie, Esopus, Quinnipiac, Communipaw, Ninigret, Totoket, The Dutch set up a trading post at the mouth of the Branford River in the 1600s, the source of the name \\"Dutch Wharf.\\" Branford Chamber of Commerce, Schuykill, and elsewhere. Trapper Jan Rodrigues is believed to have been the first non-Indian to winter on the island of Manhattan in 1611. Nut Island The States General of the Dutch Republic awarded the newly formed Dutch West India Company a trade monopoly for the region in 1621, and New Netherland became a province of the Dutch Republic in 1624. The South River was initially chosen as the site of the capital because the colonists felt that it had the best climate. However, summer humidity, mosquitos, and winter freezing made the North River more appealing. A number of ships brought settlers to the New World, at first to Noten Island and soon after to the tip of Manhattan, and the colonists began construction of Fort Amsterdam, around which the colony began to grow. Small groups of the early arrivals were dispersed to Fort Orange, to Fort Wilhelmus, or to Kievets Hoek, but those who went to Fort Wilhelmus and Kievets Hoek were later recalled. Among those who made the crossing were many Walloons and 11 Africans as company-owned slaves. Patroonships In 1629, the Dutch West India Company introduced the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions, a series of inducements commonly known as the patroon system. Invested members could receive vast land patents and manorial rights, somewhat reminiscent of a feudal lord, if they were willing to fulfill certain conditions, including transporting and settling at least 50 persons. A number of attempts were made, but the only notable success was the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. Pavonia, across the river from New Amsterdam, was returned to the company and became a company-managed holding. In 1640, company policy was changed to allow land purchases by individuals in good standing. South River Another patroon patent was Zwaanendael Colony later named by the British, Lewes, Delaware (the town is still known as such), the first Dutch colonial settlement on the Zuyd Rivier (Delaware Bay), but it was plundered soon after its founding in 1631.The Zwaanendael Museum After 1638, settlement was mostly in New Sweden, and these were brought under New Netherland control in 1655 when Fort Casimir was built. In 1663, Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy attempted to create a utopian settlement in the region, but it expired under English rule.Bart Plantegna. (April 2001) \\"The Mystery of the Plockhoy Settlement in the Valley of Swans \\". Mennonite Historical Bulletin. Fresh River (Connecticut) The Dutch established a short-lived factorij trading post at Kievits Hoek (or Plover's Corner) in present-day Old Saybrook, Connecticut shortly after constructing their first settlement on the island of Manhattan. They abandoned it soon after, however, in order to focus on the trading post at Fort Goede Hoop on the Connecticut River, which was completed in 1633. The Dutch also had a trading post and possible fort at the mouth of the Branford River in Branford, Connecticut, which still contains a wharf called \\"Dutch Wharf.\\" Branford Chamber of Commerce web site accessed 26 June 2006http://www.livingplaces.com/CT/New_Haven_County/Branford_Town/Branford_Point_Historic_District.htmlThe Archaeology of 17th-Century New Netherland Since 1985: An Update Paul R.

Petrus Stuyvesant attempted to prevent further competition for the area and agreed to a border 50 miles west of the river in the Treaty of Hartford (1650). This did some not stem the flow of New Englanders to Long Island and the mainland along Long Island Sound, however. North River The port called the Manhattans grew up at the mouth of the North River (Hudson River). New Amsterdam was the capital of the province and received its municipal charter in 1652; this included the isle of Manhattan, Staaten Eylandt, Pavonia, and the Lange Eylandt towns, including Gravesend, Breuckelen, and Nieuw Amersfoort. A municipal charter was also granted to Beverwijck in 1652, which had grown from a trading post to a bustling town in the midst of Rensselaerswyck.Beverwyck In 1657, the homesteads scattered along the west bank of the Hudson Valley in Esopus country were required to build a garrison that became the province's third largest town of Wiltwijk. The Dutch Belt Colonial settlers spread throughout the region after the final transfer of power to the English with the Treaty of Westminster (1674), establishing many of the towns and cities that exist today. The Dutch Reformed Church played an important role in this expansion.

Development Side view of Scott Flying Squirrel taken at the Ace Cafe The Squirrel name was used for Scott motorcycles since 1921 but with the death of the founder Alfred Angas Scott in 1923 the unorthodox Scott two-stroke motorcycles began to become more conventional. Development of the three-speed Scott Flying Squirrel began in 1922 as the company was in severe debt and faced receivership. Launched at the 1926 Earls Court motorcycle show, the Flying Squirrel was expensive - nearly twice the cost of a sporting four-stroke motorcycle of the time. The unique water-cooled circulation used a convection method known as the thermosyphon system. The bottom end block was painted either green or red for racing or road respectively and featured a centrally positioned flywheel, twin inboard main bearings, overhung crankpins and doors to enable ease of access to the engine. The redesigned three-speed gearbox, multi-plate clutch and the repositioned magneto were all significant improvements. 1932 Squirrel In 1929 Scott achieved third place in the Isle of Man TT and launched a road going TT Replica Flying Squirrel. Following cost cutting the factory also launched a basic touring model in 1929 for under £70. Financial problems continued, however, and in 1931 Scott were unable to enter the TT or the Earls Court show. A three-cylinder prototype was developed but Scotts lacked the resources to develop it and on the outbreak of World War II production ended. Between 1935 and 1938 the factory at Shipley in Yorkshire produced the B2592 air-cooled Aero engine, based on the Scott Flying Squirrel motorcycle unit. A version was also specifically developed to power the notoriously dangerous Flying Flea aircraft. In 1950 the rights were bought by the Birmingham based Aerco Company and in 1956 they produced what are known as the Birimingham Scotts. In the late 1970s, Silk Engineering produced the Silk 700S, which comprised an uprated Scott engine fitted into a modern Egli-type frame made by Spondon Engineering.

Located in what was once part of Denmark, it was one of earliest Danish religious houses. There are no remnants of the abbey remaining today.  History  There is disagreement between scholars as to how long the Benedictines had a monastery at Lund. An important historic source of information about the abbey is the 'Necrologium Lundense ', essentially an obituary book kept by monks. The data has been used by some scholars to indicate the dates of historic events including for the date of founding. There was a monastic house in Lund perhaps as early as 1072 founded by Ricwald, Bishop of Lund (1072-1089) during the reign of King Sweyn Estridsson who imported German monks from Brauweiler Abbey near Cologne. Bishop Ricwalf is named as the founder of the abbey church sometime after 1072 in the 'Necrologium Lundense '. It may be that the church was constructed on one of the properties given to the Diocese of Lund by King Canute IV of Denmark in the first year of his reign. The small community of mostly German Benedictine monks at Lund apparently flourished. Abbot Hartwig from St. Pantaleon's Abbey in Cologne was named as the first abbot of the Benedictine house at Lund in 1123. All Saints Abbey was constructed just outside the wall of Lund about 1138, the year Bishop Eskil was elevated to Archbishop of Lund by Pope Innocent II. The complex consisted of a three range set of buildings connected to the abbey church. Monks slept in the dormitory and ate in the refectory with large cellars located beneath. One wing was for the use of the lay brothers who did much of the work of the abbey. Another range contained the abbey's library and scriptorium, though not a single manuscript has survived. In 1536, King Christian III of Denmark and the State Council (Riksråd) voted to accept the , thereby, making Denmark a Lutheran state. All religious houses and their income properties fell to the crown. Christian systematically closed the monasteries and superfluous churches most of which were torn down or put to other uses. Building materials from the demolition was used for construction of other structures throughout Scania. All Saints Abbey was demolished and most of its archive destroyed.

In the early 1920s the Berwick-upon-Tweed electricity undertaking was operated as part of the Urban Electric Supply Company Limited. The latter company operated electricity undertakings in Caterham, Cambourne, Dartmouth & Kingswear, Glossop, Godalming, Grantham, Illogan, Newbury, Newton Abbot, Redruth, Stamford, Weybridge and Woking. In 1923 the plant at Berwick-upon- Tweed comprised three 90 kW and one 200 kW reciprocating engines driving electricity generators. The machines were supplied with up to 22,000 lb/hr (9,979 kg/hr) of steam. The generators operated at 500 Volts and supplied Direct Current at 240 and 480 Volts to consumers. In 1923 the plant generated 539.447 GWh, the maximum load was 330 MW and there were 1,673 connections on the system. The undertaking sold 423,000 kWh which generated an income of £10,338. After deduction of expense there was a profit of £5,083. The station was constructed in the 1930s to generate electricity for the town. The station's main building, which consisted of a boiler house and turbine hall, stood at two stories tall. The station was designed to fit in with the town walls, and so constructed in stone. The main building was a triple gabled building, with irregular windows. It had frontage onto the river for easy access to condensing water and coal delivery. After ceasing to generate electricity in the 1960s, the generating equipment was removed and the building was used as a storehouse. The building was eventually demolished in the late 1990s.

The term most often refers to villages in what are today the Republic of North Macedonia (Vardar Macedonia) and Greek Macedonia (Aegean Macedonia). In the context of Macedonia, such villages often lie in otherwise Grecoman and Serboman areas. The name Little Sofia was used pejoratively by the Grecoman and Serboman population as well as Serbia and Greece's armed propaganda and later those nations' authorities in parts of the region.

The term \\"battle\\" is something of a misnomer because the encounter consisted primarily of an artillery duel. However, it was costly for the French: the great French marshal, the Vicomte de Turenne, was killed by a cannonball. The Imperial army was commanded by the Italian Field Marshal Raimondo Montecuccoli. Background The Rhineland area 1674–1675, Strasbourg upper left; note the narrow corridor between the Rhine and the Black Forest During the previous War of Devolution (1667–1668), France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands but under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, it was forced to relinquish most of these gains by the Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. Louis XIV now moved to break up the Alliance before making another attempt on the Spanish Netherlands. In return for large subsidies, Sweden agreed to remain neutral and to attack its regional rival, Brandenburg-Prussia if it attempted to intervene. In 1670, Charles II of England signed the Treaty of Dover, agreeing to an alliance with France against the Dutch, and the provision of 6,000 English and Scottish troops for the French army.Lynn 1999, p. 109-110. The treaty also contained secret provisions, not revealed until 1771, one being the payment by Louis to Charles of £230,000 per year for the services of this brigade.J. P. Kenyon, The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68. France invaded the Dutch Republic in May 1672 starting the Franco-Dutch War (1672 – 1678) and seemed at first to have achieved an overwhelming victory. However, the Dutch position stabilised, while concern at French gains brought support from Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and Charles II of Spain. Louis was now forced into another war of attrition around the French frontiers and in August, an Imperial army opened a new front in the Rhineland.Lynn 1999, p. 117. The French army in Germany was led by Turenne, (1611-1675), considered the greatest general of the period. Over the next two years, he won a series of victories over superior Imperial forces led by Alexander von Bournonville and Raimondo Montecuccoli, the one commander contemporaries viewed as equal to Turenne. France found itself over-extended, a problem that increased in January 1674 when Denmark joined the Alliance; in February, England left the war by signing the Treaty of Westminster with the Dutch Republic. The campaign that started in June 1674 and ended with his death in July 1675, has been described as 'possibly Turenne's most brilliant campaign.' Significantly outnumbered, he fought Bournonville to a standstill at Entzheim in early October, followed by a surprise winter attack that culminated in another decisive victory at the Battle of Turckheim in January 1675.Lynn, 1999, 127. The campaign of 1675 begins After Bournonville's defeat, Montecuccoli took over command of the Imperial forces in southern Germany. He hoped to make up for the recent disaster by crossing the Rhine River at Strasbourg and re- occupying Alsace. In the spring of 1675, he marched west through the Black Forest into the Rhine valley. There, he gathered in the remnants of Bournonville's army, some 8,000 men. The Imperial army now numbered 18,000 foot and 14,000 horse. On May 20, Montecuccoli established his headquarters at Willstatt. At the same time, his scouts reached Kehl, the town on the east bank of the Rhine opposite Strasbourg.Ferdinand Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne d'apres des documents inedits (1672-1675) (Nancy: Sidot Freres, 1903), 553-554; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 140. As Montecuccoli approached the east bank of the Rhine, Turenne and his army—20,000 foot and 15,000 horse—moved to block the Imperials on the opposite bank. The French commander sent word to Strasbourg, then an independent city, demanding that the Imperial army not be allowed to use the city's bridge over the Rhine. However, unimpressed by Turenne's recent victory, Strasbourg favored the Empire. Not only did the city authorities permit Montecuccoli to cross on May 22, but they also supplied his headquarters with delicacies. For his part, the Imperial commander seemed intimidated by Turenne's approach. Although Montecuccoli crossed the Rhine, he did not bring his army with him. He made a pretense of moving troops to Kehl, but he and his army were soon marching north to attempt a crossing elsewhere.Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 556-557; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 140. War of maneuver On May 31, Montecuccoli crossed to the west bank of the Rhine near Speyer. However, his move was nothing more than a feint designed to draw Turenne north, away from Strasbourg; the Imperial army pulled back to the east bank on June 4. Turenne was not taken in by the ruse. The French army began to build temporary bridges across the Rhine at Ottenheim south of Strasbourg on June 6, and the French were across by June 8. Now both armies were on the east bank. As Montecuccoli had done, Turenne chose Willstatt for his headquarters. The Imperial army hurried south to confront the French who now blocked the way to Kehl and Strasbourg. The Imperial advance guard, 4,000 men under Charles of Lorraine (soon to be Charles V, Duke of Lorraine), attacked the French lines but was repelled.Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 560, 564-566; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 140. Montecuccoli attempted another feint to draw Turenne away from Kehl. He marched around the French eastern flank, skirting the Black Forest, to occupy Offenburg. He sent troops even further south to threaten the French bridges at Ottenheim. Refusing to take the bait, Turenne merely pulled up his bridges and moved them north, closer to Willstatt. For a week, the two armies watched each other, neither side willing to bring on a general engagement. At last, lack of forage forced Montecuccoli to withdraw north to entrench his army along the Rench River, 10 miles from Strasbourg. He left 5,000 men under Count Aeneas de Caprara to hold Offenburg. In response, Turenne moved most of his army to face the new Imperial position while keeping a garrison in Willstatt.Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 567-569; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 140-141. Both sides suffered from supply problems and from the weather. French horses were reduced to eating leaves, and the troops suffered under continuous rain. While the armies marked time waiting for better weather, Turenne had a close call. Peasants fired on him and a party of French officers, killing a guard who stood near Turenne. The rain let up on July 22, and Turenne began a turning maneuver that sought to pin Montecuccoli against the Rench. The French vanguard attacked the Imperials at Gamshurst but was driven off. Montecuccoli attempted an attack of his own on July 23–24, but this was hampered by fog. There was more fighting over the day and night of July 25–26. Seeing no hope of victory along the Rench, Montecuccoli ordered a retreat to the Black Forest, instructing Caprara to abandon Offenburg and join the main Imperial army.Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 574, 583; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 141. The Encounter at Salzbach Turenne followed after the Imperials. By this time, attrition had reduced each army to an approximate strength of 25,000 men. On the morning of July 27, the French found the Imperial army entrenching around the village of Salzbach, behind a stream of the same name, on a small plain at the foot of the mountains. The Imperial baggage train could be seen moving into the pine forest beyond the village. Montecuccoli took advantage of hedges and woods in protecting his troops, and placed musketeers in the village church and an old castle on his right flank. The Imperial commander had to hold this position because he was waiting for Caprara to join him. This officer was slow in arriving, though, because the presence of the French army had forced him to take a long detour through the foothills.A Relation or Journal of the Campaigns of the Marechal de Turenne, in the Years One Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Four, and One Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Five; 'Til the Time of His Death. Done from the French, By an Officer of the Army (Dublin: Addison's Head, 1732), 124-126; Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 584-585; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 140-141. The French army formed line of battle south of the Salzbach Stream, with infantry to the front and cavalry behind. Turenne sent Pierre de Mormez, Seigneur de Saint Hilaire, his lieutenant general of artillery, to determine how best to place the army's guns. French volunteers went forward to fire the nearest houses of the village, and eight French cannon were brought up to bombard the church and castle. Part of the village caught fire, but the French artillery was not effective against the church and castle because the Imperials had erected field fortifications in the church yard and cemetery to protect the structures. Imperial cannon responded, and an artillery duel began. Turenne sent a dispatch to King Louis saying he planned to attack the Imperials if they began to retreat. The French marshal discussed the situation with his generals, seeming confident of success. The French could see much movement among the Imperial units, suggesting irresolution, and the enemy looked to be on the verge of withdrawing.A Relation or Journal, 126-129; Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 585; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 141; Francois Alexandre Aubert de la Chesnaye-Desbois,Dictionnaire Genealogique, Heraldique, Historique et Chronologique, Tome V (Paris: Duchesne, 1761), 625. Turenne's death The Death of Turenne At about 2:00 p.m., Saint Hilaire asked Turenne to inspect a battery he was siting to suppress fire from Imperial guns commanded by Margrave Hermann of Baden-Baden. A staff officer urged caution because of the danger posed by the enemy's artillery fire. It has been suggested that the fire was especially hot because Saint Hilaire wore a red cloak, providing a good target. According to one source, Turenne agreed to be cautious, reportedly saying \\"je ne veux point être tué aujourd'hui\\" (\\"I do not want to be killed today.\\"). As the marshal and the general conferred, an Imperial cannonball hit them. It took off Saint Hilaire's left arm and passed through Turenne's body from shoulder to side. Turenne was able to take two steps before he fell, but he said nothing. Saint Hilaire survived, but Turenne died of his wound.A Relation or Journal, 129; Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 587-588; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 141. Another source ascribes to Turenne a somewhat different set of last words: \\"I did not mean to be killed today.\\" Laura Ward, Famous Last Words: The Ultimate Collection of Finales and Farewells (London: PRC Publishing Limited, 2004), 108. This phrasing suggests that he uttered the statement after being hit. It seems unlikely that a man could speak after a cannonball strike to the chest. At first, the French tried to hide the fact that their commander was dead. Meanwhile, Montecuccoli was expressing surprise that full-scale fighting had not yet begun by mid-afternoon. He soon learned of Turenne's death, possibly from a deserter. He is reported to have declared: \\"Today died a man who did honor to mankind.\\"A Relation or Journal, 129; Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 589, 591; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 141. The End and Aftermath of the Encounter As news of Turenne's death spread through the French army, there was grief, consternation, and anger. The soldiers, particularly the infantry, loved the old marshal. Some said: \\"Notre pere est mort, mais il faut le venger.\\" (\\"Our father is dead, but we must avenge him.\\"). Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges, the lieutenant general of the day (and Turenne's nephew), assumed command, although another officer disputed this for a time.Each day in rotation, one of the army's lieutenant generals served as officer of the day and assumed a range of responsibilities such as the organization of foraging. John Lynn, Giant of the Grand Siecle: The French Army 1610-1715 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 290. The French cannons continued to fire. But soon it became clear that there would be no major battle. On the night of July 29–30, the French army retreated in good order. A volunteer with the army stated later that Turenne's plan of campaign died with him, and that the generals who took over from him were considered worthy of reward merely for safely getting back across the Rhine to await orders from the royal court. Montecuccoli pressed hard on the French as they withdrew. It is not clear why he did not attack on July 27 as soon as he heard of Turenne's death. With his army disposed to defend against a blow from Turenne, he may not have considered it in a position to go over to the offensive. Once the French were in retreat, Montecuccoli felt strong enough to attack. He brought on a sharp fight at the Schutter River, but was unable to prevent the French from crossing into Alsace.A Relation or Journal, 129-131; Des Robert, Les Campagnes de Turenne en Allemagne, 589, 591; Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV, 141. It has been suggested that a full battle took place at Salzbach, ending in a French victory. E.g., article on the Franco-Dutch War. However, the sources cited herein and others indicate that there was no such victory on that day. The Battlefield Today Turenne fell in what is now the small town of Sasbach, Germany. A monument stands near the site of Turenne's death, and the Turenne-Museum is nearby. (accessed October 10, 2015) In popular culture At the battle of Salzbach, Montecuculi, the Austrian commander, noticed the French troops making a movement so different from the cautious style of his famous rival that he exclaimed, 'Either Turenne is dead or mortally wounded.' So it proved to be; the French marshal had been killed by a cannon-ball before the movement began.\\" NotesReferences Brooks, Richard, ed. Atlas of World Military History.

Trygve Johannessen (born 11 January 1953) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He is best known for his time at Viking, with whom he won four league titles and one cup between 1974 and 1982. He scored a total of 181 goals in 312 games for Viking (these numbers include friendlies). Career Johannessen had many youth caps when he moved from Florvåg to Viking in the summer of 1974. Viking paid somewhat less than for the player, at a time when money was seen as taboo in Norwegian football. Johannessen played well to hold his place in the team, and was for many years Viking's top scorer. He became top goalscorer in the first division with 17 goals in 1977 and 11 goals in 1982. After a couple of seasons in the reserves at Viking, Johannessen was sold to neighbours Vidar in 1981. Here he was an unrivalled success. In the course of a season, he scored 56 goals and helped Vidar to promotion to the Second Division. In 1982, he returned to Viking. He won his fifth title with the club and together with Ham-Kam's Tor Arne Granerud he was top scorer with eleven goals. In 1983, he returned to Vidar again, where he stayed for two seasons. Over his three seasons with Vidar, Johannessen played 109 games and scored 124 goals (including friendlies). In his first ten years of his career, Johannessen scored a total of 305 goals for the two Stavanger clubs. In 1985, he played one season for Brann and scored eleven league goals. Johannessen finished his football career in Florvåg IF, where he started it. He later became manager of many local clubs, such as Florvåg, Løv-Ham, Follese FK and Askøy FK. Johannessen won five caps and seven youth caps. He made his international debut against the Soviet Union on 24 September 1975. His other caps were Olympic qualifying matches in 1979.
