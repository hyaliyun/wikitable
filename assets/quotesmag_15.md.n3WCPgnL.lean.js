Introduction  After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, concerns about the fate of the Soviet \\"nuclear cities\\" fell into the hands of Russia. It was in these secret, highly restricted cities that the Soviet Union designed and produced its nuclear weapons. Due to the great importance of these cities, they were generously funded by the Soviet Union. After the fall of the USSR, the 600,000 residents and workers of these cities were left enormous funding problems over the past decade of political, social, and economic difficulties in Russia. Despite attempts by Moscow to create self-sustainable infrastructure, the attempts ultimately failed. The , now the Partnership for Global Security, responded by launching the Nuclear Cities Initiative. The initiative was brought about after a 1997 report by the RANSAC recommended action to prevent the \\"nuclear know-how\\" of the workers in the cities falling into undesirable hands. United States president Bill Clinton and Russian leader Boris Yeltsin made the deal in September 1998, confirming their approval of the overall concept. In 1999 $15 million were procured from American assistance programmes, but a Russian financial crisis and Congress' decision to halve funding to $7.5 million reduced funding to the project. The project at first worked only on a few of the cities; Russia disallowed development elsewhere until success could be proven in a handful of cities first. In 2001, the U.S. General Accounting Office criticised the progress made so far, and recommended merging NCI and the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention into a single programme to improve efficiency. By the end of the Clinton administration, over $30 million had been secured for the project, but this was heavily cut by the following Bush administration who reduced expenditure to $6.6 million. However, the 2002 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, which merged IPP and NCI, resulted in a substantial increase in funding to $42 million as it brought funding from the Russian Transition Initiatives budget, which was further increased by $15 million after the September 11 attacks.

However, with a prominence of only 17 metres it is arguable whether it can be counted as an independent mountain, or just as a subpeak of the Gro√üglockner. It lies in the Glockner Group of Austria's Central Alps, the middle section of the Hohe Tauern. Geographically and geologically speaking, it is viewed a secondary summit of the neighbouring Gro√üglockner, but in the literature, in view of its importance to mountaineering, it is in some cases treated as separate. Its peak forms part of the Glockner crest or ridge (Glocknerkamm) and lies exactly on the border between the Austrian state of Carinthia and Lienz District in the East Tyrol. The Kleinglockner has the shape of a sharp edge, covered with the so-called Glockner Cornice (Glocknerwechte) and, depending on the conditions, can make the ascent of the mountain dangerous to almost impossible. The climbing history of the Kleinglockner is closely linked to that of the Gro√üglockner, because the first climbers, coming from the south and east, had to cross it.

The team was established in 1903, the first year of the PCL. Franchise history Many baseball teams have been known as the Portland Beavers; the most recent club, which began operating in 2001, recognized the history of all previous incarnations as its own, stating it was established in 1903, the same year the Pacific Coast League was established. The \\"Beavers\\" originated in 1906 following a newspaper contest to rename the existing Portland team that had been created in 1901 when a group of Portland businessmen founded the Portland Baseball Club. Along with the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Oaks, Sacramento Solons, San Francisco Seals, and Seattle Rainiers, a Portland Beavers club was a charter member of the Pacific Coast League in 1903. Portland and Sacramento were the only two charter cities that had a team in the PCL as of 2010, the other cities having been taken over by Major League Baseball franchises. Following the 2010 season, the Beavers were placed for sale and relocation because of the lack of a suitable stadium in Portland, as PGE Park was being remodeled into a soccer-only configuration for Major League Soccer's 2011 expansion Portland Timbers. In 2010, the Beavers were sold to Jeff Moorad, owner of the San Diego Padres. The team temporarily moved to southern Arizona and became the Tucson Padres while awaiting a new purpose-built stadium in their planned future home of Escondido, California. After the 2013 season, the Padres instead moved to El Paso, Texas and became the El Paso Chihuahuas. =Establishment of a Portland team: 1903‚Äì1918= On December 10, 1902, Henry Harris, the owner of the California League's San Francisco team announced that the Pacific Northwest League team from Portland, the Portland Webfoots, and a new team from Seattle were joining with the California League to create the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Before the Portland franchise joined the PCL, the president of the Pacific Northwest League, Henry Lucas, was adamant in keeping the Portland franchise in his league. A team in the Pacific Northwest League was formed called the Portland Green Gages, which folded early in its first season. When the Portland PCL team first started playing, they were known as the Portland Browns. In their first season, classified as an independent league, the PCL featured six teams including the Browns. The Browns finished their first season fifth in the PCL. During the 1904 season, the Browns finished with a record of 79‚Äì136. The 136 losses still stands as a record in the PCL for most losses by a team in a single season. Other records for that season include the most errors in a season (669), and the lowest single-season team fielding percentage (.929). Before the 1905 season, professional baseball player Walt McCredie and former Republican U.S. House member from Washington Judge William Wallace McCredie purchased the Portland franchise. The team was then renamed the Portland Giants and Walter McCredie was named the player- manager of the team. During the 1905 season, the PCL was re-classified as a Class-A league in minor league baseball. In 1906, the team was renamed the Portland Beavers after a newspaper contest was started to decide the new name of the team. That season, the Portland team won its first pennant in the PCL. Beavers player Mike Mitchell led the PCL in home runs with six, the fewest ever to lead the PCL. Mitchell also led the league in batting average. The 1906 Beavers were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. The Beavers finished last in 1907, and second in 1908 and 1909. In 1910, Portland won another pennant behind the pitching of Vean Gregg and Gene Krapp. Gregg finished the season with a 32‚Äì18 record and 14 shutouts while Krapp had a 29‚Äì16 record for the season. Portland repeated as PCL champs in 1911 fielding four 20-game-winning pitchers. In 1912, Judge McCredie helped get a new 12,000-seat grandstand built at Vaughn Street Park. His obituary later read that the ballpark was \\"the sensation of baseball, because it inaugurated a minor league precedent of providing individual grandstand seats, which fellow magnates called an extravagance and a dangerous innovation.\\" The NAPBL made a change to league classifications in 1912, making Double-A the top tier. The PCL, and the Portland Beavers, moved into this new classification from the previous top tier Class A league. Walt McCredie. During the 1910s, the Beavers developed some working relationships with other teams. From 1911 to 1914 the Portland Beavers had their own farm team which played in the Northwest League (renamed the Pacific Coast International League in 1918). The Class B team shared the use of Vaughn Street Park and was known as the Portland Pippins in 1911, but changed their name to the Portland Colts in 1912. During the 1914 season, the Colts moved to the Seattle area and finished their last season as the Ballard Pippins before folding. Portland also had an informal relationship with the Cleveland Indians through much of the 1910s that saw many future major league stars come through Portland to fine-tune their skills. Portland played well in 1913 and 1914, winning the pennant both seasons. Though the 1915 Beavers featured future Hall of Famer Stan Coveleski, the team didn't fare too well, and started into a tailspin that would last for over a decade. The year also marked the end of their relationship with the Cleveland Indians. With America's entry into World War I, restrictions were placed on travel, such that the Beavers withdrew from the PCL for the 1918 season, playing instead in the Class B Pacific Coast International League. The team was known as the Portland Buckaroos and finished their shortened season (play was stopped on July 7 due to the war) in second place 1¬Ω games back of Seattle. Ironically, the PCL ceased play just a week later as they too were unable to continue play due to restrictions on travel. Due to the Beavers' withdrawal from the PCL, the league offered Sacramento a franchise to replace the Portland team, while the McCredies continued to own the baseball club in Portland. The new team in Sacramento was known as the Sacramento Senators, and could be considered a continuation of the original Portland Baseball Club. =Return to the Pacific Coast League: 1919‚Äì1972= With the McCredies still at the helm, Portland was offered an expansion franchise and re-entered the PCL in 1919. The team finished in seventh place, only ahead of last-place Seattle who was also an expansion team that year. Portland finished in last place in 1920 and again in 1921. After the 1921 season, the McCredies sold the team to Walter Klepper who had been president of the Seattle team. Klepper brought in the 35-year old Jim Thorpe, who played outfield and first base with the Beavers in 1922,\\"Jim Thorpe is Purchased by Beavers,\\" Oregon Daily Journal [Portland], vol. 20, no. 291 (Feb. 10, 1922), p. 14. paying him a then-unheard of minor league salary of US$1,000 per month. It wasn't long before Klepper was in the middle of a dispute with Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Klepper had brought Seattle player-manager Bill Kenworthy down to manage the Beavers, only Seattle claimed Kenworthy was still under contract and that Klepper had tampered in the matter. Landis suspended Klepper until January 1, 1925, and declared Kenworthy ineligible to play or manage Portland until 1924.Weiss, Bill and Marshall Wright. \\"Historians Weiss, Wright Rank 100 Best Minor League Baseball Teams.\\" Minor League Baseball. 2001. Retrieved September 27, 2008. According to The Portland Beavers, a book by Kip Carlson and Paul Andresen, \\"The feisty Klepper went to court and had the decision overturned, supposedly the only time that Landis ever had a ruling reversed.\\" Kenworthy did manage the Beavers in 1924, replacing popular player-manager Jim Middleton. He was fired mid-season, though, as he was not able to generate support from the players. The 1924 season was also noteworthy in that future Hall of Famer Mickey Cochrane played on the team. After 1924, the Beavers officially became a farm team for a major league team for the first time when Philadelphia Athletics owners John and Tom Shibe purchased the Beavers as well as Vaughn Street Park. Despite having Duffy Lewis on the team in 1925 (winning the PCL batting title), Elmer Smith in 1926 and 1927 (leading the PCL in home runs in 1926 and all of minor league baseball in home runs in 1927), and Ike Boone in 1928, the Beavers continued to finish in the bottom half of the league. Longtime head groundskeeper Rocky Benevento started working for the Beavers in 1927. Benevento was so popular with the fans that they took up a collection for him in 1956 to send him to the World Series. Benevento retired at the end of the 1966 season and was given a new car. When Benevento died in 1969, The Oregonian stated, \\"He adored kids...he loved baseball...and most of all he loved people.\\" His funeral had an overflowing crowd that included Oregon Governor Tom McCall. Benevento stayed with the team 40 years, spanning 30 managerial changes and five ownership changes. While the former location of Vaughn Street Park is now a parking lot, there is a plaque honoring Benevento for his efforts in furthering baseball in Portland. In 1929, the Beavers changed their name to the Portland Ducks, bearing a duck on their uniform, and were also occasionally known that year as the Portland Rosebuds. The name change didn't change the team's luck as they finished with a 90‚Äì112 record. Long‚Äìtime radio broadcaster Rollie Truitt also joined the Beavers staff in 1929, and worked for the team for 35 years, spanning 28 managerial changes and five ownership changes. Truitt would later be known as the \\"Dean of Pacific Coast League broadcasters.\\" In 1930, the team reverted to the Beavers name, but would occasionally be referred to as the Ducks for over a decade. The highlight of the Beavers last place 1930 season was William Rhiel's unassisted triple play, the last recorded in PCL history. In 1931, team President Tom Turner bought the franchise from the Shibe brothers and the team took a turn for the positive. Ed Coleman led the PCL in hits and runs batted in, and the team finished in third, winning 100 games. The team continued to improve in 1932, winning Portland its first pennant since 1914. The team finished second in 1933. Turner brought Walter McCredie back to manager the team in 1934, but he died early in the season and the team fell to the bottom half of the league. The Portland Beavers and Hollywood Stars managers before a game performing a comedy routine (Gilmore Field in the 1940s) Following the 1934 season, E.J. Shefter bought the team from Turner. The team improved in 1935, finishing one game over .500, and then won the pennant in 1936, finishing 1¬Ω games over runner-up Oakland, then winning the postseason series to capture the crown. In 1937, the Beavers finished in fourth place, but made it to the playoffs defeating San Francisco in the first round before losing to the San Diego team featuring a young Ted Williams. The team finished sixth in 1938 before finishing in last place in 1939‚Äì1942. The 1940 team was so bad, finishing 56‚Äì122, that they were still 25 games behind the seventh-place team (the league had eight teams at that time). In 1943, William Klepper, with partner George Norgan buying a minority share, purchased the Beavers. The team came back that season with their first winning record since 1937. The management of the team began referring to the team as the \\"Lucky Beavers\\" and Vaughn Street Park was known as \\"Lucky Beaver Stadium.\\" With the United States firmly involved in World War II, local radio station KXL sold over $300,000 in war bonds in 1943 to fund the building of a bomber for the war that would be dubbed \\"The Lucky Beaver.\\" Due to U.S. involvement in the war, the available pool of baseball players in the nation was ravaged. Somehow, the Beavers still moved up in the league, finishing second in 1944. In 1945 the Beavers brought another pennant to Portland being skippered by player-manager Marv Owen. Despite winning the pennant, the team lost to San Francisco in the first round of the playoffs. To commemorate Portland's 1945 pennant win, Portland held a banquet at the Multnomah Hotel (now the downtown Portland Embassy Suites). Oregon Governor Earl Snell presented a commemorative watch and gold and diamond ring to each player at the banquet. The watches were given to the players due to L. H. Gregory of The Oregonian requesting fans to donate money to a fund for the purpose. Gregory did this because he felt it was not right that no memento was given to the players from the 1936 championship team. Following the 1945 season, Norgan purchased Klepper's share of the team becoming the team's new owner. In 1946, the Beavers fell to the bottom half of the league, finishing in seventh place, 41 games out of first. In 1947 Eddie Basinski joined the Beavers, and they finished third, losing to the Los Angeles Angels in the first round of the playoffs. The team drew, up to then, a team record of 421,000 fans that season. This record would stand for the Beavers until the 2001 season when Triple-A Baseball returned to Portland. In 1948, the team finish fifth, followed by a sixth-place finish in 1949. The 1949 season began the integration of the Pacific Coast League as Frankie Austin and Luis Marquez became Beavers. Beginning with the 1950 season, the Beavers finished fourth for four straight years. Clay Hopper, who had been Jackie Robinson's manager when he played for the Montreal Royals in 1946, was named the team's manager in 1952. This year also marked the first year the Pacific Coast League was classified by the NAPBL as an \\"open league.\\" The open league was a step above Triple-A, and was an attempt by the Pacific Coast League to be considered the third major league. Plans for a new ballpark were announced by the team in 1953. Originally the team planned to build a new stadium at 82nd and Holgate in Southeast Portland. Due to the Korean War, among other issues, the stadium never came to fruition. In 1954 the team dropped again to the bottom of the league. After the 1954 season the team went up for sale to the community via public stock, which resulted in 2,400 new owners for the 1955 season. With the change the Beavers rose to fifth place, only nine games back of first. In 1956, the Beavers left the now-demolished Vaughn Street Park to move into 25,000-seat Multnomah Stadium, today's Providence Park. Throughout most of the 1960s, the Beavers were the Triple-A affiliate of the American League Cleveland Indians, nurturing such future stars as \\"Sudden\\" Sam McDowell, Lou \\"Mad Dog\\" Piniella, and Luis \\"El Gigante\\" Tiant. Later major league affiliations included the Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Phillies. In 1961, the Beavers signed the 56-year-old Satchel Paige. He pitched 25 innings for the Beavers, striking out 19 and giving up 18 earned runs without recording a decision. Following the 1972 season, principal owner Bill Cutler moved the team northeast to Spokane, who had lost their PCL team to Albuquerque after the 1971 season. For the next five seasons, Portland was in the short-season Class A Northwest League (NWL) with the independent and non-conforming Portland Mavericks, owned by actor Bing Russell. =Triple-A returns to Portland: 1978‚Äì1993= The PCL expanded in 1978 and added a new team in Portland, calling themselves the Beavers, displacing the single-A Mavericks. The new Beavers played in Civic Stadium for sixteen seasons through 1993. In 1983, the Beavers won the PCL pennant, the first for Portland in 47 years. Though tied for third overall during the regular season, the Beavers won the second half division title by four games, defeated first- half winner Edmonton Trappers in four games (3‚Äì1) to take the Northern Division title, then swept the three-time defending champion Albuquerque Dukes in three games in the finals to capture the league championship. As PCL champs in 1983, the Beavers participated in the first Triple-A World Series, a three- team round-robin competition in Louisville with the champions of the International League and the American Association. Each team played the others twice and it was won by the Tidewater Tides of the IL with three wins. Portland was second, splitting with both teams, and the Denver Bears were 1‚Äì3. Vince Sinisi on deck in 2008. A decade later, Beavers owner Joe Buzas moved the team after the 1993 season east to Salt Lake City, where they became the Salt Lake Buzz in 1994 in a brand new ballpark. The team was renamed the Stingers in 2001, and have been the Bees since the 2006 season. For the first time since 1894, Portland was without professional baseball. After being without a team in 1994, the Class A Rockies of the Northwest League relocated from Bend for the 1995 season. The Portland Rockies played in the Rose City for the next six seasons and served an important role for the city, whose demand for a major league team was growing. They were league champions in 1997. Portland's support for the Rockies paved the way for the return of the Triple-A PCL in 2001. =The Beavers return: 2001‚Äì2010= Following the 2000 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres swapped Triple-A affiliates. The Albuquerque Dukes (a charter franchise of the PCL in 1903 as the Los Angeles Angels from 1903 to 1958, and later the Spokane Indians from 1958 to 1971) moved to Portland and became the Beavers, as the Padres' top affiliate. As part of the relocation agreement, Civic Stadium was renovated in 2000 and renamed PGE Park. The Las Vegas Stars (the 1919‚Äì72 Beavers) became the Dodgers' top affiliate; they were renamed the 51s for 2001. The single-A Portland Rockies moved up the Columbia River to Pasco and became the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2001. In 2007, owner Merritt Paulson announced that he was considering changing the name of the team to prevent confusion with the Oregon State University teams from Corvallis.\\"Merritt Paulson, new owner of the Beavers and Timbers, stages a 'Grand Reopening' tonight at PGE Park.\\" The Oregonian.

The Portland City Council approved a $31 million agreement to renovate PGE Park to a soccer- and football-only stadium, with the condition that a new ballpark be built in Portland for the Beavers by 2011. Memorial Coliseum in the Rose Quarter was an original site for the proposed ballpark; however, it met public opposition. Initial plans called for the new ballpark to be built at the site currently occupied by the Memorial Coliseum, which would have been torn down, but public outcry about demolishing a Portland landmark led Portland mayor Sam Adams to propose a second site in the Rose Quarter area north of Memorial Coliseum. The site, however, proved to be too small. Another location on the site of Charles D. Walker Stadium in the Lents neighborhood in southeast Portland was also rejected due to objections from neighbors. That was until the Portland Pickles collegiate wood bat team began play in 2016 at Walker Stadium. In June 2009, the Portland City Council voted to separate the soccer and baseball projects, allowing renovation of PGE Park to proceed without completed plans for a baseball stadium in place. Other locations in the Portland area were considered for the ballpark, including a vacant terminal at the Port of Portland, Delta Park, the Portland Expo Center, Portland Meadows, the Westwood Corporation Heliport site, a building owned by Portland Public Schools near the Rose Quarter, and suburban locations in Beaverton, Clackamas, and Vancouver, Washington. None of these sites progressed past initial discussions. With no suitable Portland location available, in July 2010, Paulson announced that he was putting the team up for sale and relocation. Padres owner Jeff Moorad formed a group to buy the team and talked of moving its home games to the Lake Elsinore Diamond in Lake Elsinore, California until a new stadium in Escondido could be built. Eventually, the group decided to move the team temporarily to Tucson in 2011, rename them the Tucson Padres, with plans to move again to Escondido when a new ballpark was built. The plans in Escondido failed, and the team was sold again; they moved to west Texas prior to the 2014 season and became the El Paso Chihuahuas. The Portland area was without minor league baseball in 2011 and 2012. After the 2012 season, the NWL Yakima Bears relocated to a new 4,500-seat stadium in the northwest suburb of Hillsboro and became the Hillsboro Hops. The Hops won the NWL title in 2014 and again in 2015, averaging more than 3,700 in attendance for 38 regular season home games.

The band consists of Vincent Kircher, Austin Dutmer, and Andrew Harris. Their music is described as psych-pop, with up-beat guitar and punk music matched with dark lyrics. Their 2010 album, That's How We Burn, earned them the most attention, receiving multiple reviews. History Vincent Kircher and Austin Dutmer began performing together while in college in Milwaukee, attending Marquette University and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee respectively. They met through mutual friend Michael Corcoran and soon the three had started playing regionally as The Detectives. Opting to focus more on recording and writing than on playing live shows, Vincent and Austin took to the basement studio in Austin's Milwaukee rental unit, recorded the initial 7\\" EP Semaine De Quatre Jeudis and reformed as Jail. Months later in an effort to begin performing again live, the two added guitar players, bass and keyboards via a rotating cast of other local musicians including Neil Weingarth, Hugh Masterson, later of The Wildbirds, Clifford Smith and Noah Johnson. =Early Recordings and Personnel= In 2003 Kircher and Dutmer, along with guitarist Hugh Masterson and bassist Neil Weingarth recorded the Decor EP in a spare bedroom of Kircher's house. The instruments were tracked separately, most often without anyone else in the band present at the time of recording. It was released as a show-only CD-R, the band later joking that they pressed \\"really only a couple dozen, given away for free.\\" But the recording would mark the first time Kircher began experimenting with the limits of the multitrack process. In 2004 they recorded Kept Me Spitting in much the same fashion, with Dutmer and Weingarth laying down the initial song structure, and Kircher filling out most of the rest of the instrumentation himself. It was pressed later that year on Dutmer's Decorated Records imprint, and the band began to make small east coast tours in support. 5 Song was recorded with the intention of making a demo more representational of the group's sound at the time, and was put out by the band as a CD with limited packaging for ease of mailing. It featured newly added members Noah Johnson on guitar, Joseph Deluxe on bass, and Clifford Smith on keyboards. That release also included an early version of Everyone's Hip, a song later rerecorded and used as an advance single on their 2010 Sup Pop release That's How We Burn. 5 Song was recorded in two afternoons, with most of the instruments live-tracked, and all musicians standing in the same small bedroom, using bath towels wrapped around their heads to hold the headphones in place and silence the rest of the unwanted mix. Prolific and restless, Kircher in 2003 started recording a series of songs covering all of the instrumentation himself, eventually to be released as 2 handmade EPs, a project dubbed, Whimsy and the Slugs. Whimsy and the Slugs (2003) and Cranes (2004) featured some songs eventually featured on Jail albums, and showcased Kircher's range as a songwriter and lo-fi producer. At about the same time Dutmer began splitting his time in Jail with the newly formed Milwaukee folk-garage outfit Goodnight Loving for which he played drums. It was in Goodnight Loving that he met eventual Jaill bassist Andrew Harris, who joined in 2006 following the release of the 5 Song EP. =There's No Sky (Oh My My)= It was the lineup of Kircher, Dutmer, Harris, Johnson who, with the intention of at long last producing an LP, recorded There's No Sky (Oh My My) in 2008. This time the group took to their practice space in the basement of Milwaukee artist space, The Borg Ward. A former funeral home in Milwaukee's lower west side, the space still retained a body cooler in the basement where the band practiced. The four recorded the basic tracks to There's No Sky live, over a weeks time. Kircher then spent the following 6 months adding and overdubbing guitars, keys, vocals and effects, creating a lo-fi but lush sound. It was pressed on 12\\" vinyl with blank jackets, the cover art a black and white xerox rubber cemented on. It was the album that eventually caught the ear of Sup Pop Records' A&R; after it received numerous small mentions and favorable reaction on music blogs. It has subsequently been rereleased on vinyl and cassette by Fullerton, CA based label, Burger Records. =Signing To Sub Pop Records= In 2009, the band signed to Sub Pop Records, propelling them out of the local music scene and onto the national stage. With the departure of Johnson, the band added Ryan Adams, who had contributed a slide guitar track to There's No Sky (Oh My My), to fulfill touring obligations as a four piece. Adams continued on in the band through the recording of That's How We Burn, eventually departing following the album's release owing to creative differences within the band. One caveat of working with Sub Pop was that the band change their name owing to the existence of a European band of the same name nearly 40 years prior. They opted to add an additional \\"L\\" to their name, and their decision to do so was taken as a snide response to having to change their name over something so irrelevant. That's How We Burn was recorded over a month with Justin Perkins at his Mystery Room Recording Studio in Milwaukee. Perkins had previously worked with the band, contributing the final mix and master to There's No Sky (Oh My My). That's How We Burn was their most successful album, and the band toured North America and Europe in support.

Life Scourfield was born John Henry Phillips, the son of Owen Phillips of Williamstown, Pembrokeshire, Wales and his wife Ann Elizabeth Scourfield, niece of William Henry Scourfield of the Mote and Robeston Hall. He was educated at Harrow School and at Oriel College, Oxford graduating BA 3rd class in classics in 1828 and MA in 1832. He was a Deputy Lieutenant and J.P. for Pembroke and chairman of the Quarter Sessions of Pembroke. He was also High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire in 1833 and Lord-Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the borough of Haverfordwest. In 1862 he assumed the name of Scourfield by Royal Licence on succeeding to the estates of his maternal uncle.Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1870 Political career At the 1852 general election Scourfield was elected Member of Parliament for Haverfordwest and held the seat until 1868. In 1857 he narrowly held on to the seat by two votes over the Liberal candidate William Rees, in a contest characterised by accusations of intimidation. At the 1868 general election he was elected MP for Pembrokeshire and held the seat until his death aged 68 in 1876. He was created a baronet by Disraeli on 18 February 1876 but died the following May. He was against the Women's Disabilities Removal Bill, an early women's suffrage bill. He argued, in May 1872, that the novelist Jane Austen would be, too, were she alive. Scourfield argued this by using a quotation from Austen's novel Emma (1816), which was itself a quotation from Oliver Goldsmith, taken out of context. This appears to be the first time that Austen's name was referenced in official business in parliament. Cricket As John Philipps, he was a cricketer with amateur status who was associated with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and made his first-class debut in 1830. Works He was the author of a number of published plays and poems. Family Scourfield married in 1845 Augusta Phillips, daughter of John Lort Phillips of Haverfordwest and Llawrenny Park, Pembrokeshire. They had two sons, the eldest of which, Owen, succeeded to the baronetcy (which became extinct on his death).

Based on the Battlefield series, the game featured a modern warfare battlefield setting. Play4Free is built on a modified version of Battlefield 2s game engine, with improvements such as high resolution artwork and post-processing effects. The game was also less demanding on computer specifications, similar to Battlefield Heroes. The game was available to players for free online, under Electronic Arts' free-to-play model called Play4Free. Play4Free uses a similar micropayment store system similar to that in Battlefield Heroes. Battlefield Play4Free was announced on 5 November 2010. The game's open beta testing phase began on 4 April. Closed beta codes originally started being distributed via email on 30 November 2010. The game was released as an open beta on 4 April 2011. Battlefield Play4Free, along with other EA free-to-play titles Battlefield Heroes, Need for Speed: World, and FIFA World, went offline on 14 July 2015. Gameplay Battlefield Play4Free screenshot showing an American engineer with a PP-2000 submachine gun. Battlefield Play4Free featured content from both Battlefield 2 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Battlefield included two gameplay modes, Assault and Rush. The game had a leveling system, in-game shop, and gameplay customization similar to that of Battlefield Heroes. Battlefield Play4Free featured eight maps from Battlefield 2 and supported up to 32-player servers for online battles. Players were randomly chosen to play as soldiers from either the Russian Ground Forces or the United States Marine Corps. =Classes= Battlefield Play4Free featured a class system, which was similar to the class systems of previous Battlefield games. The player could choose between Assault, Medic, Engineer, and Recon. The Assault class was armed with an assault rifle and an \\"Ammo Box,\\" which could be used to resupply the player and teammates with more ammunition. Medics had a light machine gun and were able to heal themselves and other players with a \\"Medic Box\\" as well as being able to revive other players with a defibrillator. Engineer class soldiers were equipped with an RPG-7, a submachine gun, and a repair tool that could be used to fix teammates' vehicles. Lastly, the Recon class utilized a sniper rifle, motion sensor, and M18 Claymore mines. The four classes also had the ability to wield a shotgun and a tracer dart gun, which was not class- specific. This class system has been used in Battlefield: Bad Company 2. =Updates= Easy Studios, the developer of Battlefield Play4Free, performs updates to the game commonly. The first major update took place on 29 January 2011, when Easy Studios launched Oman. Then, the developers released Sharqi Peninsula on 4 April 2011, the same day that the game went to open beta. On 9 June 2011, Basra, the fourth map, was released. Later, Dragon Valley was released on 10 August 2011. Besides new maps, Easy Studios has added various game elements such as motion blur due to the new, modified Refractor game engine. On 25 October 2011, \\"Tier 3\\" training was released to include an array of new skill options for all four classes. On 1 December 2011, weapon customization was added to Battlefield Play4Free, thus allowing players to specifically customize their weapons with attachments such as holographic sights, different barrels, assorted stocks, and different types of magazines. Nineteen days later, on 20 December 2011, Easy Studios released the sixth map, Dalian, which was remade from Battlefield 2. Also, in the same update, Easy Studios replaced all \\"Legacy\\" weapons with reclassified weapons, which are denoted as \\"+3.\\" On 23 October 2012, Easy Studios Released \\"Rush\\" game mode. This mode places players in one of two roles: either an attack or defense. The game plays out across multiple stages where destroyable MCOM stations are the focal point. There are two MCOMs at each stage, labeled A and B, both of which must be destroyed in order for the attackers to continue forward. The game ends when either all of the MCOMs are destroyed or the attackers are eliminated by means of depletion of their tickets. This game mode was first used in Battlefield: Bad Company. The expanded Sharqi Peninsula map was the first map to get the rush treatment. Karkand rush and Dalian rush are also now online. In October 2013, the devs at Easy Studios began an effort to balance the vast number of weapons currently in the game, several of which were felt to be unbalanced or \\"overpowered\\" when compared to other weapons within each respective class as well as on the whole. As of November 2013, the re- balancing has been mostly completed and implemented; however, was still met with continued discord. Reception The game received a score of 68% from 11 reviews on Metacritic and 67.75% from 8 reviews on GameRankings. Closure On 15 April 2015, Easy Studios announced that on 14 July 2015 they would be closing Battlefield Play4Free and turning off services for the game. Battlefield Heroes, Need for Speed: World, and FIFA World were due to be closed on the same day.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974. The building is a two-story brick structure that sits on the northwest corner of West Third and Fillmore Streets. It is part of a small commercial district near the historic German neighborhoods and the industrial areas along the Mississippi River. It is a typical commercial building in the West End which combined commercial space on the first floor and apartments on the second floor. Frick's before the 2016 renovation History The building was built in 1872. Over the years it has housed a bakery, tavern, barbershop and living quarters. A tavern opened in the building in 1876 and there has been one there ever since. with It is the oldest bar in Davenport, and the second oldest in the State of Iowa. Charles Frick opened a tavern in the building in 1888 and his descendants kept it in operation for three generations. The family lived in the apartments above, and Floy Frick maintained a garden in the back. The bar was a center of social activity for Davenport's west end German community. After Ross Frick died in 1986, the family sold the business to Chuck Fogle. When Chuck died in 1992 his wife Betty continued ownership until she sold the business in 2015. A self- proclaimed teetotaler, Betty Fogle leased the business to five different people. She sold it to Nathan Sharp and NKP LLC, who completed an extensive renovation of the building. Architecture The building is designed in the Italianate style. It features bracketed eaves and flat-arched windows on the second floor. The building is topped with a hipped roof. The main floor of the building had two commercial spaces for most of its history. They were combined in the 2016 renovation and a full-size commercial kitchen was added. There was a door in between the commercial spaces on Third Street with access to the two apartments on the second floor. The apartments were also eliminated in 2016, and converted into an upstairs barroom. At the time the building became a tavern the rear section of the building, covered with a shingled surface, was added. There is also a brick addition in the back that was added at an unknown date. In 1923 the corner door entrance was added to the tavern. Shutters and chimneys were also removed over the years.

Wells was the son of Captain William Wells, R.N. and his wife Lady Elizabeth Proby, daughter of John Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort, and grandson of Vice-Admiral Thomas Wells, of Holme, whose father, William, had inherited the estate from his wife's uncle, Thomas Truman, in 1768. He was educated at Harrow School and at Balliol College, Oxford, and served in the 1st Life Guards from 1839 until 1843. In 1826 he inherited Holmewood Hall in Huntingdonshire from his father. He also inherited the Redleaf estate in Kent from his great-uncle William. He was a J.P. and a Deputy Lieutenant for Kent and Huntingdonshire. At the 1852 general election Wells was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for the borough of Beverley. He held the seat until his defeat in the 1857 by the Liberal Edward Glover. An election petition was lodged by Wells on the grounds that Glover was not duly qualified, because he did not meet the property-holding requirements. The issue had been raised during the election, and handbills circulated to that effect, but Glover had denied the allegations. On 3 August 1853, the committee ruled that Glover had not been duly qualified, and that his election was void. A by-election was held on 11 August 1853, when Wells stood again, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate Henry Edwards. Wells contested the City of Peterborough at the 1852 general election, where he was the third-placed of the three Liberal candidates.Craig, pages 237‚Äì238 He won the seat at the 1868 general election, defeating the Liberal MP Thomson Hankey, a former Governor of the Bank of England. Wells remained an MP for Peterborough and held the seat until the 1874 general election, when he did not stand again. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1875. He was also a keen agriculturalist and President of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1880. Wells died at the age of 71.

The highway runs from Potomac Street in Hagerstown east to US 40 in Frederick. US 40 Alternate parallels US 40 and much of Interstate 70 (I-70) to the south through eastern Washington County and western Frederick County. The alternate route connects Hagerstown and Frederick with Funkstown, Boonsboro, Middletown, and Braddock Heights. US 40 Alternate crosses two major north-south components of the Blue Ridge Mountains that separate the Great Appalachian Valley and the Piedmont: South Mountain between Boonsboro and Middletown and Catoctin Mountain, which is locally known as Braddock Mountain, at Braddock Heights. US 40 Alternate is the old alignment of US 40\\\\. The highway's path was blazed in the mid-18th century to connect the Hagerstown Valley and Shenandoah Valley with eastern Pennsylvania and central Maryland. In the early 19th century, US 40 Alternate's path was improved as part of a series of turnpikes to connect Baltimore with the eastern terminus of the National Road in Cumberland. The highway was improved as one of the original state roads in the early 1910s and designated US 40 in the late 1920s. Construction on a relocated US 40 between Hagerstown and Frederick with improved crossings of South Mountain and Braddock Mountain began in the mid-1930s; the new highway was completed in the late 1940s. US 40 Alternate was assigned to the old route of US 40 in the early 1950s. Route description US 40 Alternate is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from Edgewood Drive in Funkstown to its underpass of I-70 south of Funkstown and from Old Hagerstown Road near Middletown to US 40 in Frederick. =Hagerstown to South Mountain= US 40 Alternate begins as Baltimore Street at its intersection with one-way southbound Potomac Street within the Hagerstown Historic District on the southern edge of downtown Hagerstown. Baltimore Street, which continues west as a city street toward the Hagerstown City Park, runs east-west two blocks south of US 40, which comprises a one-way pair of Washington Street eastbound and Franklin Street westbound. After heading east for two blocks, during which US 40 Alternate intersects one-way northbound Locust Street, the municipally-maintained alternate route turns southeast onto Frederick Street at a five-way junction that also includes north-south Mulberry Street. US 40 Alternate intersects Memorial Boulevard, which heads east past Municipal Stadium, home of the minor league baseball Hagerstown Suns. The highway meets a CSX rail spur at grade while passing through an industrial area that extends to the southern city limits of Hagerstown at Kenly Avenue. View west at the east end of US 40 Alt. at US 40 in Frederick US 40 Alternate continues southeast as a state- maintained highway that passes the historic home Garden Hill and crosses Antietam Creek into Funkstown, where the highway's name changes to Westside Avenue. Within the Funkstown Historic District, the alternate route turns east onto Baltimore Street, then southeast onto Frederick Street. At the southern town limits of Funkstown, US 40 Alternate becomes Boonsboro Pike, which passes through farmland as it parallels Antietam Creek. The highway passes under I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) with no access and intersects Poffenberger Road, which leads west to the historic home Valentia. The highway veers away from Antietam Creek just past the historic Cool Hollow House. It then passes through the hamlet of Benevola and traverses Landis Spring Branch and Beaver Creek on its way to Boonsboro. US 40 Alternate enters the town of Boonsboro and its name changes to Main Street at its intersection with Maryland Route 68 (MD 68) (Lappans Road). The highway meets the south end of MD 66 (Maple Avenue) next to the Bowman House and the east end of MD 34 (Potomac Street) in the center of town. US 40 Alternate leaves the town of Boonsboro after its intersection with MD 67 (Rohrersville Road). The alternate route continues southeast as Boonsboro Pike and starts to ascend South Mountain. At the summit, known as Turner's Gap, US 40 Alternate intersects Washington Monument Road, which leads north to Washington Monument State Park, and passes the Dahlgren Chapel and the Old South Mountain Inn. =South Mountain to Frederick= US 40 Alternate westbound approaching MD 17 in Middletown, with South Mountain in the background US 40 Alternate's name changes to Old National Pike as it intersects the Appalachian Trail at the Washington- Frederick county line and begins its curvaceous descent of South Mountain into the Middletown Valley. In the western part of the valley, the highway passes the Henry Shoemaker Farmhouse and intersects Mount Tabor Road, which parallels South Mountain north past the historic Daniel Sheffer Farm and Routzahn-Miller Farmstead. In Spoolsville, US 40 Alternate crosses Catoctin Creek and meets Old Hagerstown Road, which passes the Bowlus Mill House. The alternate route's name becomes Main Street as it heads east through Middletown. US 40 Alternate passes the Stonebraker and Harbaugh-Shafer Building and intersects MD 17 (Church Street) within the Middletown Historic District. The highway passes through the Airview Historic District before leaving the town limits. East of Middletown, US 40 Alternate passes through a suburban area then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a climbing lane eastbound to the top of the mountain, which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US 40 Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane eastbound, two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At the base of the mountain, the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps to and from the direction of Frederick. East of I-70, US 40 Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US 40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US 15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from eastbound US 40 Alternate to westbound US 40 or from eastbound US 40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road. History =Early paths and turnpikes= The portion of US 40 Alternate between Frederick and Boonsboro roughly follows the Monocacy Road, a pack-horse trail blazed by settlers from Pennsylvania around 1730. The trail connected Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Hanover with Winchester, Virginia by way of what is now Taneytown, Frederick, Boonsboro, and Williamsport.MDSRC, pp. 10-11. The portion of the Monocacy Road from Frederick to Williamsport was used by the Braddock Expedition on its way from Alexandria to Cumberland to commence its ill-fated assault on Fort Duquesne.MDSRC, p. 14. Following the founding of Hagerstown in 1762, a road was laid out north from Boonsboro to connect the new town with the eastern part of the colony.MDSRC, p. 12. While the Monocacy Road as a whole was disused by 1794, the portion followed by US 40 Alternate remained an important connection between Baltimore and Western Maryland. The Baltimore and Fredericktown Turnpike Company was chartered in 1805 to build a road along the path from Baltimore to Boonsboro. This turnpike was the first step in connecting Baltimore with Cumberland, the eastern terminus of the just- commenced National Road. By 1808, the turnpike had been completed west from Baltimore and another was under construction.MDSRC, p. 29. The Baltimore and Fredericktown Turnpike was completed in 1812. That same year, keen for an improved road to fully extend between Baltimore and Cumberland, the Maryland General Assembly conscripted the state's banks to fund turnpike companies to complete the gap between Boonsboro and Cumberland with the benefit of having their charters extended from 1816 to 1835. The banks opposed this measure but reluctantly bankrolled the construction of a road from Conocheague Creek to Cumberland between 1816 and 1818 and from Hagerstown to Conococheague Creek in 1818 and 1819.MDSRC, pp. 31-32. The Maryland General Assembly used their powers again in 1821, agreeing to extend the banks' charters to 1845 if they would fund a turnpike in the gap between Boonsboro and Hagerstown.MDSRC, p. 32. When the National Turnpike was completed in 1823, it became the first macadam road constructed in the United States.MDSRC, p. 33. The Baltimore and Fredericktown and National turnpikes remained in operation through 1909. =State road construction and bypass= In 1909, the nascent Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSRC) designated the road between Frederick and Hagerstown for improvement as one of the original state roads. The commission's first task was to acquire the necessary right-of-way by purchasing the two turnpikes in 1911. MDSRC reconstructed the road between Frederick and Hagerstown with a wide macadam surface from Frederick to Middletown and from South Mountain to Boonsboro in 1913. The state road was built from Middletown to South Mountain and from Boonsboro to Hagerstown in 1914. The portion of the highway within Boonsboro was paved in 1915. The last portion of the Frederick-Hagerstown state road to be constructed was within Funkstown, where the highway was surfaced with concrete by 1919. The highway was designated part of US 40 in 1927. Around 1926, US 40 received its first improvement when concrete shoulders were added to expand the roadway from to in width. By 1934, MDSRC recommended widening the highway to from west of Frederick to east of Hagerstown. Ultimately, the commission decided to construct a new highway between the two cities that would shorten the distance by and bypass the sharp curves and limited sight distances of the old road. Grading and drainage work on the new highway began in 1936 and was completed in 1938 for the first roadway of what would ultimately become a divided highway. The first wide concrete roadway was constructed from downtown Hagerstown southeast to near Beaver Creek Road in 1938. Surfacing of the remainder of the relocated National Pike was delayed by World War II; construction resumed in 1946 and the new highway opened in 1948. The relocated National Pike was originally designated US 40 Alternate; the old and new roads switched to their present designations in 1952. Despite the construction of a new highway, improvements continued on the original road. Trolley tracks of the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway were removed from the highway in Funkstown and the street was resurfaced in 1940. Hill climbing lanes were added for a length of on both sides of Braddock Mountain and South Mountain around 1942. The highway between Funkstown and Boonsboro had curves modified and was widened and resurfaced in 1949. US 40 Alternate from US 40 in Frederick west to Braddock Mountain underwent the same type of work in 1951 and 1952.

Formed in 2005, the band consists of Chris \\"Motionless\\" Cerulli (lead vocals), Ryan Sitkowski (lead guitar), Ricky \\"Horror\\" Olson (rhythm guitar), Vinny Mauro (drums), and Justin Morrow (bass). The band has stated that their band name derived from the Eighteen Visions song \\"Motionless and White\\". Motionless in White was signed to Fearless Records for their first three studio albums; their fourth album, Graveyard Shift, was released on May 5, 2017, via Roadrunner Records. Their most recent fifth album, Disguise, was released on June 7, 2019. History =Formation and early years (2005‚Äì2009)= Motionless in White was founded in 2005 by members Chris Motionless, who played guitar and lead vocals, Angelo Parente on drums, Frank Polumbo on guitar and Kyle White on bass during high school. They incepted many other titles into the group until finally settling on what would be Motionless in White. Chris Motionless and other members have noted bands such as Poison the Well, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, and other musical groups as their inspiration. In 2005 they released their self-distributed demo. Within the year after the release of their demo, new member Josh Balz was added as the band's keyboardist, Frank Polumbo took over on bass and new members, Michael Costanza and Thomas \\"TJ\\" Bell, were added to the band as the new guitarists, moving Chris Motionless solely to lead vocals. The band was discovered by Zach Neil while performing at a local nightclub called The Staircase. Neil signed the band first to management and then later to his record label Masquerade recordings. They recorded their first EP The Whorror which was produced by Zach Neil and mixed by Dan Malsch and released it through Masquerade Recordings/Warner music group in 2007. After touring in support of The Whorror, Motionless in White had written enough songs to complete a full-length album. The album was named When Love Met Destruction. When Love Met Destruction was recorded in 2008 initially at Soundmine recording studio then finished at Zach Neil's home by Dave Cutrone and Zach Neil, and was released the same year on Masquerade Recordings. Neil added the band to his stage on the Warped tour with the new record in hand and the band quickly caught the attention of Shawn Milke from Alesana who offered to manage the band. Shortly thereafter Bob Becker of Fearless Records contacted Zach Neil to make an offer to buy the band's recording contract and sign the band to Fearless. The band and Neil agreed and Tragic Hero was offered to incubate the first official release to help grow the band leading up to their Fearless debut. The band was never actually signed to Tragic Hero Records. The band parted ways with guitarist Michael Costanza and brought in current guitarist Ryan Sitkowski as his replacement. Despite being signed to Fearless before the months leading up to the release of the EP form of When Love Met Destruction, it was distributed through Tragic Hero on February 17, 2009. The song \\"Ghost in the Mirror\\" was made as the band's first ever single and had a music video produced for it. =Creatures and line-up change (2009‚Äì2011)= After the release of When Love Met Destruction, bassist Frank Polumbo departed Motionless in White due to unknown reasons, leaving Bellevue, Washington native, Ricky \\"Horror\\" Olson as their new permanent bass player in October 2009. Months later, Motionless in White entered the studio during May 2010 to record their debut full-length, Creatures with Andrew Wade as the chosen producer. The record's first single, \\"Abigail\\", was released premiered on Revolver Magazine in August 30 and was the released on iTunes the day after. A music video for the song was released a few months afterwards, along with following music videos over the next 2 years for title track \\"Creatures\\", the first track of the record \\"Immaculate Misconception\\" and a live music video for \\"Puppets (The First Snow)\\" which was filmed during the band's summer on The All Stars Tour in 2011. Creatures was released on October 12, 2010 through Fearless, and claimed the 175th slot on the Billboard Top 200 charts, and No. 6 on the Heatseekers chart.[ Charts], Allmusic On Wednesday May 4, 2011, guitarist Thomas Joseph \\"TJ\\" Bell was fired from the band. Reasons for the matter explained from Bell's perspective were that while he was handling bass substitution duties for Escape the Fate, he was expected to meet along with the rest of Motionless in White in Orlando, Florida by that tour's end. According to the band, Bell left in the middle of Motionless in White's tour schedule to fill-in as a bassist for Escape the Fate and also did not inform the rest of the members early enough in advance that he would not be available during those weeks. This action forced the band to be without their rhythm guitar parts during their performances. Motionless in White stated \\"If our live performance didn‚Äôt heavily depend on having 2 guitarists then it wouldn‚Äôt have been a huge deal to us... but unfortunately having one guitar player in a band like ours causes your show to suffer greatly. We agreed to let TJ go,\\" along with an explanation about how they experienced many disagreements with Bell throughout the years of being a band.

Quotas and Goals :Quotas should be avoided at all costs as they tend to be biased and discriminatory. \\"Best qualified\\" should be the sole criterion for assignments open to both genders. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=9, No=6, Abs=0 B. Voluntary vs. Involuntary Duty :A voluntary assignment policy would hinder combat readiness and effectiveness. A gender-neutral assignment policy for qualified persons should be used. The term \\"qualified\\" is determined solely by law and policy. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=10, No=2, Abs=3 C. Fitness/Wellness Standards :Current good health practices are not linked either to specific assignments or gender but rather to the highest levels of general fitness/wellness for the armed services. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=12, No=0, Abs=1, NV=2The Final Report did not :include a \\"not voting\\" (\\"NV\\") category, nor did it explain several voting total discrepancies for individual recommendations. D. Occupational Physical Requirements :The armed services should adopt specific requirements for those occupational specializations requiring muscular strength, endurance, or cardio-vascular capacity without regard to gender. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=9, No=4, Abs=2 E. Basic Training Standards :Entry-level physical training may be gender-specific as necessary for specific assignments. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=8, No=6, Abs=1 F. Pre- Commissioning Standards :Physical training in the military academies, officer candidate schools, and the Reserve Officer Training Corps already have appropriate gender-neutral and gender-specific programs in place. These programs do not appear to compromise either combat performance or combat readiness. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=10, No=4, Abs=1 G. Gender-Related Occupational Standards :Gender-neutral muscular strength, endurance, and cardiovascular capacity requirements may be adopted for those specialties for which they are relevant. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=14, No=0, Abs=0, NV=1 H. Parental and Family Police :The Defense Department should review all policies regarding single and dual-service parents. Policies on recruitment, retention, deployment, and child care for such personnel require either new policies or better implementation of existing policies. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=9, No=0, Abs=1, NV=5 I. Pregnancy and Deployability Policies :Consistency of application and force readiness should drive Defense Department policies regarding pregnancy. Current pregnancy rates among women aviators do not hamper unit performance or readiness. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=8, No=0, Abs=2, NV=5 J. Combat Roles for Women :While circumstances exist where female personnel may be assigned to combat situations, unit readiness for combat should be the main policy concern. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=8, No=1, Abs=1, NV=5 K. Ground Combat :Women may not be assigned to direct land combat units. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=10, No=0, Abs=2, NV=5 L. Combat Aircraft :Women may not be assigned to fly in combat-mission aircraft. \\"The one vote margin by which this issue was resolved illustrates the deeply divided views that exist to the assignment of women to combat aircraft\\"Final Report, p. 29. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=8, No=7, Abs=0 M. Combatant Vessels :Women may be assigned to all naval vessels except amphibious craft and submarines. The navy should modify vessels to accommodate women when needed as part of normally scheduled maintenance. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=8, No=6, Abs=1 N. Special Operations ::Retain the existing policies excluding female personnel from assignment to Special Forces. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=14, No=0, Abs=0, NV=1 O. \\"Risk Rule\\" :The \\"risk rule\\" is standard operating procedure whereby the exposure of women members of the armed services to situations involving injury, death, or capture is avoided. The \\"risk rule\\" should be retained except for women serving on naval vessels. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=9, No=4, Abs=2 P. Transition Process :The further integration of female personnel into existing military units should be done according to an individual's physical and professional qualifications for the assignment. This transition period should proceed in a timely fashion adhering to best operating procedures. Modifications of existing equipment and facilities for women personnel should be carried out during scheduled routine maintenance :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=11, No=3, Abs=1 Q. Conscription :Women should be excluded from any draft or conscription for required military service. :Commission vote‚ÄîYes=11, No=3, Abs=0, NV=1 Alternative views :Five members of the commission ‚Äî Cockerham, Donnelly, O'Beirne, Ray, and White - wrote a 38 page section in the Final Report entitled \\"The Case Against Women in Combat\\". They argued that the proponents of assigning women to combat did not prove the necessity of their case. The five members repeated and emphasized the evidence and personal testimony the Commission collected that cast doubt on combat roles for women. \\"Most importantly\\", they stated, \\"(combat roles for women) would overturn two centuries of settled law and military policy based on deeply held and commonly shared cultural assumptions defining how men should treat women\\".

Palmer House, also known as the Palmer Family Residence, is a historic building located on the Brady Street Hill in Davenport, Iowa, United States. It is on the campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984. The college offers tours of the first floor of the mansion. B.J. Palmer B.J. Palmer Bartlett Joshua Palmer (1882‚Äì1961) was the son of Daniel David Palmer who established the practice of chiropractic. B.J. Palmer convinced his father to establish a school of chiropractic in Davenport. In the first decade of the 20th-century, B.J. Palmer purchased the mansions built by J.C. Duncan, W.D. Petersen and Thomas Barron on the top of Brady Street for the school. He served the college as its president and is credited with the development of chiropractic. In 1922 he bought a small radio station in Rock Island, Illinois and moved it to a studio near the school's campus and it became WOC. It was the second commercial radio station in the United States and the first west of the Mississippi River.Anderson, 172. Palmer created a communications dynasty during the 1930s and 1940s after he acquired WHO is Des Moines in 1930. with Palmer Family Residence The Palmer Family Residence was built in the Second Empire style in 1874 by Louis C. Dessaint, who was a local lumber mill owner. F.H. Hancock bought the house in 1886 and William D. Petersen bought it in 1895. He was a part of the family that owned a department store downtown that became Von Maur. The Petersen family redecorated the house in 1905. They had the parquet floors, painted plaster moldings and Italian marble fireplaces installed in the house. Palmer acquired the property in 1912 for $25,000. In 1921-1922 he had the enclosed porch built around the structure that created a room for entertaining. In most cases this would be considered a significant alteration of the original building, but because it reflects Palmer's peculiar personality and his disassociation from the traditional tastes of Davenport's elite, it is significant in its own right. The porch is an odd assortment of institutional form with residential features such as the beveled glass. WOC radio had its first studio on the porch. The home contains an Aeolian player pipe organ that was purchased by the Palmers for $75,000. B.J. Palmer's favorite room in the house was called the rustic room. It incorporated the trunks and branches of four oak trees that were cut down to make room for a classroom building that was built next to the house. Some of the logs are wrapped in belts with metal buckles from the uniforms of Palmer students who served in World War I. The house also contains a sunken solarium that features a ceiling of square latticework that is painted to look like a circus wagon in colors of yellow, green, orange and red. The white wicker furniture in the solarium came from a Philippine prison. It also contains an eclectic collection that includes a humidor and umbrella stand made out of elephants‚Äô feet, which is next to a kangaroo from Australia. There is a bird of paradise on top of a Bodhisattva from India, which is on top of a cabinet from Korea placed on top of Native American rugs. It also contains a shrine from the Philippines holding a Hindu idol with a piece of African art. Rounding out the collection is a figure in Carrara marble from Italy, a Buddha from Siam, Japanese lanterns, and a Buddhist monk's umbrella that has been made into a light fixture. The house's kitchen has been restored to its 1950s appearance. The floor is covered in multi-colored tiles. Palmer obtained these from a local merchant, Wayne Montgomery, who would keep aside a floor tile every time he sold a batch of them. In time the kitchen was covered in the tiles where no two look alike. The kitchen also contains a Roper stove and a Kelvinator Foodarama refrigerator/freezer. The walls and woodwork are painted in bright circus colors. The butler's pantry still contains dishes that bear the Palmer crest. A Little Bit O‚Äô Heaven The entrance of A Little Bit O' Heaven Palmer started to build a garden along the north side of the house in 1924 that he called A Little Bit O‚Äô Heaven. It was largely a collection of artwork and artifacts that Palmer and his wife, Mabel Heath Palmer, collected on their trips to Asia and Europe. Part of the collection was also kept on the porch. A courtyard contained items such as totem poles, statues of deer, birds and the birth of Venus. There was a rock-lined corridor called ‚Äúpurgatory‚Äù that led to the heart of the exhibit that contained a large greenhouse with a waterfall of and a pond that was filled with tropical fish, alligators and Oriental art. The site also contained what Palmer claimed was the smallest chapel in the world, it was , and thousands of people wed there. For a small fee the public was allowed to visit the site. It was one of the most popular attractions in Davenport. After Palmer's death in 1961 A Little Bit O‚Äô Heaven started to decline and it was closed to the public in 1981 and it was dismantled in 1983. Over their lifetime the Palmers amassed a large collection of artifacts that decorated their house and A Little Bit O‚Äô Heaven. Half of the Palmer's collection went to their son David when Mabel died. When B.J. died, half of what was left was relocated to the Putnam Museum in Davenport. The remainder went to the Palmer's three granddaughters and what was left over remains in the house. The house remains a part of Palmer College today and the courtyard became a patio for students.

The variety program was based on the San Diego nightclub of the same name. Backstory Fred Finn had been performing an outdoors show at a yacht club in San Diego in 1965 when he was approached by a television producer, who asked if Fred would like to do a TV show - this same producer later came by the nightclub with NBC executives to see the entire act - they were all so impressed that they decided to give Mickie Finn's a chance as a TV series. Mickie Finn's webpage on the HARMONIZE.COM website  Production  This half-hour musical variety series was co-hosted by Fred Finn (his real name) and his wife, Mickie Finn (a stage name). The music played by the house band (Tony \\"Spider\\" Marillo on drums, Stormy Gormley on tuba & cello, \\"Dimples\\" Bobby Jensen on left-handed trumpet, Owen Leinhard on trombone, and \\"Cugar\\" Nelson on trombone Mickie Finn's webpage on the Restaurants, Bars & Nightclubs section of the TV ACRES website) ranged from current hits to ragtime to Dixieland jazz. In addition to the guest stars, the regular cast included Fred as the proprietor who played piano, Mickie who played banjo, and the Dapper Dans, a barbershop quartet who also did comedy bits. Harold \\"Hoot\\" Connors and Mickey Manners were the bartenders and bouncers who provided comic relief.Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle (Edition 7 -- 1997), The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows: 1946--Present, Random House Inc., p.676-677, The set on which this series was taped was a replica of the San Diego nightclub, re-created in NBC's studios at a cost of $50,000. A scenic designer had made countless sketches and photos of the original club to ensure a faithful duplication; details included such things as the long, narrow tables with red-checkered tablecloths, the moose heads on the wall, and signs like Keep Cool with Coolidge. The show's Nielsen ratings were better than for its sitcom predecessor, but would likely have been even better had its timeslot not been the same as ABC's primetime soap-opera hit Peyton Place.

Episodes were pre-empted on June 30, July 7, July 28, and August 25, 1966. Mickie Finn's was not renewed for the 1966-1967 Fall television season; on September 8, 1966, a sitcom series, The Hero, debuted in Mickie Finn's timeslot on NBC.

The cars were designed by the San Diego Electric Railway Company (SDERy) under the leadership of John D. Spreckels and built by the St. Louis Car Company (SLCCo). These cars, which took the best elements from preceding models and integrated them into a new, modern streetcar design, went on to serve the many neighborhoods of San Diego until they were retired in 1939. While most of them were ultimately destroyed over the years, three remaining Class 1 streetcars were saved from this fate in 1996 by a San Diego antique dealer and collector Christian T. Chaffee, owner of Chaffee Estate Services. They have since been designated San Diego Historic Landmarks (#339) and have been adequately preserved to this day in storage in San Diego at a substantial cost to Mr. Christian T. Chaffee. History =The Panama- California Exposition and the inception of the Class 1 streetcars= To celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal and to advertise San Diego as a vital port destination for traveling ships, city leaders planned the Panama- California Exposition of 1915. It was decided it would take place in Balboa Park, which was largely an open space park up until that point and would have to undergo major renovations and construction to be made ready for the event. Visionary artists and developers from San Diego and throughout America came together to design and construct an impressive new park. Apart from the architectural and botanical transformations that took place in Balboa Park, John D. Spreckels and his San Diego Electric Railway Company (SDERy) took on the task of providing public transportation for the Exposition. Directing a team of engineers and designers led by Abel A. Butterworth, Spreckels and SDERy Vice President, William Clayton, sought to develop a new streetcar that could both provide transportation for the visitors at the Panama-California Exposition and for the city of San Diego in the following decades of anticipated growth. Inside a San Diego Class 1 Streetcar. One of the main goals for Spreckels and San Diego Electric Railway was improving upon the flaws of existing streetcars, all the while synthesizing their strengths. Taking notes from both the ‚ÄúCalifornia Car‚Äù and ‚ÄúClosed Car‚Äù models, Butterworth and his team successfully developed an updated, modern streetcar with improved safety, speed, technology, and overall design. These new cars, known as the Class 1s, were also designed in the Arts & Crafts style with an artist‚Äôs touch to complement the changes to Balboa Park. Built by the world- renowned Saint Louis Car Company, they were adorned with warm yellow colors, gold-leafed oak leaves, hand-polished cherry wood, and solid bronze hardware ‚Äì- even the push buttons passengers used to alert the motorman were inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The first of these cars went into service in 1912. The fleet of twenty-four Class 1 streetcars went on to serve the patrons of the Panama-California Exposition and the citizens of San Diego for a number of years. =The streetcars in operation in San Diego= Archival photo of Class 1 streetcar #125 at the Park Ave. entrance to Mission Cliff Gardens in the University Heights neighborhood of San Diego, CA Following the success of the Panama-California Exposition, the Class 1 streetcars became a mainstay of early 20th century public transportation in San Diego. The improved design was met with enthusiasm from the general public and these streetcars became a popular mode of transit, often carrying over twice their intended capacity in passengers. One of the most significant features of the Class 1s was the development of the ‚Äúcenter entrance‚Äù, a large opening door in the center of the streetcar that also lowered spring-loaded steps for ease of entrance. This improved safety a great deal and made it easier for women in their fashionable ‚Äúhobble skirts‚Äù to enter a streetcar with a greatly reduced risk of falling over. This new center entrance was also combined, for the first time in the Class 1 streetcars, with the ‚ÄúP.A.Y.E‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPay As You Enter‚Äù, system. Soon after San Diego‚Äôs streetcars were developed, New York City followed suit and commissioned their own center entrance, ‚ÄúP.A.Y.E.‚Äù streetcar line. The various advancements made with the Class 1s ensured their widespread expansion across San Diego, with lines ultimately running everywhere from Downtown, to Coronado, Ocean Beach, Mission Hills, Old Town, Hillcrest, University Heights, North Park, South Park, Golden Hill, Kensington, Chula Vista, and even to the U.S.-Mexico border (until 1916). =The Great Depression leads to the retirement of the Class 1 streetcars= Archival photo of Class 1 streetcar homes in the Old Town neighborhood of San Diego, CA. Ultimately, after some updates and improvements in the mid-1920s, the San Diego Class 1 streetcars met the same fate as most light rail as The Great Depression began to take hold in America. As the government moved to economize public transportation systems in order to reduce the financial burden of public transit budgets, many cities decided to make the switch to the cheaper, utilitarian Presidents' Conference Committee (PCC) streetcars. Developed by a collaborative committee of streetcar company presidents, this mass-produced vehicle was designed to look like a then modern city bus and represented a necessary shift during the tough economic times. As a result, the Class 1 streetcars were retired and some were auctioned off in 1939. Some were even turned into homes, before a city law that prevented the practice was passed later that same year. Following the ban on streetcar sales, the remaining Class 1 bodies were destroyed. However, the sale of a few of these streetcars has allowed for three of these important pieces of San Diego history to be preserved until this day. Potential for restoration =The preservation and future of the Class 1 streetcars= After functioning as homes for over 50 years, in 1996 a private antique dealer purchased the three remaining Class 1 streetcars and has been personally preserving them until today. Since then, they have been officially designated a San Diego Historic Landmark (#339) and inspected and viewed by a number of experts and enthusiasts. Fred Bennett, who was involved with the San Francisco Vintage Trolley project, found that the Class 1s were ideal candidates for restoration and recommended that they return to the streets on a streetcar line.

Dyar and Frederick Knab were primarily responsible for the taxonomic portions of The Mosquitoes of North and Central America and the West Indies, published, with co-author L. O.

In 1924, Dyar was commissioned a captain in the Sanitary Department of the U.S. Army Reserve Officers Corps because of his background in the study of mosquitoes.Terry L. Carpenter and Terry A. Klein. 2011. 2011 AMCA Memorial Lecture Honoree: Dr. Harrison Gray Dyar Jr. Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association 27(3):336‚Äì343. Personal Dyar was a bigamist, \\"for fourteen years he was married to two women, maintaining two families with five children in all.\\" He married Zella M. Peabody of Los Angeles, a music teacher in 1889. They had two children. This marriage ended in 1920. But in 1906, using the alias of Wilfred P. Allen, Dyar married Wellesca Pollock. In 1921, now divorced from Peabody, Dyar legally married Pollock; they had three sons. Pollock was an educator and ardent disciple of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. After his legal marriage to Pollock, Dyar became active in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and edited an independent Bah√° º√≠ journal, Reality, from 1922 until his death. During the 1920s, Dyar's hobby of tunnel building was discovered when a truck broke through into a labyrinth of tunnels near his former home in Washington, D.C. Dyar was a second cousin of American Civil War soldier and publisher Harrison Gray Otis.Harrison Gray Dyar Jr.: A Preliminary Genealogy of the Dyar Family, Gibson Bros., Printers, Washington, D.C., 1903, p. 16.

Since the erection of a summit cross, that was set up in October 2003 by Franz Brunner and Fritz Gostner, this summit has enjoyed growing popularity.  Location  The Hintere Bachofenspitze in the second Karwendel mountain chain, known as the Gleirsch-Halltal Chain, separates the Gleirsch chain (Gleirschkette) in the west from the Hall Valley chain (Halltalkette) in the east. It is also the northernmost peak of the linking ridge (Verbindungsgrat) which runs over the Rosskopf south to the Stempeljochspitzen joining up with the Inn Valley chain. The north face of the Hintere Bachofenspitze drops 700 metres to the small Gschnierkopf in the upper Hinterau valley.  Routes to the top  The easiest and shortest way to reach the summit is on the marked path from the Pfeis Hut through the Sonntagskar to the southwest. Even the route through the rock barrier of the upper section is well marked and equipped with some iron steps (UIAA II). Another route runs from the \\"Wilde Band Steig\\" in the southeast through the pathless Bachofenkar. At the back of the kar, climb through a rubbly gully north up to the gap between the summits of the Vordere and Hinterer Bachofenspitze. From here the summit is reached, either along the ridge or just below it to the west (Grade I). In addition, the peak may be gained by crossing the ridge either from the Sonntagkarspitze (III), from the Haller Rosskopf (II) or the Gro√üer Lafatscher (II).

Mazumdar has been described as a \\"conceptual artist\\" and a \\"post-structuralist\\" while some critics consider it difficult to classify his oeuvre into a single artistic tradition or even into any consistent genre of his own. Mazudmar has referred to himself as an \\"expressionist painter\\" but has also said he generally prefers not to use \\"a particular word to qualify\\" his work because it comprises different kinds of media and forms,Johny ML. Methods of Memory and Materials for Recollecting. 1x1 Art Gallery. 2009. and that art is more interesting when fully given over to the viewer's own experience rather than constrained by the prescriptive power of labels. Born in Paris, Mazumder spent most of his childhood in Kolkata and in a remote area in rural Jharkhand. He received his initial art education from his father, the renowned Indian Modernist painter Nirode Mazumdar (1916 ‚Äì1982) and later, at the Calcutta Government College of Art & Craft. He first rose to prominence as a painter in the 1980s and 1990s and transitioned to installation work in the mid to late 1990s. He has often collaborated with Seagull Publications to design books and with Kolkata-based theater groups to design performance spaces. As of January 2015, he lives and works primarily in Kolkata and is associated with the 1X1 Gallery in Dubai. Major exhibitions of his work have been presented in Dubai, Kolkata, London, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Palo Alto, Paris, Rome, Singapore and Salzburg, among other places. His paintings are housed in the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi and in several private collections internationally. Early life and education Chittrovanu Mazumdar was born into a racially and culturally mixed family of artists and scholars. His mother Marguerite Mazumdar was French and his father, Nirode Mazumdar, a stalwart of 20th Century Indian Modern art and a founding member of the Calcutta Group, was Bengali Indian. Noted painter and art educator Shanu Lahiri and renowned Bengali novelist Kamal Kumar Majumdar were his paternal aunt and uncle, respectively. Mazumdar was born in Paris, but spent the bulk of his childhood in Kolkata and in a tiny village in Jharkhand (then part of Bihar). He grew up in a trilingual household and read extensively in all three of his native languages (Bengali, French, and English). The eclectic nature of his cultural and intellectual heritage has significantly informed his work later in life. Poet and art critic Ranjit Hoskote has written that Mazumdar \\"has served his apprenticeship to the grand tradition of European painting; equally, he has addressed the ingeniously achieved modernism in Santiniketan as well as the Calcutta Group.\\" Until he was about 12 years old, when he attended the Patha Bhavan School in Kolkata, Mazumdar was sent to a village school held in a little bamboo hut because his \\"father thought it would be good for [him]\\". He later studied art at the Calcutta Government College of Art & Craft, graduating at the top of his class in 1981. Prior to attending art college, he was taught by his father, whom he also cites as a significant creative influence. Work Mazumdar began his professional life as a painter. His first solo show was presented in Kolkata in 1985 at the Academy of Fine Arts by Seagull Foundation for the Arts, which went on to present a dozen solo exhibitions by him throughout India over the next decade and a half. In 1991 he became the third artist in history to be invited to present at the Durbar Hall at Victoria Memorial in Kolkata. During this period, he also established his international reputation through major group exhibitions in Asia, Europe, the UAE and the United States. His first solo exhibit outside of India was presented in New York at the Bose Pacia Modern Gallery in 1997. Since then, Mazumdar's work has been shown in twelve solo exhibitions and thirteen group exhibitions in India and abroad. In 2004, Seagull Foundation for the Arts presented his sprawling, multi-sensory installed environment New Work in an abandoned apartment building in a crowded Kolkata neighbourhood. In 2009, 1x1 Art Gallery of Dubai presented another ambitious project, the critically acclaimed undated: Nightskin. In 2012, Nightskin, which had been specifically tailored to its exhibit space, was adapted for and recreated in a space that comprised Mazudar's Kolkata studio at Ho Chi Minh Sarani and extended into the Harrington Street Arts Centre located on a floor above the studio in the same building (the new iteration of the work was titled ...and undated: Nightskin). In the summer of 2014, his expansive three month solo exhibit And what is left unsaid‚Ä¶ was held in the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome (commonly known as \\"MACRO\\"). Chittrovanu Mazumdar's work =Form and style= Mazumdar's paintings are sometimes created on very large canvases and the visual elements are often constructed in layers, creating the effect of being visible and shrouded at the same time. Fragmented images, collaged text and pictures, mythical iconography, abstracted and literal figuration are all built on top of each other, crowding together, yet appearing to be on separate planes of ‚Äútranslucent and opaque paint.‚Äù In the early to mid 1990s, although still largely focused on painting, Mazumdar was experimenting with different technologies and the use of three dimensional spaces. He collaborated on designing theater spaces, where he developed some of his technique and ideas for using sound, lighting, moving parts, digital media, and also the architectural elements, contours and traversable spaces of the exhibition venue itself. Since the late 1990s, Mazumdar has worked mostly in multimedia installations. He has continued to produce a large number of discrete paintings, but these are usually incorporated into the larger entity of the exhibition as a whole. In some shows, he has taken groups of multiple paintings (displayed in a traditional gallery-space configuration) as well as the entire room containing the display, and turned these into components of the larger installation. Mazumdar's installations employ a wide range of technologies and materials. He has used painted canvas and paper, poured industrial tar, mercury coated cups, aluminum reflectors, rubber, wood, wax, engine oil, brocaded textile, masonry, gold, iron, steel, motorized and mechanical devices, light bulbs, filtered light, video, CGI, soundtracks (including recognizable strands of music and recited poetry as well as human screams, traffic sounds, and jumbled noises), and massive freestanding structures such as metal towers with embedded digital content. In part because of the variety, Mazumdar's works have tended to defy categories. They are usually loosely characterized as installations or sculpted environments, but the artist himself refrains from attaching any single label to them. He says \\"there are paintings, sculptures, sound and light installations. Each piece tends to cross over to a new field, forcing the viewer to shift his/her position constantly.\\" =Subjects and themes= Critical reception Business Standard calls him \\"one of the foremost artists of his generation.\\" Lunch With BS: Chittrovanu Mazumdar. Business Standard. 25 August 2009. Celebrated painter M. F. Hussain, who once described Mazumdar as one of India's \\"most dynamic younger artists,\\" later said of his work \\"underlying his many shifts in medium, form and style over the years is a sensual intensity that reaches past the clever and the quick to probe deep layers of the human experience in all its tragi-comic universality - archetype, myth, memory, desire, betrayal, longing, ecstasy, pain.\\" Poet and art critic Ranjit Hoskote says Mazumdar's work inspires \\"a visual and conceptual excitement ‚Äì a heightened, even epiphanic extension of the senses‚Ä¶ now rarely felt in exhibitions of contemporary art. In sacrificing conceptual depth for surface flamboyance, in confusing truism with idea, in mistaking fashion for formal progress, many younger Indian artists have lost their way in a labyrinth where each forked path leads to discovery or a dead end. Mazumdar, by contrast, has never lost sight of the vital connection between reflection and practice, self-expression and self-critique; he values hesitancy, the creative rupture of one‚Äôs own certitude, over the reckless speed of unmediated production.\\" Soumitra Das of The Telegraph found the 2012 installation ‚Ä¶ and undated: Nightskin to be \\"matured and transformed into an aesthetic realization of his ideas of transience, mutability and of night being the matrix of creativity\\" in comparison to his earlier works from the 1990s, which Das found to be \\"gimmicky\\" in their use of \\"giant canvases‚Ä¶ electric lights and other theatrical props.\\" Reviewing Mazumdar's Installation New Work (Kolkata, 2004), writer Aveek Sen wrote that \\"the work teeters on the verge of great clich√©s‚Ä¶. But then, \\"how clear is the line that separates great clich√©s of art from its great themes?\\" Notable works =New Work= =undated: Nightskin= ...and Undated: Nightskin, Kolkata, 2012\\" Mazumdar's seminal work undated: Nightskin, debuted in Dubai in 2009 and was adapted and recreated as ‚Ä¶and undated: Nightskin in Kolkata in 2012. The original Dubai installation was presented in a large warehouse and used the exhibition space and the surrounding desert landscape as elements of the work. The Kolkata edition was housed in Mazudar's studio at Ho Chi Minh Sarani and extended into the Harrington Street Arts Centre located on a floor above the studio.Soumitra Das. \\"Transience, Mutability and the Night\\". The Telegraph. 18 February 2012. The exhibition stretched across two floors and included photographs, multimedia installations, tall towers (some of which were covered in lush, textured layers made of fabric), oils leaking out of boxes, and projections of video, light, and sound. One reviewer described a \\"crate smok[ing] like an overheated engine which might catch fire at any moment, but close inspection reveals the smoke as vapour.\\" One room had stark white walls on which were hung a series of prints titled \\"One Square Kilometre\\" showing the decomposing carcass of a calf, photographed over a period of five days. Another room contained \\"large screens on which streams a restless flow of images and sound, interspersed with text.\\" There was also a large, dark, vaulted chamber, which was intermittently illuminated with sudden flashes of rotating, coloured beams of light. In this chamber were \\"looming black metal towers and huge, squat black metal boxes. Moutned on wheels, yet unmoving.\\" Video images showed burning fires, flowing waters, a sleeping girl, \\"banks of flowers\\" in brilliant hues, some primary colours, some metallic. A soundtrack with layers of indistinct words, music, and muffled noises was heard. There were aperture- like mechanical components, opening and closing, smoke, viscous liquids seeping out of boxes, and partially open windows \\"containing small, digital prints of natural, organic textures and materials ‚Äì body parts or flowers of soil.\\" Nightskin constructed various spaces of \\"night\\", including images of large, twilight landscapes and intimate, trancelike moments of half-sleep. It evoked images that were alternatively comforting (like a \\"womb\\" or a \\"boudoir\\") and suffocating (like looking \\"down through bars at videos of people, as if they are trapped\\"). British historian and journalist, Lucian Harris, wrote that the work captured the moment of transition from day to night when the \\"equilibrium of light and dark dissolves all matter before it is recast in the skin of the night\\" and contemplated the \\"many layered mysteries of the night\\" that are allowed to emerge once the harsh world of daylight has been left behind \\"like a snake, lithe and glistening as it sheds the brittle corset of its dying scales.\\" The project was widely praised for its technical and methodological achievement. Soumitra Das of The Telegraph wrote \\"Mazumdar could not have created this daedal overlay of optic and aural sensations by simply wishing it would happen. It is obvious that meticulous planning went into it.\\" Das speculated about the time and effort required to paint, sculpt, photograph, arrange the music, and other such usual types of creative work, but also for \\"hanging at least a hundred framed pictures from the ceiling, rigging up a panel encrusted with the tiny bells of a ghunghru that start jangling in unison from time to time, putting together and installing those sinister, tall black ‚Äòcupboards‚Äô on wheels... punctuated with ‚Äòwindows‚Äô embedded with... images, and making sure that the louvres open up and close to reveal just enough of the videos with the regularity of the respiratory system.\\" In an interview to The Statesman, Mazumdar said that Nightskin took almost five years to complete.Swapan Mullick.\\"A Staggering Visual Experience\\" . The Statesman. 15 February 2012. Nightskin raises questions about the self, memory, conventions of art, and the significance of artists. According to Harris, it interrogates various ways of perceiving reality. Everything is highly evocative and also seems to exist in a literal and representational way, but on closer inspection, nothing is quite what it seems. The images and even the physical objects and substances (flowers, smoke, some unidentified \\"viscous liquid\\") reveal themselves to be something quite different.Lucian Harris. TAKE on art Magazine. Harris also writes that \\"Revelation is a particularly pervasive theme of Mazumdar‚Äôs installation. Hinged doors conceal imbedded video screens, still photographs and paintings, opening up like medieval icons. Throughout the whole arrangement is the invitation to explore, to touch, to get beneath the skin and peel away the layers, the process every bit as charged as what is uncovered. Soon we are absorbed in the motifs that guide us through Mazumdar‚Äôs subconscious mind, mapping his memories with reference to whole panoply of senses.\\" Pranabranjan Ray sums up his experience of Nightskin as one of \\"awe and wonder...inspired by the scale of the constructions, and ...the ingenious yet unobtrusive nature of the constructions.\\" Ray says \\"the language Mazumdar constructs is not for the generation of meaning, but for the evocation of feelings, both physiological and psychological. This makes Mazumdar a romantic artist, in the best sense of the term, although his process of realisation is deceptively postmodern. The sensation-boggling experience of the trip and the overwhelming perceptual after-effects defy categorisation.\\"Pranabranjan Ray. \\"Heart of Darkness\\". ART India. April 2012. =And what is left unsaid...= =The River= Mazumdar's installation \\"the River\\" was displayed as part of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale exhibition of contemporary art in Kochi, Kerala, during the 2016 edition. The program was curated by Artist Sudarshan Shetty, whose vision for the edition was to present works that ‚Äúcreate multiple, layered worlds and urge viewers to move between them.‚Äù The River (nicknamed \\"River of Ideas\\" by the exhibition), is a multi-room exhibit at the Aspinwall House, which features a series of journeys for the viewer, starting with a black metal tunnel ‚Äúmade dangerous with hanging, exposed wires,\\" according to one reviewer, and, in the center of it, a bridge over simulated fires made of incandescent light bulbs. There are rooms with video projections of water, leaves and ‚Äúdecay‚Äù on the floor as well as a video of the river Ganga flowing inside of a book. The work was ‚Äúinspired by mythical accounts of India as the land of seven rivers‚Äù and expresses in a new way, the elements of motion, transition, transience, and memory that are often present in Mazumdar's art. In discussing the beginnings of the project, he describes a conversation with curator Sudarshan Shetty, wherein the two of them spoke about the ancient river Saraswati, which is no longer extant but lives on in myth and in memory. Mazumdar says The River \\"raises questions about how you perceive time and culture and the passing of a moment.‚Äù He describes ‚Äúwater as a space of transition.\\" The thing about a river, he says, is that ‚Äúonce it‚Äôs gone, its gone forever; you never get back the same water.‚Äù Exhibitions =Selected solo exhibitions= *2017 'Undated Nightskin.\\" Mana Contemporary Gallery, Jersey City, New Jersey. *2014 ‚ÄòAnd what is left unsaid‚Ä¶.‚Äô Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome (MACRO), Curated by Paola Ugolini. *2012 Parcours St German, Paris curated by Anne-Pierre d'Albis, presented by 1x1 Art Gallery *2012 '...and undated: Nightskin', The Harrington Street Arts Centre, Kolkata presented by 1 x 1 Art Gallery, Dubai *2010 'Ancient Earth', Apparao Galleries, Chennai in association with 1x1 Art Gallery, Dubai *2009 'undated: Nightskin', 1x1 Art Gallery, Dubai *2006 'Various', Royal Academy of Arts, London presented by Gallerie 88, Kolkata *2005 Bodhi Art, New Delhi *2004 'New Work', Seagull Foundation for the Arts, Kolkata *1997 Bose Pacia Modern, New York *1997 'Recent Works', presented by Seagull Foundation for the Arts (SFA), Kolkata at Jehangir art Gallery, Mumbai and Sumukha Art Gallery, Bangalore *1997 'Works on Paper', Seagull Foundation for the Arts (SFA), Kolkata *1994 'Recent Works', organised by Seagull Foundation for the Arts (SFA), Kolkata at Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai and Lalit Kala Academy, Chennai (with Apparao Art Gallery, Chennai) *1991 Presented by Seagull and Victoria Memorial Board of Trustees, Kolkata at Victoria Memorial Durbar Hall and Sukh Sagar, Kolkata *1989 ‚ÄòRecent Works‚Äô, Presented by Seagull Foundation, Kolkata at Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai *1989 ‚ÄòUntitled', presented by Seagull Foundation, Kolkata and The Birla Academy at Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata *1985 'Recent Works', presented by Seagull Foundation at Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata Chittrovanu Mazumdar Profile.

Military career Torma was mobilized into the Russian Imperial Army during World War I and served as an officer. He was seriously injured in Galicia in 1917 and subsequently became a prisoner of war in Austria. He eventually returned to Estonia in 1918 after a prisoner exchange via Denmark. Torma was attached to the British expeditionary force as the Estonian representative during the North Russia Campaign, serving in the area of intelligence.

The pattern emphasizes a controlled sharing and exchange of information among autonomous components by communication via messages. Highest possible autonomy shall be given to the different cooperating components. In return they are expected to adhere to common models by using defined interfaces.  Complex problems  \\"Complex architectures are extremely hard to manage, not only in terms of the architecture process itself, but also in terms of getting buy-in from large numbers of stakeholders. This in turn requires a very disciplined approach to identifying common architectural components, and management of the commonalities between federated components ‚Äî deciding how to integrate, what to integrate, etc.\\"TOGAF Version 9 Enterprise Edition. The pattern's intention is to provide the highest possible autonomy in order to reduce the complexity, which at the same time shall increase what is called agility. The expected result is a high degree of flexibility ‚Äî which at the end means, taking local particularities seriously and solve local problems locally whenever possible. There are different areas where autonomy can help solve complex problems better. ;Autonomic * Operation * Provisioning * Design decisions * Platform decisions * Application design Federated architecture is expected to deliver high flexibility and agility among independently cooperating components and at the same time reduces complexity significantly. It should be considered for problems with the root cause of unmanageable complexity. That can be caused by functional business and non-functional IT requirements. The pattern is applicable for decoupling and decentralization projects, heterogeneous environments, where a central one-fits-all approach cannot be applied and will not solve the problem of constantly changing underlying realities. It is especially applicable for long term migration projects, where a big bang approach cannot be applied. The federated architecture is an architecture vision to foster managed independence among loosely coupled cooperating components sharing a common aim.  Federation and syndication  The concept of federation is supplemented by the concept of syndication. Syndication is a kind of central authority being able to interpret the federated model and compile meaningful information out of it. This is typically done by management information and workflow systems, portals, reporting systems, general ledger, tax reporting and even identity and security management. A typical example is demand planning of a supply chain or a stock exchange order book, where different participants have agreed on a standard protocol. Common to all such systems and organizations is a common semantic model and protocol, to which each participant agreed to adhere and behave like to a law.  Federated architecture foundation  The FA pattern with its emphasis on autonomy by sharing of a model is forced to deliver a constitution, a federated architecture foundation (FAF), something like The Ten Commandments, common concepts, principles and even a common technical architecture: \\"a corpus juris\\". In the absence of a global authority, the federated architecture has to resolve two conflicting requirements: the components must maintain as much autonomy as possible, but the components must be able to achieve a reasonable degree of information sharing\\" (Heimbiger, 1985). This is the reason federated architecture strongly demands for governance. The FAF is the legislative body, which needs an executive or an architecture enforcement QC process and sometimes a jurisdiction.  Federated organizations  The federated architecture pattern was first used by the US Federal CIO in the early 1990s and was since then adopted by other large organization like banks, IT architecture organizations, etc. Large and complex organizations with independent lines of business (LOBs) federate the administrative and IT functions among several local authorities. It enables LOBs to maintain diversity and uniqueness, while providing interoperability. LOBs have full autonomy to develop standards for applications and infrastructure and to define enterprise architectures. The goal of the LOB is to optimize performance at LOB level. Federated Architectures define common or shared architecture standards across autonomous program areas, enabling, e.g., state government entities to maintain diversity and uniqueness, while providing interoperability. Federated Enterprise Architecture is a collective set of organizational architectures (as defined by the enterprise scope), operating collaboratively within the concept of federalism, in which governance is divided between a central authority and constituent units balancing organizational autonomy with enterprise needs. The central authority‚Äôs architecture focuses on the dynamics of economies of scale, standards, and the well being of the enterprise, while constituent units‚Äô architecture has the flexibility to pursue autonomous strategies and independent processes.See Meta Group.  Federated information technology systems  Most recently the principle was carried over to application design by large software vendors, emphasized in large scale database system architecture as well as portal infrastructure and identity management. Federated identity systems link a user's attributes to multiple systems, such as with single sign-on technologies. It is also used to manage pricing in service industries, where the requirement of bundling services and invoice customers according to these service-bundles needs independently, across product areas organized processing systems to syndicate their service definitions and pricing determination. It allows the introduction of new pricing models in market-oriented time. A holistic customer view as well as a detailed and traceable price calculation shall allow for transparent information towards the customer and the corporation.  Benefits  The benefits of being as independent of a global authority as possible (where a global authority may be a central computer system, central organization or central process management system), are expected to outweigh problems caused by misunderstandings and incompatibilities. There are different areas where independently solved problems can reduce complexity and increase agility. ;Independence * Lifecycle independence (LI) means that each local team can define its own lifecycle concept, roadmap and release plan for its product, independently from others' products. * Operational independence (OI) means that in case of emergency each local team, having the know-how about their products and computer systems, is able to fix and operate them without relying on others' knowledge and willingness to support them. * Platform independence (PI) means that system and application platforms can be mixed as well as computer languages as long as they are able to interpret the model and produce the expected results.  History  Federated architecture as database architecture was first introduced by Denis Heimberger 1982Heimbigner, D. M. A federated architecture for database systems. Ph.D. dissertation, Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, August 1982. and 1985 with the title: A Federated Architecture for Information Management:Heimbigner, Dennis and McLeod, Dennis, A Federated Architecture for Information Management, 1985. \\"This federated database architecture allows a collection of database systems (components) to unite into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information.

He was the eldest son of Jeremy II, and was young when he took office. In 1740 the Anglo-Spanish \\"War of Jenkins' Ear\\" broke out, and Great Britain was anxious to enlist the Miskito on their side. They wanted to take advantage of the people's enmity to Spain as a means to conduct raids against Spanish possessions in Central America. To that end, Governor Trelawny of Jamaica created an office of \\"Superintendent of the Mosquito Shore\\" and entrusted it to Robert Hodgson. Hodgson arrived in 1740 and met with Edward and Governor John Briton, the other officials being either sick (Admiral Dilly) or too far away (General Hobby).

Moreover, Hodgson had to give gifts that amounted to a sort of tribute to the Miskito. Hodgson resided at Black River, a station more or less at the extreme northwestern end of the kingdom, where English had settled since the 1730s. According to Hodgson's report, filed in 1740, the kingdom was ruled by three chiefs or \\"guards.\\" These included governor Briton to the south of the king's domain, controlling lands of unmixed Miskito; the lands of the king himself around Sandy Bay; and general Hobby, who controlled the Zambo or mixed-race African- Miskito to the north and west.

What appears to be the case is that Columbia Records took a group of Williams' studio recordings, most of them made during the summer of 1970 and consisting of his versions of recent soft rock hits, and added a lot of canned applause along with some of the kind of musical interludes used to usher numbers on and off on the show, including bits of its \\"Moon River\\" theme music at the start and the finish.\\" The album made its first appearance on the Top LP's chart in the issue of Billboard magazine dated November 14, 1970, and remained on the album chart for 17 weeks, peaking at number 81..

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History The building at 309 Harrison Street is associated with a prominent Davenport Attorney Charles August (C.A.) Ficke. He was responsible for building or renovating numerous properties in the downtown area. The block, which has the appearance of two separate buildings, was built in 1899 to house the McCormick Division of the International Harvesting Company of America and apartments on the upper floors. with The southern storefront (307) became the L.R. Wareham pool hall in 1915 and remained a pool hall through the 1940s. The north side (309) was home to a variety of businesses that included: City Fuel and Lumber Company, Bee Jay Tire Service, the Savoy Caf√©, the Colorado Restaurant, the Old Timer (tavern), and the Three Hundred Nine Tavern. It currently houses the Berg Apartments. Architecture The Ficke Block is a four-story, brick structure built on a stone foundation. It features many details found in late Victorian architecture: rusticated, semi-circular window arches on the third floor, and flat stone lintels over the paired windows on the fourth floor recall the Romanesque style. A pair of two-story bay windows with embossed garland swags, wrought iron balconies, and ornate cornices reflect the Queen Anne style. The storefronts, however, have been significantly altered.

An English language dub was produced in 1989 by Ahmed Agrama's Intersound, Inc., and released on home video in the United States by Celebrity Home Entertainment. It was never shown in the cinema in either country, although the American cable channel Nickelodeon showed it occasionally as part of its weekend \\"Special Delivery\\" block. The special was worked by Nippon Animation with production assistance by Madhouse. The special is based on the 1968 children's novel Jakobus Nimmersatt, by German author Boy Lornsen. Plot Many animals inhabit a peaceful forest known as Placid Forest. They attempt to resist, and ultimately must declare war on, some humans who live in a nearby village. The humans plot to cut down all the trees in Placid Forest so they can make money and become millionaires, but the animals know that they will lose their home if they do not act fast. The animals team up and carry out a systematic process of operations to guard their habitat. Characters Non-humans *Jacob : Kimotsuki Kaneta / Myron Mensc, a black crow wearing a yellow bandana, is the leader of the animals and the first to sound the alarm to the other animals. He has excellent leadership, courage, and elocution. His biggest flaw, however, is his occasional appetite for food, especially cheese, which puts him in a rat trap set by Marcus. *Peter : Masako Nozawa / Rebecca Forstadt, an elf-like fairy with a pink hat and green clothes, is a great ally to Jacob. He is appointed the chairman of the animals, second-in-command to Jacob. He sometimes plays hide-and-seek with his friend Penny, and he is skilled at looking at the big picture before making a decision. He can turn invisible at will, but when someone sneezes, he becomes visible, which almost gives him away to Marcus when he attempts to steal the humans' lunch. *Penny : Minori Matsushima / Lara Cody, a mouse with a red nose, is highly fearful. When she proceeds to gnaw the bridge leading from Placid Forest to the village with Billy and his team of rats, she almost falls in the river and runs away, thus earning her the label of coward from Billy. However, she finally plucks up her courage when she drops a pot on Marcus's cat. This prompts Billy to call her \\"the first mouse to ever get a cat in the history of the rat's kingdom\\". *Billy, the leader of the rats. He is initially very strict about fear, calling Penny a coward for failing to gnaw the bridge, but when Penny proves her courage by inadvertently dropping a pot on Marcus's cat, he becomes extremely appreciative of her. He is voiced by Eddie Frierson in the English version. *Paul, the leader of the squirrels. He is very competitive against the rats. He offers to listen to every idea suggested, and he is a reliable ally to the animals. He is voiced by Doug Stone in the English version. *Mary, an owl wearing a locket, is obsessed with her appearance and beauty. At times she is arrogant, especially to Jacob, whom she sometimes teases, but in the long run, she is sweet and sympathetic. She is voiced by Masuyama Eiko in the Japanese version and by Lisa Paulette in the English version. *Carl, a green rabbit. He participates in the forest plot alongside his grandfather, and he is obedient and loyal both to him and to Peter. He is voiced by Koyama Mami in the Japanese version and by Wendee Lee in the English version. His grandfather is voiced by Richard Barnes. *Jay, as his name suggests, is a blue jay. He is easily excited and upset, which is his biggest flaw, and sometimes, he cannot tell how the other animals feel. He is voiced by Steve Apostolina in the English version. *Stanley, a hedgehog. When he hears an idea or has a particular goal, he will hold onto it until it is done. His obsessive nature, however, can lead him to occasional temper tantrums. He is voiced by Don Warner in the English version. *Adam, a frog. He is relatively calm, unlike Jay. When he hops, his speech is sometimes fragmented. He is voiced by Dave Mallow in the English version. Humans *Marcus, the leader of the villainous humans. His leadership and courage match those of Jacob, but unlike him, Marcus is arrogant and usually doesn't think about the consequences first. He is voiced by Cyn Branch. His wife, Bertha, is voiced by Lisa Paulette. *Timothy, a businessman. Like Marcus, he is intent on receiving money, and he will often ignore the consequences of his actions. He is voiced by Drew Thomas. His wife is voiced by Deanna Morris. *Nigel, a cook. He has a gruff voice, which reflects his courage and toughness. He is voiced by Cliff Wells. *Michael, a tailor. He is not as enthusiastic about cutting down the forest as the other men, but he likes having a large sum of money. He is voiced by Michael Sorich. His wife, Joanna, is voiced by Penny Sweet. *Benjamin, a priest. He is somewhat of a neutral party compared to the other men, as he is only concerned about his church at first. He is voiced by Leonard Pike. *Matthew, a shepherd. He betrays his teammates, since he opposes cutting down the forest. This makes him a reliable ally to the animals, albeit a human. He is voiced by Mikey Godzilla.

It was set-up as one of the first plantations in the 1730s, and operated as the last sugar plantation on the island until the Bethlehem Central Factory closed in 1966.  Location  Bethlehem Old Works, also known as Lower Bethlehem, was part of the Estate Bethlehem in the flat center of St. Croix, where now the VIARNG armory is located along the Bethlehem Gut waterway, which had been called South Salt River in the colonial era. Other parts of the Estate were Bayworks (Fairplain) in the south and Middle Works (Upper Bethlehem) in the north.Stephan Timothy Lenik: Historical archaeological approaches to Afro-Cruzan identity at Estate Lower Bethlehem, St. Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands. 2000.  Name  The source of the name of Estate Bethlehem is unknown, but it was probably named after Bethlehem, Pennsylvania by the Moravians, who evangelized the Danish Virgin Islands since 1732 at a mission in Friedensfeld near Lower Bethlehem.  History  The Danish West India Company, which often acted as an agent on behalf of the Danish Crown, purchased St. Croix from France in 1733. Prior to this deal, the settlement was labeled Baron on a French map of 1671.J. B. du Tertre: Map of St. Croix, 1671. The area that became known as Bethlehem was deeded to King Christian VI and the Queen in 1736, as it was flat and ideally suited for cultivation of sugar or cotton benefiting from the fresh water of the Bethlehem Gut. In 1739, King's Quarter was subdivided: Parts of it were sold to the Dutch governor of St. Eustatius Peter Heyliger and his brother Johannes, while four plots were retained by the King, until they were sold to the Heyligers in 1751. The first windmill was built at Bethlehem in the late 1760s. Estate Bethlehem on a map of 1779 by the military surveyor Frederik Christian von Meley A map of 1779 by the military surveyorFrederik Christian von Meley shows Lower Bethlehem on the right as an eighteenth century Danish sugar plantation. The Old Works occupied 450 acres, and was divided into 27 variably sized plots. The slave village consisted of four rows of ten structures each, and the provision grounds occupied an acre and a half to the west of the village. Further south were the sugar mill and associated buildings for processing sugar cane. Sugar Factory, Estate 'Bethlehem', St. Croix, 1902 In the 1820s, Estate Bethlehem suffered from a drought, a hurricane and the drop in sugar prices, and were thus sold to Benjamin De Forest at an auction in 1831. In 1882, William H. Carson, a Danish investor, bought the estates at Bethlehem, Friedensburg and Jealousy and built a modern sugar factory at Lower Bethlehem, which used the vacuum pan process to refine the sugar. He sold Bethlehem to the Lachmann family in 1902 who built the Central Sugar Factory at Lower Bethlehem in 1903. It was connected by a narrow gauge steam railway to Bethlehem Middle Works and Friedensburg, which also belonged to the Lachmann family. In 1917, the United States bought the Danish Virgin Islands. The Lachmanns continued to manage the Bethlehem works, employing approximately 2,000 employees out of a total population of about 15,000, until they sold the factory to the federal government in 1930 as a consequence the Great Depression. Subsequently, the old factory was demolished and a new sugar mill was built to replace it, which operated until 1966.The Bethlehem Central Factory during the 1950s. The land became the property of the Virgin Islands Government. Ruins of the Bethlehem Central Factory and many of the worker's residences are still standing, including the smokestack, which has become a prominent landmark of central St. Croix. Parts of the plantations were parceled off and sold for agricultural use, while others were used for building the new headquarters of the Virgin Islands Army National Guard.

The series follows the career of a future mercenary tank regiment called Hammer's Slammers, after their leader, Colonel Alois Hammer. As with his other work, Drake borrows plots from historical or mythological sources for many of the Hammer's Slammers stories. For example, he retells the story of Jason and the Argonauts in The Voyage, and part of the Odyssey in Cross the Stars. Other stories borrow from pulp era fiction (The Sharp End is based on Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest.) Short essays in Hammer's Slammers provide details of the political, social, economic, and technological conditions in the Hammerverse. The series =Original novels= # Hammer's Slammers (1979): The initial collection of stories. Includes the creation of the Slammers as a mercenary unit, shows several of its campaigns, and the end of its independent existence when Colonel Hammer becomes the ruler of his native world, Friesland. # At Any Price (1985): A study in command and cultural conflict. The Slammers must aid a human community in a fight with aliens who can teleport. # Counting the Cost (1987): The Slammers become involved in an internal dispute among their employers. Based on the Nika riots, with Slammers Captain Tyl Koopman in the role of Belisarius. # Rolling Hot (1989): A pick-up Slammers unit, Task Force Ranson, must make a rapid combat march to relieve the capital city which is under threat. Based loosely on the events of the Tet offensive, according to Drake's comments. # The Warrior (1991): A rivalry between two of the Slammers, who have very different ideas of what it means to be a warrior. One of them, Slick Des Grieux, is based on the classical character of Achilles. # The Sharp End (1993): A survey team from the Slammers is looking for work for the regiment. This book is set after Colonel Hammer has become President Hammer; Hammer's Regiment the 1st Friesian Defense Forces Regiment; and is based on Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest. # Paying the Piper (2002): Three novellas that follow a Slammers unit commander during a war between rival city states. The political situation is based on the war between Rhodes and Byzantium in the 3rd century BC # Other short stories: A Death in Peacetime (\\"Oceans of the Mind\\", Spring 2005).

Models of the vehicles are available from Old Crow and infantry figures from Ground Zero Games. John Treadaway also offers a Hammer's Slammers-based miniatures wargames ruleset called The Crucible at http://www.hammers-slammers.com/home.htm Technology =Powerguns= In the Hammer universe, a powergun is a weapon which projects high energy copper plasma toward its target. This plasma is created by inducing an electrical field in a precisely aligned group of copper atoms; the atoms' alignment causes a resonance which greatly amplifies the field energy and ionizes the atoms. The resulting plasma is directed by a firing chamber and barrel made of refractory metal, such as iridium; the chamber and barrel are cooled between shots by injected gas (typically nitrogen). The copper atoms are stored as individual charges, with the atoms held in the correct alignment by a plastic matrix which is mostly consumed by the firing. All the parts of a powergun require extremely precise machining and advanced materials, which makes powerguns very expensive; only the most successful mercenary units (or technologically advanced planets) can afford large numbers of powerguns. Powerguns are easily identified by the extremely bright cyan color of their plasma bolts; the electrical field also generates a broadband radio frequency discharge which can be picked up by the appropriate equipment. A powergun's recoil is far lower than a projectile weapon of equivalent size or firepower, as the copper atoms have low rest mass; the primary limit for powergun rate of fire is its ability to dissipate heat. Many smaller rapid fire powerguns use a multibarrel configuration, either a rotary gatling or a multi chamber mitrailleuse (the latter called a \\"calliope\\" in Slammers military slang.) Powerguns are line of sight weapons. As a general rule, if you can see it, you can hit it. The upper limit of their range is not known. However, in one story a politician is killed with a shot to the head from a 1 cm pistol in the hands of a master marksman at a range of more than a mile.Drake, David. \\"Standing Down,\\" Hammer's Slammers (New York: Ace Books), 1984 In another, part of a plot revolves around disabling the powergun equivalent of a heavy flak gun battery capable of hitting a spaceship in orbit. However, the plasma projected has one failing: the energy in the plasma will expend itself on the first object it hits, whether that is a leaf or an enemy soldier. Precision in aiming is key when using a powergun. The operating characteristics and tactical employment of powerguns were chosen by the author, David Drake, to be roughly equivalent to the firearms he was familiar with; specifically, the M14 rifle, the M1928A1 Thompson submachine gun, the M1911A1 .45 ACP pistol, and the Browning M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun. This allowed him to easily translate his experiences in Vietnam to a science fiction context. The specifics of the powergun are inspired by Drake's interest in Fortean phenomena; the mechanism by which powerguns produce destructive plasma is similar to the working of a Tesla coil, and the destructive power of copper plasma is said (in the Slammers universe) to have resulted in the deaths of thousands in the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelee. (In reality, this was the result of a pyroclastic surge.) =Other Weapons= The Slammers have few standard issue weapons other than powerguns. Slammers infantry troops use grenades of various types in addition to their powerguns. The Regiment also maintains several batteries of self-propelled howitzers which fire rocket boosted shells. These include simple high explosive and smokescreen rounds, antipersonnel cluster bomb shells (\\"firecracker rounds\\"), sophisticated anti tank munitions with self-forging warheads similar to the present day CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon (\\"tank killers\\"), and tactical nuclear warheads (\\"red pills\\"). The Slammers occasionally use poison gas or incendiary weapons as area denial methods, and for eliminating threats in bunkers they do not choose to assault.Dranke, David. \\"Standing Down.\\" The Slammers (and similarly advanced units) make extensive use of powerguns for defense against aircraft, incoming artillery shells, and missiles. The powerguns are computer controlled in air defense mode to achieve the needed precision and reaction time. Although Hammer's hovertanks have computers which are capable of individual air defense operation,Drake, David. Rolling Hot (New York: Baen Books), 1989. . the usual practice is for the regiment's Fire Central computer to take control of whatever tribarrels bear on the threat and use them to eliminate it. Some mercenary forces in the Slammers universe are specialized antiaircraft units (e.g., the United Defense Batteries; see Counting the Cost) which provide this service to clients who cannot afford to field the sophisticated technology required. Forces other than the Slammers also use powerguns, along with a wide range of weapons. Most are similar in type to present day weapons, although they are generally smaller in size and of greater lethality. Newly established colony planets, which devote most of their production to bare survival, might produce low tech improvised firearms; at the other end of the scale, some well established planets can produce weapons such as high powered lasers or electromagnetic railguns and Gauss guns. These advanced weapons can approach powerguns in effectiveness, and even exceed them in some ways (albeit at comparable expense.) =Vehicles of Hammer's Regiment= Hammer's Regiment uses air-cushion and ducted-fan motive systems for its vehicles. The primary fighting unit is an air cushion tank weighing 150 to 170 tonnes, armed with a 20 cm single barrel powergun as the main armament in the rotating turret and a 2 cm tribarrel powergun in a cupola. Standard battle tanks are crewed by one driver and one sergeant commander who doubles as the gunner. A command tank version exists, which adds stations in the turret for an officer and his communications technician along with the communications equipment necessary to command a tank company.Drake, David, \\"Hangman,\\" Hammer's Slammers (New York: Ace Books), 1984. . Hammer's tanks have extremely heavy armor, with the main hull and turret made of iridium and heavy steel skirts surrounding the plenum chamber. The tank also is equipped with multiply redundant systems and state of the art artificial intelligence to assist the crew, particularly the vehicle commander. Slammers tanks carry a continuous strip of directional mines above the skirts, to defend against infantry attacks and man-portable antitank missiles (\\"buzz bombs\\") launched at point blank range. The tanks are supported by smaller \\"combat cars\\", armored air cushion vehicles that mount three 2 cm tribarrels. Combat cars have a crew of one driver, one vehicle commander who doubles as a gunner, and two wing gunners. The armor, sensors, redundancy, and artificial intelligence of the combat cars are not as extensive as those on the tanks. The combat car was inspired by Drake's recollection of the \\"ACAV\\" version of the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier. A command version of the standard combat car, essentially a steel box on a combat car chassis, exists. The command car's powerful computer and communications gear is useful for unit commanders, although many commanders choose instead to use a standard combat car as their command vehicle. The Slammers also operate self-propelled artillery units and tank recovery vehicles, both of which are only equipped with splinter resistant armor. While these use the same air cushion propulsion system as the fighting vehicles, the sheer weight of these vehicles limits their maneuverability. The Regiment's infantry uses very small air cushion vehicles to improve their mobility. These are either one man \\"skimmers\\" or two man \\"jeeps\\"; the latter can be equipped with tribarrel powerguns, mortars, or a variety of command and sensor modules. Many vehicles in the Slammers universe, including all the armored fighting vehicles of Hammer's Regiment, are powered by magnetically contained fusion reactors. These are called \\"fusion bottles\\" in the Slammers universe. The high power density of these reactors allow the Slammers to combine high speed, heavy armor, and heavy weapons in their combat vehicles, albeit at extreme expense. Other vehicles of Hammer's Regiment are powered by fuel cells or high capacity batteries which can be recharged in the field from an armored vehicle's fusion reactor. Other vehicles in the Slammers universe are not significantly advanced beyond modern vehicles, except in the specifics of materials and computer systems. One notable difference is that \\"aircars,\\" similar to the Piasecki Airjeep, are common on many worlds. =FTL= Starships in the Slammers universe use FTL drives to travel between star systems, or to travel short distances within a system. In the Slammers universe, the FTL drive is called \\"Transit drive.\\" Distances between planets and star systems are measured in Transit Minutes, referring to the overall time spent in Transit \\"jumps\\". Travel by Transit usually involves a series of instantaneous short distance jumps followed by a period of recalculation; the calculations involved in Transit navigation take anywhere from ten to a hundred times as long as the actual Transit process. Distances of seventy Transit Minutes are considered extremely long, for instance. The process by which Transit occurs is not explained in Slammers fiction. However, it appears to have some effect on the human brain as those who travel by Transit are disoriented and fatigued by the jump itself, and suffer severe headaches for a short time afterward. In addition, the distance between two points via Transit is not equivalent to the distance in normal space. Two star systems which are relatively close might be many Transit Minutes apart. There is also a realtime communications system available in the Slammers universe called the Stadtler Communication Device. Its method of operation is unknown, but it is capable of instantaneously communicating to another Stadtler Device at distances up to kiloparsecs away. However, there is one absolute requirement to employ one. \\"The Stadtler Device could not be used to receive alone.

Chickering explains the process of identity development. The theory was created specifically to examine the identity development process of students in higher education, but it has been used in other areas as well. History During his employment at Goddard College, Chickering started in on the research for his theory. The research, which he began in 1959 and finished in 1969, involved surveying college students. The students were traditional in age, and were enrolled as sophomores through senior. Chickering was involved with the Project on Student Development in Small Colleges, which allowed him to collect additional data from other schools and compile it with the data from his own. In 1969, he published Education and Identity which explained his new theory of student development. His work was revisited and updated in 1972 and again in 1993 in cooperation with Linda Reisser.  Overview  Chickering's theory focuses primarily on identity development. It examines this by means of seven vectors of development which contribute to the development of identity: * Developing competence * Managing emotions * Moving through autonomy toward interdependence * Developing mature interpersonal relationships * Establishing identity * Developing purpose * Developing integrity These vectors can be thought of as a series of stages or tasks that deal with feeling, thinking, believing, and relating to others. Individuals may progress through the vectors at different rates. The vectors have a tendency to interact with each other, and this can cause reevaluation of issues associated with vectors that had already been worked through. Although the vectors do build on one another, the vectors do not follow a strict sequential order. Developing in multiple vectors allows individuals to function with greater stability and intellectual complexity. = Developing competence = In Education and Identity, Chickering and Reisser use the analogy of the three-tined pitchfork to describe competence. The tines are intellectual competence, physical competence, and interpersonal competence. The handle of the pitchfork represents the sense of competence that comes from the knowledge that the individual is able to achieve goals and cope with adverse circumstances.The Seven Vectors: An Overview = Managing emotions = This vector consists of learning to understand, accept, and express emotions. Individuals learn how to appropriately act on feelings that they are experiencing. In his more recent work, Chickering's theory was broad and covered emotions including anxiety, depression, guilt, anger, shame along with positive emotions such as inspiration and optimism. In his original work, he focused primarily on aggression and sexual desires. = Moving through autonomy toward interdependence = The successful achievement of this vector involves learning how to be emotionally independent. This includes becoming free from the consistent need for comfort, affirmation, and approval from others. Individuals also see growth in problem solving abilities, initiative, and self-direction. They begin to understand that they are part of a whole. They are autonomous, but interdependent on others in society. In Chickering's updated theory, much more emphasis is placed on interdependence. = Developing mature interpersonal relationships = In this vector, individuals learn to appreciate and understand others. Some of the related tasks include cross-cultural tolerance and appreciation for the differences of others. An individual also becomes competent in developing and maintaining long-term intimate relationships. Chickering moved this up to list of vectors in his revised edition in order show the importance of developing relationships. = Establishing identity = This vector builds on each of the ones which comes before it. It involves becoming comfortable with oneself. This includes physical appearance, gender and sexual identity, ethnicity, and social roles. It also includes becoming stable and gaining self-esteem. A person who has a well-developed identity can handle feedback and criticism from others. = Developing purpose = In this vector, an individual develops commitment to the future and becomes more competent at making and following through on decisions, even when they may be contested. It involves developing a sense of life vocation. It may involve the creation of goals, and is influenced by the family and lifestyle of the individual. = Developing integrity = This vector consists of three stages which flow in chronological order, but are able to overlap. These stages are humanizing values, personalizing value, and developing congruence. The process of humanizing values encompasses the shift from a cold, stiff value system to one which is more balanced with the interests of others matched with the interests of the self. After this is established, the individual begins to assemble a core group of personal values which are firmly held, but the beliefs of others are considered and respected. Developing congruence involves bringing actions in line with beliefs.

Biography Crehan was born and raised in Bonavilla, Ballymackea Beg near Mullagh, County Clare on the West coast of County Clare. While his father was not a musician, his mother played the concertina. The Crehans frequently opened their home for social occasions, so live music and was a fixture in their home. Junior first took up the concertina himself, but took an interest in an old fiddle in the house, and took up the process of restoring it himself. When established fiddler Thady Casey heard Crehan play in a pub (having taught himself initially), he offered to tutor him - as a result, Crehan learned the fundamentals of fiddling from Thady, and learned stylistically from both him and his brother, Scully Casey, who was also a respected fiddler. Subsequently, Junior became a sought-after musician for country house dances until their decline in the 1930s (exacerbated in particular by the Public Dance Halls Act of 1935). Crehan was encouraged by the folk revivals of the 1950s and later, and involved himself with Comhaltas Ceolto√≠ri √âireann, at one point serving as president of its Clare branch. Playing style Crehan's peers have described his playing as \\"sweet\\" and \\"emotive,\\" and his bowing as \\"economical.\\" He is said to have relied more on rhythmic variation than on ornamentation, and relying heavily on long rolls when he did use ornamentation. He made extensive use of double- stops, and music writer Barry Taylor suggests this may result from the influence of his friendships with uilleann pipers Willie Clancy and Johnny Doran. Compositions A number of tunes currently popular within the Irish Traditional Music community were written by Junior. These include Poll an Mhadra Uisce (The Otter's Holt), written with reference to some otters near his family home that would approach when music was played. A further and even better-known example is \\"The Mist Covered Mountain\\", inspired by Mount Callan which can be seen from his home in West Clare. It has been recorded by Matt Molloy, Dervish, Kevin Burke, Kevin Crawford, and numerous others. Discography Crehan did not record as a featured artist, but did play on individual selections on these recordings: *Ceol an Clair, Vol. I (Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann CL 17) *An Irish Dance Party: The Laichtin Naofa Ceili Band (Dublin Records LP 1007) Trivia Crehan often played in Gleeson's Pub in Coore.

He was also the owner of Curry Mallet in Somerset, under which his Wiltshire manor was held. In the time of Edward the Confessor, Fisherton had been owned by a man named Bondi. The ancient parish of Fisherton Delamere formed a detached part of the Warminster hundred of Wiltshire. It contained two villages, Fisherton itself, to the north of the River Wylye, and Bapton, about a mile away and to the south of the river, and a combined total of 2,834 acres, of which 1,660 were in Fisherton. The civil parish, was extinguished in 1934, when Fisherton was transferred to Wylye, and Bapton to Stockton.A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume IV (1959), p. 361 The former parish was a rough oblong stretching both north and south up into the downland on each side of the river, each slope running down from an altitude of about 600 feet.

Governance Almost all of the present village of Fisherton Delamere is now part of the parish of Wylye. However, as the River Wylye is the parish boundary, Fisherton Mill (lying on the south of the river) is in Stockton.

Life He was born in London on 28 April 1761, and was sent in 1771 to Merchant Taylors' School. There he was beaten for an epigram on Mr. Knox, the third master. At the age of seventeen he was placed with a painter, but he gave up art to become an author and translator. When he was about eighteen he wrote a defence of David Garrick against William Kenrick, earning Garrick's friendship. About two years later he went to Ireland, and during his time in Dublin edited several periodical publications. He attacked the government in the Volunteers' Journal during the administration of the Duke of Rutland, a prosecution was started against him in 1784, and he was obliged to decamp, leaving the printers to face the judgment. The same year (1784) he was associated with Henry Bate Dudley in the Morning Herald. A violent quarrel broke out between them, and Williams wrote a satire on his antagonist, for which he was prosecuted, though the action did not proceed. In 1787 Williams accompanied his friend Pilon to France, and on his return he started a paper called The Brighton Guide. He next settled at Bath, Somerset, but again left in a hurry. For some years he contributed influential theatrical criticism to some of the London newspapers. In 1797 he appeared in the Court of King's Bench as plaintiff in an action against Robert Faulder, the bookseller, for a libel contained in William Gifford's poem The Baviad. In one of the notes Gifford, speaking of Williams, observed that ‚Äòhe was so lost to every sense of decency and shame that his acquaintance was infamy and his touch poison.‚Äô In this cause the plaintiff was nonsuited, based the proof that was given of his having himself grossly libelled every respectable character in the kingdom, from the sovereign down to the lowest of his subjects. Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon, who tried the case, commended Gifford. Williams emigrated to America shortly afterwards, and edited a New York newspaper called The Federalist. He died a poor man of typhus fever in Brooklyn, on 23 November 1818.

Manier and his family found in 1924 near Picture Rocks, Arizona which were initially thought by some to be created by early Mediterranean civilizations that had crossed the Atlantic in the first century, but were later determined to be a hoax. The find consisted of thirty- one lead objects, including crosses, swords, and religious/ceremonial paraphernalia, most of which bore Hebrew or Latin engraved inscriptions, pictures of temples, leaders' portraits, angels, and a dinosaur (inscribed on the lead blade of a sword). One contained the phrase \\"Calalus, the unknown land\\", which was used by believers as the name of the settlement. The objects also have Roman numerals ranging from 790 to 900 inscribed on them, which were sometimes interpreted to represent the date of their creation. The site contains no other artifacts, no pottery sherds, no broken glass, no human or animal remains, and no sign of hearths or housing.Williams, Stephen (1991). Fantastic Archaeology: A Walk on the Wild Side of North American Prehistory. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.Burgess, Don. (Spring 2009) \\"Romans in Tucson? The Story of an Archaeological Hoax.\\" Journal of the Southwest 51. 1. Retrieved February 23, 2013. History On September 13, 1924 Charles Manier and his father stopped to examine some old lime kilns while driving northwest of Tucson on Silverbell Road. Manier saw an object protruding about from the soil. He dug it out, revealing that it was a lead cross measuring and weighing . Between 1924 and 1930 additional objects were extracted from the caliche, a layer of soil in which the soil particles have been cemented together by lime. Caliche often takes a long period of time to form, but it can be made and placed around an article in a short period of time, according to a report written by James Quinlan, a retired Tucson geologist who had worked for the U.S. Geological Survey.Burgess notes that Marshall Payn asked Quinlan to prepare his report for his article: Payn, Marshall. (1996) \\"The Tucson Artifacts: Case Closed.\\" New England Antiquities Research Association Journal 30(3-4): 79-80. Quinlan also concluded that it would be easy to bury articles in the soft, silt material, and associated caliche in the lime kiln where the objects were found at the margin of prior trenches. The objects were believed, by their discoverer and main supporters, to be of a Roman Judeo-Christian colony existing in what is now known as Arizona between 790‚Äì900 AD. No other find has been formally established as placing any Roman colony in the area, nor anywhere else in North America. In November 1924, Manier brought his friend Thomas Bent to the site and Bent was quickly convinced of the authenticity of the discovery. Upon finding the land was not owned, he immediately set up residence there, in order to homestead the property. Bent felt there was money to be made in further excavating the site. =Latin inscriptions= The first object removed from the caliche by Manier was a crudely cast metal cross that weighed ; after cleaning it was revealed to be two separate crosses riveted together. After his find, Manier took the cross to Professor Frank H. Fowler, Head of the Department of Classical Languages of the University of Arizona, at Tucson, who determined the language on the artifacts was Latin. He also translated one line as reading \\"Calalus, the unknown land\\", giving a name for the supposed Latin colony. The Latin inscriptions on the alleged artifacts supposedly record the conflicts of the leaders of Calalus against a barbarian enemy known as the \\"Toltezus\\", which some have interpreted as a supposed reference to the Mesoamerican Toltec civilization. However, the Latin on the artifacts appears to either be badly inflected original Latin, or inscriptions brazenly plagiarized from Classical authors such as Virgil, Cicero, Livy, Cornelius Nepos, and Horace, among several others. This has led many experts to condemn the artifacts as frauds. What is perhaps most suspicious, however, is that most of the inscriptions are identical to what appeared in widely available Latin grammar books, like Harkness's Latin Grammar and Allen and Greenough's Latin Grammar, as well as dictionaries like The Standard Dictionary of Facts. Views on authenticity Manier took the first item to the Arizona State Museum to be studied by archaeologist Karl Ruppert. Ruppert was impressed with the item, and went with Manier to the site the next day where he found a caliche plaque weighing , with inscriptions that included a date of 800 A.D. A total of thirty-one objects were found. Other contemporary scholars including George C. Valliant, a Harvard University archaeologist who visited the University of Arizona in 1928, and Bashford Dean, curator of arms and armor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, thought the articles were fakes. Neil Merton Judd, curator of the National Museum at the Smithsonian Institution, happened to be in Tucson at the time of the discovery of the objects and, after examining them, also thought they were fakes, proposing that they may have been created by \\"some mentally incompetent individual with a flair for old Latin and the wars of antiquity.\\"Gilstrap, Peter. (3/21/1996) 'A Reputation in Ruins' Phoenix New Times. Retrieved February 23, 2013. =Supporters= In the 1960s, Bent wrote a 350-page manuscript entitled \\"The Tucson Artifacts,\\" about the objects, which is unpublished but kept by the Arizona State Museum. Both Manier and Bent were supporters of the objects as a genuine archaeological find. Lara Coleman Ostrander, a Tucson immigrant and high school history teacher studied the historical background of the research, and translated the alleged history of Calalus from the writings on the items. Geologist Clifton J. Sarle worked with Ostrander to present the Tucson Artifacts to the press and the academic profession. Tucson University administrator and director of the Arizona State Museum Dean Byron Cummings led archaeologists at the university to the location where the items were found. He brought ten of the objects to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and showing them at museums and universities on the east coast. Astronomer Andrew E. Douglass, known for his work in dendrochronology also considered the items to be authentic. In 1975, Wake Forest University professor Cyclone Covey re-examined the controversy in his book titled Calalus: A Roman Jewish Colony in America from the Time of Charlemagne Through Alfred the Great. Covey was in direct contact with Thomas Bent by 1970, and planned to carry out excavations at the site in 1972, but was not allowed, due to legal complications preventing Wake Forest University from leading a dig at the site. Covey's book proposes that the objects are from a Jewish settlement, founded by people who came from Rome and settled outside of present-day Tucson around 800 AD. =Skeptics= Professor Frank Fowler originally translated the Latin inscriptions on the first items and found that the inscriptions were from well known classical authors such as Cicero, Virgil and Horace. He researched local Latin texts available in Tucson at the time and found the inscriptions on the lead items to be identical to the texts available. Dean Cumming's student and excavator, Emil Haury, closely examined scratches on the surface of the objects as they were removed from the ground and concluded that they were planted, based partly on a cavity in the ground which was longer than a lead bar removed from it. After Cummings became president of the university, his views changed in an unclear manner, possibly due to Haury's skepticism, or the increasing sentiment that the items were nothing more than a hoax and as university president had to take a different stand on the matter. George M. B. Hawley staunchly opposed Bent's views about the objects. Hawley even accused Ostrander and Sarle as perpetrators of the hoax. =Possible creator= A local news article identified Timot√©o Odohui as the possible creator of the items. Odohui was a young Mexican sculptor who lived near the site in the 1880s. The article mentions his possible connection to the site and his ability to craft lead objects. Bent wrote that a craftsman in the area had recalled the boy, his love for sculpture of soft metals and his collection of books on foreign languages, and told the excavators this.Stevens, Kristina (1990) \\"A Cold Trail,\\" Zocalo Magazine, Tucson. In popular culture H. P. Lovecraft alludes to the Tucson artifacts in \\"The Mound,\\" a short story ghost-written for Zealia Bishop.H. P. Lovecraft. \\"The Mound\\". (Wikisource) Archaeologist and Lovecraft scholar Marc A. Beherec argues that the items influenced some of Lovecraft's other writings.Beherec, Marc A. 2008. \\"H. P.

The Tucson artifacts were featured on The History Channel show America Unearthed in the episode titled \\"The Desert Cross,\\" on February 22, 2013. This episode was criticised for its methodology, its ignorance (or deliberate omission) of the complete text on the crosses, and its conclusions.

Early life and education Henderson was born into a naval family in Falmouth, Cornwall, the son of Commander John Hannam Henderson and Betsy Ann May. He was the nephew of Admiral Sir Reginald Friend Hannam Henderson and Admiral Sir William Hannam Henderson. He had one brother, Lt.-Col. Henry May Henderson, who was killed in action in the First World War. He entered as a naval cadet in 1895. Naval career Henderson was appointed an acting sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy in November 1900, confirmed as such in 1902, and posted to in April that year. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1902, and in November that year was posted to the battleship HMS Venerable, on her first commission, to the Mediterranean Fleet. He took part in the Naval Mission to Greece in 1913.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives He served in World War I as commanding officer of the battleship in 1914 and took part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916.Battle of Jutland In 1917, as a commander involved in anti- submarine warfare, he quietly opposed the Admiralty's official position that the volume of merchant shipping was too great to be protected by warships. Henderson demonstrated that the vast majority of the 2,500 ships completing voyages each week were in fact coastal voyages, and only between 120 and 140 ocean-going. Hankey's biographer Stephen Roskill suggested that Henderson's contribution to the introduction of convoys (in particular to Hankey's memorandum of February 1917) was not acknowledged on paper at the time in order to avoid imperilling the younger officer's career.Grigg 2002, p50-1 After the War he became Chief Staff Officer to the Commander-in-Chief, China Station and then, in 1923, joined the staff of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. Henderson later promoted the Fleet Air Arm and the construction of aircraft carriers. He was given command of the aircraft carrier in 1926 and became Naval Aide-de-Camp to King George V in 1928. He was appointed Rear Admiral commanding aircraft carriers in 1931 and Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy in 1934. As such he played a significant role in all of the major warship procurements for the Royal Navy in the rearmament period running up to the Second World War, in particular the new aircraft carrier, escort and cruiser forces.Brown, D. K. 'Nelson to Vanguard: Warship Development 1923-1945', 2000, p239. He was earmarked for higher command until his early death. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) following the First World War and knighted in the order (KCB) in 1936. He was promoted to full admiral in January 1939, but fell ill and was forced to retire in March 1939. In April 1939, he was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), which, owing to his illness, was accepted by his wife on his behalf at Buckingham Palace.

Charles Leroux Memorial Charles Leroux (born as Joseph Johnson; 31 October 1856 in Waterbury, Connecticut, United States ‚Äì in Reval, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire) was an American balloonist and parachutist. He died on his 239th jump after a water landing in the city bay of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia). A monument to Charles Leroux is located on Pirita road near Maarjam√§e, Tallinn. Biography Charles Leroux was born in the town of Waterbury, Connecticut, United States. He came to Europe in 1889 in order to demonstrate his skill in flying balloons and parachuting from them. He is known to have performed exhibition jumps in Germany (Berlin and Bremen) and Russia (Moscow, St. Petersburg). He was to conclude his European tour in Tallinn. Leroux's parachute jump in Tallinn, initially scheduled for 10 September was postponed for two days on account of high winds. On 12 September (o.s.), however, the weather showed little improvement. Variable winds were accompanied with fine rain every now and then. After an angry argument with his manager Leroux decided to go up. The balloon was inflated with lighting gas supplied by the local gas factory and it took off at 5 PM from a small elevation, a former bastion called Harjum√§gi in the centre of the town. Winds overpowered the balloon at once and quickly drove it towards the Tallinn Bay. Above the last houses of the town the balloonist dropped himself down from the suspended seat and began to descend under a properly inflated canopy. The winds, however, rocked the parachute violently and carried it farther out to sea. About a mile and quarter away from the coast the heavily oscillating parachute dropped into the sea. Leroux made no attempt to unharness himself from the parachute and almost immediately disappeared under water. Some observers thought that they saw him once or twice to rise to the surface. No safety precautions had been taken, and the life-boats that reached the place of disaster ten minutes later found no trace of the balloonist. Two days passed before Leroux's body was recovered by local people. A medical commission came to the conclusion that he had drowned. Charles Leroux was an inventor at heart who did much to improve his balloon and parachute. The performance in Tallinn not only aroused general interest in aviation in Estonia, it also became a kind of milestone for several young men whose dreams and ambitions already moved in the same direction. Estonian sports aviators highly appreciate Leroux for his charismatic role in aeronautics and regard the perpetuation of his memory as a matter of honour. It is rumoured in Estonia that Leroux was the nephew of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. That is not possible because Lincoln's only sister Sarah Lincoln Grigsby died in 1828 and his only brother Thomas Lincoln Jr. in 1812, when 3 days old. He was buried at the Kopli cemetery in Tallinn. The cemetery was completely flattened and destroyed by the Soviet occupation authorities in 1950, governing the country at the time.

Government officials later claimed that the sentence was instead based on alleged violent crimes, specifically rape and extortion; however, no formal charges or evidence of violent crimes have been presented in court.

Nadarkhani was again arrested and beaten on July 22, 2018 and is currently in prison in Iran.  Apostasy Law in Iran  After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iranian Christians were recognized as a \\"protected religious minority\\" and according to the Constitution of Iran possess freedom of religion and even have a Member of Parliament (MP) representing them. However, evangelism and missionary work and converting Muslims to Christianity is prohibited by law. Additionally, Christians and other minority religions are often subject to state-sanctioned discrimination. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, there is officially no crime known as apostasy in the penal code (although there was a law about it prior to 1994). The last known execution for this crime was in 1990. However, despite there being no official civil law of apostasy, judges may still convict a defendant of that crime if they rule based on religious fatwas. As a result, a few people have been convicted of it, but there have been no known executions. In 2011 a man was executed in Ahvaz, Iran for blasphemy and \\"spreading corruption on the earth\\" (Mofsed-Fel- Arz) when he claimed that he was God, and attracting a \\"following\\" around himself. According to the fatwas, for a man, if convicted, the punishment is death by hanging-for a woman, it is life imprisonment. The apostate should be given three chances to repent and convert back to Islam.  Biography  Nadarkhani is from Rasht, Gilan Province, in Iran. He originally had no known religion, however Nadarkhani said that he converted to Christianity as a child having never practised Islam. However, court documents claim that he converted at age 19. Prior to his arrest, he was the pastor of a network of Christian house churches. He is a member of the Protestant evangelical Church of Iran. He is married to Fatemeh Pasandideh, and they have two sons, ages 9 and 7. Initial arrest Nadarkhani was first imprisoned in December 2006, on the charges of apostasy from Islam and evangelism to Muslims. He was released two weeks later, without being charged. In 2009, Nadarkhani discovered a recent change in Iranian educational policy that required all students, including his children, to take a course in Quran study in school. After he heard about this change, he went to the school and protested, based on the fact that the Iranian constitution guarantees the freedom to practice religion. His protest was reported to the police, who arrested him and brought him before a court on 12 October 2009, on charges of protesting. On 18 June 2010 Nadarkhani's wife was arrested and charged with apostasy. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, and placed in prison in Lakan, Iran, which is just south of their hometown of Rasht. She was released in October 2010., after serving four months in prison. Death sentence The charges against Nadarkhani were later changed to apostasy and evangelism, the same charges he was initially arrested under in 2006. On 21‚Äì22 September 2010, Nadarkhani appeared before the 11th Chamber of The Assize Court of the province of Gilan and received a death sentence for the charge of apostasy. Nadarkhani's lawyer, Nasser Sarbaz, claims there were numerous procedural errors during Nadarkhani's trial. After conviction, Nadarkhani was transferred to a prison for political prisoners, and denied all access to his family and attorney. The delivery of Nadarkhani's written verdict was delayed by Iran's security officials. Iranian officials seemed reluctant to execute Nadarkhani, and kept delaying his sentence. They also gave him several opportunities to convert back to Islam. On 13 November 2010, the verdict for the trial of 21‚Äì22 September was finally delivered in writing, indicating that Nadarkhani would be executed by hanging. The sentence was appealed and the 3rd Chamber of the Supreme Court in Qom upheld the conviction and sentence of death. In July 2011 Mr. Nadarkhani's lawyer, Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, a prominent Iranian human rights defender, received the written verdict of the Supreme Court of Iran, dated 12 June 2011, which upholds the death sentence. The Supreme Court decision asked the court in Rasht, which issued the original death sentence, to re-examine some procedural flaws in the case, but ultimately gave the local judges the power to decide whether to release, execute or retry Mr. Nadarkhani in October. The recent written verdict included a provision for annulment should Mr. Nadarkhani recant his faith. he was being kept in a security prison in Lakan. Nadarkhani was acquitted of apostasy at retrial on 8 September 2012. During proceedings, the court found him guilty of evangelizing Muslims and sentenced him to three years in prison, time he has already served. He was released and returned to his family. International response A number of Western organizations and governments have issued statements in support of the release of Nadarkhani. On 29 October 2010, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom asked President Barack Obama to press Iran for Nadarkhani's release. If the execution is carried out, Nadarkhani would be the first Christian executed for religious reasons in Iran in over 20 years. On 28 September 2011 the Commission on International Religious Freedom stated: > Despite the finding that Mr. Nadarkhani did not convert to Christianity as > an adult, the court continues to demand that he recant his faith or > otherwise be executed. The most recent court proceedings are not only a > sham, but are contrary to Iranian law and international human rights > standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political > Rights, to which Iran is a party. President Barack Obama's 30 September 2011 statement read: > The United States condemns the conviction of Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani. > Pastor Nadarkhani has done nothing more than maintain his devout faith, > which is a universal right for all people. That the Iranian authorities > would try to force him to renounce that faith violates the religious values > they claim to defend, crosses all bounds of decency, and breaches Iran's own > international obligations. On 28 September 2011, British Foreign Secretary William Hague issued a statement condemning the imminent execution, stating > I deplore reports that Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, an Iranian Church leader, > could be executed imminently after refusing an order by the Supreme Court of > Iran to recant his faith. This demonstrates the Iranian regime's continued > unwillingness to abide by its constitutional and international obligations > to respect religious freedom. I pay tribute to the courage shown by Pastor > Nadarkhani who has no case to answer and call on the Iranian authorities to > overturn his sentence. Amnesty International designated Nadarkhani a prisoner of conscience and urged his immediate release, stating, \\"It is shocking that the Iranian authorities would even consider killing a man simply for exercising his right to choose a religion other than Islam.\\" Statements of the Iranian government On 1 October 2011 the Iran state media reported that Nadarkhani is facing the death sentence for rape and extortion, not for apostasy and refusing to renounce his religion, as his lawyer, human rights groups and Western news media have reported. They also reported that they had not signed his execution order. Nadarkhani's lawyer said that he believed that Nadarkhani would not be executed. According to the government Fars News Agency in a 30 September story, Gholamali Rezvani, the Gilan Provincial Political/Security Deputy Governor, stated: > Youcef Nadarkhani has security crimes and he had set up a house of > corruption. ... Nobody is executed in our country for choosing a religion, > but he has committed security crimes. He also accused Zionist media for spreading propaganda. In reply, Nadarkhani's lawyer, Mohammad Ali Dadkhah told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran: > If he is under trial in another court on other charges, I am not aware. But > we only defended him against the death sentence in the case of his charge of > apostasy. The charge the court staff announced that I defended during > several different court sessions was apostasy and no other charge. In a ruling from the Iranian Supreme Court, translated into English by the Confederation of Iranian Students, Nadarkhani was sentenced to execution by hanging for, \\"turning his back on Islam\\" and \\"converting Muslims to Christianity.\\" The ruling also alleges that he also participated in Christian worship by holding home church services and baptising himself and others, effectively breaking Islamic Law. There is no mention in the ruling of rape or extortion allegations. Release In early September 2012, Nadarkhani was acquitted of apostasy, sparing him the death penalty. However, he was found guilty of evangelism, but released for having already served his time. Re- arrests Youcef Nadarkhani was taken back into custody on Christmas Day 2012. He was released on 7 January 2013. Iranian state security forces raided Youcef Nadarkhani's home on July 22, 2018. He was beaten, his son was tasered, and Nadarkhani was taken to prison.

Powered by four Wright R-3350 TurboCompound engines, it was built at Lockheed's Burbank, California plant from 1956 to 1958. Design and development Development of the Starliner began when Lockheed designed the L-1449 in response to the Douglas DC-7C Seven Seas.Breffort, Dominique. Lockheed Constellation: from Excalibur to Starliner Civilian and Military Variants. Histoire and Collecions, 2006. p.112 to 117 Powered by four 5500 hp Pratt & Whitney PT2G-3 turboprop engines, the L-1449 would have cruised faster than the DC-7C with comparable range with of fuel in a new wing. Pratt & Whitney dropped the PT2 project in March 1955 due to expected unreliability, high specific fuel consumption and high operating costs, though the T34 military version of the engine powered the Douglas C-133 freighter, which was also plagued with unreliability. The L-1449 would have been about longer than the L-1049 series with a maximum gross takeoff weight (MGTOW) of .Peter J Marson, Peter J. The Lockheed Constellation Series (Air- Britain, 1982); American Aviation 6 Dec 1954, p.29, says the 1449 would be 118.2 ft long while the 1049G was to be 113.6 ft; the 20 Dec issue says the 1449 cabin would be 55 inches longer. The L-1549 replaced the 1449 in early 1955, with an additional stretch and MGTOW of , presumably still with the PT2 turboprops.Aviation Week 4 April 1955 says P&W; dropped the civil PT-2 after Lockheed lengthened the 1449 fuselage by 108 inches; \\"This longer version became the 1559.\\" Lockheed told Trans World Airlines (TWA) on 30 September 1954 the L-1449 would use the same fuselage as the 1049 series;Rummel, Robert W. Howard Hughes and TWA, 1991 Hughes Tool Company ordered 25 in December, though TWA estimated the L-1449 would lose money, even with every seat occupied. When P&W; dropped their engine, Lockheed proposed an L-1549 with Allison turboprops, but TWA and Lockheed agreed on the piston-engine L-1649 instead, and so amended the L-1449 contract. In April 1955 Lockheed told TWA that they wanted to drop the 1649, but Hughes refused to agree. Though the L-1449 and L-1549 were never built, all Constellations from 1954 onwards were strengthened to take the thrust generated by the T34/PT-2 turboprops, which were fitted to several R7V-2 Constellations for the United States Navy (USN). With the abandonment of the L-1549, Lockheed designed a less ambitious upgrade of the Constellation series as the L-1649A Starliner. The new design used the L-1049G fuselage, the new wing and four Wright R-3350 988 TC18-EA-2 turbocompound radial engines, allowing the Starliner to fly nonstop from California to Europe. Lockheed said the new L-1649A would deliver 58 passengers over a range of at , or from Paris to New York City three hours faster than the DC-7C.Flight International 10 June 1955 p.785 In January 1958 Pan American scheduled the DC-7C from Orly to Idlewild in 14 hr 15 min; TWA scheduled the 1649 in 14 hr 50 min. Operational history The L-1649A prototype first flew on October 11, 1956. (The prototype [N1649] was the property of Lockheed until the early 1970s when it was sold in Japan.) Airline service began on June 1, 1957 on a Trans World Airlines (TWA) flight from New York to London and Frankfurt. TWA called their L-1649s \\"Jetstreams\\" and flew them on longer domestic routes and on flights from New York to Europe and beyond. In July 1958 TWA scheduled 60 flights a week from Europe to New York; 30 were L-1649s, including seven nonstops a week from Paris, five from London, four from Frankfurt, two each from Madrid, Lisbon and Geneva, one from Zurich and one from Rome. Three 1649s a week flew the Polar route Europe to California, sometimes nonstop.Breffort, Dominique. Lockheed Constellation: from Excalibur to Starliner Civilian and Military Variants. Histoire and Collecions, 2006. p.117 to p.119 Boeing 707s replaced the last TWA transatlantic passenger L-1649 in October 1961; 707s and Convair 880s displaced them from domestic scheduled flights in December 1962. In the early 1960s Lockheed converted twelve TWA L1649s to freighters that carried cargo across the Atlantic until 1964 and domestically until 1967. Air France bought ten Starliners; they were the only airline to market the aircraft by its name (being called the \\"Super Starliner\\").Aviation Week 26 August 1957 p45 reports that Air France planned to fly a 1649 from Abbeville to Nice along the coast at 1000 ft altitude, having advertised the times it would appear at each point. The 2500-mile flight was to take just over nine hours. Transatlantic flights lasted from August 1957 until September 1960 when the Boeing 707 took over. Starting in April 1958 Air France L-1649s flew from Paris to Anchorage to Tokyo, but they were not allowed to fly to the west coast of the United States. In summer 1959 they scheduled 22 nonstop L-1649s a week from Orly to Idlewild, four of which continued to Mexico City; two weekly L-1649s flew from Orly to Montreal to Chicago Midway and back. The twice-weekly ORY-ANC-TYO flight was scheduled for 30 hr 45 min, compared to 42 hr 20 min for the fastest 1049G via India (and 32 hr 00 min for BOAC's Comet from London to Tokyo via India). Lufthansa Starliner taking off from Manchester Airport in 1961 when operating a freight schedule to New York's Idlewild Airport Lufthansa was the last airline to purchase the Starliner new; their four Starliners were marketed as \\"Super Stars\\" and flew transatlantic routes. Lufthansa's Starliners were delivered nonstop to Hamburg from the Lockheed factory at Burbank. In summer 1959 Lufthansa scheduled nonstops to New York from Frankfurt, D√ºsseldorf and Orly. Lockheed converted two of Lufthansa's Starliners to freighters after the Boeing 707 had replaced them on the transatlantic passenger flights in 1960. Linee Aeree Italiane (LAI) ordered four Starliners, but did not take them up following the merger with Alitalia in October 1957. Alitalia had accepted the DC-7C and had no interest in the Starliners; they were delivered to TWA in 1958. Varig ordered two Starliners, but the order was switched to two L-1049Gs. The DC-7C ended up selling more airframes than the Starliner, which had greater range than its rival but was expensive ($3,000,000 USD) and entered service a year later. In the end, only 44 Starliners were built (including the prototype) compared to 121 DC-7Cs. Alaska Airlines used two Starliners for MATS operations in the 1960s. Others operators used Starliners for charter flights. A small number of Starliners were used as cargo aircraft in Alaska during the 1970s. By the early 1980s, all Starliners ceased commercial operations.

He was known for a spectacular military tactic called \\"Fire Cattle Columns\\". After the kingdom was nearly destroyed under the rule of King Min of Qi, he helped regain its territory and restored the king's son. He later fought the Beidi nomads, either in the far north or in areas in or between the various northern Chinese states. Yan and Qi Conflicts In 314 BC, Zizhi, the Chancellor of Yan Kingdom, rebelled against his king which led to months of internal turmoil within Yan. King Xuan of Qi, desiring to take advantage of Yan's weakened defences, launched a military attack on Ji (near modern Beijing), the capital of Yan. However, the attack was unsuccessful. In 286 BC, King Min of Qi attacked the state of Song and destroyed it, annexing its land into Qi territory. Although successful, the attack incited hostility against Qi from the remaining six kingdoms. King Zhao of Yan used that development to raise a military alliance against Qi. The army of Yan and its allies under the command of Yue Yi managed to inflict a crushing defeat on Qi, captured 70 cities. Only two cities remains in Qi possession, Jimo and Ju. King Min was later killed at Ju. His son Tian Fazhang was crowned by the local people as King Xiang of Qi. Yan army's onslaught led to many of Qi's citizens fleeing. Many of Qi people's chariots were broken due to overuse. However, Tian Dan had reinforced his chariots' axles with metal. Therefore, his family was able to safely escape to Jimo. The Qi citizens in Jimo praised Tian Dan's intelligence and elected Tian Dan as Jimo's military commander after the previous commander was killed in battle. In 279 BC, King Zhao of Yan died. He was succeeded by King Hui of Yan who disliked his military commander Yue Yi. Tian Dan sent his spies to Yan who created and spread rumours about Yue Yi's possible treachery. The rumours successfully misled King Hui who then dismissed Yue Yi and replaced him with Ji Jie. This enraged the Yan army which deeply respected its former commander. =Boosting the morale of Qi troops= It was said that Tian Dan had his spies spread the rumour : \\"If Yan troops cut the noses of Qi prisoners and put them in the first line, Qi troops will be defeated.\\" Yan troops believed the rumour and cut the noses of the Qi prisoners. The Qi army was enraged at this action and in future battles with Yan refused to surrender because they didn't want to be mistreated. Tian Dan's spies spread another rumour: \\"If Yan troops dig up Qi ancestor's graves and dishonour the deceased people, it will be very disheartening.\\" Yan troops again believed the rumour and destroyed Qi graves and burned the dead bodies. The Qi people were again enraged and strongly sought revenge. =The Flaming Oxen= After boosting Qi's morale and weakening the Yan troops, Tian Dan was able to launch a successful counter- attack and retook the lost territory of Qi. This counter-attack was reliant on an unconventional assault which included inducing panic in a herd of oxen, who were then set upon the Yan army. It is described by Sima Qian in the Records of the Grand Historian within his biography of Tian Dan: \\"Tian Dan collected more than one thousand oxen from the people in the city. He had them dressed with red silk, and had multicolour lines, like those of dragons, painted on them. Sharp blades were adjusted to their horns, and reeds dipped in grease, so that their tips could be set aflame, were attached to their tails. Several passages were dug in the city walls, and on one night, the oxen were released, followed by five thousand sturdy men. The oxen, their tails on fire, charged the army of Yan, creating panic. The torches attached to the tails illuminated the night, the troops of Yan saw the lines on their bodies, which looked like dragons, and all those who met their horns were either killed or wounded. Then, the five thousand men, their mouths closed with pieces of wood, attacked them. They were followed by the sound of shouts and drums from the city, and all the old people and children struck metal pots. The noise shook heaven and earth. The soldiers of Yan panicked. They were defeated and repelled, and the people of Qi killed the Yan general, Ji Jie. As the army of Yan was falling back, in disorder and confusion, the soldiers of Qi chased it, and destroyed it as they pushed it northwards. All the cities it went through revolted, and rallied to Tian Dan, whose troops grew larger every day. As he surged from one victory to another, the army of Yan was defeated every day, and finally reached the northern bank of the Yellow River. At this time, more than seventy cities had returned back to Qi.\\" References Category:Zhou dynasty generals Category:3rd-century BC people Category:Qi (state) Category:Generals from Shandong ","title":"Tian Dan"},{"id":"29490375","text":"Benjamin Che Usher (born 3 February 1970) is a former English cricketer.

She is known for films such as Fjols til fjells (1957), Aldri annet enn br√•k (1954), and Ung flukt (1959). Her 1949 film, D√∏den er et kj√¶rtegn (Death is a Caress), is considered to be Norway's first film noir. The last film she directed, Ung Flukt, introduced Liv Ullmann, Norway's most famous actor internationally, to the silver screen. Carlmar came from a poor family in the working class districts of East Oslo. However, she did manage to take dancing classes and made her debut on stage at the age of 15. In the theater she met Otto Carlmar whom she married three years later. From 1936 she worked as an actress in various theatres. Here she met the film director Tancred Ibsen who introduced her to the world of cinema. In 1949 she and her husband started Carlmar Film A/S, and began writing scripts, directing and producing films. They made ten feature films over a ten-year period. After a decade of film-making Carlmar retired as a director. In the last part of her life she accepted only minor acting roles in plays and movies.

Over time, Befimmo has specialised in particular in investing in office buildings mainly located in city centres, notably in Brussels. In 2018, Befimmo's portfolio consisted of around a hundred office buildings, valued at about ‚Ç¨2 billion, more than 65% of which are let long-term to Public Institutions, and almost 73% of which are located in Brussels. Listed on NYSE Euronext Brussels and a member of the BEL 20 index, Befimmo has a market capitalisation currently superior to ‚Ç¨1 billion.  History  On 30 August 1995, ‚ÄúWoluwe Garden D SA‚Äù was founded, a subsidiary of the Bernheim-Comofi group (now AG Real Estate), with the mission of buying and letting buildings. The company was originally devoted mainly to the management of a building named \\"Woluwe Garden D\\", at boulevard de la Woluwe No 24, Zaventem (St Stevens Woluwe). The Bernheim- Comofi group then decided to expand its subsidiary's property portfolio, which was then renamed Befimmo and converted into a Soci√©t√© en Commandite par Actions. On 29 November 1995, Befimmo was approved by the Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission: the first Belgian fixed-capital real-estate investment trust (Sicafi) was introduced on the stock market. In 2012, Befimmo became a Limited Liability Company and by the end of 2014, the Company became a B-REIT.

Biography  Educated with diplomas in psychology and philosophy, Aim√© Michel joined the French Radio BroadcastingRadiodiffusion Fran√ßaise which was later known as RTF and then ORTF in 1944. (He had successfully passed an entrance exam for studio sound engineers in 1943.) In 1946, he worked in the research department, making contact with Pierre Schaeffer (a member of the association \\"Work and Culture\\" (Travail et Culture) in association with Louis Pauwels). In 1958, with the publication of his book about the 1954 wave of UFOs (Myst√©rieux Objets C√©lestes) in France, Michel devised a theory called orthot√©nie with the help of Jacques Bergier on the corner of a restaurant tablecloth.About Flying Saucers - Mysterious Celestial Objects (OMC), Aim√© Michel, coll. Planet Presence, Planet Ed, 1966, p.134 Michel posited so-called \\"alignments\\": Straight lines which corresponded to large circles traced and centered on the earth. Michel claimed that UFO sightings could be concentrated along these grid lines. He proposed, for example, that there was a line known as ‚ÄúBavic‚Äù (for ‚ÄúBayonne - Vichy‚Äù) where, out of nine UFO observations cited in the press on 24 September 1954, six aligned (Bayonne, Lencouacq, Tulle, Ussel, Gelles, Vichy). A member of the editorial board of Lights in the Night (Lumi√®res dans la nuit) since 1969, he wrote numerous articles on UFOs, mysticism, the animal kingdom as well as other topics in various journals.(Arts, Science et Vie, Tout Savoir, Monde et Vie, Encyclop√©die Larousse ¬´ D√©couvrir les Animaux ¬ª in 1971, Plan√®te - apologist for R√©alisme fantastique including other participants Remy Chauvin, Bernard Heuvelmans, Charles No√´l Martin, Jean E.

From September 26 to October 10, 1964, Aim√© Michel also led cultural workshops on the theme of \\"Life in the Sidereal Universe\\" (La vie dans l'Univers sid√©ral), taking place under the auspices of the magazine Planet (Plan√®te) at Cefalu in Sicily. He wrote the television screenplay Myc√®nes Celui qui vient du futur: Myc√®nes, He who comes from the future. His readers generally appreciate his interest in \\"anything that is beyond human\\" and in challenges of the mind. Described as a free spirit by his entourage, Michel had a stated goal to avoid being limited by external constraints. He was a friend of the controversial Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels, and described himself as a \\"pathological\\" rebel.

It was constructed in 1861 by La Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Bienfaisance, originally offering health care to the city's Francophone community. It became popularly known as \\"the French Hospital\\". The hospital closed in closed on October 31, 1949. The building was subsequently rented out for offices. It served as national headquarters of the Knights of Peter Claver organization during 1951 to 1974, when a new, adjacent building was constructed to serve as its headquarters instead. The building was demolished in 1986. The original building was constructed in Greek Revival style in 1861, relatively late for applications of that style. It was further developed around 1883. It was used by the French Benevolent and Mutual Aid Society of New Orleans, as the \\"French Hospital\\", until 1949. Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated U.S. President John F.

Description Trifolium breweri is a mat forming perennial herb that grows upright or decumbent in form, with dense, hairy herbage. The leaves are cauline, each with three obovate leaflets that are generally 5‚Äì20 mm, and can be either entire or serrate. The inflorescence is umbel-like with 5-15 flowers, and is often turned to the side. The flowers are small, bilaterally symmetrical, and range from yellowish white to pink-lavender. Flowers consist of a five lobed, hairy calyx, petals are separate, and the corolla is papilionaceous. The banner petal is lanceolate, wing petals are narrow and oblanceolate to oblong, wing tips and keel tips are obtuse or rounded. They have diadelphous stamens, nine of which are united and one free. After pollination a fruit containing one seed is exserted from corolla.Jepson, W. L. (1993). The Jepson manual: higher plants of California. J. C. Hickman (Ed.). Univ of California Press.

It can also survive in open areas and even roadsides at elevations between 200m-1800m.http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=trbr3 Distribution Trifolium breweri is found in most of Eastern Norway, southern Oregon and California. It grows in the Klamath Range, Cascades Range and Sierra Nevada. Conservation This plant is considered to be secure within its range. Recent Research There was a study done about New World clovers found in mountainous regions done in 2013. Trifolium breweri is mentioned briefly as being basal within the Involucrarium clade with some of the South American species that were studied.Hendy, J. (2013). A Morphological Analysis of the Trifolium Amiable Kunth Species Complex in South America (Doctoral dissertation, Miami University). Another study done on the molecular phylogenetics of the clover genus mentions Trifolium breweri. 218 species of Trifolium were collected and sequenced in California. The results of the study were consistent with a Mediterranean origin of the genus, probably in the Early Miocene. They believe that all of the New World species had a single origin, while the species of sub-Saharan Africa originated from three separate dispersal events.Ellison, N. W., Liston, A., Steiner, J.

The resulting longshore sediment transport shapes the beaches, and may result in beach erosion or accretion. In fluid dynamics, the radiation stress is the depth-integrated ‚Äì and thereafter phase-averaged ‚Äì excess momentum flux caused by the presence of the surface gravity waves, which is exerted on the mean flow. The radiation stresses behave as a second- order tensor. The radiation stress tensor describes the additional forcing due to the presence of the waves, which changes the mean depth-integrated horizontal momentum in the fluid layer. As a result, varying radiation stresses induce changes in the mean surface elevation (wave setup) and the mean flow (wave-induced currents). For the mean energy density in the oscillatory part of the fluid motion, the radiation stress tensor is important for its dynamics, in case of an inhomogeneous mean-flow field. The radiation stress tensor, as well as several of its implications on the physics of surface gravity waves and mean flows, were formulated in a series of papers by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart in 1960‚Äì1964. Radiation stress derives its name from the analogous effect of radiation pressure for electromagnetic radiation. Physical significance The radiation stress ‚Äì mean excess momentum-flux due to the presence of the waves ‚Äì plays an important role in the explanation and modeling of various coastal processes:Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1964,1962).Phillips (1977), pp. 70‚Äì81. * Wave setup and setdown ‚Äì the radiation stress consists in part of a radiation pressure, exerted at the free surface elevation of the mean flow. If the radiation stress varies spatially, as it does in the surf zone where the wave height reduces by wave breaking, this results in changes of the mean surface elevation called wave setup (in case of an increased level) and setdown (for a decreased water level); * Wave- driven current, especially a longshore current in the surf zone ‚Äì for oblique incidence of waves on a beach, the reduction in wave height inside the surf zone (by breaking) introduces a variation of the shear-stress component Sxy of the radiation stress over the width of the surf zone. This provides the forcing of a wave-driven longshore current, which is of importance for sediment transport (longshore drift) and the resulting coastal morphology; * Bound long waves or forced long waves, part of the infragravity waves ‚Äì for wave groups the radiation stress varies along the group. As a result, a non- linear long wave propagates together with the group, at the group velocity of the modulated short waves within the group. While, according to the dispersion relation, a long wave of this length should propagate at its own ‚Äì higher ‚Äì phase velocity. The amplitude of this bound long wave varies with the square of the wave height, and is only significant in shallow water; * Wave‚Äìcurrent interaction ‚Äì in varying mean-flow fields, the energy exchanges between the waves and the mean flow, as well as the mean-flow forcing, can be modeled by means of the radiation stress. Definitions and values derived from linear wave theory =One-dimensional wave propagation= For uni-directional wave propagation ‚Äì say in the x-coordinate direction ‚Äì the component of the radiation stress tensor of dynamical importance is Sxx. It is defined as:Mei (2003), p. 457. :S_{xx} = \\\\overline{ \\\\int_{-h}^\\\\eta \\\\left( p + \\\\rho \\\\tilde{u}^2 \\\\right)\\\\; \\\\text{d}z } - \\\\frac12 \\\\rho g \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right)^2, where p(x,z,t) is the fluid pressure, \\\\tilde{u}(x,z,t) is the horizontal x-component of the oscillatory part of the flow velocity vector, z is the vertical coordinate, t is time, z = ‚àíh(x) is the bed elevation of the fluid layer, and z = Œ∑(x,t) is the surface elevation. Further œÅ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration by gravity, while an overbar denotes phase averaging. The last term on the right-hand side, ¬ΩœÅg(h+')2, is the integral of the hydrostatic pressure over the still-water depth. To lowest (second) order, the radiation stress Sxx for traveling periodic waves can be determined from the properties of surface gravity waves according to Airy wave theory:Mei (2003), p. 97.Phillips (1977), p. 68. :S_{xx} = \\\\left( 2 \\\\frac{c_g}{c_p} - \\\\frac12 \\\\right) E, where cp is the phase speed and cg is the group speed of the waves. Further E is the mean depth-integrated wave energy density (the sum of the kinetic and potential energy) per unit of horizontal area. From the results of Airy wave theory, to second order, the mean energy density E equals:Phillips (1977), p. 39. :E = \\\\frac12 \\\\rho g a^2 = \\\\frac18 \\\\rho g H^2, with a the wave amplitude and H = 2a the wave height. Note this equation is for periodic waves: in random waves the root-mean-square wave height Hrms should be used with Hrms = Hm0 / , where Hm0 is the significant wave height. Then E = œÅgHm02. =Two-dimensional wave propagation= For wave propagation in two horizontal dimensions the radiation stress \\\\mathbf{S} is a second-order tensorLonguet-Higgins & Stewart (1961). with components: :\\\\mathbf{S}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} S_{xx} & S_{xy}  S_{yx} & S_{yy} \\\\end{pmatrix}. With, in a Cartesian coordinate system (x,y,z): : \\\\begin{align} S_{xx} &= \\\\overline{ \\\\int_{-h}^\\\\eta \\\\left( p + \\\\rho \\\\tilde{u}^2 \\\\right)\\\\; \\\\text{d}z } \\\\- \\\\frac12 \\\\rho g \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right)^2,  S_{xy} &= \\\\overline{ \\\\int_{-h}^\\\\eta \\\\left( \\\\rho \\\\tilde{u} \\\\tilde{v} \\\\right)\\\\; \\\\text{d}z } = S_{yx},  S_{yy} &= \\\\overline{ \\\\int_{-h}^\\\\eta \\\\left( p + \\\\rho \\\\tilde{v}^2 \\\\right)\\\\; \\\\text{d}z } \\\\- \\\\frac12 \\\\rho g \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right)^2, \\\\end{align} where \\\\tilde{u} and \\\\tilde{v} are the horizontal x- and y-components of the oscillatory part \\\\tilde{u}(x,y,z,t) of the flow velocity vector. To second order ‚Äì in wave amplitude a ‚Äì the components of the radiation stress tensor for progressive periodic waves are: : \\\\begin{align} S_{xx} &= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{k_x^2}{k^2} \\\\frac{c_g}{c_p} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{c_g}{c_p} - \\\\frac12 \\\\right) \\\\right] E,  S_{xy} &= \\\\left( \\\\frac{k_x k_y}{k^2} \\\\frac{c_g}{c_p} \\\\right) E = S_{yx}, \\\\quad \\\\text{and}  S_{yy} &= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{k_y^2}{k^2} \\\\frac{c_g}{c_p} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{c_g}{c_p} - \\\\frac12 \\\\right) \\\\right] E, \\\\end{align} where kx and ky are the x- and y-components of the wavenumber vector k, with length k = k = and the vector k perpendicular to the wave crests. The phase and group speeds, cp and cg respectively, are the lengths of the phase and group velocity vectors: cp = cp and cg = cg. Dynamical significance The radiation stress tensor is an important quantity in the description of the phase-averaged dynamical interaction between waves and mean flows. Here, the depth-integrated dynamical conservation equations are given, but ‚Äì in order to model three-dimensional mean flows forced, or interacting with, surface waves ‚Äì a three-dimensional description of the radiation stress over the fluid layer is needed. =Mass transport velocity= Propagating waves induce a ‚Äì relatively small ‚Äì mean mass transport in the wave propagation direction, also called the wave (pseudo) momentum. To lowest order, the wave momentum Mw is, per unit of horizontal area:Phillips (1977), p. 40. :\\\\boldsymbol{M}_w = \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{k}}{k} \\\\frac{E}{c_p}, which is exact for progressive waves of permanent form in irrotational flow. Above, cp is the phase speed relative to the mean flow: :c_p = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{k} \\\\qquad \\\\text{with} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma=\\\\omega - \\\\boldsymbol{k}\\\\cdot\\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{v}}, with œÉ the intrinsic angular frequency, as seen by an observer moving with the mean horizontal flow-velocity while œâ is the apparent angular frequency of an observer at rest (with respect to 'Earth'). The difference k‚ãÖ is the Doppler shift.Phillips (1977), pp. 23‚Äì24. The mean horizontal momentum M, also per unit of horizontal area, is the mean value of the integral of momentum over depth: :\\\\boldsymbol{M} = \\\\overline{\\\\int_{-h}^\\\\eta \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{v}\\\\; \\\\text{d}z} = \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right) \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{v}} + \\\\boldsymbol{M}_w, with v(x,y,z,t) the total flow velocity at any point below the free surface z = Œ∑(x,y,t). The mean horizontal momentum M is also the mean of the depth-integrated horizontal mass flux, and consists of two contributions: one by the mean current and the other (Mw) is due to the waves. Now the mass transport velocity is defined as:Mei (2003), p. 453. :\\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} = \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{M}}{\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right)} = \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{v}} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{M}_w}{\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right)}. Observe that first the depth-integrated horizontal momentum is averaged, before the division by the mean water depth (h+') is made. =Mass and momentum conservation= Vector notation The equation of mean mass conservation is, in vector notation:Phillips (1977), pp. 61‚Äì63. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\left[ \\\\rho \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right) \\\\right] + abla \\\\cdot \\\\left[ \\\\rho \\\\left( h + \\\\overline{\\\\eta} \\\\right) \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} \\\\right] = 0, with including the contribution of the wave momentum Mw.

However, the mean energy of the fluctuating motion itself is not conserved, nor is the energy of the mean flow. The mean energy E of the fluctuating motion (the sum of the kinetic and potential energies satisfies:Phillips (1977), pp. 65‚Äì66. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} + \\\\boldsymbol{c}_g \\\\right) E \\\\right] + \\\\mathbf{S}:\\\\left( abla \\\\otimes \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} \\\\right) = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_w \\\\cdot \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} - \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_b \\\\cdot \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} - \\\\varepsilon, where \\":\\" denotes the double- dot product, and Œµ denotes the dissipation of mean mechanical energy (for instance by wave breaking). The term \\\\mathbf{S}:\\\\left( abla \\\\otimes \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{u}} \\\\right) is the exchange of energy with the mean motion, due to wave‚Äìcurrent interaction. The mean horizontal wave-energy transport ( + cg) E consists of two contributions: * E : the transport of wave energy by the mean flow, and * cg E : the mean energy transport by the waves themselves, with the group velocity cg as the wave-energy transport velocity. In a Cartesian coordinate system, the above equation for the mean energy E of the flow fluctuations becomes: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial t} &\\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\overline{u}_x + c_{g,x} \\\\right) E \\\\right] \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\overline{u}_y + c_{g,y} \\\\right) E \\\\right]  &\\\\+ S_{xx} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}_x}{\\\\partial x} \\\\+ S_{xy} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}_y}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}_x}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right) \\\\+ S_{yy} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\overline{u}_y}{\\\\partial y}  &= \\\\left( \\\\tau_{w,x} - \\\\tau_{b,x} \\\\right) \\\\overline{u}_x \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\tau_{w,y} - \\\\tau_{b,y} \\\\right) \\\\overline{u}_y \\\\- \\\\varepsilon. \\\\end{align} So the radiation stress changes the wave energy E only in case of a spatial- inhomogeneous current field (x,y).

Born in the last year of the war, by the late 1880s she became known as the \\"Daughter of the Confederacy\\". Images of her were widely circulated when she was young, helping morale. Later in the 1880s, she appeared with her father on behalf of Confederate veterans' groups. After his death, she and her mother moved in 1891 to New York City, where they both worked as writers. She published a biography and two novels, in addition to numerous articles. Davis died young from infectious disease. Childhood Varina Anne \\"Winnie\\" Davis was born one year before the end of the American Civil War in the White House of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia. She was the second daughter and the sixth child of Varina Banks (Howell) Davis and Jefferson F. Davis. The youngest, she was the only child of the family who was allowed to visit her father in Fort Monroe with her mother during his two years of imprisonment that followed the Civil War. They were eventually given an apartment in the officers' quarters to use. Winnie was home-educated by her parents in her early years. She later accompanied her parents on their numerous journeys. At the age of thirteen, she was sent to the Misses Friedl√§nders School in Karlsruhe, Germany. She studied for five years in the renowned boarding school, in that time acquiring a slight German accent. Later, she studied in Paris for a short while before returning to the United States.Heath Hardage Lee, Winnie Davis: Daughter of the Lost Cause, University of Nebraska Press, Potomac Books: 2014 Daughter of the Confederacy During the 1880s, Winnie lived with her parents at Beauvoir, their Gulf Coast estate near Biloxi, Mississippi. It was bequeathed to Jefferson Davis in 1878 by Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey, a wealthy widow and supporter of the Confederacy. In 1886, Winnie and her aging father visited West Point, Georgia on a tour of the South promoting his books and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. On April 24, 1886, Governor John Brown Gordon called Davis \\"The Daughter of the Confederacy\\". This title stuck, and Winnie became an icon for Confederate veteran groups and an inspiration for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which formed in 1894. Together with her father, she made public appearances and speeches, and acted more and more as his representative. Confederate groups, including women's associations, worked to fund and organize cemeteries, memorialize the war and its soldiers, and honor the \\"Lost Cause\\" of the South.David W. Blight, Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, Cambridge: Belkap Press of Harvard University Press, 2001 In 1888, Winnie published her first book, a monograph of Irish revolutionary Robert Emmet entitled An Irish Knight of the 19th Century. Winnie Davis' 1880s skiff Barbashela, restored 2016 Painting on display at the Jefferson Davis Memorial Historic Site Davis was involved in a few well-known romantic relationships, but she never married. In 1885‚Äì1886, she may have been courted by the noted landscape and portrait artist Verner Moore White, but the relationship supposedly ended when White moved to Europe to further his studies in art. This relationship has never been completely verified.Baker, James Graham; Southwestern Historical Quarterly Vol CXIII; April 2010 In 1887, Davis developed a more serious relationship with Alfred Wilkinson, a successful New York attorney, whom she met while staying with family friends in Syracuse during the late fall of 1886. Her mother met Wilkinson and initially approved the match, but her father disapproved, based on Wilkinson being from the North and his grandfather having been an abolitionist. Davis reconsidered his disapproval after meeting Wilkinson, and the engagement of the couple was announced in 1889. Northern papers publicized it as healing the wounds of the Civil War. However, an outcry against it in the South burdened the romance, for some dreamed that the young Davis would marry a prominent Southerner, preferably a descendant of one of the generals. Jefferson Davis died shortly before the announced wedding date, and mourning custom required postponing the nuptials for a year. During this time, Wilkinson's house burned down. Winnie's mother Varina became opposed to the marriage. Her Southern friends considered the relationship an insult to the Davis legacy. More importantly, her husband had left the widowed Varina in financial difficulties, and she worried that Wilkinson would be unable to support Winnie. This concern was incorrect, but the damage was done. The engagement was ended in October 1890. By 1891, Varina Davis moved with her daughter to New York City, deeming the climate of Mississippi unhealthy. Richmond, Virginia had also offered them a home, but both women realized they needed to work to support themselves financially. The widowed Varina had no pension, nor signing authority with respect to what remained of Davis's estate. Mother and daughter both became correspondents for the New York World, a newspaper owned by Joseph Pulitzer, a good friend of the Davis family who was married to Kate Pulitzer, a distant Davis cousin and friend of Varina's. The Davis women lived in a series of residential hotels, eventually settling at the Gerard Hotel in what is now the theater district. During this time, Davis also wrote for national magazines, such as The Ladies Home Journal. She published two novels: The Veiled Doctor: A Novel (reprinted 2015) and a A Romance of Summer Seas (1898, reprinted 2009). Both books were moderately successful. Death In July 1898, Winnie Davis became deathly ill. She had been soaked in a rainstorm at a Confederate Veterans' Reunion in Atlanta, Georgia, then traveled by train to meet her mother in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island. They vacationed there annually in the summer at the fashionable Rockingham Hotel. Doctors diagnosed Davis with \\"malarial gastritis.\\" She had already suffered for years from gastritis.Jane Turner Censer, Review: Winnie Davis: Daughter of the Lost Cause by Heath Hardage Lee, The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 122, No. 3 (2014), pp. 282-284, via JSTOR; accessed 08 June 2018 (It has been associated with bacterial infection.) Davis suffered for weeks from fever, chills, and loss of appetite. The Rockingham Hotel closed for the season in early September, but the management allowed Davis and her mother to stay on. Davis died there on September 18, 1898. She was 34 years old. Her mother arranged for her daughter to be buried in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery, with military honors because of her service to Confederate veterans' groups. She was next to the graves of her father and brothers, who had been reinterred here. Davis was survived by her mother Varina and by her sister Margaret (Davis) Addison Hayes, then living in Colorado Springs, Colorado with her husband Joel Addison Hayes, and her sister's children. Among their several children was a daughter, Varina Howell Davis Hayes. The youngest Varina later married Gerald Bertram Webb. Among their children was a daughter, Varina Margaret Webb.Photo Record: Four Generations of Davis Women, # 0985.07.00264, American Civil War Museum, 2017; accessed 08 June 2018 Works * * \\"Foreign Education for American Girls\\" (1889), monograph * * A Romance of Summer Seas (1898), novel Biography * Mary Craig Sinclair, The Romance History of Winnie Davis (unpublished) * Heath Hardage Lee, Winnie Davis: Daughter of the Lost Cause, University of Nebraska Press, Potomac Press: 2014 References Sources  * External links * Category:1864 births Category:1898 deaths Category:American columnists Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of Welsh descent Category:Burials at Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia) Category:Deaths from gastritis Category:Jefferson Davis family Category:Writers from Richmond, Virginia Category:American women columnists Category:19th-century American journalists Category:19th-century American women writers Category:Journalists from Mississippi Category:American women novelists Category:19th-century American novelists Category:Journalists from Virginia Category:Novelists from Virginia Category:Lost Cause of the Confederacy Category:Children of national leaders Category:Disease-related deaths in Rhode Island ","title":"Varina Anne Davis"},{"id":"29491261","text":"Arlanda Central Station () or Arlanda C is a railway station on the Arlanda Line serving Stockholm-Arlanda Airport in Sweden.

History Plans for a railway line from the city center of Stockholm to the airport started in the early 1990s. Policy-makers wanted to allow the airport to grow without increasing the road traffic to the airport, and decided to build a railway. The project involved building a branch from the existing East Coast Line from Rosersberg and back at Odensala. Financing was secured by introducing Sweden's first public‚Äìprivate partnership, whereby a private consortium would be granted a 40-year permit to operate the line in exchange for all direct traffic and the right to collect usage fees from other train companies. The contract was won by A-Train in 1994, which started construction in 1995 and completed the line and station in 1999, with Arlanda C itself opening in 2000 on the East Coast Line shortly after the opening of Arlanda North and Arlanda South stations.

That is a basis for some conclusions that Nicholas Zaharia and Nikola Sakat are the same person who is related to Koja Zaharia. Komnen Arianiti of Arianiti family had married the daughter of Nicholas Zaharia Sakati, ruler of Budva. They had three sons (Gjergj, Muzaka, and Vladan), and one daughter who married Pal Dukagjini. In 1396, due to a favorable political situation, Koja Zaharija captured the castle of Dagnum and declared himself a vassal of the Ottomans. In his second marriage Balsha III married Bolja, a daughter of Koja Zaharia, in 1412 or at the beginning of 1413.Albanolo≈°ki institut u Pri≈°tini 1968 p. 125: \\"Poznato je takoƒëe da se Bal≈°a III krajem 1412 ili poƒçetkom 1413 godine o≈æenio u drugom braku ƒáerkom Koe Zaharije\\" In 1415 their only son and the only male descendant of Bal≈°a family died. Koja maintained the control of the region and upon his death, they were passed to his only son Lek√´ Zaharia. According to Marin Barleti, in 1445 during the ceremony of the marriage of Skanderbeg sister Mamica Kastrioti, he had a dispute with Lek√´ Dukagjini. The reason of this dispute was a woman named Irene Dushmani, the heir of Dushmani family. She seemed to prefer Zaharia, while this was not accepted by Dukagjini. A skirmish happened and Lek√´ Dukagjini remained wounded, saved only by the intervention of Vrana Konti. Two years later, in 1447, Lek√´ Zaharia was killed in an ambush and Lek√´ Dukagjini was accused of this murder. Original Venetian documents show that this murder happened in 1444. According to Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno it was Nicholas Dukagjin, Zaharia's vassal, who killed Lek√´ Zaharia in the battle, not Lek√´ as stated by Marin Barleti. Stefano Magno also stated that, before he died, Lek√´ Zaharia expressed the wish that his properties should be handed over to Venetian Republic. Having left no heirs, the fortress of Dagnum was claimed from Skanderbeg in the name of League of Lezh√´, whose Lek√´ Zaharia was a participant.

It was introduced in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) form by the Nobel Prize winner Manfred Eigen in 1971 and subsequently further extended in collaboration with Peter Schuster. It was proposed as a solution to the error threshold problem encountered during modelling of replicative molecules that hypothetically existed on the primordial Earth (see: abiogenesis). As such, it explained how life on Earth could have begun using only relatively short genetic sequences, which in theory were too short to store all essential information. The hypercycle is a special case of the replicator equation. The most important properties of hypercycles are autocatalytic growth competition between cycles, once-for-ever selective behaviour, utilization of small selective advantage, rapid evolvability, increased information capacity, and selection against parasitic branches. The hypercycle is a cycle of connected, self-replicating macromolecules. In the hypercycle, all molecules are linked such that each of them catalyses the creation of its successor, with the last molecule catalysing the first one. In such a manner, the cycle reinforces itself. Furthermore, each molecule is additionally a subject for self- replication. The resultant system is a new level of self-organization that incorporates both cooperation and selfishness. The coexistence of many genetically non-identical molecules makes it possible to maintain a high genetic diversity of the population. This can be a solution to the error threshold problem, which states that, in a system without ideal replication, an excess of mutation events would destroy the ability to carry information and prevent the creation of larger and fitter macromolecules. Moreover, it has been shown that hypercycles could originate naturally and that incorporating new molecules can extend them[source?]. Hypercycles are also subject to evolution and, as such, can undergo a selection process. As a result, not only does the system gain information, but its information content can be improved. From an evolutionary point of view, the hypercycle is an intermediate state of self-organization, but not the final solution. Over the years, the hypercycle theory has experienced many reformulations and methodological approaches. Among them, the most notable are applications of partial differential equations, cellular automata, and stochastic formulations of Eigen's problem. Despite many advantages that the concept of hypercycles presents, there were also some problems regarding the traditional model formulation using ODEs: a vulnerability to parasites and a limited size of stable hypercycles.MC Boerlijst, P Hogeweg (1991) \\"Self-structuring and selection: Spiral Waves as a Substrate for Prebiotic Evolution\\". Conference Paper Artificial Life II In 2012, the first experimental proof for the emergence of a cooperative network among fragments of self-assembling ribozymes was published, demonstrating their advantages over self-replicating cycles. However, even though this experiment proves the existence of cooperation among the recombinase ribozyme subnetworks, this cooperative network does not form a hypercycle per se, so we still lack the experimental demonstration of hypercycles. Model formulation =Model evolution=  * * =Error threshold problem= A presentation of the error threshold problem When a model of replicating molecules was created, it was found that, for effective storage of information, macromolecules on prebiotic Earth could not exceed a certain threshold length. This problem is known as the error threshold problem. It arises because replication is an imperfect process, and during each replication event, there is a risk of incorporating errors into a new sequence, leading to the creation of a quasispecies. In a system that is deprived of high-fidelity replicases and error-correction mechanisms, mutations occur with a high probability. As a consequence, the information stored in a sequence can be lost due to the rapid accumulation of errors, a so-called error catastrophe. Moreover, it was shown that the genome size of any organism is roughly equal to the inverse of mutation rate per site per replication. Therefore, a high mutation rate imposes a serious limitation on the length of the genome. To overcome this problem, a more specialized replication machinery that is able to copy genetic information with higher fidelity is needed. Manfred Eigen suggested that proteins are necessary to accomplish this task. However, to encode a system as complex as a protein, longer nucleotide sequences are needed, which increases the probability of a mutation even more and requires even more complex replication machinery. This vicious circle is known as Eigen's Paradox. According to current estimations, the maximum length of a replicated chain that can be correctly reproduced and maintained in enzyme-free systems is about 100 bases, which is assumed to be insufficient to encode replication machinery. This observation was the motivation for the formulation of the hypercycle theory. =Models= It was suggested that the problem with building and maintaining larger, more complex, and more accurately replicated molecules can be circumvented if several information carriers, each of them storing a small piece of information, are connected such that they only control their own concentration. Studies of the mathematical model describing replicating molecules revealed that to observe a cooperative behaviour among self-replicating molecules, they have to be connected by a positive feedback loop of catalytic actions. This kind of closed network consisting of self-replicating entities connected by a catalytic positive-feedback loop was named an elementary hypercycle. Such a concept, apart from an increased information capacity, has another advantage. Linking self-replication with mutual catalysis can produce nonlinear growth of the system. This, first, makes the system resistant to so-called parasitic branches. Parasitic branches are species coupled to a cycle that do not provide any advantage to the reproduction of a cycle, which, in turn, makes them useless and decreases the selective value of the system. Secondly, it reinforces the self-organization of molecules into the hypercycle, allowing the system to evolve without losing information, which solves the error threshold problem. A hypercycle with translation. Analysis of potential molecules that could form the first hypercycles in nature prompted the idea of coupling an information carrier function with enzymatic properties. At the time of the hypercycle theory formulation, enzymatic properties were attributed only to proteins, while nucleic acids were recognized only as carriers of information. This led to the formulation of a more complex model of a hypercycle with translation. The proposed model consists of a number of nucleotide sequences I (I stands for intermediate) and the same number of polypeptide chains E (E stands for enzyme). Sequences I have a limited chain length and carry the information necessary to build catalytic chains E. The sequence Ii provides the matrix to reproduce itself and a matrix to build the protein Ei. The protein Ei gives the catalytic support to build the next sequence in the cycle, Ii+1. The self-replicating sequences I form a cycle consisting of positive and negative strands that periodically reproduce themselves. Therefore, many cycles of the +/‚àí nucleotide collectives are linked together by the second-order cycle of enzymatic properties of E, forming a catalytic hypercycle. Without the secondary loop provided by catalysis, I chains would compete and select against each other instead of cooperating. The reproduction is possible thanks to translation and polymerization functions encoded in I chains. In his principal work, Manfred Eigen stated that the E coded by the I chain can be a specific polymerase or an enhancer (or a silencer) of a more general polymerase acting in favour of formation of the successor of nucleotide chain I. Later, he indicated that a general polymerase leads to the death of the system. Moreover, the whole cycle must be closed, so that En must catalyse I1 formation for some integer n > 1. =Alternative concepts= During their research, Eigen and Schuster also considered types of protein and nucleotide coupling other than hypercycles. One such alternative was a model with one replicase that performed polymerase functionality and that was a translational product of one of the RNA matrices existing among the quasispecies. This RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalysed the replication of sequences that had specific motifs recognized by this replicase. The other RNA matrices, or just one of their strands, provided translational products which had specific anticodons and were responsible for unique assignment and transportation of amino acids. Another concept devised by Eigen and Schuster was a model in which each RNA template's replication was catalysed by its own translational product; at the same time, this RNA template performed a transport function for one amino acid type. Existence of more than one such RNA template could make translation possible. Nevertheless, in both alternative concepts, the system will not survive due to the internal competition among its constituents. Even if none of the constituents of such a system is selectively favoured, which potentially allows coexistence of all of the coupled molecules, they are not able to coevolve and optimize their properties. In consequence, the system loses its internal stability and cannot live on. The reason for inability to survive is the lack of mutual control of constituent abundances. Mathematical model =Elementary hypercycle= The dynamics of the elementary hypercycle can be modelled using the following differential equation: : \\\\dot{x_i}=x_i \\\\left(k_i+\\\\sum_j k_{i,j} x_j - \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\phi \\\\right) where : \\\\begin{align} x &= \\\\sum_i x_i, k_i &= f_i-d_i. \\\\end{align} In the equation above, xi is the concentration of template Ii; x is the total concentration of all templates; ki is the excess production rate of template Ii, which is a difference between formation fi by self-replication of the template and its degradation di, usually by hydrolysis; ki,j is the production rate of template Ii catalysed by Ij; and œÜ is a dilution flux; which guarantees that the total concentration is constant. Production and degradation rates are expressed in numbers of molecules per time unit at unit concentration (xi = 1). Assuming that at high concentration x the term ki can be neglected, and, moreover, in the hypercycle, a template can be replicated only by itself and the previous member of the cycle, the equation can be simplified to: : \\\\dot{x_i} = x_i \\\\left(k_{i,i-1} x_{i-1}-\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\phi\\\\right) where according to the cyclic properties, it can be assumed that : \\\\begin{align} k_{i,0} &= k_{i,n},  x_0 &= x_n. \\\\end{align} =Hypercycle with translation= A hypercycle with translation consists of polynucleotides Ii (with concentration xi) and polypeptides Ei (with concentration yi). It is assumed that the kinetics of nucleotide synthesis follows a Michaelis‚ÄìMenten-type reaction scheme in which the concentration of complexes cannot be neglected. During replication, molecules form complexes IiEi-1 (occurring with concentration zi). Thus, the total concentration of molecules (xi0 and yi0) will be the sum of free molecules and molecules involved in a complex: : \\\\begin{align} x_i^0 &= x_i+z_{i},  y_i^0 &= y_i+z_{i+1}. \\\\end{align} The dynamics of the hypercycle with translation can be described using a system of differential equations modelling the total number of molecules: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{x}_i^0 &= f_i z_i-\\\\frac{x_i^0}{c_I} \\\\phi_x,  \\\\dot{y}_i^0 &= k_i x_i-\\\\frac{y_i^0}{c_E} \\\\phi_y \\\\end{align} where : \\\\begin{align} c_I &= \\\\sum_i x_i^0,  c_E &= \\\\sum_i y_i^0. \\\\end{align} In the above equations, cE and cI are total concentrations of all polypeptides and all polynucleotides, œÜx and œÜy are dilution fluxes, ki is the production rate of polypeptide Ei translated from the polynucleotide Ii, and fi is the production rate of polynucleotide Ii synthesised by the complex IiEi-1 (through replication and polymerization). Coupling nucleic acids with proteins in such a model of hypercycle with translation demanded the proper model for the origin of translation code as a necessary condition for the origin of hypercycle organization. At the time of hypercycle theory formulation, two models for the origin of translation code were proposed by Crick and his collaborators. These were models stating that the first codons were constructed according to either an RRY or an RNY scheme, in which R stands for the purine base, Y for pyrimidine, and N for any base, with the latter assumed to be more reliable. Nowadays, it is assumed that the hypercycle model could be realized by utilization of ribozymes without the need for a hypercycle with translation, and there are many more theories about the origin of the genetic code. Evolution =Formation of the first hypercycles= Eigen made several assumptions about conditions that led to the formation of the first hypercycles. Some of them were the consequence of the lack of knowledge about ribozymes, which were discovered a few years after the introduction of the hypercycle concept and negated Eigen's assumptions in the strict sense. The primary of them was that the formation of hypercycles had required the availability of both types of chains: nucleic acids forming a quasispecies population and proteins with enzymatic functions. Nowadays, taking into account the knowledge about ribozymes, it may be possible that a hypercycle's members were selected from the quasispecies population and the enzymatic function was performed by RNA. According to the hypercycle theory, the first primitive polymerase emerged precisely from this population. As a consequence, the catalysed replication could exceed the uncatalysed reactions, and the system could grow faster. However, this rapid growth was a threat to the emerging system, as the whole system could lose control over the relative amount of the RNAs with enzymatic function. The system required more reliable control of its constituents‚Äîfor example, by incorporating the coupling of essential RNAs into a positive feedback loop. Without this feedback loop, the replicating system would be lost. These positive feedback loops formed the first hypercycles. In the process described above, the fact that the first hypercycles originated from the quasispecies population (a population of similar sequences) created a significant advantage. One possibility of linking different chains I‚Äîwhich is relatively easy to achieve taking into account the quasispecies properties‚Äîis that the one chain I improves the synthesis of the similar chain I‚Äô. In this way, the existence of similar sequences I originating from the same quasispecies population promotes the creation of the linkage between molecules I and I‚Äô. =Evolutionary dynamics= After formation, a hypercycle reaches either an internal equilibrium or a state with oscillating concentrations of each type of chain I, but with the total concentration of all chains remaining constant. In this way, the system consisting of all chains can be expressed as a single, integrated entity. During the formation of hypercycles, several of them could be present in comparable concentrations, but very soon, a selection of the hypercycle with the highest fitness value will take place. Here, the fitness value expresses the adaptation of the hypercycle to the environment, and the selection based on it is very sharp. After one hypercycle wins the competition, it is very unlikely that another one could take its place, even if the new hypercycle would be more efficient than the winner. Usually, even large fluctuations in the numbers of internal species cannot weaken the hypercycle enough to destroy it. In the case of a hypercycle, we can speak of one-for-ever selection, which is responsible for the existence of a unique translation code and a particular chirality. The above-described idea of a hypercycle's robustness results from an exponential growth of its constituents caused by the catalytic support. However, E√∂rs Szathm√°ry and Irina Gladkih showed that an unconditional coexistence can be obtained even in the case of a non-enzymatic template replication that leads to a subexponential or a parabolic growth. This could be observed during the stages preceding a catalytic replication that are necessary for the formation of hypercycles. The coexistence of various non- enzymatically replicating sequences could help to maintain a sufficient diversity of RNA modules used later to build molecules with catalytic functions. From the mathematical point of view, it is possible to find conditions required for cooperation of several hypercycles. However, in reality, the cooperation of hypercycles would be extremely difficult, because it requires the existence of a complicated multi-step biochemical mechanism or an incorporation of more than two types of molecules. Both conditions seem very improbable; therefore, the existence of coupled hypercycles is assumed impossible in practice. Evolution of a hypercycle ensues from the creation of new components by the mutation of its internal species. Mutations can be incorporated into the hypercycle, enlarging it if, and only if, two requirements are satisfied. First, a new information carrier Inew created by the mutation must be better recognized by one of the hypercycle's members Ii than the chain Ii+1 that was previously recognized by it. Secondly, the new member Inew of the cycle has to better catalyse the formation of the polynucleotide Ii+1 that was previously catalysed by the product of its predecessor Ii. In theory, it is possible to incorporate into the hypercycle mutations that do not satisfy the second condition. They would form parasitic branches that use the system for their own replication but do not contribute to the system as a whole. However, it was noticed that such mutants do not pose a threat to the hypercycle, because other constituents of the hypercycle grow nonlinearly, which prevents the parasitic branches from growing. =Evolutionary dynamics: a mathematical model= According to the definition of a hypercycle, it is a nonlinear, dynamic system, and, in the simplest case, it can be assumed that it grows at a rate determined by a system of quadratic differential equations. Then, the competition between evolving hypercycles can be modelled using the differential equation: : \\\\dot{C_l}=q_l C_l^2-C_l \\\\frac{\\\\phi}{C} where : C = \\\\sum_l C_l. Here, Cl is the total concentration of all polynucleotide chains belonging to a hypercycle Hl, C is the total concentration of polynucleotide chains belonging to all hypercycles, ql is the rate of growth, and œÜ is a dilution flux that guarantees that the total concentration is constant. According to the above model, in the initial phase, when several hypercycles exist, the selection of the hypercycle with the largest ql value takes place. When one hypercycle wins the selection and dominates the population, it is very difficult to replace it, even with a hypercycle with a much higher growth rate q. Compartmentalization and genome integration Hypercycle theory proposed that hypercycles are not the final state of organization, and further development of more complicated systems is possible by enveloping the hypercycle in some kind of membrane. After evolution of compartments, a genome integration of the hypercycle can proceed by linking its members into a single chain, which forms a precursor of a genome. After that, the whole individualized and compartmentalized hypercycle can behave like a simple self-replicating entity. Compartmentalization provides some advantages for a system that has already established a linkage between units. Without compartments, genome integration would boost competition by limiting space and resources. Moreover, adaptive evolution requires the package of transmissible information for advantageous mutations in order not to aid less-efficient copies of the gene. The first advantage is that it maintains a high local concentration of molecules, which helps to locally increase the rate of synthesis. Secondly, it keeps the effect of mutations local, while at the same time affecting the whole compartment. This favours preservation of beneficial mutations, because it prevents them from spreading away. At the same time, harmful mutations cannot pollute the entire system if they are enclosed by the membrane. Instead, only the contaminated compartment is destroyed, without affecting other compartments. In that way, compartmentalization allows for selection for genotypic mutations. Thirdly, membranes protect against environmental factors because they constitute a barrier for high-weight molecules or UV irradiation. Finally, the membrane surface can work as a catalyst. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, there are also potential problems connected to compartmentalized hypercycles. These problems include difficulty in the transport of ingredients in and out, synchronizing the synthesis of new copies of the hypercycle constituents, and division of the growing compartment linked to a packing problem. In the initial works, the compartmentalization was stated as an evolutionary consequence of the hypercyclic organization. Carsten Bresch and coworkers raised an objection that hypercyclic organization is not necessary if compartments are taken into account. They proposed the so-called package model in which one type of a polymerase is sufficient and copies all polynucleotide chains that contain a special recognition motif. However, as pointed out by the authors, such packages are‚Äîcontrary to hypercycles‚Äîvulnerable to deleterious mutations as well as a fluctuation abyss, resulting in packages that lack one of the essential RNA molecules. Eigen and colleagues argued that simple package of genes cannot solve the information integration problem and hypercycles cannot be simply replaced by compartments, but compartments may assist hypercycles. This problem, however, raised more objections, and E√∂rs Szathm√°ry and L√°szl√≥ Demeter reconsidered whether packing hypercycles into compartments is a necessary intermediate stage of the evolution. They invented a stochastic corrector model that assumed that replicative templates compete within compartments, and selective values of these compartments depend on the internal composition of templates. Numerical simulations showed that when stochastic effects are taken into account, compartmentalization is sufficient to integrate information dispersed in competitive replicators without the need for hypercycle organization. Moreover, it was shown that compartmentalized hypercycles are more sensitive to the input of deleterious mutations than a simple package of competing genes. Nevertheless, package models do not solve the error threshold problem that originally motivated the hypercycle. Ribozymes At the time of the hypercycle theory formulation, ribozymes were not known. After the breakthrough of discovering RNA's catalytic properties in 1982, it was realized that RNA had the ability to integrate protein and nucleotide-chain properties into one entity. Ribozymes potentially serving as templates and catalysers of replication can be considered components of quasispecies that can self-organize into a hypercycle without the need to invent a translation process. In 2001, a partial RNA polymerase ribozyme was designed via directed evolution. Nevertheless, it was able to catalyse only a polymerization of a chain having the size of about 14 nucleotides, even though it was 200 nucleotides long. The most up-to-date version of this polymerase was shown in 2013. While it has an ability to catalyse polymerization of longer sequences, even of its own length, it cannot replicate itself due to a lack of sequence generality and its inability to transverse secondary structures of long RNA templates. However, it was recently shown that those limitations could in principle be overcome by the assembly of active polymerase ribozymes from several short RNA strands. In 2014, a cross-chiral RNA polymerase ribozyme was demonstrated. It was hypothesized that it offers a new mode of recognition between an enzyme and substrates, which is based on the shape of the substrate, and allows avoiding the Watson-Crick pairing and, therefore, may provide greater sequence generality. Various other experiments have shown that, besides bearing polymerase properties, ribozymes could have developed other kinds of evolutionarily useful catalytic activity such as synthase, ligase, or aminoacylase activities. Ribozymal aminoacylators and ribozymes with the ability to form peptide bonds might have been crucial to inventing translation. An RNA ligase, in turn, could link various components of quasispecies into one chain, beginning the process of a genome integration. An RNA with a synthase or a synthetase activity could be critical for building compartments and providing building blocks for growing RNA and protein chains as well as other types of molecules. Many examples of this kind of ribozyme are currently known, including a peptidyl transferase ribozyme, a ligase, and a nucleotide synthetase. A transaminoacylator described in 2013 has five nucleotides, which is sufficient for a trans-amino acylation reaction and makes it the smallest ribozyme that has been discovered. It supports a peptidyl-RNA synthesis that could be a precursor for the contemporary process of linking amino acids to tRNA molecules. An RNA ligase's catalytic domain, consisting of 93 nucleotides, proved to be sufficient to catalyse a linking reaction between two RNA chains. Similarly, an acyltransferase ribozyme 82 nucleotides long was sufficient to perform an acyltransfer reaction. Altogether, the results concerning the RNA ligase's catalytic domain and the acyltransferase ribozyme are in agreement with the estimated upper limit of 100 nucleotides set by the error threshold problem. However, it was hypothesized that even if the putative first RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases are estimated to be longer‚Äîthe smallest reported up-to-date RNA-dependent polymerase ribozyme is 165 nucleotides long‚Äîthey did not have to arise in one step. It is more plausible that ligation of smaller RNA chains performed by the first RNA ligases resulted in a longer chain with the desired catalytically active polymerase domain. Forty years after the publication of Manfred Eigen's primary work dedicated to hypercycles, Nilesh Vaidya and colleagues showed experimentally that ribozymes can form catalytic cycles and networks capable of expanding their sizes by incorporating new members. However, this is not a demonstration of a hypercycle in accordance with its definition, but an example of a collectively autocatalytic set. Earlier computer simulations showed that molecular networks can arise, evolve and be resistant to parasitic RNA branches. In their experiments, Vaidya et al. used an Azoarcus group I intron ribozyme that, when fragmented, has an ability to self-assemble by catalysing recombination reactions in an autocatalytic manner. They mutated the three-nucleotide-long sequences responsible for recognition of target sequences on the opposite end of the ribozyme (namely, Internal Guide Sequences or IGSs) as well as these target sequences. Some genotypes could introduce cooperation by recognizing target sequences of the other ribozymes, promoting their covalent binding, while other selfish genotypes were only able to self-assemble. In separation, the selfish subsystem grew faster than the cooperative one. After mixing selfish ribozymes with cooperative ones, the emergence of cooperative behaviour in a merged population was observed, outperforming the self-assembling subsystems. Moreover, the selfish ribozymes were integrated into the network of reactions, supporting its growth. These results were also explained analytically by the ODE model and its analysis. They differ substantially from results obtained in evolutionary dynamics. According to evolutionary dynamics theory, selfish molecules should dominate the system even if the growth rate of the selfish subsystem in isolation is lower than the growth rate of the cooperative system. Moreover, Vaidya et al. proved that, when fragmented into more pieces, ribozymes that are capable of self-assembly can not only still form catalytic cycles but, indeed, favour them. Results obtained from experiments by Vaidya et al. gave a glimpse on how inefficient prebiotic polymerases, capable of synthesizing only short oligomers, could be sufficient at the pre-life stage to spark off life. This could happen because coupling the synthesis of short RNA fragments by the first ribozymal polymerases to a system capable of self- assembly not only enables building longer sequences but also allows exploiting the fitness space more efficiently with the use of the recombination process. Another experiment performed by Hannes Mutschler et al. showed that the RNA polymerase ribozyme, which they described, can be synthesized in situ from the ligation of four smaller fragments, akin to a recombination of Azoarcus ribozyme from four inactive oligonucleotide fragments described earlier. Apart from a substantial contribution of the above experiments to the research on the origin of life, they have not proven the existence of hypercycles experimentally. Related problems and reformulations The hypercycle concept has been continuously studied since its origin. Shortly after Eigen and Schuster published their main work regarding hypercycles, John Maynard Smith raised an objection that the catalytic support for the replication given to other molecules is altruistic. Therefore, it cannot be selected and maintained in a system. He also underlined hypercycle vulnerability to parasites, as they are favoured by selection. Later on, Josef Hofbauer and Karl Sigmund indicated that in reality, a hypercycle can maintain only fewer than five members. In agreement with Eigen and Schuster's principal analysis, they argued that systems with five or more species exhibit limited and unstable cyclic behaviour, because some species can die out due to stochastic events and break the positive feedback loop that sustains the hypercycle. The extinction of the hypercycle then follows. It was also emphasized that a hypercycle size of up to four is too small to maintain the amount of information sufficient to cross the information threshold. Several researchers proposed a solution to these problems by introducing space into the initial model either explicitly or in the form of a spatial segregation within compartments. Bresch et al. proposed a package model as a solution for the parasite problem. Later on, Szathm√°ry and Demeter proposed a stochastic corrector machine model. Both compartmentalized systems proved to be robust against parasites. However, package models do not solve the error threshold problem that originally motivated the idea of the hypercycle. A few years later, Maarten Boerlijst and Paulien Hogeweg, and later Nobuto Takeuchi, studied the replicator equations with the use of partial differential equations and cellular automata models, methods that already proved to be successful in other applications. They demonstrated that spatial self-structuring of the system completely solves the problem of global extinction for large systems and, partially, the problem of parasites. The latter was also analysed by Robert May, who noticed that an emergent rotating spiral wave pattern, which was observed during computational simulations performed on cellular automata, proved to be stable and able to survive the invasion of parasites if they appear at some distance from the wave core. Unfortunately, in this case, rotation decelerates as the number of hypercycle members increases, meaning that selection tends toward decreasing the amount of information stored in the hypercycle. Moreover, there is also a problem with adding new information into the system. In order to be preserved, the new information has to appear near to the core of the spiral wave. However, this would make the system vulnerable to parasites, and, as a consequence, the hypercycle would not be stable. Therefore, stable spiral waves are characterized by once-for-ever selection, which creates the restrictions that, on the one hand, once the information is added to the system, it cannot be easily abandoned; and on the other hand, new information cannot be added. Another model based on cellular automata, taking into account a simpler replicating network of continuously mutating parasites and their interactions with one replicase species, was proposed by Takeuchi and Hogeweg and exhibited an emergent travelling wave pattern. Surprisingly, travelling waves not only proved to be stable against moderately strong parasites, if the parasites' mutation rate is not too high, but the emergent pattern itself was generated as a result of interactions between parasites and replicase species. The same technique was used to model systems that include formation of complexes. Finally, hypercycle simulation extending to three dimensions showed the emergence of the three-dimensional analogue of a spiral wave, namely, the scroll wave.S Altmeyer, C Wilke, T Martinetz (2008) \\"How fast do structures emerge in hypercycle-systems?\\" in Third German Workshop on Artificial Life See also * Chemoton References External links * J.

The first graduating class was summer of 1927. The Principal was Dr. Houston Cole, who later became President of Jacksonville State University. The first student government for the school was organized in 1928. Hiram Darden was the first president. Secretary for that class was Inez Deal. The treasurer was Dan Whitson. Built as a high school for the county, many rural county schools were closed. Due to this school being built, a county wide school busing system was enacted. Students were bused from many miles away in the county to the school. Students came from south, north and west rural sections of the county. Many of them from south Tuscaloosa County were bused across the City of Tuscaloosa to get to County High. During the 1940s, the school building was the high point in local political rallies. Political rallies were held all across the county and only a few days before the election, a big county wide political rally was at County High. The building, with an auditorium and stage, was also used for musical and cultural community performances. This school is where Alabama‚Äôs only woman Governor, Lurleen Burns Wallace, was a student.  Class of 1927  The formal announcement and invitation for the first graduating class at Tuscaloosa County High School states: Class of 1927, Tuscaloosa County High school, commencement exercises, Friday evening May 20 at 8 o‚Äôclock, High school auditorium. The 1927 graduating class members were: L C Bambarger, Vera Bell, Flora Clements, Lois Chism, Lula Christian, Milton Cooper, Sally Curry, Leonora Deason, Annie Belle Doughty, Brucie Lee Doughty, Mae Darden,Pauline Evans, Fred George,Hattie Hassel, Katherine Hardin, Mary Alice Johnson, Newell Shepherd, Leota Shirley, Catherine Thompson, and Chester Utley. Leonora Deason was 1927 class president and was author and composer of words to The Tuscaloosa County High School Alma Mater. = Fred George, Class of 1927 = Always remembering his heritage, Fred George, a 1927 County High graduate, had great interest in talking about and recording our local history. George was special in many ways, including that he was in the first graduating class of Tuscaloosa County High school in 1927. But also he had unrelenting interest in local history, especially early years at County High. Born 1908 in the Coker community, he was the son of Willie Lewis and Alice Bonds George. He grew up in rural west Tuscaloosa County. He attended grade school in the Coker community. After Northport Education Board established and put into service a transporting system to bring students from rural county areas to the County High school, he attended school in Northport. His school graduating year of 1927 was special to him and he never forgot those who were a part of this class. Fred George married September 1934 and had one child. George was employed at Alabama Bindery Company located in the Holt areas for many years before retirement. Mr. George died in 1995.  Class of 1928  The first County High Band first played on March 22, 1928 as was written in The County High News. Cecil Fields, Cornet Elizabeth Adams Dorothy Laycock, Cornet Frances Bell, Clarinet Maureen Palmer, Alto Woodrow Clements, Alto Kelly Bradley, Bass-Horn Ralph Kilgore, Slide-Trombone Roy Caldwell, Snare Drum James Avery Adams, Baritone Jim Caldwell John Anders, Slide-Trombone Unidentified Carolyn Shepard, Clarinet Everett Shepard, Cornet (not pictured is Capt.

Early life McPherson was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to Andrew and Jean McPherson. His father had served as a captain in the Highland Light Infantry during the First World War and was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Order. The younger McPherson was educated at The Glasgow Academy. McPherson's sister, Janet Elizabeth Macgregor, pioneered cervical cancer screening trials in the United Kingdom. Second World War McPherson is notable for being the pilot of Bristol Blenheim bomber N6125 of No. 139 Squadron RAF, which was the first British aircraft to cross the German coast after Britain had declared war on Germany. His mission on 3 September 1939 was to look for potential targets in North Germany and the German fleet on the Schillig Roads near the port of Wilhelmshaven from an altitude of 24,000 feet. He took off from RAF Wyton in cold, cloudy weather and experienced severe icing on the aircraft. Amongst the ships he and his crew observed were the German cruisers Admiral Scheer and Emden. McPherson's grave at the Heverlee Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, Belgium Their sightings were reported upon their return to base as the aircraft wireless transmissions failed. An air raid was then ordered on the ships by fifteen Blenheims from No. 107 Squadron, No. 110 Squadron, and No. 139 Squadron. The weather conditions were very poor when they set off on their bombing mission the next morning. Several bombs did not detonate and four aircraft from No. 107 Squadron were shot down, with two survivors becoming the first Bomber Command airmen to be taken prisoner in the Second World War. An aircraft from No. 110 Squadron was also shot down and crashed into the bow of the cruiser Emden (curiously the pilot killed in the crash was also named Emden). For his role in the action, Flying Officer McPherson was presented with one of the first two Distinguished Flying Crosses of the war by King George VI. McPherson was killed on 12 May 1940 when his Blenheim was shot down by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters near Lanaken, Belgium, while on a mission to bomb armoured columns. This was the same action that earned Donald Garland and Thomas Gray posthumous Victoria Crosses. McPherson is buried at the Heverlee Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery in Leuven, Belgium.

The historians of Alexander the Great state that the Indus parted into two branches at the city of Patala before reaching the sea, and the island thus formed was called Patalene, the district of Patala. Alexander constructed a harbour at Patala. While the Patala was well known to mariners and traders of the Ancient Mediterranean, by the European Middle Ages, mapmakers no longer knew its location. Regio Patalis appeared on late 15th and early 16th century maps and globes in a variety of increasingly erroneous locations, further and further east and south of India. It even appeared on some maps as a promontory of Terra Australis. Some scholars identify Patala with Thatta, a one-time capital of Sindh. But the identity of Patala is much debated among scholars. The Regio Patalis in classical literature Pliny the Elder (Gaius Plinius Secundus, 23-79 AD) referring to ‚Äúthe island of Patale, at the mouth of the Indus‚Äù, wrote in Historia Naturalis: ‚ÄúAlso in India [as well as at Aswan in Egypt] at the well-known port of Patale the sun rises on the right and shadows fall southward‚Äù.‚ÄúIn eadem India Patalis, celeberrimo portu, sol dexter oritur, umbrae in meridiem cadunt‚Äù; Gaius Plinius Secundus, Historia Naturalis, Book II, cap.xii, 25 and cap.lxxv: 184; quoted in John Watson McCrindle, Ancient India as described in Classical Literature, being a Collection of Greek and Latin Texts relating to India, Westminster, Constable, 1901, p.188. The geographer Strabo (c.64 BC‚Äìc.24 AD) had said: ‚ÄúThe Indus falls into the southern sea by two mouths, encompassing the country of Patal√™n√™, which resembles the Delta in Egypt‚Äù.Strabo, Geography, bk.XV, c.13, quoted in McCrindle (1901): 19. He noted: ‚ÄúAll these [nations] were conquered by Alexander, and last of all he reduced Patal√™n√™, which the Indus forms by splitting into two branches‚Ä¶ Patal√™n√™ contains a considerable city, Patala, which gives its name to the island‚Äù.Strabo, Geography, bk.XV, c.33; quoted in McCrindle (1901): 40. Patala on the Waldseem√ºller map The 1507 Martin Waldseem√ºller map shows Patala in this location.The only surviving copy of Waldseemueller‚Äôs 1507 map is now held by the Library of Congress, Washington DC, and a hi-resolution image of it can be found at: https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/exh.html In the late 2nd century BC, Agatharchides of Cnidus recorded merchants from Patala, or as he called it, Potana, coming to the island of Socotra to trade with Alexandrian merchants.Agatharchides of Cnidus, On the Erythraean Sea, translated and edited by Stanley M. Burstein (London, Hakluyt Society, 1989): 169. The 2nd century AD author Dionysios Periegetes said in his Orbis Descriptio: ‚ÄúThis river [the Indus] has two mouths, and dashes against the island enclosed between them, called in the tongue of the natives, Patal√™n√™‚Äù.Dionysios Periegetes, Orbis Descriptio, lines 1080-1165; quoted in McCrindle (1901): 188. Or, as Priscian put it in his popular rendition of Periegetes: ‚Äúthe River Indus... Patalene is girt by its divided waters.‚Äù‚ÄùIndum... Dividua cujus Patalanae cingitur unda‚Äù; Priscianus Caesariensis, Periegesis Prisciani (lines 998-1000), in Habes candide lector in hoc opere Prisciani volumen maius, Venetiis, Boneto Locatello, 1496, p.285. Siltation has caused the Indus to change its course many times since the days of Alexander the Great, and the site of ancient Patala has been subject to much conjecture. Ahmad Hasan Dani, director of the Taxila Institute of Asian Civilisations, Islamabad, concluded: ‚ÄúThere has been a vain attempt to identify the city of Patala. If ‚ÄòPatala‚Äô is not taken as a proper name but only refers to a city, it can be corrected to ‚ÄòPattana‚Äô, that is, [Sanskrit for] a city or port city par excellence, a term applied in a later period to Thatta [onetime capital of Sindh], which is ideally situated in the way the Greek historians describe‚Äù.A.H. Dani and P. Bernard, ‚ÄúAlexander and His Successors in Central Asia‚Äù, in J√°nos Harmatta, B.N. Puri and G.F. Etemadi (editors), History of civilizations of Central Asia (Paris, UNESCO, 1994) II: 85. Herbert Wilhelmy has pointed out that siltation had caused the Indus to change its course many times over the centuries and that in Alexander‚Äôs time it bifurcated at the site of Bahmanabad, 75 kilometres to the north east of Hyderabad, which John Watson McCrindle had considered to occupy the site of ancient Patala: Herbert Wilhelmy, ‚ÄúVerschollene St√§dte im Indusdelta‚Äú, Geographische Zeitschrift, 56: 4 (1968): 256-294, n.b. 258-63; McCrindle (1901): 19, 40, 124, 188; idem, The Invasion of India by Alexander the Great, Westminster, Constable, 1893, pp.356-7. Patala and Patalene on the map by Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, Orbis Veteribus Notus [The World Known to the Ancients], in Complete Body of Ancient Geography, Laurie and Whittle, London, 1795. The eighteenth century French geographer, Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, also identified Thatta with Patala:‚ÄúTatta is not only a town, but also a province of India, according to modern travellers; this town has taken the place of the ancient Patala or Pattala, which formerly gave name to the country included between the mouths of the Indus.‚ÄùJean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, A Geographical Illustration of the Map of India, Translated by William Herbert, London, 1759, p.19; \\"Tatta est non seulement un ville, mais encore une province de l'Inde, selon les voyageurs modernes. La ville ainsi nomm√©e a pris la place de l'ancienne Patala ou Pattala, qui donnoit autrefois le nom √† terrain renferm√© entre les bouches de l‚ÄôIndus.\\" Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville, Eclaircissements g√©ographiques sur la carte de l'Inde, Paris, Imprimerie Royale, 1753, p.39. D'Anville, Orbis Veteribus Notus This opinion was shared by Alexander Burnes, who voyaged up the Indus on a diplomatic mission in 1831-32, and wrote:\\"The antiquity of Tatta is unquestioned. The Pattala of the Greeks has been sought for in this position, and, I believe, with good reason; for the Indus here divides into two great branches; and these are the words of the historian:- ‚ÄòNear Pattala, the river Indus divides itself into two vast branches‚Äô (Arrian, lib.vi). Both Robertson and Vincent appear to have entertained the opinion of its identity with Tatta\\".Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara: Containing the Narrative of a Voyage on the Indus, London, Murray, 1839, Vol.I, p.27. William Robertson, An Historical Disquisition concerning Ancient India, Basel, Tourneisen, 1792, pp.20: ‚ÄúPatala (the modern Tatta)‚Äù; p.40: ‚ÄúPattala (now Tatta).‚Äù William Vincent, The Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients in the Indian Ocean, London, Cadell and Davies, 1807, p.138. ‚ÄúTatta, the P√°ttala of the ancients.‚Äù Cf. M. Nisard, Pomponius M√©la, oeuvres compl√®tes, Paris, Dubochet et Le Chevalier, 1850, p.656: \\"Cette r√©gion [Patal√®ne], qui tirait son nom de Patala, sa principale ville, est comprise aujourd'hui dans ce qu'on appelle le Sindh y, qui avait autrefois pour capitale Tatta, ville de douze √† quinze mille √¢mes, qui occupe l'emplacement de l'antique Patala\\". The reason for Pliny mentioning Patala, or as he called it, Patale, was to indicate that it, like the other places mentioned in the same chapter of his Natural History, particularly Syene (Aswan, in Egypt), was situated on or below the Tropic of Cancer and so shadows there were cast southward in midsummer, thus demonstrating the rotundity of the Earth. Pliny, writing in Latin, used the form, Patale: in accordance with convention, he treats Patala, being for him a Greek-derived noun, as a third declension Latin noun with the genitive form Patalis, as though its nominative case was Patale: hence, Regio Patalis not Regio Patalae.Cf. J. Andr√© et J. Filliozat: ‚ÄúPatale (71) ou Patala (72) transcription de gr. œÑŒ± Œ†Œ±œÑŒ±ŒªŒ± [ta Patala]‚Äù, Pline l‚ÄôAncien: Histoire Naturelle, Texte √âtabli, Traduit et Comment√©, Paris, Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√âditions les Belles Lettres, Livre VI, 1980, p.109. Syene is connected with the measurement of Earth's circumference by Eratosthenes of Cyrene in c.240 BC, although the method traditionally considered a used by Eratosthenes is actually a simplification of another author, Cleomedes, who proposed his readers to imagine to observe the angle of a shadow cast at Alexandria on the day of the summer solstice ‚Äî eighty-three degrees ‚Äî and deducting that from the ninety- degree right angle of the sun over Syene on the same day, from that deducing the acute angle ‚Äî seven degrees ‚Äî at the apex of the segment of the Earth's circumference represented by the known distance from Syene to Alexandria ‚Äî 500 stadia ‚Äî and then multiplying that distance by the value of that angle and dividing it by the 360 degrees of the whole circumference of the Earth: 250,000 stadia (instead of the 252,000 actually measured by Eratosthenes), or 39,690 km, an error of less than one per cent. The Regio Patalis in Renaissance cosmography The map of the world by the French mathematician and cosmographer Oronce Fine published in 1531 shows a large promontory attached to the continent of TERRA AVSTRALIS and extending northward almost to the Tropic of Capricorn: this promontory is named REGIO PATALIS (‚ÄúRegion of Patala‚Äù).Robert J. King, \\"Terra Australis Not Yet Known\\", National Library of Australia, Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, p.82.; A hi-resolution image of Fine‚Äôs 1531 map can be found at: http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/search~S2?/Xd:(crux)&searchscope;=2&SORT;=R&f;=e&f;=f/Xd:(crux)&searchscope;=2&SORT;=R&f;=e&f;=f&SUBKEY;=d%3A(crux)/1,71,71,E/l856~b2431215&FF;=Xd:(crux)&searchscope;=2&SORT;=R&f;=e&f;=f&31,31,,1,0 Fine's TERRA AVSTRALIS with its REGIO PATALIS is apparently drawn from the globe of the German cosmographer Johann Schoener produced in Nuremberg in 1523.Lucien Gallois, Les G√©ographes allemands de la Renaissance (Paris, Leroux, 1890, repr. Amsterdam, Meridian, 1963): 92; Franz von Wieser, Magalh√£es-Strasse und Austral-Continent auf den Globen Johannes Sch√∂ner (Innsbruck, 1881): 65. On this globe the Antarctic continent, called TERRA AVSTRALIS RECENTER INVENTA SED NONDUM PLENE COGNITA (‚ÄúTerra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known‚Äù) also has a large promontory bearing the name REGIO PATALIS.F.C. Wieder (ed.), Monumenta Cartographica (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1925) I: 1-4, ‚ÄúThe Globe of Johannes Sch√∂ner, 1523-1524‚Äù, and Plates 1-3. Schoener developed his globe from the globe made by Martin Behaim in Nuremberg in 1492.George E. Nunn, The Columbus and Magellan Concepts of South American Geography (Glenside, Beans, 1932): 45, 58. On Behaim's globe, India potalis is located south of the Equator on the Hoch India (High India, or India Superior) peninsula, the actual Indochina, on the eastern side of the Sinus Magnus (\\"Great Gulf\\", the Gulf of Thailand).E.G. Ravenstein, Martin Behaim: His Life and His Globe, London, George Philip & Son, 1908, p.95. An inscription on Behaim's globe explains that Hoch India (India Superior ), was situated so far to the South that the Pole Star was no longer visible: ‚Äúbecause this land lies at the antipodes to our land‚Äù.da≈øs macht da≈øs de≈ø≈øelb landt ligt recht fu≈øs gegen fu≈øs gegen un≈øer landt; Ravenstein (1908): 95. Martin Behaim's source of knowledge of India Patalis was the Ymago Mundi of Pierre D'Ailly, a revised edition of earlier standard cosmographical works which d‚ÄôAilly wrote between 1410 and 1419. D‚ÄôAilly wrote: ‚Äúaccording to Pliny we find there to be habitation under the Tropic of Capricorn and beyond. For the island called the Regio Pathalis has a well- known port where the Sun‚Äôs shadow falls southward, therefore the inhabitants always have the Sun to their North‚Ä¶ I say therefore that the southern side of India extends to the Tropic of Capricorn near the region of Pathalis‚Äù.‚Äúsecundum Plinium habitationem esse sub Capricorni tropico & ultra. Nam regio Pathalis insula dicitur habens portum celeberrimum ubi umbre solum in meridie cadunt, ergo habitatores ei habent semper Solem ad Aquilonem.‚Ä¶Dico igitur frons Indie meridianus pellitur ad tropicum Capricorni propter regionem Pathalis (Pierre d‚ÄôAilly, Ymago Mundi, Louvain, 1483, cap.xi, xv). See also Alfred Hiatt, Terra Incognita: Mapping the Antipodes before 1600 (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2008): 182, n.103. In discussing the habitability of lands under the Torrid Zone and Tropic of Capricorn, D'Ailly drew on the Opus Majus, written around the year 1267 English monk and scholar Roger Bacon. With regard to the Regio Patalis, Bacon said: ‚Äúthe southern frontier of India reaches the Tropic of Capricorn near the Region of Patale and the neighbouring lands which are washed by a great arm of the sea flowing from the Ocean‚Äù.The Opus Majus of Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Belle Burke (New York, Russell, 1962) 1: 328. Patala was on or just south of the Tropic of Cancer, not south of the Equator, but somehow Roger Bacon had confused the Tropic of Capricorn with the Tropic of Cancer under which, on the day of the summer solstice, shadows at Patala were cast southward. D‚ÄôAilly's Ymago Mundi served as the standard text book on cosmography during the 15th and early 16th centuries and so made widely current the view that there was a part of India, or of what was later called Indo-China, where the sun's shadow always fell southward at noon: this part was the Region of Patala.Eva G.R. Taylor, review of E. Buron (ed), Ymago Mundi de Pierre d‚ÄôAilly, (Paris, Maisonneuve, 1930), in The Geographical Journal, vol.77, no.3, March 1931, pp.290-2. This theory found expression on Martin Behaim's globe of 1492, where India potalis is located south of the Equator on the Hoch India peninsula on the eastern side of the Sinus Magnus, the actual Indochina.Ravenstein (1908): 95. This concept of the Region of Patala is shown as Patalie regi√£ in the world map included in La Salade, a textbook of the studies necessary for a prince written by Antoine de La Sale and published in 1444.Patalie regi√£, Antoine de La Salle, Mappemonde de la fin du XVe si√©cle. Following Magellan‚Äôs circumnavigation voyage of 1519-1522, Johann Schoener identified South America with the extended India Superior (Indochina) peninsula, and so depicted it on his 1523 globe. He also split the Region of Patala (Regio Patalis) off from this peninsula and transferred it across the ocean to become a promontory of the Terra Australis. In this he was followed by Oronce Fine, whose mappemonde of 1531 shows the large REGIO PATALIS promontory on the continent of TERRA AVSTRALIS.A hi-resolution image of the 1531 Fine‚Äôs map can be found at: http://image.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/ebindshow.pl?doc=crux/a127;seq=7 The REGIO PATALIS is shown on the globe in an armillary clock made by Jean Naze of Lyon in 1560, in a fashion similar to that on Schoener‚Äôs globe of 1523 and on Fine‚Äôs map of 1531.Museumslandschaft Hessen-Kassel, Astronomisch- Physikalisches Kabinett, Inv. Nr. U45. It is also shown on the Nancy Globe, made c.1535.B. F. De Costa, ‚ÄùThe Nancy globe‚Äù, The Magazine of American History, vol. 6, March 1881. pp.183-187. The world maps of the school of cartographers centred in and around the Norman port of Dieppe (the Dieppe Maps, include the Harleian, so-called after its former owner, Edward Harley, made by an unknown cartographer in the mid-1540s, that made by Pierre Desceliers in 1546, and also Guillaume Le Testu‚Äôs Cosmographie Universelle of 1555. On these maps, Fine‚Äôs REGIO PATALIS has evolved into the great promontory of Jave la Grande (Greater Java) which extends, like the Regio Patalis, northward from the Austral continent.The Harleian Mappemonde, British Library, Add. MS 5413; Pierre Desceliers‚Äô 1546 mappemonde is held by the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester; Guillaume Le Testu‚Äôs Cosmographie Universelle, 1555, is held at Vincennes, Biblioth√®que du Service Historique de l‚ÄôArm√©e de Terre, DLZ 14. This development may have been influenced by the phrase used by the Italian traveler Ludovico di Varthema in describing Java which, he said, ‚Äúprope in inmensum patet (extends almost beyond measure)‚Äù.Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, Novus Orbis Regionum, Basel, 1532, Ludovico di Varthema, Itinerario, p.271; cited in Franz von Wieser, Magalh√£es-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Sch√∂ner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert, Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), p.67. Although the word patet (‚Äúextends‚Äù) has no connection with Patala, the superficial resemblance may have misled them. Terra Java in the Vallard Atlas of 1547, another product of the Dieppe school, bears the vestigial toponym patallis inscribed on its west coast.Terra Java in the Vallard Atlas (1547); Image at: http://dpg.lib.berkeley.edu/webdb/dsheh/heh_brf?CallNumber=HM+29&Description;=&page;=1 ‚ÄúPatal(l)is‚Äù is the genitive form of Patala, and therefore simply means ‚Äúof Patala‚Äù without specifying the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of Patala‚Äîregion, land, kingdom, port, or city‚Äîindicating that it is no more than a vestige of the original ‚ÄúRegio Patalis‚Äù. The cosmography of the Dieppe mapmakers, particularly as regards the Austral continent, developed from that of Johann Schoener, through the work of Oronce Fine. Albert Anthiaume wrote in 1911: ‚ÄúWhence had the Norman cartographers drawn the idea of this continent [la Terre Australe]? From the bicordiform [two-heart shaped] mappemonde of Oronce Fine (1531), which he in turn had borrowed from Schoener....Most of the Norman cartographers, and particularly Le Testu, knew the works of Oronce Fine‚Äù.Albert-Marie-Ferdinand Anthiaume, \\"Un pilote et cartographe havrais au XVIe si√®cle: Guillaume Le Testu\\", Bulletin de G√©ographie Historique et Descriptive (Paris), Nos. 1-2, 19111, pp.35-202, n.b. p.176. See also Armand Rainaud, Le Continent Austral: Hypotheses et D√©couvertes, Paris, Colin, 1893, repr. Amsterdam, Meridian Pub. Co., 1965, p.291. In his study of Sch√∂ner's globes, Franz von Wieser, found that the derivation of Fine's mappemonde from them was ‚Äúunmistakeable (unverkennbar)‚Äù.Franz von Wieser, Magalh√£es-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Sch√∂ner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert, Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), p.67. Schoener's idea of the Regio Patalis developed, as explained above, from the earlier globe of Martin Behaim which itself was based on the works of Pierre d‚ÄôAilly, Roger Bacon and Pliny the Elder, and not on the accounts of any voyages to the unknown Austral continent, the Terra Australis Incognita. Jave la Grande on the Dieppe maps, which was derived from the ideas of Johann Schoener, can be seen to be a construct of the cosmographical concepts of the early 16th century and not derived from the discovery of the coasts of Australia made by unknown voyagers of that time.Robert J. King, \\"Regio Patalis: Australia on the map in 1531?\\", The Portolan, issue 82, Winter 2011, pp.8-17. This is seen on Guillaume Le Testu‚Äôs 1556 Cosmographie Universel, 4me projection, where the northward extending promontory of the Terre australle, called Regio Patalis by Sch√∂ner and Fine, is called Grande Jaue. French geographer Numa Broc has noted that the Dieppe cartographers, including Le Testu, replaced the Regio Patalis of Oronce Fine with a Grande Jave, more or less attached to an enormous austral land mass, and that their insistence on speaking of ‚Äúla Grande Jave‚Äù permitted the erection of the hypothesis of a Portuguese or French ‚Äúpre-discovery‚Äù of Australia between 1520 and 1530.Numa Broc, \\"De l‚ÄôAntichtone √† l‚ÄôAntarctique\\", Cartes et figures de la Terre, Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou, 1980, pp.136-49 ; and idem, La G√©ographie de la Renaissance (1420-1620), Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale, 1980, pp.171. Regio Patalis as part of Terra Australis: Abraham Ortelius, Typus Orbis Terrarum, 1564. The Flemish cosmographer and map maker Gerard Mercator produced a map of the world in 1538 which, though modelled on that of Fine of 1531, departed from it by showing Fine's southern continent much smaller, unnamed and bearing the inscription, Terra hic esse certum est sed qu√£tus quibusque limitibus finitas incertum (‚ÄúIt is certain that there is a land here, but its size and the limits of its boundaries are uncertain‚Äù). The outline of Fine's Regio Patalis, though shown as a promontory of this smaller Antarctic continent, is likewise unnamed.Gerard Mercator‚Äôs 1538 map of the world is reproduced in Antoine de Smet and J. van Raemdonck (eds.), Les Spheres Terrestre & C√©leste de G√©rard Mercator, Bruxelles, Editions Culture et Civilisation, 1968. In 1564, Mercator's Flemish contemporary, Abraham Ortelius published a world map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, on which he identified the Regio Patalis with Locach as a northward extension of the Terra Australis: ‚ÄùThis tract is called by some Patalis\\"; and \\"The Region of Locach seems to be placed here by Marco Polo the Venetian\\". The great promontory terminated in the north with New Guinea, \\"recently discovered, so called because its nature and climate do not differ from the African Guinea; apparently this tract was called Terra de Piccinacoli by Andrea Corsali\\".G√ºnter Schilder, Monumenta Cartographica Neerlandica, Alphen aan den Rijn, Uitgevermaatschappij Canaletto, 1986, Vol.2. From that time on, the outline of the Regio Patalis/Jave la Grande/Locach promontory gradually faded from the maps of the world.

Shortly after the First Siege of Kruj√´, Murad II died in Edirne, only to be succeeded by his son Mehmed II. Mehmed always supported more aggressive strategies of conquest which his father had continually rejected. Once in power, Mehmed ordered nearly annual invasions of Albania which often resulted in multiple battles in one year. The first of these expeditions was sent in 1452 under the dual- command of Hamza Pasha and Tahip Pasha, with an army of approximately 25,000 men. This campaign was the first major test for the new Sultan against western Europe and a high point of a diplomatic struggle between the major Mediterranean powers. Albania at the time was suffering a crisis of power as Skanderbeg, the chief of the League of Lezh√´, became a vassal of Alfonso the Magnanimous, the king of Aragon. Worried about another growing adversary in the Venetian Gulf, the Republic of Venice tried to turn Skanderbeg's allies against him in order to weaken Alfonso's influence. Realizing his opportunity, Mehmed ordered an invasion of Albania. Skanderbeg, knowing the impetuous nature of the new Sultan and the effect it would have if his army were not immediately defeated, acted quickly. As soon as the Ottoman army was split into two separate forces, Skanderbeg attacked and defeated both Hamza and Tahip. Tahip was killed in battle whereas Hamza was captured and ransomed for 13,000 ducats along with his staff. Soon thereafter, Skanderbeg cajoled his former Venetian adversaries into easing Albanian-Venetic relations. Albanian relations with the West Alfonso V of Aragon by Juan de Juanes. The siege of Kruj√´ in 1450 resulted in heavy loss for both Murad II and the League of Lezh√´. A large portion of the Albanian land was wasted from the long campaign where the Turkish forces had been stationed for more than half a year. The country was left with few resources to produce crops and a large famine was the result. In 1451, the year after Murad's forces had devastated the country, Mehmed II gained control of the Ottoman Empire after his father's death. Mehmed's great energy was already apparent during the previous years when he had accompanied his father to Albania. Skanderbeg realized that if Mehmed struck now, he would be in great difficulty since he lacked the resources and the support to successfully hold off a large invasion. One of Albania's most powerful princedoms, the Dukagjini, were making open negotiations with the Turks, suggesting that they would become Mehmed's vassals.Frash√´ri p. 308. With an internal conflict, a destroyed economy, and a weakened army, Skanderbeg realized that he needed to make an alliance with a powerful state so that the League would continue its existence. He first approached the Republic of Venice by offering a military alliance and a sort of vassalhood to the Republic of Venice, but the Republic was then enjoying good relations with the Ottomans and thus refused Skanderbeg's offer. Rome offered some monetary help, but Skanderbeg was looking for more. Skanderbeg then turned to Alfonso V of Aragon who then controlled Naples and Sicily. Alfonso wanted to expand his empire from Gibraltar to the Bosphorus. In order to realize his dreams, he would need a bridgehead in the Balkans from where he could march to Constantinople. Alfonso thus took up the offer to establish diplomatic relations with Skanderbeg and his Albanian allies.Frash√´ri p. 309. The process was not without obstacles, however. The Neapolitan nobles distrusted Skanderbeg since the Kastrioti family had previously been allied with Venice. Alfonso himself had been offended when he asked Skanderbeg to attack Venice along with ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and the Albanian refused. Alfonso was also a devout Christian and found it uneasy to ally with Skanderbeg who had previously practiced Islam in the Ottoman court. On the other hand, Skanderbeg had been disillusioned when Alfonso failed to send any troops to Kruj√´ when they were most needed. But things changed once Skanderbeg had thwarted the Ottoman Army. Both Venice and Alfonso grew an interest in expanding their powers in the Adriatic and the Ionian. On 26 March 1451, the Treaty of Gaeta was signed, creating an Albanian-Aragonese alliance. Skanderbeg also sent diplomats to other Italian states. In August 1451, along with Venice he sent messages to Francesco Sforza, then duke of Milan, and Siena to inform them of his victory over the Turks and of the desperate need for supplies to continue combating the Ottoman armies, but no aid was received.Frash√´ri pp. 319‚Äì320. Venice responded that she wished to see the Albanians and the Turks settle for peace, whereas Sforza's response hinged upon the excuse that his state was not financially sound and that his soldiers were not meant to help an Albanian prince. Only Ragusa offered a large amount of ducats.Frash√´ri p. 320. Conflict over control of Albania Mehmed II outside of Constantinople. Skanderbeg's primary reason for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year- old Mehmed II, whose ambition was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain.Freely, John. The Grand Turk: Sultan Mehmet II. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Kruj√´ in 1450. Another factor was that Kruj√´ geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's and it was clear that there would be some sort of clash between the two in Albania, the epicenter of the conflict.Frash√´ri p. 317. Mehmed was one of the first monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control.Hodgkinson p. 124. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.Hodgkinson p. 122. The strength of the Albanian resistance was supposed to be fierce, but Alfonso wanted to see the League become powerful enough to seriously challenge the Ottoman Empire, much unlike the Venetians who were troubled by the growing Albanian state. In May, Alfonso sent two experienced Catalan officers with 200 men and plenty of supplies to Kruj√´ and, on 7 June 1451, he established an alliance with George Arianiti, the most powerful League member from southern Albania.Frash√´ri p. 318. Later that same year, Alfonso created similar alliances with John Musachi, George Stres Balsha, Muzaka Thopia, Peter Himariot, and Simon Zenevishi, all important Albanian nobles allied to Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg was pleased with Alfonso, but dissension in the League over political issues was still present. Paul Dukagjini and Peter Spani remained aligned with Venice and established friendly relations with the Sultan.Frash√´ri p. 319. In 1451, Mehmed was focused on defeating the Karamanids and Mente≈üe in the East, but it was in his intentions to return to Albania. During this brief period of rest, Skanderbeg took up the rebuilding of Kruj√´ and erected a new fortress in Modrica in the Drin Valley near Svetigrad (which had been lost in a 1448 siege) where Turkish forces had previously slipped through unhindered. The fortress was constructed in the heat of summer within a few months when few Turkish posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited.Schmitt p. 280. Meanwhile, the Venetian cities had been trying to antagonize Skanderbeg's allies against him in order to halt Aragonese expansion into the Eastern Mediterranean. In response, Alfonso sent Bernard Vaquer to be the governor of Kruj√´, only to be replaced later by Ramon d'Ortaf√†, whereas the commander of the garrison was Pedro Scuder with 100 men. Alfonso thus became the nominal ruler of Albania, although Skanderbeg's men made up the dominant majority of the anti-Ottoman forces, leaving Skanderbeg in virtual command of Albania.Frash√´ri p. 321. Venice continued its efforts to turn Skanderbeg's allies against Alfonso and Skanderbeg. George Arianiti resisted the Venetian plots and even cut himself off from Albanian politics. Paul Dukagjini, however, prepared for war against Skanderbeg. To the north, Stefan Crnojeviƒá did not keep relations with Alfonso. Instead, he allied himself with Venice which gave him the Flag of St. Marc to bear. Crnojeviƒá thus became a Venetian vassal, who promised to protect Albania Veneta from Serbian and Turkish attacks.Schmitt p. 281. Skanderbeg grew agitated from the Venetian subtleties and threatened a renewed war against Venice under the pretext that the Senate had not been annually paying the 1,400 ducats promised to the Albanian in 1448. He had already moved his men towards Durazzo and Scutari, leaving the Republic with no choice but to ease their secretive diplomacy. War in the East In 1452, Turkish cavalry forces had begun raiding Albanian territories in the East, a common Ottoman tactic to weaken an enemy before beginning a full-scale invasion. On 23 April, Raimon d'Ortaf√†, Alfonso's governor in Albania, feared that the Turkish invasion would force many of the Albanians to turn to Islam and sent letters to Alfonso for aid. Mehmed, believing that the misunderstandings between the Albanian leaders was at its most critical point, ordered a force of 25,000-27,000 inexperienced men. His reasoning was that these could weaken Albanian forces enough so that he could then launch a concerted invasion. The force was under the main command of Tahip Pasha. Tahip would split his forces into two parts, one under his command, and the other under his subordinate, Hamza Pasha.Francione p. 105. Mehmed had been tied up in war in the East so he let Hamza ride back to the West.Schmaus p. 92. =Battle of Modriƒç= Skanderbeg gathered 14,000 menNoli p. 100. and marched against Tahip Pasha's army. Skanderbeg planned to first defeat Hamza and then to move around Tahip and encircle him. Hamza had 10,000-12,000Franco p. 316. men under his personal command and was camped near the new fortress of Modriƒç. Skanderbeg did not give Hamza much time to prepare and, on 21 July, he assaulted immediately. The fierce attack made short work of the Ottoman force, resulting in them fleeing. Much of the force fell on the field and the parts that ran away were pursued. Hamza was captured in the battle as well as his staff. Francesco Sansovino, in Historia universale dell'origine et imperio de'Turchi, states that Hamza, fearing punitive measures, begged for mercy, arguing that he had only fought against Skanderbeg since he had been ordered to. According to Demetrio Franco, one of Skanderbeg's earliest biographers, Skanderbeg responded in such a way that the Ottoman officers began to cry and he offered to have dinner with them. After this, he ordered for his prisoners to be put under guard and to be treated properly. The men were freed in the end, but Hamza and his staff were ransomed for 13,000 ducats. Franco reports that Skanderbeg's magnanimity became known throughout Albania and the Ottoman Empire to the point where many of his men gained much more respect for him as a warrior. Skanderbeg's intention in doing so was to show that he would not take advantage of the unfortunate and that he had enough confidence in his ability to let his enemies fight him again another day.Franco p. 317. =Battle of Me√ßad= Skanderbeg had kept the captured Ottoman foot-soldiers under his control, however. The same day that he defeated Hamza's army he sent several men to Tahip's army (which had moved to the center of Albania) where they displayed the captives along with the captured Ottoman standards in order to demoralize Tahip's army. Tahip was not intimidated and split his forces in two in the plains of Me√ßad, with his elite forces covering his flanks. Skanderbeg, however, had sent Moses of Dibra around Tahip's rear flanks in order to weaken the Ottoman army before launching his main attack. After this was done, Skanderbeg then attacked with his own men. In the heat of the battle, Moses was able to spot out Tahip and after a fierce duel, managed to kill him.Francione p. 106. The Turks were thus left without their commander and they fled. Aftermath The Fall of Constantinople. In the battles of Modrica and Me√ßad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left dead on the battlefield along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortaf√† reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance.Francione p. 107. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation. In order to reduce the risk of Ottoman expeditions prompted by Venice, Skanderbeg took several steps to soften relations with the Republic. In the autumn of 1452, ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá attacked the Venetian city of Cattaro. Skanderbeg sent a troop of men to aid the Venetians to thwart the attack, but Venice, despite thanking the Albanian, still held its animosity towards him. Skanderbeg took another step. He sent an \\"orator\\", Ezop Zguri, to Alfonso in order to ask for military aid and to convince Alfonso to urge for a reconciliation with Venice. The first request could not be fulfilled: Alfonso responded that he had neither the men nor the means to help Skanderbeg. The second request, however, was satisfied and on 5 March 1453, Alfonso sent a letter censuring Venice for not paying its dues to Skanderbeg and also for supporting Skanderbeg's enemies. He thus urged for a peremptory measure to all Albanian-Venetian conflicts. On 22 April 1453, Mehmed sent another expedition to Albania under Ibrahim Pasha, only to be defeated at Pollog with Ibrahim killed in action. The Albanian victory, however, was shadowed by Mehmed's conquest of Constantinople only five weeks after, which deeply troubled the Christian states of Europe. Mehmed, by then called el-FƒÅti·∏• (\\"the Conqueror\\"), turned his attention to finally defeating the Kingdom of Hungary and crossing into Italy.Frash√´ri p. 322. The European powers were locked in internal conflicts: e.g. the war in Lombardy. Skanderbeg believed that the threat of Mehmed launching his withheld European campaigns was at its highest. He sent urgent requests to Venice to prepare for a new Ottoman offensive, thus attempting to develop an Albanian-Venetian alliance. While recognizing the threat and Skanderbeg's sovereignty over Albania, Venice withheld an establishment of an alliance. Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. Albania, Ragusa, Serbia, and Hungary then made a loose anti- Ottoman coalition to halt any future Turkish expansions.

In 1937, the South African Railways placed a single Class 21 steam locomotive with a Texas type wheel arrangement in service, designed as a mixed traffic locomotive suitable for use on light rail. A simultaneously proposed heavier mainline version Class 22 was never built.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1946). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, October 1946. pp. 804-806. Manufacturer The Class 21 2-10-4 Texas type locomotive was designed by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1929 to 1936. It was built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow and delivered in 1937. Only one locomotive was built, numbered 2551. At the time, the design represented the maximum power obtainable from a ten-coupled non- articulated locomotive which was limited to a axle load on rail.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser Characteristics Watson disliked articulated locomotives and his aim was to develop a powerful non-articulated mixed traffic branch line locomotive with an axle load suitable for light rail. To enable it to negotiate tight curves of radius, the third and fourth coupled wheelsets were flangeless. In addition, a total side play of was provided on the leading coupled wheels and spherical bearings were fitted to the leading coupling rods. Its bar frames extended from the front to the hind buffer beams and were stayed by cross stretchers of a light fabricated construction. It used a Watson Standard no. 3B boiler, the same as that used in the Classes 15E, 15F and 23. A.G. Watson The end result could be considered as Watson's answer to the Class GF Garratt locomotive, the two types having very similar axle loads. The Class 21 carried more water than the Garratt and was about heavier with tractive effort, compared to the of the Class GF. Even so, only one Class 21 was produced and the design was not repeated. Watson's design called for cylinders with rotary cam poppet valve gear, but since the locomotive was still under construction when Watson retired, his successor as CME, W.A.J. Day, made use of the opportunity to alter the specifications. Thus, in the year following Watson's departure, the Class 21 locomotive was delivered with Walschaerts valve gear. The cylinders were interchangeable with one another and with those of the Classes 15F and 23, even though the piston stroke of the Class 21 was compared to in respect of the other two classes. On the Class 21, the difference in stroke was made up by providing deep spigots on the cylinder covers. The 2-10-4 Texas type wheel arrangement had not been tried before on the SAR. To distribute the axle loads to within the maximum allowed for branch lines, the ten-coupled arrangement with a four-wheeled trailing bogie was required. To further assist with keeping within the permissible weight limits, the cab was of welded construction and all footplates and running boards were made of duralumin while the axles and crank pins of the coupled wheels were hollow and the connecting rods were of special high tensile steel. The equalised suspension of the engine was arranged in the customary three groups. The leading Bissel bogie and the first two pairs of coupled wheels were equalising in one group, while the remaining three pairs of coupled wheels were equalised with the trailing bogie, on each side (not cross-connected); thus three groups. As is usual, cross equalisation (LHS to RHS) was provided between the leading Bissel bogie and leading coupled wheels. Instead of pins, case-hardened cotters were provided for fulcrums of the bearing spring equalisinging beams. The proportion of balanced reciprocating parts was only 6% which reduced the hammer blow on the rails to per wheel at . The locomotive was noted for its smooth running. Tender The Type FT tender was an unusual type which used six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks and the rest of the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of the engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that if the tender frame could be carried on more points represented by the rigid and Bissel wheels instead of on only two bogie pivot centres, the frame could be made lighter.South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941).

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. pp. VIII, 6a-7a, 20-21, 29, 46. The tender was equipped with a mechanical stoker. The water tank was of welded construction and the coal bunker was of the self- trimming design. Each Bissel truck was compensated with two pairs of rigidly mounted wheels. The eight rigidly mounted wheels were fitted with overhead laminated bearing springs while the spring gear for each pony truck and two adjacent axles were compensated throughout the springing system, constituting two equal groups. Vacuum cylinders mounted on top of the tank actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels. The tender's wheel arrangement did not prove to be very successful and with the exception of the Type JV tender, a similar experimental tender which had been built in the Salt River shops in 1936 during the design phase of the Class 21 as a prototype test-model of the Type FT tender, it was not used again on the SAR. Comparison, in working order, with the Type MR tender showed that the Type FT tender weighed more than the Type MR while it carried the same amount of coal and only more water, the difference representing a weight of . Another characteristic unique to the Type FT tender and its Type JV prototype was their left sides, where both had a space built-in to stow the fire-irons and rakes. The stowage space was open at the top, where the upper sides of both tender types were tied to the top of the coal bunker by four metal straps.Soul of A Railway, System 5, Part 2: O.F.S.

(Accessed on 18 March 2017) The Bissel or pony axle design is commonly used on steam locomotives with a single leading or trailing axle and was later also used on the Class 4E electric and Classes 32-000 and 32-200 diesel-electric locomotives. Service The locomotive began its career on trials at Braamfontein in 1937, working the Rhodesian Mail trains between Randfontein and Mafeking. The Class GM entered service a year later and when it was found that the Garratt outperformed the on this line, no. 2551 was transferred to Pretoria where it spent the rest of its working life on the line between Pretoria and the Eastern Transvaal. Here it took loads exceeding those given to the Class 15CA.Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 22: Braamfontein by Les Pivnic: Braamfontein Yard, Loco, ERS and Old Kazerne Goods Yard, Part 1. Caption 18. (Accessed on 4 May 2017) At the time, it seemed that ten-coupled engines could not be used as general utility types suitable for the rather severe curvature which existed on SAR lines, particularly those with rail of and where the curvature was generally more severe than elsewhere. A ten-coupled locomotive could only have 25% more tractive effort than an eight-coupled engine of similar axle load and with really heavy loads, the Garratt type had definite advantages and was much less severe on the track. During the Second World War, the locomotive was often used to haul long and heavy military trains, troop trains and sometimes Italian prisoners-of-war to the military unit and prisoner-of-war camp at Sonderwater near Cullinan. In the process it was made the official mascot of the oldest military unit in Pretoria, the Pretoria Regiment (Princess Alice's Own). The was the only SAR locomotive to be honoured in this way by the armed forces.The Rayton-Cullinan Railway Line and World War 2, Lieutenant-Colonel J.E. Samuels (SANDF, Ret), Bulletin of the Railway History Group, No. 82, December 2005 The Class 21 was scrapped in 1952 after only 15 years in service. During its time in service, it was equipped with smoke deflectors. Neither the Class 21 nor the aborted Class 22 design was repeated in either its original or modified form, leaving the impression that they represented advanced thinking which appears to have been considered as too far and too fast by Watson's successors. When it was scrapped at the Pretoria shops, its Watson Standard no. 3B boiler was repaired and retained as a spare for use on the other locomotive classes equipped with this boiler model. Its Type FT tender was allocated to Kroonstad Loco as a spare tender for use on Class 15F locomotives, since all the Class 15Fs shedded at Kroonstad at the time were fitted with mechanical stokers. The Type FT could work coupled to these engines because they used the same type of Watson Standard no. 3B boiler and firebox arranged for mechanical firing as the Class 21. The tender was rarely used, if ever, since it had a smaller coal and water capacity than the Type JT tender normally fitted to the Class 15F. The aborted Class 22 A design for a Class 22 steam locomotive, Watson's final design, was submitted at about the same time. The proposed was also to have a 2-10-4 Texas wheel arrangement, but was to have been a heavy mainline version of the Class 21 with an axle load of , the heaviest that current SAR track could bear on its mainline rail. It was to have been a massive machine with larger coupled wheels, a larger grate and the larger Type EW tender which was later to be used with the Class 23 locomotive. If this engine had been built, it may have been one of the world's most outstanding locomotives. The proposed boiler pressure was , a figure never attained on the SAR, and its anticipated tractive effort of at 75% of boiler pressure would have made it capable of handling loads of on the coal run from Witbank to Johannesburg with comparative ease. The design was a compromise between a 2-8-4 passenger class with coupled wheels and a freight locomotive with coupled wheels. At the time, however, the demand for general utility locomotive types was so pronounced that no good argument could be put forward for the introduction of a heavy locomotive dedicated to goods working only. Another factor which acted against the project was the insufficient length of the receiving sidings in the yards which made it doubtful that such a locomotive would have been able to be used to its full capacity. Although the Class 22 was never built, the class number was not used for another steam locomotive type.

The one-room brick schoolhouse was one of three completed in 1839 for the town, and is the only one to survive. It served the town as a district school until 1940. It was acquired in 1950 by the Bell Hill Meetinghouse Association (which also owns the adjacent Bell Hill Meetinghouse), and has been converted into a local history museum. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description The Bell Hill School is a single-story brick structure, measuring about by , resting on a granite foundation. It has a front-facing gable roof with low pitch, covered in asphalt shingles. The cornices are simple wooden boxes, with a piece of ogee moulding on the eave wall. The main (southern) facade has three bays, with a centered doorway flanked by sash windows. The north and west facades have three sash windows each, while the east facade has two windows flanking a chimney. The brick is laid in Flemish bond on two facades and American bond on the other two; it is not clear if the walls were originally built this way or if it was the result of later restoration work.National Register nomination for Bell Hill School; available by request from the National Park Service The interior of the school is divided into a foyer area and the single classroom. The foyer contains a small washbasin, shelf, and towel rack. The walls are finished in plaster above irregularly-sized wainscoting. The western wall of the classroom is covered in fiberboard painted black, which was used as a blackboard. The school in 2014 The building has had only modest alterations. An opening in the western gable is filled with brick; its original decoration is unknown. In 1902 a woodshed and outhouse were attached to the school's north facade; these were removed after the school was closed in 1940, including the restoration of brick in a doorway space that had been opened between the school and that structure. History The Bell Hill School was one of three brick schoolhouses built in Otisfield in 1839. Their designer and builder are unknown. The town reached its height of population in 1840, and declined from 1307 in that year to 488 in 1940. Its other schools were eventually consolidated and adapted for residential use, while the Bell Hill School remained open until 1940. The building was sold by the town to the Bell Hill Meeting House Association in 1955, which oversaw its restoration, and opens it to the public.

It existed until 1912 and was a central institution of the Modern Breakthrough in Danish art. History =Foundation of the new school= From its foundation in 1754, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts exercised a dominating role in the education of artists in Denmark. During the first half of the 19th century, with Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg as the central figure, the institution was the basis of what has become known as the Golden Age of Danish Painting. Another major influence at the academy was professor Niels Laurits H√∏yen who advocated a nationalistic approach to art. Gradually the legacy from Eckersberg, who died in 1854, and H√∏yen's demand for nationalistic art became an obstacle deterring the assimilation of new trends from abroad and creating a vacuum in Danish art which lasted until the early 1880s. Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler was founded in 1882, at the initiative of a group of dissatisfied students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, as a reaction to the outdated teachings at the Academy. Laurits Tuxen became the school's first director and Peder Severin Kr√∏yer one of its teachers. =Zahrtmann's school= Poul C. Christensen: Zahrtmann's Painting School, 1899 In 1884 a preparatory class was added. It was first led by Frans Schwartz but in 1885 Kristian Zahrtmann became the head and under him it developed into an independent department. While Tuxen og Kr√∏yer's teachings were inspired by L√©on Bonnat's school in Paris, where they had both been students, Zahrtmann encouraged his students to study classical art. In spite of this, Zahrtmann's school became even more avant garde and innovative, due to his calls for radical experiments and strong use of colours. Johan Rohde, who had himself attended the school and had been among the original founders, took over after Zahrtmann and led the school until its closure in 1912. Students Zahrtmann's school was of central importance to the group of painters who became known as Fynboerne due to their attachment to the island Funen. His students included Peter Hansen, Fritz Syberg, Poul S. Christiansen, Johannes Larsen and Oluf Hartmann; and modern painters Karl Isakson; Edvard Weie, Harald Giersing and Olaf Rude.

There are no windows in the south and east walls, and a bank of four sash windows in the north wall. The west wall has the main entrance, which is flanked on each side by sash windows, with a third window in the gable. The interior is divided into three sections. The entrance opens into a vestibule area which extends across much of the western facade, with a small storage room on the northwest corner. Most of the building is taken up by the classroom. The classroom has a form of wainscoting using floorboards to a height of about ; the rest of the walls are plastered. A slate blackboard occupies most of the south wall. The room is filled with original desks made of wood and cast iron, with glass ink wells.

Snow is a Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Irvine.http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=4669 Intellectual Contributions Snow's research constitutes one of the most original and groundbreaking bodies of work in the discipline. While it addresses a number of discrete theoretical and empirical problems, it has the common goal of creating general conceptual tools to comprehend the dynamics of everyday social interaction. Snow‚Äôs influence is particularly deep in two areas of the discipline: social movements and social inequality. Perhaps Snow‚Äôs single greatest scholarly achievement is the creation of the ‚Äúframing perspective‚Äù on social movements, which focuses on the negotiable and emergent meanings of social-movement issues, tactics, and participants. Snow‚Äôs approach is more social psychological and agency-centered than competing perspectives. The framing perspective focuses attention on the signifying work or meaning construction engaged in by movement adherents (e.g., leaders, activists, and rank-and-file participants) and other actors (e.g., adversaries, institutional elites, media, counter movements) relevant to the interests of movements and the challenges they mount in pursuit of those interests. Snow's work problematizes the meanings associated with relevant events, activities, places, and actors, suggesting that those meanings are typically contestable and negotiable and thus open to debate and differential interpretation. From this vantage point, mobilizing grievances are seen neither as naturally occurring sentiments nor as arising automatically from specifiable material conditions, but as the result of interactively-based interpretation or signifying work. Snow‚Äôs research on social inequality focuses on the social psychology of extreme poverty and homelessness. In his best-known work in this area, Down on Their Luck (University of California Press 1993, Portuguese translation 1998), Snow and co-author (and former student) Leon Anderson examine the everyday challenges faced by homeless men and women, using data from hundreds of hours of interviews, participant observation, and social service agencies. On this unique and expansive empirical base, Snow and Anderson reveal who the homeless are, how they live, and why they have ended up on the streets. They debunk several popular myths of the homeless with their portrayal of adaptive, resourceful, and pragmatic men and women. Among the book‚Äôs many honors, Down on Their Luck earned a place on a list of the best ethnographies published between 1950 and 2000 by the journal Contemporary Sociology. Honors and awards Snow has received multiple honors and awards for his work. The Society for the Study of Social Problems awarded Snow the Lee Founders Award for his career contributions to the study of social problems in 2008. In 2011, he earned UCI‚Äôs highest campus-level distinction for faculty, Distinguished Professor. In 2012, the UCI Alumni Association granted Snow the Lauds & Laurels Award for Outstanding Faculty Achievement. In 2013, Snow won the McCarthy Award from the Center for the Study of Social Movements at the University of Notre Dame. Education, Teaching, and Service Born in Saginaw Michigan, Snow received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1976. He has taught at Southern Methodist University; University of Texas, Austin; University of Arizona; and since 2001 at the University of California, Irvine. At UC Irvine, Snow has been the co-director for the Center for Citizen Peace Building, which supports research and community-based activities aimed at discouraging conflict and violence. Under his co-direction, the center helped to establish the Olive Tree Initiative. He also supported the launching of a Youth and Gang Violence Intervention Training Program which hosted its inaugural class in March 2012. In addition, he is a member of the UCI Center for Ethnography; Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies; Center for Research on Immigration, Population and Public Policy; and Center for the Study of Democracy.

Built in 1847 to a design by Gridley James Fox Bryant, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It served as a school until 1917, and has housed the city's offices since 1974. Description and history Eastport City Hall is set at the southwest corner of Boynton and High Streets, in a predominantly residential area west of the city's main waterfront area. It is a 2-1/2 story rectangular wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and a brick foundation. Its main entrance is now on the long south side, although it was probably on the eastern street-facing facade when used as a school. The eastern facade now has a windowless first level, and three round-arch sash windows on the second level. The building has wooden quoining blocks at the corners, and bracketed eaves and gables, both markers of the Italianate style. The ground floor, originally a single classroom space, has been divided into offices, while the upstairs, also originally a single classroom, is now used as a meeting space. The building was built in 1846, replacing the Old South School, which had been destroyed by fire. It was one of three works in Eastport commissioned by Boston architect Gridley James Fox Bryant, and is the only one to survive. The building was used as a school until 1917, when a new high school was opened. From 1921 to 1926 the building housed a laundry, and from 1927 to 1937 George Pearse Ennis ran a summer branch of his New York‚Äìbased School of Art in the building. The town then leased the building for a variety of community purposes, and from 1946 to 1951 it was leased by the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Thereafter it was returned to an academic use, housing the high school's industrial arts program. In 1974 the building was adapted for use as a city hall, a role it continues to serve. Most of the building's original interior decorative features were lost when the building was used as a laundry.

KZWF and KZWU were granted construction permits to upgrade, which would allow the stations to be heard in Des Moines. This would bring a 4th country station into the market (behind KJJY, KHKI, and KXIA). Since the CP was awarded, the two stations have been bouncing on and off the air, usually after Special Temporary Authority granted by the Federal Communications Commission expires. The latest STA issued states that KZWF could not remain on the air due to \\"The Potential for Localized Reception Interference,\\" as well as to finish preparations to increase transmitter power.

Then on March 9, 2011, the station launched a rhythmic contemporary format known as \\"HITS 105.9,\\" targeting competitor station KISS 107.5 (KKDM, Des Moines). Since the launch, its playlist has featured more of a Dance/Pop feel as opposed to having a R&B;/Hip-Hop flavor. This move brings the Rhythmic Top 40 format back to Des Moines for the first time since KDRB flipped to adult album alternative in 2005. On March 22, 2011, the call letters changed from KZWF to KZHZ to better reflect the HITS branding. .\\"Hits 105.9 Debuts In Des Moines\\" from All Access (March 10, 2011)\\"HITS 105.9 debuts in Des Moines\\" from Des Moines Register (March 10, 2011) Studios were located in nearby Indianola On August 5, 2011, Connoisseur announced the sale of both KZHZ and KZHC to Iowa State University, which planned to convert the two stations into non-commercial outlets as part of the Iowa Public Radio network.

Built in 1908, it is the only surviving one-room schoolhouse in the rural community. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The Greer's Corner School is located in western Belmont, at the southeast corner of Back Belmont Road and Lincolnville Road, a junction known locally as Greer's Corner. The school is a small single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, wooden clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A small gabled wing, housing privy toilets, projects to the south. The main facade faces west, and has centrally-placed windows on the first floor and in the attic level, with the entrance set to the right, sheltered by a bracketed hood. On the interior, the walls are finished with vertical tongue-and-groove wainscoting, with plaster above and on the ceiling. Original blackboards are located on two walls. The privies are finished entirely in horizontal tongue-and-groove paneling. At the turn of the 20th century, the rural community of Belmont had five school districts, and it was reported in 1907 that the school at Greer's Corner was its oldest. The following year this building was constructed by Edmund Brewster at a cost of about $550. The school was used until 1953, when the town opened a consolidated school on the diagonally opposite corner. The building then housed town offices until the early 1980s. It has since been taken over and restored by the local historical society.

Description and history The former Union School building stands just outside the main downtown area of Searsport, on the east side of Mt. Ephraim Road, about north of its junction with United States Route 1. It is a two-story brick structure with a side gable roof and granite foundation. It is oriented facing south, with a five- bay facade that has a central entrance sheltered by a porch supported by narrow turned columns. Sash windows are set in rectangular openings, with stone sills and lintels, and there is a mansarded gable at the center of the roof above the entrance. The side elevations have fully pedimented and bracketed gables, with round-arch Italianate windows at their centers. These are partially obscured on the street-facing west side by a modern fire escape. The school was completed in 1866, to a design by Portland architect George M. Harding, one of Maine's leading mid-19th-century architects. It is one of eight known school commissions of his, and is of those the best preserved (at least two have been demolished). (Harding is also credited with the design of Union Hall, Searsport's town hall.) The building was used as a school until 1953.

While standardized PXE clients use TFTP to transfer data, non-standardized iPXE client firmware adds the ability to retrieve data through other protocols, including HTTP, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet (AoE), and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). Also, on supported hardware iPXE firmware can use a Wi-Fi link rather than requiring a wired connection. iPXE firmware cannot be considered as a \\"drop-in\\" replacement for PXE firmware. iPXE is the official replacement for gPXE. Any feature present in gPXE is also present in iPXE, and users can seamlessly upgrade from gPXE to iPXE.  PXE implementation  iPXE can be booted by a computer either by replacing (re-flashing) the existing standard PXE ROM on a supported network interface card (NIC), or by booting the NIC's standard PXE ROM and then chainloading into the iPXE binary, thus obtaining its features without the need to re-flash a NIC. PXE firmware embeds its configuration script into the firmware image, thus any changes to the configuration require a NIC to be re-flashed. iPXE implements its own PXE stack either by using the network card driver provided by iPXE, or the standard PXE UNDI driver if iPXE is chainloaded from a standard PXE ROM. Implementing an independent PXE stack allows clients without the standard PXE ROM on their NICs to use an alternative iPXE stack by loading it from an alternative medium.  Boot manager  Although its basic role was to implement a PXE stack, iPXE can be also used as a network boot manager with limited capabilities for menu-based interaction with end users. iPXE can fetch boot files using multiple network protocols, such as TFTP, NFS, HTTP or FTP. iPXE can act as a boot loader for the Linux kernel, with support for multiboot. For other operating systems, for example Windows CE, iPXE chain- loads corresponding Microsoft boot loader. Additionally, iPXE is scriptable and can load COMBOOT and COM32 SYSLINUX extensions, which, for example, allows SYSLINUX-based graphical menu capabilities to be available for network booting.

During the early twentieth-century, the hacienda was known for its productivity of mezcal business until the Mexican agrarian reform and other uprisings caused it dissolution. History It was founded and settled in the valley of Ameca in 1870 by Don Felipe (born 1834), an aristocrat and leader of the municipality of San Mart√≠n de Hidalgo. The hacienda's location was also productive, due to the rich water springs in the western adjacent mountain to which an acequia would bring down water for the irrigation of the huerta containing the \\"arrayan\\", \\"mango\\" and \\"granada\\" trees. The area to the west, a large mountain slope, was already settled and inhabited by the Barbosa family. They too had a chapels, barns, and lands. In 1899, the hacienda was listed as a mezcal factory with Antonia Mijares de Arce as its owner. The hacienda was counted with 147 inhabitants in 1900, 73 were men and 74 were women. By the early 1900s, the hacienda would grow into a community of 147 inhabitants primarily composed of peones, hacendados, and peasants. The residents of the nearby town of San Jer√≥nimo would often visit the Chapel on Sundays, and would pass through the arcaded buildings, portales, which were lined with food stands serving pozole, enchiladas, menudo, and more regionally-typical cuisine. Despite the fame the hacienda garnered (it transported mezcal to aristocrats of Guadalajara and Mexico City), the hacienda fell victim to the Mexican Revolution which left the Hacienda in ruins and with a mere small portion on which to sit on. Today, the hacienda is officially still a community, although inactive. In the 1990s, a municipal plan, was brought into thought: that of relocating the population of San Jer√≥nimo to the hacienda and repopulating and rebuilding the hacienda with a selected townsite. The family of the Hacienda San Jos√© de Miravalle Don Felipe, the aristocrat and leader of San Martin County, was mayor for four terms alternating mandates with his only son-in-law, in acknowledgement for their entrepreneurial achievements and the love people had for both of them. He fathered his only child, Maria Dolores who as a restless and enterprising young lady convinced her beloved father to start with the expansion of one of Don Felipe‚Äôs many production and commercial businesses: agave planting, for which Ma. Dolores took the reins beginning this great legend. The artisanal Tequila of the Hacienda San Jose de Miravalle was produced in extremely small quantities, and became known because of its quality rather than for the amounts that were usually produced, becoming the legend of the greatest tasting ‚Äòvino mezcal-Tequila.‚Äô The ‚ÄòDones‚Äô (Hacienda owners and rich gentlemen of the high society of Mexico between the 1600s and 1800s) indulged their guests with this exclusive elixir, as a special treat, only in the most special occasions. In that time, to transport the Tequila of Hacienda San Jose de Miravalle, wooden cars pulled by six or eight bulls would take almost four days to get to Guadalajara and fifteen full days to arrive to Mexico City in order to provide the ‚ÄòDones‚Äô with one of the best Tequilas Mexico has ever brought to life. By the year 1907, Don Alfredo, the eldest of Dona Maria Dolores‚Äô sons, took charge of the Hacienda San Jose de Miravalle, and under his leadership and hard work, the estate reached its shiniest times by providing for its more than 1,300 economic dependants that inhabited the valley. In the turbulent years that followed the Mexican Revolution (which with a very strong socialist hue claimed ‚Äòland and freedom‚Äô so land workers could own the land they worked on) an unimaginable number of Haciendas were expropriated by the ‚Äòauthorities‚Äô throughout the country, among which Hacienda San Jose de Miravalle was counted, marking with it the abrupt end of all the productive activities that were held in the estate. Almost 100 years later, in 2008, the restart has been marked by the family returns to its roots when glory days of Hacienda San Jose de Miravalle shined farther than what sight could reach from the top of the Hacienda‚Äôs chapel bell-tower.

There are over 500 described species, but there are well over 1000 specimens in collections that have not yet been described. The common name elegant canopy beetles has been used for genus Agra. Beetles of this genus have narrow heads and long, constricted necks. The tarsomeres, or the \\"feet\\" of the beetle, are wide and equipped with pads, allowing the beetle to grip leaves as it moves about and rests on plants. Females have \\"telescopic\\" reproductive organs, which they use to deposit eggs deep in the substrate. Adults of some species are probably predators of other arthropods. Some have also been seen drinking sap and eating pollen. Adult beetles are nocturnal and attracted to lights. They rest on the undersides of leaves with their bodies aligned along the midrib, legs and antennae tucked in. The larvae develop in burrows and under tree bark, and are likely predatory. Adult beetles have anti-predator secretions that are offensive to predators; they have been noted to repel bats.

It was founded by Leopold Samuel to promote a positive image of the Pacific Northwest and to encourage economic growth in the region. The magazine was known for publishing excellent articles by well- known authors and for its many high-quality illustrations. As a result, West Shore became one of the most successful publications in the Pacific Northwest. Its finely executed illustrations showed the scenery, architecture, and commerce of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alaska. Today, West Shore illustrations provide a detailed record of the Pacific Northwest as it existed in the second half of the nineteenth century. Masthead from Vol. 1 History West Shore was founded by Leopold Samuel, a German immigrant who settled in Portland in 1871. Shortly after arriving in Portland, Samuel published an Oregon travel guide. Samuel then compiled and published an illustrated directory for the city of Portland. The directory was modestly successful. After publishing three annual editions of the directory, Samuel decided to begin publishing a monthly literary magazine, West Shore. The first edition of the magazine was published in August 1875.Jette, Melinda, \\"Brick Making, Near Portland, Oregon\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2003. Retrieved June 17, 2016.Tucker, Kathy, \\"News Editorial, A Prosperous Future\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2002. Retrieved June 17, 2016. In the first issue of West Shore, Samuel announced his goal was to create the best literary journal in the Pacific Northwest by securing contributions from the brightest intellects and writers in the region. Samuel followed through on his promise by publishing poetry by Joaquin Miller, essays by historian Frances Fuller Victor, scientific studies by paleontologist Thomas Condon, and history articles by pioneer Lindsay Applegate and former Governor of Oregon Joseph Lane. George H. Himes, secretary of the Oregon Pioneer Association, was a regular contributor to West Shore. Himes was later a founding member of the Oregon Historical Society and served as the society's curator for twenty-five years.Wexler, Geoffrey, \\"George Himes (1844-1940)\\", Oregon Encyclopedia, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, 30 October 2010. The magazine's original format was an eight-page newspaper layout with four columns of text per page. Its illustrations were stock wood cuts purchased from eastern printing companies or from engravers in San Francisco. Nevertheless, the magazine was very successful. In less than two years, West Shore was being sold in thirty-two states, Canada, England, and Scotland. By 1878, the magazine's circulation was 8,160, the largest of any publication in the Pacific Northwest.Cleaver, J. D., \\"L. Samuel and the West Shore: Images of a Changing Pacific Northwest,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, p. 173.\\"The Daily Bee\\", Access Genealogy.com, Columbus, Georgia, 28 October 2010. West Shore illustration of the Tacoma on the Columbia RiverIn September 1878, the magazine was increased from eight to thirty-two pages and high quality lithographic illustrations were introduced. Over the next few years, stock illustrations were phased out and replaced with original illustrations produced by the West Shore staff artists. In 1883, Samuel hired a full-time editor, Henry L. Wells. As editor, Wells increased the magazine's news and information content, focusing on feature story about the Pacific Northwest rather than literary articles. In January 1884, the magazine was increased to forty-eight pages per issue. Three years later, the format was enlarged to match Harper's Magazine and the magazine was expanded to seventy-two pages. In 1888, West Shore changed to a quarto format. In September 1889, Samuel decide to begin publishing West Shore as a weekly magazine. At about this time, noted author and poet Ella Higginson edited a women's department for the magazine. West Shore reached its peak circulation of about 15,000 in 1890. In August of that year, Samuel enlarged the size of the pages. That turned out to be the magazine's last format change. In September, the West Shore Publishing Company was reorganized. Samuel remained president and general manager, but was forced to report to a board of directors made up of Portland area businessmen. Following the reorganization, plans for expanding the publication were announced along with new advertising contests and upcoming special editions. However, the magazine's advertising revenue was insufficient to cover the cost of the high quality illustrations and expensive paper that readers had come to expect from West Shore. As a result, Samuel resigned in February 1891. The new general manager, J. M. Lawrence, announced additional changes, but without Samuel's vision and drive the public quickly lost interest in the magazine. West Shore closed its doors on 2 May 1891.Cleaver, J. D., \\"L. Samuel and the West Shore: Images of a Changing Pacific Northwest,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, p. 216.  Illustrations  West Shore magazine produced many finely executed illustrations of scenery, architecture, and commerce in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alaska.Burdon, Elisabeth, \\"The West Shore Magazine Published in Portland, Oregon 1875-1891\\", oldimprints.com galleries, Portland, Oregon, 2009.Samuel, L., \\"Any Person\\" (advertisement), West Shore, West Shore Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, July 1887, p. 487. However, its original illustrations were limited to small black and white wood engravings. It added lithography in 1878. Color lithography illustrations were introduced in 1886. Finally, the magazine switched to halftone photoengraving just prior to closing in 1891. After the first few years of publication, the magazine began using itinerant artists and engravers to produce local illustrations. In 1881, the magazine hired its first full-time artist, Henry Epting. His first illustrations appeared in the July 1881 issue. Illustrator Junius F. Whiting joined the staff in early 1882, and Albert B. Burr was hired a year later. These excellent artists produced numerous illustrations for each addition of the magazine. In 1883 alone, there were 282 illustrations used in the magazine's twelve regular issues. In 1884, Clarence L. Smith, another excellent artist and lithographer, joined the staff as head of the art department. Two years later, William H. Byrnes replaced Epting, allowing the flow of illustrations to continue without interruption. Samuel also run the West Shore Lithographing and Engraving Company, using the magazine's art staff to produce illustrations for catalogs, maps, portraits, printed labels, and business forms for banks and others commercial enterprises. Samuel regularly advertised this business in issues of West Shore, allowing the magazine illustrations to highlight the quality of the lithography and engraving work his company produced.\\"West Shore Lithographing and Engraving Company\\" (advertisement), West Shore, West Shore Publishing Company, Portland, Oregon, August 1887, p. 572.

Samuel, though not an artist, was also a founding member of the club. West Shore announced the formation of the new art club in its February 1886 edition. Other members of the Portland Art Club who contributed works to West Shore included Cleveland S. Rockwell, James E. Stuart, Charles Clyde Benton Cooke, Edward Lincoln Espey, and Grafton Tyler Brown.Cleaver, J. D., \\"L.

Over the years, the illustrations originally published in West Shore have been reproduced in a wide variety of books and articles. Today, the magazine's illustrations provide a detailed record of the Pacific Northwest as it existed in the second half of the nineteenth century. The original prints also retain value as artwork and are sold in many antique print galleries, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.West Shore images, Lewis and Clark College Digital Collection, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon, 1 November 2010.

The club was established 10 May 1893 as Berliner Fu√üball Club Minerva taking its name from the Roman goddess of wisdom. A merger with Wilmersdorfer FC Fr√ºhling in 1896 led to the club taking on the name Sport-Club Minerva 93 Berlin. __TOC__ History =Foundation to WWII= In 1900, the team played a single season as part of the Freie Berliner Fu√üballvereinigung (FBF), one of several early competing top-tier leagues in Berlin. They were joined in 1904 by Berolina Moabit ‚Äì also part of the FBF in 1900 ‚Äì and Saxonia Berlin, and returned to the top-flight that season in the Berliner Meisterschaft (I). Minerva remained a first division club for most for the next 50 years. After being relegated in 1906, the team re-appeared in the Berliner Meisterschaft in 1908. A unified Berlin-Brandenberg first division began play with the 1911‚Äì12 season and Minerva enjoyed their best finish to date with a 3rd-place result in the league's Staffel B. Over the next dozen years they were generally a lower to mid-table side, repeating their 3rd place showing in 1915 and earning a second-place finish in 1921, before being sent down after a 10th-place result in 1924. Minerva was much improved on their return to the Berlin-Brandenberg Oberliga (I) in 1926. They won a number of top three finishes over the next ten years. This included a first-place finish in the Oberliga Staffel A in 1932, followed by the team's only appearance in the national playoffs where they were put out in an eighth- final match by Bayern Munich. =Play during the Third Reich= Germany football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into 16 regional top- flight divisions. Minerva became part of the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) and returned to the role of a middling side. A second-place finish in 1936 was immediately followed by a 9th-place result and relegation. The team immediately bounced back by capturing the Bezirksliga Berlin (II) and spent the next six seasons in Gauliga play before again being relegated in 1944. By this time, World War II had overtaken the country and football became more local in character due to the danger and expense of travel. Manpower shortages led to wartime mergers between clubs known as Kriegsspielgemeinshaft; Minerva joined Spandauer SV to play the incomplete 1944‚Äì45 season as KSG Minerva 93/SSV Berlin. =Postwar play= Following the war, occupying Allied forces disbanded most organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of denazification. Football clubs were soon reformed and the former membership was reorganized as SG Tiergarten which played in the postwar Stadtliga Berlin, Staffel C in 1945‚Äì47. As SG Tiergarten-Minerva the team was part of the Landesliga Berlin in 1947‚Äì48 where they finished atop Staffel A and moved on to the restored Oberliga Berlin (I) to play a single season that ended in relegation. Now playing again as SC Minerva 93 Berlin, they won another second division title in the Amateurliga Berlin and returned to the Oberliga for another 8 seasons. Their best results were second-place finishes in 1954 and 1956. At the end of the 1950s, Minerva slipped out of top-flight competition into the Amateurliga Berlin (II) where they remained until disappearing into lower tier city competition in the mid-1960s. Today the team plays in Berlin's Kreisliga B (X). The club fielded successful youth sides through the 1980s and in 1987 were awarded the Sepp Herberger Prize by the DFB (Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund; German Football Association) in recognition for their youth work. However, by 2000, Minerva did not have a single youth side remaining. They have since renewed their commitment to youth and again have an active youth department. References *Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001).

It was particularly notable for being the first-ever INS-led wire tap case resulting in a successful criminal prosecution, and for being the first time federal prosecutors used money-laundering and racketeering statutes to smash an alien smuggling operation and seize its assets. Then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno called it, \\"the largest alien smuggling organization ever dismantled in United States history.\\"  Tracking the Smuggling Ring  Officials said the smuggling operation, which was loosely made up of three different cartels, smuggled mostly Indian nationals from India to Moscow, where connecting flights allowed aliens to travel to Cuba. The organization also smuggled aliens who were nationals of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. From Cuba aliens would then either fly or travel by boat to the Miami area or travel across the Mexican border into Texas.United States v.

The cartel moved aliens from India through Moscow and on to Cuba, from where the aliens were transported by sea or traveled by land into the U.S.Once in the U.S., the immigrants were kept in stash houses where they were kept under lock and key, until their families or prospective employers paid their smuggling fee. The alien smuggling fees were primarily paid to a U.S.-based hawaladar who then contacted hawaladars in India, who then made the necessary arrangements with alien smugglers there. The smuggling cartel transported aliens at a cost of $20,000 per alien, generating more than $200 million in proceeds over a 3-year period.GAO Report to Congress, \\"Alien Smuggling: Management and Operational Improvements Needed to Address Growing Problem.\\" May 2000. According to INS officials, INS agents based in Texas first became aware of the operation in 1995, when they discovered a commercial pilot in Texas was making frequent flights from Dallas to the Texas/Mexico border, and became aware that an Indian smuggling ring was working into Texas through Mexico and Central America.\\"Breaking a Smuggling Cartel: A Timeline of Operation Seek and Keep,\\" ABCNews.com, July 7, 1999 In 1997, after a former smuggler contacted an INS agent in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and became an informant, authorities learned the operation was using multiple routes. After further investigation, the case became a formal operation within INS and the Department of Justice, and was pursued as a racketeering and money-laundering case. The operation was also allowed to begin using new wire-tapping authority given to it by Congress, which led to over 35,000 calls by the smuggling operation to be intercepted.  Breaking the Cartel  In November 1998, twenty-one people were taken into custody in a series of raids in several states, the Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Ecuador. Two of the ringleaders were arrested, including Nick Diaz, also known as Nitin Shettie. Diaz was arrested in a raid in the Bahamas on November 14, 1998, and after his arrest by Bahamian authorities he was then taken into U.S. custody. The raid in the Bahamas detained dozens of Indian citizens waiting to make the last leg of the trip to the United States. An INS videotape showed Diaz being taken into custody, the Indian nationals who were being smuggled, and documents including piles of airline tickets used by the Indians to fly to the Caribbean via Moscow. A federal grand jury in Dallas, where the investigation began, charged Shettie and 30 others in three sealed indictments that contained nearly 60 immigration and money-laundering counts. Eighteen alien smugglers accepted guilty pleas. Then-INS Commissioner Doris Meissner hailed the success of the operation, saying, \\"Cracking a multimillion-dollar alien smuggling ring whose operations spanned four continents is an impressive achievement that underscores INS' commitment to defending the integrity of this nation's immigration laws ... we have disrupted and dismantled a major criminal enterprise.\\"  Groundbreaking Operation  Operation Seek and Keep was the first investigation authorized to use wiretapping technology in an illegal immigrant smuggling case, as approved by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, The INS used the new authority to intercept electronic communications, monitoring 35,000-plus calls. Also, for the first time, federal prosecutors used money-laundering statutes to smash an alien smuggling operation and seize assets.

They also refer to themselves as Gautam Thakurs. The Gautam Khanzada are Muslim converts from the Gautam community. Origin At various times in history, different lineages of the rajputs Khanzada converted to Islam. The rajputs Khanzada of Fatehpur District are said to have converted during the rule of the Mughal Emperor Jehangir. This group of rajputss claim descent from Ratan Sen, who is said to be married to the daughter of Jaichand of Kannauj. Through him descended two brothers, Bijai Singh and Bahrawat Singh. Bijai Singh took the name Bijli Khan, and his descendants are now found mainly in Bhainsauli. They were at one time substantial landowners. Bahrawat Singh, on his conversion to Islam took the name Bahadur Khan, was granted eighty four villages, that former the estate of Tappa Jar. His son Mansoor founded the village of Mansoorpur while another son Sarmast founded the village of Sarmastpur. These two villages plus the village of Garhi Jar and Bahadur pur Meona were home to families who played an important role in the history of Fatehpur District. Another prominent rajputs family was that of the Rajahs of Azamgarh. The family claimed descent from Chandra Sen, who had two sons, Sagar Singh and Abhiman Singh. Sagar Singh converted to Islam, and took the name Daulat Khan. He passed his estate on to his nephew Harbans Singh. It was Harbans Singh son Bikramjit Singh, also known as Azam Khan who founded the city of Azamgarh. His brother Azmat founded the town of Azmatgarh. The Rajahs of Azamgarh maintained their independence until their principality fell to the British in the late 18th Century. Another rajputs family in Azamgarh District was that of the Sidhari Babus, who were also substantial landowners. Other minor rajputs Khanzada landowners included the chaudhary of Khutahan Shahgang in Jaunpur District, as well as minor landowners in Sitapur District. Present circumstances The sense of Rajput identity amongst the rajputs Khanzada remains strong, especially those of Fatehpur District. In their marriages too, Rajput customs are followed, like bursting of fire crackers and sending specially made laddoos to community members, which form part of marriage celebrations. The community also practices clan exogamy, marrying into other Khanzada communities such as the Dikhit Khanzada. Rajput traditions have eclipsed the religious divide and forged a common identity for the Hindu rajputs Thakurs and the rajputs Muslims. This is seen by the act that Hindu rajputs Thakurs participate in Muslim rajputs functions, while rajputs Muslims participate in intercommunity functions including religious ones. For example, rajputs Muslims help organise Holi milans, Ram Lilas and kirtans.

On completion of her schooling Minakshi joined the Women's Christian College in Madras, graduating in 1929. She wanted to her master's degree at Madras Christian College but her candidature was initially rejected on grounds of being a woman. However, Minakshi persisted and the authorities relented when her eldest C. Lakshminarayanan, who was working as a Professor in the college gave a written undertaking to take care of her. Minakshi eventually completed her master's degree and went on to pursue her doctorate obtaining it in 1936.

Theological and theatrical origins The main attraction and founder was Jesuit Nick Weber, who held degrees in theology and theater. He saw a circus as a vehicle to communicate theological lessons without being heavy-handed. \\"I used to be involved with community theater,\\" he once explained, \\"but I got disenchanted with that. It wasn't open enough. People come to our shows and know they'll have fun.\\" Yet Weber also avers, \\"Ours was an entertainment in every sense, but it was a ministry of the California Jesuits.\\"Mitch Kincannon, Royal Lichtenstein Circus Manager{[dead linkdate=March 2020}} Weber's very first experiment with street performing took place in downtown San Jose, California, under the title, \\"Sam's Sidewalk Show.\\" For a few months after that he toured alone under the Royal Lichtenstein title and then was joined by three young friends for the first summer attempt in 1971. The following summer three young Jesuit scholastics joined for another tour. In the fall of 1972, the young Jesuits were replaced by two former students and the tiny show with the big name (selected as being easily remembered) began its annual cross-country tours. In a 1974 People profile Weber explained the philosophy behind the show: A Typical Season A season ran from August through May performing in more than 120 cities with a cast as few as three to as many as eight. Venues included college campuses, shopping centers, churches, Indian reservations, company picnics and benefits. Besides Weber, the other regular cast member was Mitch Kincannon, who acted as booking agent, house manager, performer, ombudsman and many other roles before crowds and behind the scenes. Kincannon, summing up the show's appeal, stated, \\"The payoff is creating an atmosphere for kids. It's their experience as we show the moral of the circus by transforming a dull parking lot into something magical, another world. The circus always has had this ability to transcend the average, boring, dull life.\\" The rest of the performers were generally people in their 20s who signed up for a season or so, although the show also actively recruited from audiences while travelling. Animal and Human Performers The show had a small menagerie of performing animals that consisted at various times of bears, monkeys, miniature horses, foxes, pheasants, pigmy goats, dogs, parrots, ducks, and domestic cats. Time dubbed the performance \\"an amiable blend of circus acts and low-key morality plays.\\" Drawing inspiration from the emerging New Vaudeville movement, acts could vary to include fire eating, dance, juggling, mime, parables, wire- walking and single trapeze, aerial roman rings, magic (including a version of Harry Houdini's Milk Can Escape)Circus Magic Milwaukee Journal April 2, 1977 and clown antics. Off-season, funding and alumni In the Seventies, summer months were spent at Santa Clara University rehearsing with the new cast members while recuperating after the hectic 10-month performance schedule. In 1980, the show's training quarters were relocated at the Jesuit Novitiate property in Montecito, near Santa Barbara. Ongoing operations received substantial help from the California Province of the Jesuits during training periods and with capital outlay for the show's vehicles. Other substantial support came from passing the hat for voluntary audience contributions, board and room accommodations from en route host families, along with stipends paid by student associations and other performance sponsors.Getting There Many alumni continued street performing or even transitioned into working in mainstream circuses and theater companies or other media related employment. Prominent examples include Dana Smith, Steve Aveson, Bill Cain, Joey Joey Colon, Kevin Curdt, Carlo Gentile, Darren Peterson, Jens Larson, Jim Jackson, Mary Nagler Hildebrand and Carlo Pellegrini, Nanci Olesen, John and Paul Hadfield, Juanita Madrigal, Jody Ellis, Stefan Fisher and Eric Wilcox.

Al-Ghafur Al-Ghaffar Al-GhƒÅfur () is one of the titles of God in Islam, translated as \\"The Forgiver\\". It is derived from the root gh-f-r (ÿ∫ŸéŸÅŸéÿ±Ÿé). The basic meaning of the root is \\"to cover, to shield, to protect\\", besides \\"to forgive\\". Al-Ghaf≈´r () and Al-GhaffƒÅr () are two of the 99 Names of God in Islam derived from the same root. Their traditional translations are \\"The All-Forgiving\\" and \\"The Forgiving\\". The root gh-f-r has given rise to three names in the Qur'an: Ghaffar, Ghaffur and Gh√¢fir. However, only Ghaffar and Ghaffur were included in the list of 99 names narrated by Tirmidhi. Interpretation The difference between Al- Ghaffar and Al-Ghafur has been explained by various means. Traditionally, Al- Ghaffar is translated as \\"The Forgiving\\". This type of forgiveness is a continuous and repetitive action. No matter how many times a person may sin, God can continually forgive him/her for his/her sins. Al-Ghafur, on the other hand, is understood as forgiving a sin no matter how large the sin may be. A way to make a distinction between the two names is to consider Al-Ghaffar as dealing with the quantity of sins, while Al-Ghafur deals with the quality of a sin. In his book, Al-Maqsad Al-Asna fi Sharah Asma' Allahu al-Husna (The best means in explaining God's Beautiful Names), Imam Al Ghazali translates Al- Ghaffar as \\"The Very Forgiving One\\" and Al-Ghafur as \\"The Most Forgiving One\\". Al Ghazali writes: :\\"The sins (of man) are among the disgraceful things which He veils by placing a veil upon them in this world and disregarding their punishment in the hereafter ... Certainly Al-Ghaffar denotes an extreme ... of forgiveness in respect of forgiveness that is repeated time after time.\\" :\\"Thus He is Al-Ghafur in the sense that He forgives perfectly and completely...\\" Quran Both of these Names appear in the Quran a number of times. For example, Al Ghaffar is found in verses 20:82, 38:66, 39:5, 40:42, 71:10, Al-Ghafur in 2:173, 8:69, 16:110, 41:32. E.g. verse 4:48: \\"Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives other than that to whom He wills. And whoever sets up partners with Allah has indeed invented a tremendous sin.\\" The Prophet Noah says in verse 71:10 of the Quran, \\"Ask forgiveness of your Lord, surely He is Ghaffar.\\" Sura 40 of the Quran is titled Al-Ghafur or Al-Mu'min Hadith It has been transmitted from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim that Abu Bakr related, \\"I said to the Prophet: 'O Messenger of Allah! Teach me a supplication that I may make in prayer.' He replied: 'Say: O Allah! I have done my soul a great harm and no one can forgive sins except You; so grant me forgiveness with Your pleasure, and have pity on me. You are Al-Ghafur, Ar-Rahim.'\\" Imam Tirmidhi reported that Anas said that he heard the Islamic Prophet Muhammad say: \\"Allah the Almighty has Said: 'O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not Mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it.'\\" It has been transmitted from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim that Ibn Umar reported that he heard the Prophet Muhammad say, \\"A Mumin will be brought close to his Rabb on the Day of Resurrection and enveloping him in His Mercy, He will make him confess his sins by Saying, 'Do you remember (doing) this sin and this sin?' He will reply, 'My Rabb, I remember.' Then He will Say, 'I covered it up for you in the life of the world, and I forgive it for you today.' Then the record of his good deeds will be handed to him.\\" Concept of Allah's forgiveness When contemplating how Allah deals with an individual's forgiveness, the root definition of each of these words help a great deal. In general, an individual has sins that he is aware of and sins that he is not aware of. Al Haleem has been explained to mean that Allah is Forbearing and Clement, where He gives an individual respite, or time to ask Him for forgiveness. Allah is not in haste to punish an individual for his sins. He even at times overlooks sins due to His Attribute of Haleem. Al Ghaffur has been described as meaning Allah is \\"The Most Forgiving One\\". He forgives a particular sin, no matter how large it may be. If the person returns to the same sin, Allah is Al Ghaffar, The Very Forgiving One. Al Ghaffar gives the notion that Allah continuously and repetitively forgives an individual for his sins. If an individual returns to Allah and asks for repentance, it can be accepted due to Allah's Attribute of being Tawwab, the Acceptor of Repentance. Once Allah accepts the repentance of an individual through His Infinite Mercy, He can erase the sin altogether because of His Attribute, Affuw. It would be as though there is no sin at all. Since man is not perfect, he repetitively sins and asks for forgiveness and seeks repentance, so the cycle of forgiveness can repeat from Allah.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and cup-shaped or bell-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus wilcoxii is a mallee, sometimes a tree, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey, copper-coloured or greenish bark that is shed in long ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have bluish green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, narrow elliptical, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, cylindrical to oval, about long and wide with a beaked or conical operculum long. Flowering has been observed in March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, bell-shaped or cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves slightly protruding. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus wilcoxii was first formally described in 1987 by Douglas John Boland and David Arthur Kleinig in the journal Brunonia from specimens collected by Boland on the northern slope of Mother Woila Mountain in Deua National Park in 1982. The specific epithet (wilcoxii) honours Michael David Wilcox who made one of the first collections of this species. Distribution and habitat Deua gum grows in poor soil on steep scree slopes near the headwaters of the Tuross and Moruya Rivers in the Deua and Wadbilliga National Parks.

AMA style is widely used, either entirely or with modifications, by hundreds of other scientific journals (including medical and other public health journals), in many textbooks, and in academia (for papers written in classes). Along with APA style and CSE style, it is one of the major style regimes for such work. Many publications have small local style guides that cascade over AMA, APA, or CSE style (for example, \\"follow AMA style unless otherwise specified herein\\" or \\"for issues not addressed herein, follow AMA style\\").

Technical information # Typography # Manuscript editing and proofreading # Glossary of publishing terms # Resources Traits of AMA style In general, AMA style strives for clarity and simplicity, and trusts the target readership to have a certain amount of knowledge and education. For example, AMA style dispenses with periods in abbreviations, on the grounds that they are unnecessary for meaning's or clarity's sake in all but very few contexts. AMA also requires expansion of most abbreviations at first use, for clarity's sake. The AMA Manual of Style sets standards for mechanical style, but does not insist on invariability for its own sake in contexts where a bit of limited variation is logical, especially in higher- level style.

Official figures state there are around 2,000 prostitutes in the country, who are not allowed to operate near schools, hospitals, and churches.

History There had been courtesans and concubines in the Habesha culture for centuries. After the colonization by Italy in 1880 there was an increase in forced prostitution by Italian soldiers, the Italian population was estimated at 8000 military and civilian people, with the advent of fascism during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935 the increased prostitution for requests for sexual labor from Italian military authorities with an increase in sexual abuse and rape of women and children with the increase in pedophile. Prostitution was encouraged with the advent of Italian racial laws by the authorities and discouraged mixed marriages (in many cases forced marriages) between Italians and locals. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4039-8158-5_21?fbclid=IwAR2Psr9ekSyLwtNWo_yF7aTDx8zTPd3RcQ2XIseFxYUSRUe5feJ6NgTyui0https://www.actamedicamediterranea.com/archive/2019/medica-2/sexually- transmitted-diseases-at-the-time-of-italian-colonies-historical-ethi-cal-and- medical-implications/pdf.

In major cities like Assab, Asmara and Massawa, prostitution was common in bars in the \\"native neighborhoods\\". [5] This phenomenon continued much less during the World War II with the war lost in 41 it could no longer be resorted to by force of arms. https://www.actamedicamediterranea.com/archive/2019/medica-2/sexually- transmitted-diseases-at-the-time-of-italian-colonies-historical-ethi-cal-and- medical-implications/pdf Following the federation with Ethiopia in 1950, the Ethiopian troops stationed in Eritrea, and the American troops at Kagnew Station continued the demand for prostitution. Prostitution increased during the 1970s with the build-up of the Ethiopian garrisons in the area. In the 1980s there were a hundred prostitutes between Assab, Asmara and Massawa. Many worked in bars owned by successful prostitutes. During the Eritrean War of Independence, Eritrean girls in occupied territories we required to sign up to join the army at 16. There is evidence many were used as prostitutes by the soldiers. At time of liberation by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and independence, there were 4,000 prostitutes in the country, and 2,000 Ethiopian women were deported in an attempt to curtail prostitution. With the spread of HIV in the 1990s, prostitution was regulated and sex workers were required to have a monthly health check. Prostitution increased in Asmara following arrival of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea peacekeeping force in 2000. Forms of prostitution * Street walkers: These prostitutes work mainly at night seeking clients on the street. * Home based prostitutes: These prostitutes receive clients in their homes. * Bar owners: These practice prostitution as an additional source of income in the bars they own. * Bar ladies: They seek clients in the bars they work in. They may or may not be paid by the bar owners. * Small drinking house prostitutes: They work in local drinking houses or tearooms and use prostitution to supplement their income. * Brothels: There are a number of brothels, which are usually also drinking houses. * Call girls: In recent time, with the emergence of cell phones, call girls now operate in the country. HIV HIV is a problem in the country, although it has one of the lowest prevalence rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the 1990s prostitution was regulated and monthly health checks carried out to try and stop the spread of infections. 25 clinics and hospitals gave free testing for prostitutes. Social workers used community elders to try and spread the message of safe sex and condom use to prostitutes and clients. Campaigns have targeted high risk groups, including sex workers. As a result, the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers has fallen from 22% in 2002, to 10.4% in 2014. Condom use by sex workers had risen to 95% in 2014. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a problem in the country. The law criminalises child prostitution. The minimum age for consensual sex is 18. Penalties for conviction of the commercial sexual exploitation of children include imprisonment. Crimes were seldom reported, and punishment rarely applied. Data on the extent of child prostitution is not available. UN peacekeeping forces have been involved in the use of under-age prostitutes, some as young as 10. Danish, Italian, Slovakian and Irish soldiers have been implicated. Sex trafficking Eritrean adults and children are subjected to sex trafficking abroad, primarily in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Libya. Some women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Some Eritrean women and girls travel to Gulf States for domestic work but are subsequently subjected to sex trafficking. Smaller numbers of Eritrean women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in South Sudan, Sudan, and Israel; reportedly, some Eritrean men are vulnerable to sex trafficking in Israel. Some Eritrean military and police officers are complicit in trafficking crimes along the border with Sudan. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Eritrea as a Tier 3 country.

She previously served as City Council member for Oakland's 4th District. Upon inauguration on January 3, 2011, she became Oakland's first female mayor. Quan ran an unsuccessful campaign for reelection in 2014, losing the mayoral race to Libby Schaaf, a member of the Oakland City Council. Personal life Quan was born in Livermore, California. Her family ties in the Bay Area date back to the 1870s, when her great-grandfather immigrated to San Francisco from the Qing dynasty Chinese city of Kaiping (Hoiping in Cantonese), Guangdong. Quan's husband, Dr. Floyd Huen, is a doctor of internal medicine for Alameda County. They met at UC Berkeley as activists on Asian-American issues. Oakland School Board and City Council Quan was on the Oakland School Board for 12 years, starting in 1990 after organizing a citywide parent organization, Save Our Schools. As a parent leader she helped save the music program in the Oakland Schools. She served as chair of the California Urban Schools Association, the Asian Pacific Islanders School Board Members Association (APISBMA), and the Council of Urban Boards Association (the urban caucus of the National School Board Association representing the nation's 100 largest districts). She was appointed by the Clinton Administration to represent School Boards on the Title I Rules Making Committee. In these roles she advocated for more funding for urban and immigrant students, more inclusion of minority community history in textbooks, comprehensive school services and after school programs, and expansion of pre-school and adult education programs. In 1996 with Quan as president, the school board instituted a program using Standard English Program strategies to teach standard English to African American students. The move created national news with the perception Oakland schools were teaching students \\"Ebonics\\" because there was discussion about Ebonics being used as a teaching tool. In 2002, Jean Quan was elected to her first term as Council Member for Oakland District 4 (Allendale, Brookdale, Crestmont, Dimond, Laurel, Maxwell Park, Melrose, Montclair, and Redwood Heights). During her time on the Council she led several initiatives, including: \\"Measure Q\\": To prevent the closure of city libraries and increase funding for materials. \\"Oakland Wildfire Prevention District\\": Funds annual programs of vegetation control, safety inspections and homeowner education, and green waste/composting programs. \\"Oakland Cultural Arts Funding\\": Hotel Tax to fund the Oakland Zoo, Oakland Museum of California, Chabot Space & Science Center, Oakland Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Fund for Arts. \\"Measure Y for Public Safety and Measure BB\\": These initiatives fund Fire, Police and Violence Prevention Programs. The measure funds 63 police officers including geographically deployed \\"beat officers\\" and programs to prevent crimes and violence. Quan was a past chair of the Alameda County Waste Management Authority (StopWaste.org)Email from Jeff Becerra, Communications Manager, StopWaste.org and the Alameda Recycling Board. She also authored and voted for legislation which banned the use of polystyrene containers for take out foods, now widely adopted in other parts of California. In July 2010, Quan along with fellow City Council member and mayoral candidate Rebecca Kaplan were investigated by Oakland police for their actions during a protest following the manslaughter verdict of former BART Police officer Johannes Mehserle. Police claimed Quan and Kaplan joined a \\"human chain\\" which prevented officers from clearing a street, while the two countered they were acting as \\"peacekeepers\\". No charges were filed against the Councilwomen. Quan was the victim of a street robbery in September of the same year, in front of the Dimond neighborhood Safeway supermarket. Quan attributed the crime to lack of employment opportunities in Oakland. 2010 Oakland mayoral election Oakland's 2010 election was held under the city's new instant-runoff voting or ranked choice voting ballot system, which allows voters to indicate their first, second, and third choices of candidate. More than 120,000 voters participated in the largest turnout for a Mayor's race in recent memory. Though ranked choice voting is promoted as a way to reduce mud-slinging between the candidates, Quan paid for several negative hit pieces on her closest rival. The top three finishers among a field of 10 candidates were Quan, Don Perata, and Rebecca Kaplan. In the initial tally on election night, Perata led Quan, 40,342 to 29,266 but did not have a majority of the first- place votes. The votes were then re-tallied by eliminating each candidate at the bottom, until one candidate obtained a majority. After several rounds of candidate elimination, the last candidate to be eliminated was Kaplan, the third-place candidate. Her votes were then allocated according to each voter's wishes to the remaining two candidates, Perata and Quan. The Alameda Registrar of voters then declared Quan the winner with 53,897 votes from 105,769 valid votes (50.96% of the valid votes). Ranked Choice Voting undermines the argument that voting for someone widely believed to have no chance is to throw away one's vote, and thus may increase voter turnout. Such an increase seems evident in the comparison between 2006 and 2010 in Oakland. Still, some suggest Ranked Choice Voting causes difficulty, with some studies suggesting that low-income voters struggled with concepts behind Ranked Choice Voting. However, only weeks prior, the US Court of Appeals upheld Ranked Choice Voting as an accepted procedure comparing it to plurality. Oakland Mayor =Initiatives= Within her first six months in office, Mayor Quan met with more than 3,000 residents in eight town hall meetings. The resulting priorities reportedly developed by residents at these sessions were to help focus the city's and community's agenda. Her election as Oakland's first female mayor, and the first Chinese-American female mayor of a major U.S. city, resulted in high visibility nationally and internationally.http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/Mayor/a/MayorsProfile/index.htm Quan capitalized on this visibility by traveling to and meeting with potential trade and business partners for the City and Port of Oakland. Education Quan increased collaboration with the Oakland Unified School District and the community, introducing a program offering late-night youth services in the East and West Oakland areas in attempts to decrease violence with school-age youth. In 2011, she also formed the Oakland Education Cabinet with the OUSD Superintendent and the Dean of the Mills College School of Education. Crime After a surge in violence in one particular area of Oakland, Quan walked the beat with police in the neighborhood, encouraging residents to join a neighborhood crime prevention council. With gun violence up 30% from before her term, many residents and press view community policing with skepticism; \\"Even law-abiding citizens with good intentions aren't going to risk life and limb in areas of the city where the police don't feel safe.\\" wrote one reporter. Despite the skepticism, the outreach is making a difference: calls to the drug hotline went from 0 to 103 in the first six months; participation in the local Neighborhood Crime Prevention Council has gone from 5 neighbors to almost two dozen neighbors meeting with police each month and identifying hotspots and priorities; calls to the Public Works Agency for blight, streetlights and other infrastructure complaints increased by 53%, and the number of National Night Out events this past August more than doubled. She has also begun helping rebuild the Oakland Police Department's workforce, by hiring more officers. In October 2011, Quan introduced Oakland's 100 Block Plan, under the claim \\"90% of shootings and homicides occurred\\"in 5% of the City‚Äîor approximately 100 city blocks.\\".http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/mayor/documents/pressrelease/oak033035.pdf Oakland's 100 Block Plan The premise for these statistics would be disproved by the Urban Strategies Councilhttp://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Analysis- disputes-Quan-s-100-block-Oakland-plan-3625467.php and disavowed by Quan http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/06/27/oakland-mayor-quan- defends-100-blocks-plan-despite-incorrect-data/ and officials from Oakland's city government.http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2012/06/22/oakland-official- disavows-100-block-crime-numbers/ The plan was overseen by Chief of Police Howard Jordan, but would prove to be underwhelming.http://www.insidebayarea.com/oakland- tribune/ci_20400310/limited-early-successes-100-blocks Quan proposed the hiring of Bill Bratton, a former Chief of Police in Boston and Los Angeles, as a consultant on the departmental issues, which was later approved by the city council.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-hires-police-consultant- Bratton-4215491.php Combined with the underwhelming results of the 100 Blocks Plan and Bratton's report on widespread issues within the Oakland Police Department led to Howard Jordan's eventual resignation in May 2013.http://www.insidebayarea.com/breaking-news/ci_23199564/oakland-police- chief-howard-jordan-announces-medical-retirement Anthony Toribio would fill in the interim for two days until Quan appointed Deputy Chief Sean Whent.http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23216308/oakland-interim-police-chief- toribio-out-just-two Under Chief Whent, the city implemented the Operation Ceasefire program, which emphasized components of restorative justice.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/johnson/article/Oakland-s-Operation- Ceasefire-a-last-chance-to-5325894.phphttp://oaklandlocal.com/2014/01/east- oaklands-ceasefire-community-leaders-set-the-record-straight/ In May 2014, Quan promoted Whent to the permanent position http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/browns-budget-proves-hes-a- centrist/Content?oid=3928468 after a major drop in violent crime during his tenure, according to police statistics.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Sean-Whent-named-permanent- Oakland-police-chief-5477982.php =Board memberships= She was board chair of the Chabot Space & Science Center and serves on the Board of the California League of Cities. =Criticism and praise= During the second week of Quan's tenure in January 2011, it was discovered Oakland Police chief Anthony Batts was a top-two candidate for the open position of San Jose Police chief.Maher, Sean.

Two weeks later, Quan introduced a plan for the police department which included updating the technological staff and rehiring 10 of the 80 officers who were laid off the previous year.Bryson, Samantha. Quan rehires 10 laid-off OPD officers, but Batts‚Äô future still vague. OaklandNorth. January 31, 2011. Batts announced his intention to remain in Oakland a few days later, but eventually resigned in October of the same year.Lee, Henry K. Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts says he'll stay. San Francisco Chronicle. February 5, 2011. Quan has come under fire due to a relationship with \\"unpaid legal adviser\\" Dan Siegel after Siegel represented the \\"mayor's office on various legal matters, from public records act requests to a private meeting with a judge overseeing a consent decree with the police department\\", according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The Oakland City Council issued a demand Siegel not represent the city as an attorney in any capacity, which by law falls under the jurisdiction of the City Attorney's office. Siegel had been considered a controversial figure at City Hall due to his supposed vocal criticism of Oakland Police, and his presence was reported to have exacerbated a feud between Quan and City Attorney John Russo. In June 2011, Russo left his post as Oakland City Attorney to become City Manager for Alameda. A KPIX/CBS5 poll taken just before Mayor Quan's first 100 days revealed that her job performance \\"garners the approval of the city's residents by a 2‚Äì1 margin.\\" The Capitol Weekly named Mayor Quan one of the top ten \\"Good\\" Mayors in the state. A KPIX poll six months later, taken shortly after the resignation of Chief Batts, listed an approval rating of 28 percent, with 69 percent responding with \\"little or no confidence\\" the mayor's ability to reduce the city's crime problem. On October 26, 2011 it was reported Quan responded to a recall petition by saying she believed the signatories were frustrated with her lack of progress in creating jobs. She went on to KGO radio claiming \\"I'm too busy. ... I haven't even had a chance to look at the petitions.\\" Quan remained unpopular in the city of Oakland. A 2013 SurveyUSA poll found 60 percent of residents disapproved of her job performance and 65 percent said the city was on the wrong track, with crime the voters' primary concern. The Asian-American community gave her the lowest marks, with 67 percent disapproving of her performance. 2011 Occupy Oakland protest Mayor Quan received widespread national criticism in October 2011 for her handling of the Occupy Oakland protest. On October 11, Mayor Quan visited the protest site. Thirteen days later more than 500 police officers from Oakland, other area police departments, and the State of California were directed to use tear gas and batons to clear the plaza where the protests were being held. Mayor Quan was in Washington, D.C. at the time on city business. Quan issued a statement the next morning commending the police chief \\"for a generally peaceful resolution to a situation\\". That night, hundreds of police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbang grenades to subdue and arrest over 100 protesters, though denied the use of rubber bullets and flashbang grenades during the press release. The mayor's office was flooded with demands that protesters be released and her legal adviser opposed the police action and threatened to resign. One protester, war veteran Scott Olsen, was hospitalized with a fractured skull after being struck in the forehead by police projectiles. On November 2, a second protester-veteran, Kayvan Sabehgi, suffered a ruptured spleen when he was hit and tackled by Oakland Police in an area away from the protests' center. By November 14, two of Mayor Quan's top advisors, legal advisor Dan Siegel and Deputy Mayor Sharon Cornu, had resigned. Quan was criticized for apparent insensitivity at an Oakland City Council meeting on March 6, 2013. In a conversation with war veteran Scott Olsen, she accused him of having a \\"chip on his shoulder\\". Later, Olsen tweeted, \\"J. Quan told me she realizes I have a chip on my shoulder. Insulting, more like a broken skull and brain trauma.\\" Recall petition On December 7, 2011, the Oakland City Clerk's office approved the request by the Committee to Recall Jean Quan to begin collecting signatures to qualify a recall measure for a future ballot. The committee failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for a measure on the November 2012 ballot. Cellphone use while operating a motor vehicle Quan has been spotted using her cellular telephone numerous times by various San Francisco media, including \\"People Behaving Badly\\" Creator Stanley Roberts. On June 8, 2014, Quan was involved in a collision with a car in front of hers and it is alleged that she was again using her cellular telephone while operating a motor vehicle. 2014 election Quan ran for reelection in 2014. The leading candidates were Quan, Libby Schaaf, a member of the Oakland City Council, and Rebecca Kaplan, also a member of the city council. Though Kaplan was the early favorite, Schaaf finished first with 49 percent of the vote. Since no candidate received a majority and Quan finished third, she was eliminated in the subsequent ranked choice round. When Quan's ballots were redistributed, Schaaf was the second choice on more ballots than Kaplan, enabling Schaaf to win with 63 percent to Kaplan's 37. Schaaf was sworn in on January 5, 2015.

Hepps, 475 U.S. 767 (1986), is a United States Supreme Court case decided April 21, 1986. Facts and prior history Maurice S. Hepps was the principal stockholder of a corporation that has a chain of stores selling beer, soft drinks, and snacks. The Philadelphia Inquirer published a series of articles on Hepps being linked to organized crime which used some of those links to influence the State‚Äôs governmental processes. They accused Hepps of being linked to organized crime and capitalizing on that connection to influence the state legislature through articles that were published in the Philadelphia newspaper The Inquirer, owned by Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. Hepps brought a defamation suit into a Pennsylvania state court against Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. and the authors of the articles. The Pennsylvania statute gave The Philadelphia Newspaper Inc. the burden of proof on the question of truth or falsity. The jury ruled in favor of the Philadelphia Newspaper Inc. The case was remanded for a new trial. The Pennsylvania State Supreme Court favored Hepps, holding that the newspaper was obligated to prove its accusations true. Decision =Majority= On Monday, April 21, 1986 the United States Supreme Court overruled the state court in a 5-4 decision written by Sandra Day O'Connor. They held that libel plaintiffs must shoulder the burden of proving falsity, when the article in question relates to public concern. The newspaper published an article of public concern about a private figure; the private figure cannot recover damages without showing the statements are false. This court case dealt with the issues of the first amendment, libel, and defamation. =Concurrence= Justice Brennan wrote a short concurrence in which Justice Blackmun joined. He notes his belief that where \\"allegedly defamatory speech is of public concern\\" that the First Amendment requires a plaintiff (be it a public official, public figure, or private individual) prove the statements to be false. He writes to note his adherence to his view that a distinction based on whether or not the defendant is part of the media is not reconcilable with a First Amendment principle that states that \\"the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public is not dependent on the identity of the source\\". (Brennan, J., concurring). =Dissent= Justice Stevens wrote a dissent in which Chief Justice Burger and Justices White and Rehnquist joined. He starts out by stating that the majority decision will only make a difference in cases in which a private individual can prove he was libeled by a defendant who was at least negligent. He writes that as long as publishers are protected by having the burden of proof be on the plaintiff, there is little basis for a concern that a large amount of true speech is deterred unless a private person who is the victim of malicious libel can prove falsity.

The valley was first settled during the California Gold Rush of 1849. The discovery of Nevada's Comstock Lode in 1859 established the economic importance of the area, which would become the site of the Nevada State Capitol. History The area was historically occupied by the indigenous Washoe before the arrival of American settlers. The Bartleson‚ÄìBidwell Party is believed to have passed through the area on the way to California in 1841. Kit Carson and John C. Fremont rode into the valley, which was still under Mexican rule, during their survey of the Western United States in the mid-1840s. In 1848, Mexico ceded the region to the United States after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Soon afterwards, the California Gold Rush brought a wave of prospectors in search of fortune. In September 1850, the valley was part of the newly established Utah Territory. Many early settlers included Mormons led by Colonel John Reese. In 1851, Reese and a band of eighteen men established \\"Mormon Station\\", the first trading post of the Nevada region, near the valley at a location that would become the town of Genoa. When they were recalled to Salt Lake City, Utah by Mormon leader Brigham Young, the land was sold to local resident John Mankin. North of Genoa, in the area of what would become Carson City, another early trading post was established, known as Eagle Station. The post was likely located near present-day Fifth and Thompson streets in Carson City. The surrounding area was called Eagle Ranch. The name reportedly came from an eagle shot by ranch manager Frank Hall, who displayed it on the trading post wall. The station served as a stop on the California Trail. =Establishment of Carson City= In 1858, Abraham Curry came to Eagle Valley after he found the real estate in Genoa to be too expensive. Curry partnered with attorneys John J. Musser and Frank M. Proctor to purchase the trading post and much of the valley for a $300 down payment out of a total sale price of $1,000. Musser and Proctor worked to carve a separate territory from Utah, while Curry promoted the newly founded Carson City. Curry set aside and donated of land for the site of the future Nevada State Capitol. =Silver mines and statehood= In July 1859, Musser became president and Proctor became vice- president of the constitutional convention to establish the Territory of Nevada. Curry served as the delegate from Eagle Valley. In 1859, the discovery of the Comstock Lode east of Carson City was made public. It was the largest silver find in history, attracting tens of thousands of miners to the area. Carson City became a station of the Pony Express in 1860, and was designated the territorial capital in 1861. In 1862, the Nevada Territorial Legislature leased the Warm Springs Hotel, located in the valley east of Carson City, from Curry to hold meetings and detain prisoners. The legislature had been using the site's prison quarry to provide stone material for the Nevada State Capitol. In 1864, the territorial legislature acquired the hotel along with 20 acres (8.1 ha) of land from Curry for $80,000. As the American Civil War was being fought in the Eastern United States, Nevada became a state on October 31, 1864. In 1873, another major silver find called Big Bonanza continued the prosperity of the area. In that same year, railway service was opened by the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to transport ore and timber. Geography Eagle Valley is a tributary to the Carson River basin. Runoff from the valley has contributed to flooding of Carson City, notably on January 3, 1997.

Yaw Magazines and politics Burr founded a number of magazines including the Philadelphia-based periodical Nineteenth Century (first issue published January 1847); the Bergen County, New Jersey, Democrat; and the New York-based The Old Guard. In his youth, he appears to have been a \\"militant reformer\\"‚Äîhe praised the Quaker abolitionist John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \\"The Reformer\\" in the first issue of Nineteenth Century, and called Whittier \\"one of the best the purest of all poets\\"; in later issues of the Nineteenth Century \\"he published materials indicating a strong anti-slavery bias.\\" Later in life, though, he changed sides completely; the American Civil War finds him a Copperhead. The first issue of The Old Guard contains a lengthy invective by Burr against abolitionist preachers such as Henry Ward Beecher, saying that their \\"savage war-cries\\" indicate they have sided with the devil. =Political activism after the Civil War= After the war, Burr remained active in politics. In an 1866 speech to the Anti-Abolition State Rights Society, he castigated Republicans such as Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, and criticized some fellow Democrats, for attempting to steal \\"Black Republican thunder,\\" saying such Democrats were to Republicans as mulattoes (he also called them mongrels) were to Negroes. He also participated in the 1872 Democratic National Convention. Friendship with Poe Burr had become good friends with Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry he admired and imitated (in anonymous poems published in The Old Guard, and had assisted Poe physically and financially during the latter's visit to Philadelphia, one of his last jaunts before his death. Poe wrote to his mother-in-law on 14 July 1849, thanking Burr for his help: \\"I am indebted for more than life itself to B[urr]....When all failed me, he stood my friend, got me money, and saw me off in the cars for Richmond.\\" Burr repaid Poe posthumously by publishing a number of pro-Poe articles in The Old Guard, even poems clearly based on Poe's. Of special value to Poe scholars is an article published in the June 1866 issue, \\"Poe and his Biographer, Griswold,\\" in which Burr presents documentary evidence that countered some of the criticism leveled against Poe by Rufus Wilmot Griswold, including letters by those who knew Poe. Burr also officiated at the marriage of another famous writer of the era, George Lippard, held on a rock at sunset above the Wissahickon.

He was the father of Gloria Vanderbilt and maternal grandfather of Anderson Cooper. An avid equestrian, Vanderbilt was the founder and president of many equestrian organizations. He gambled away most of his inheritance. Early life Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt was born on January 14, 1880, on Staten Island, New York. He was the youngest son of Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843‚Äì1899) and Alice Claypoole Gwynne (1845‚Äì1934). Among his siblings was Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875‚Äì1942), who married Harry Payne Whitney, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (1877‚Äì1915), and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt (1886‚Äì1965), who married Count L√°szl√≥ Sz√©chenyi. Reginald was a grandson of William Henry Vanderbilt (1821‚Äì1885), and great-grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794‚Äì1877). He attended Yale University, but did not graduate. One elder brother, Cornelius Vanderbilt III (1873‚Äì1942), married Grace Wilson against his parents' wishes and was disinherited. Another elder brother, Alfred, inherited the bulk of the family fortune, though Reginald and several sisters also received some inheritance.  Personal life and death Gloria Mercedes Morgan, with his daughter, Gloria Vanderbilt In 1903, Reginald married Cathleen Neilson (1885‚Äì1927) (PDF) at Parker Cottage in Newport, Rhode Island. She was the daughter of Isabelle Gebhard Neilson, the niece of Frederick Gebhard (c. 1860‚Äì1910), and the great-granddaughter of Thomas E. Davis, a prominent New York real estate developer. Before their divorce in 1920, the couple had one daughter: Cathleen Vanderbilt (1904‚Äì1944), who married Henry Cooke Cushing III (1895‚Äì1960) in 1923. After their divorce in 1932, she married broadcasting executive Lawrence Wise Lowman (1900‚Äì1980) in 1932. They divorced that same year and in 1940, she married for the third and final time to Martin Arostegui, a publisher in Havana, Cuba. On March 6, 1923, he married Gloria Mercedes Morgan (1904‚Äì1965). Together, they were the parents of his second daughter: Gloria Laura Vanderbilt (1924‚Äì2019), the fashion designer who married Pasquale DiCicco (1909‚Äì1978) in 1941. They divorced in 1945 and that same year she married Leopold Anthony Stokowski (1882‚Äì1977). They divorced in 1955 and a year later, in 1956, she married Sidney Arthur Lumet (1924‚Äì2011). In 1963, they also divorced and, that same year, she married Wyatt Emory Cooper (1927‚Äì1978). Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt died from cirrhosis due to alcoholism on September 4, 1925, at his country home, Sandy Point Farm, in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. In his will, he left the vast majority of his estate to his daughters with a residue to his widow, which was not to exceed $1,125,000 and his New York townhouse, located at 12 East 77th Street, and Sandy Point Farm.. He is buried in the Vanderbilt family plot at the Moravian Cemetery in Staten Island, New York. Descendants Through his eldest daughter, Vanderbilt was the grandfather of Henry Cooke Cushing IV (1924‚Äì2000), who was married to Georgia Walters \\"Georgette Windsor\\" (b. 1924), Ruth Swift Dunbar (1932‚Äì2010), Rosalba Neri (b. 1939), and Laura Alvarez. Through his daughter Gloria, Reginald is the maternal grandfather of Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski (b. 1950), who married Ivy Strick and Emily Goldstein (b 1964), Christopher Stokowski (b. 1952), Carter Vanderbilt Cooper (1965‚Äì1988), and Anderson Hays Cooper (b. 1967), the television news anchor.

Seneca was built as a non-self-propelled commercial schooner barge of the same name in 1884 by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works at Chester, Pennsylvania. On 18 October 1917, the U.S. Navy purchased her from the Luckenbach Steamship Company for use during World War I. Assigned the section patrol number SP-1240, she was commissioned in 1917 as USS Seneca (SP-1240) with Chief Boatswain's Mate Raymond Smith, USNRF, in command. Seneca first served as a coal barge for the Minesweeping Division at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York. In January 1918, she moved to Providence, Rhode Island, and she spent the last months of World War I as a floating base at Shelburne, Nova Scotia, Canada. In February 1919, Seneca relieved the submarine tender as temporary tender for Submarine Division 5, and served as such, primarily as an accommodation ship, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from 4 March to 28 May 1919 and at Norfolk, Virginia, from 29 May 1919 until detached on 29 August 1919. Seneca was ordered sold on 10 September 1919 and was delivered to her purchaser, the Neptune Line of New York City, on 1 October 1919. Seneca should not be confused with the minesweeper and patrol vessel , which was in commission at the same time.

History  The concepts of individual district gazetteers originated in the mid 19th century. The Madras District Manual published by J. H. Nelson in 1868 was the first of its kind. This was followed by the South Arcot District Manual (John Henry Garstin, 1878), Trichinopoly District Manual (Lewis Moore, 1878), Chingleput District Manual (C. S. Crole, 1879), Tinnevely District Manual (A. J. Stuart, 1879), Nilgiris District Manual (H. B. Grigg, 1880), North Arcot District Manual (Arthur F. Cox, 1881), Salem District Manual (H. Le Fanu, 1883), Tanjore District Manual(T. Venkataswamy, 1883) and Coimbatore District Manual (F. A. Nicholson, 1887). By the early 1900s, however, these manuals had become obsolete. Hence, they were revised in detail and expanded and re-published as district gazetteers. The first of the gazetteers appeared in 1906. Since then, there have been plenty of gazetteers published both in British as well as independent India. Post-independence, the work has been mainly handled by B. S. Baliga of the Madras Record Office.

For over 30 years, she created theatre that impacted directly on the lives of people who are often overlooked by mainstream theatre. Biography Born in Tyler, Texas and relocated to Chicago at a young age with her parents and sister, it was through drama classes with Johnny Houston, a dedicated Chicago Park District employee who ran after-school and summertime recreation programs for children that Rice first realized she had a gift for singing, dancing and theater. After Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were both assassinated, like many who came of age in the 1960s she felt called to take action to right wrongs and redress social inequalities. Rice soon discovered the theater could not only be for entertainment, but to critically engage, uplift, memorialize and celebrate the lives of marginalized poor and working-class people. She traveled to New York City for a bit but landed in Washington, DC joined the Black Panther Party and began teaching at RAP, Inc. (a center for ex-addicts in the District). In 1970, she saw an ad for auditions for the Living Stage Theatre Company, the newly established community \\"outreach\\" and educational theatre arm of Arena Stage. Under the direction of Robert Alexander (1929‚Äì2008), Living Stage was emerging as one of the first multi-racial, improvisational theatre companies dedicated to art for social change in the nation. For 14 years (1970‚Äì1984), Rice was a lead actress and associate director at Living Stage. There she authored over 50 theatre works for audiences of all ages and abilities, and conducted thousands of workshop for children, youth and adults from the DC area including work in prisons, substance abuse rehabilitation facilities, shelters for the homeless and schools. In 1971, Rice published an article in off our backs, one of the earliest second-wave feminist publications to come out of the nation's capital, in which she reflects upon the transformative power of performance: I stand before the mirror and examine this face, my face. I know this face, I know the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the skin, the bones. Unique only in that they are together to make this face. I know this face, yes, but do I know its limitations? No. How many faces will I make today? What roles will this face portray? A black militant, a bigot, prostitute, infant, gorilla, guerilla, an Indian, an angel, a grandmother or a paper doll. It could be one or all, all and more. Take this face, add this body and there is within them the possibility to experience every emotion ever felt, all the actions and reactions that have ever occurred since the dawn of man. I have only to open my being to all of these possibilities.Rice, Rebecca (Becky). \\"How Do You Describe a Sunset...To Someone Who's Never Seen One?\\" Off Our Backs. 1.23 (24 June 1971): 8. In the article, Rice also offers this description of the work of Living Stage and the practice of theatre for social change: For her contributions to the DC community, Rice was awarded the Toast and Strawberries Community Service Award in Washington, DC. In 1985, Rice left Living Stage to pursue her work as an independent artist working in communities across the country, as well as in Europe and Latin America. Eventually she settled in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul where she began a long association with the famed Penumbra Theatre Company. There she appeared in leading roles in The Piano Lesson, Fences, Two Trains Running, Willie and Ester and Jar the Floor. The collaboration with Penumbra's Artistic Director, Lou Bellamy, led to an invitation to become a member of the ensemble. In 1993‚Äì94, she wrote and directed the season opener, Waiting in Vain, an evening-length play based on a newspaper article of a young African American girl's death and exploring the issues of the working poor and returning veterans. In 1995, Everlasting Arms, a performance piece focusing on street violence and its effect upon mother‚Äìson relationships, became the company's season closer. Rice starred in the latter with Omari Shakir (aka Gavin Lawrence) and the show was directed by Laurie Carlos. While in Minneapolis, in 1987, Rice joined the nation's first multi- racial professional women's theater ensemble, At the Foot of the Mountain Women's Theatre Company, where she collaborated in the creation of Story of a Mother and premiered This is the House (written and performed with Janet Stanford). She went on to become Artistic Director of that theater and conducted a yearlong training program in Theater for Social Change that produced the original drama Allegiance, which addressed the issue of racism and its roots in American culture. After taking intensive classes with the Washington School of the Institute for Policy Studies, and Margo-Okasawa-Rey, founder of The Anti-Racism/Anti-Oppression Education Network, as well as the People's Institute for Survival and Beyond in New Orleans, LA, during the 1990s she became a much sought-after anti-racism/anti-oppression program facilitator. Drawing upon her deep experience as a performance maker, she staged educational, participatory civics workshops to aide businesses, schools and community organizations struggling against systemic racism to address \\"diversity issues\\". Rice returned to the nation's capital and operated the All Nation's Studio, a performance space devoted to cross-cultural artwork from the basement of her home in Northeast DC. In that space she nurtured the Saturday Girls, Medusa Speaks: An Artists' Collective, Sol y Soul and many, many more arts organizations dedicated to progressive social change from the ground up. She became a lecturer on Theatre for Social Change at Catholic University and was appointed an Artistic Associate at Center Stage in Baltimore, MD, in 1998. With poet/playwright Kumani (Denise) Gantt (former Director of Education.) She met and worked with Malika Saada-Saar (who is now the Executive Director of The Rebecca Project for Human Rights) at Saada- Saar's Crossing the River program, a ritual-based arts and healing process for women in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction, and later, reestablished ties with Arena Stage as a performer, director and teaching artist. At Arena, she served as understudy for Trinidad Sisters, The Visit;and appeared as Kassandra in Agamemnon and His Daughters, directed by Molly Smith. In 1999, Rice became an Artistic Associate at Arena Stage/Living Stage, where, with support from the Theatre Communications Group/Pew Charitable Trust Fellowship. As Artistic Associate, she collaborated with Oran Sandel, then Artistic Director of Living Stage, to re-energize the ensemble's practice of arts-based community engagement and to direct, Oceans, an original movement/theatre piece about the turn of the millennium in the age of Bush conservativism. As Artistic Associate for Arena, she also devised and directed The Southwest Project, an artistic collaboration to foster civic engagement amongst residents of the Southwest quadrant of the city. In the 1950s, city planners in DC had advocated for the mass removal of the low-income Black residents of the Southwest quadrant. They circulated rumors that flies from the outhouses of SW had penetrated the dining halls of the Capital and were spreading disease along the hallowed, white halls, of the nation. Their efforts led to the mass removal of thousands of SW residents, followed by a structured burn that leveled hundreds of local businesses and homes to the ground. In the wake of the destruction, a handful of low-income housing projects surrounded by high-rise condos and Arena Stage (founded by Zelda Fichlander) rose from the ashes, but the loss of what had been a thriving community was never truly acknowledged or mourned. The Southwest Project provided a creative opportunity for community residents‚Äîpast and present‚Äîto come together to remember the loss and try to lay ties for the future. Her final completed play was an adaptation of the South African folktale. Abiyoyo: Now and Then, for young children, Abiyoyo premiered at the Imagination Stage in Bethesda, MD in February 2001. In her lifetime, Rice was honored with the 1993 Helen Hayes Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Musical, for her work in dancer-choreographer Dianne McIntrye's In Living Color: A Gullah Story at Theatre of the First Amendment; the Ruby Dee Award for her solo Lifeline/I Might Have Been Queen; and the Minnesota/St. Paul Critics Recognition for Best Actress. In 2002, after a short illness, she succumbed to an infection brought on by cancer surgery, surrounded by a host of friends and family members. Longtime colleagues Janet Stanford and Jennifer L. Nelson penned this remembrance for American Theater Magazine : Rebecca challenged her colleagues to risk living their art, to expose it to the light of day and make deep and personal contact with the audience. Her joy in works of the imagination was contagious and inspired her students to leap into unknown territory searching for their own artistic voices‚Ä¶ Rebecca was a woman people wanted to have bless their babies, artistic ones and real ones alike.Stanford, Janet; Nelson, Jennifer.

The dam was completed in 1971, after four years of construction, to replace the 1924 concrete-arch Don Pedro Dam. The dam serves mainly for irrigation water storage, flood control and hydroelectricity production, and impounds Don Pedro Reservoir in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The New Don Pedro Dam is owned and operated by the Modesto Irrigation District (MID) and Turlock Irrigation District (TID). At tall, the dam is the tenth highest in the U.S. and its reservoir is the sixth largest artificial lake in California. The original dam was named for the old mining town of Don Pedros Bar on the Tuolumne River, which in turn takes its name from prospector Pierre \\"Don Pedro\\" Sainsevain. Background Shortly after their formation in 1887, the MID and TID acquired water rights to the Tuolumne River to secure a water supply for their combined service area in the San Joaquin Valley. After selling revenue bonds totaling $4.1 million, the two irrigation districts began construction of the Don Pedro Dam (now known as Old Don Pedro Dam) in 1921, about upriver of the present location of New Don Pedro Dam. Upon its completion in 1923, this concrete gravity arch dam was the highest dam in the world, forming a reservoir with a surface area of . The dam's 15 megawatt (MW) hydroelectric plant, later expanded to 37.5 MW, delivered its first power in October 1923.Baggese, p. 67 Expanding Don Pedro or constructing a new dam altogether was first seriously considered in the 1940s because the existing dam could only store a year's supply of water for valley farmers, with no guarantee that a multiyear drought could be weathered. An enlarged Don Pedro would provide a \\"bank\\" of water storage for prolonged droughts, capture more spring runoff, and provide increased flood control. Another proponent of a high dam was the city of San Francisco, which also sought a share of the Tuolumne's water and decided to cooperate with the irrigation districts to construct the new dam. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation made tentative studies for a high dam on the Tuolumne River as part of its Central Valley Project, though it later dropped the plans in favor of other sites.William De Roos, p. 197 Construction The first Don Pedro Dam, later to be submerged under the new reservoir In 1961, an overwhelming majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance the construction of a new dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro. The $49.7 million primary construction contract for the dam was awarded to Guy F. Atkinson Company on August 22, 1967. When he first saw the dam site, chief engineer John Goodier was reported to have said \\"[it'd be a] tough nut to crack\\". Clearing the dam site began immediately afterwards, in addition to the construction of access roads and a camp for construction workers. Construction of the dam's service spillway began a week later on August 29. On September 22, 1967, work began on the diversion tunnel that would allow the river to bypass the construction site. The tunnel was fully excavated by March 13 of the following year and lined with reinforced concrete by August. On September 7, a cofferdam was constructed and the diversion tunnel began to carry the flow of the Tuolumne. As the dam site dried out, the foundations were excavated down to bedrock; cracks in the rock were injected with so-called \\"dental concrete\\" to stabilize the foundation. Construction of the embankment began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam and all of the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule.ICOLD, p. 100 Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, the embankment was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material. After the clearing of over of the future reservoir site and the relocation of several roads that ran through it, the diversion tunnel was closed and water began to rise behind New Don Pedro. The rising lake submerged Old Don Pedro Dam on April 12, 1970 and inundated the Gold Rush town of Jacksonville by June. The powerhouse and penstocks were completed by August 1970, after lengthy delays and setbacks due to the sheer scale of the generators, pipes and gates used in their construction. Some of the individual components were so heavy that a truck delivering one of the penstock sections sank up to its trailer bed in the road, and another was crushed when the driver braked, inadvertently snapping the chains that held the load in place. The total cost of the New Don Pedro Dam project, including site preparations, reservoir clearing and road relocations, was $115,679,000. The dam was formally dedicated on May 22, 1971 to a crowd of over 3,000 people. Among the dedication ceremonies were a speech by San Francisco mayor Joseph Alioto and a beef barbecue hosted by TID. Design and usage Rising above its foundations and above the Tuolumne River, New Don Pedro is a massive earth and rock fill structure containing of material. The long dam is wide at the crest and over wide at the base. High water releases are controlled by four sets of gates. A set of internal gates in the diversion tunnel can release up to , while a hollow jet valve at the base of the dam can discharge . The service spillway, controlled by three radial gates, has a capacity of , and finally the emergency spillway, a long concrete overflow structure, can discharge more than . Don Pedro Reservoir is seen at near full capacity in 2005 The hydroelectric plant at the base of the dam has four generators capable of producing 203 MW combined. The TID's share is 139 MW or 68.47%, while MID receives 64 MW or 31.53%. Three generators, each with a capacity of 55 MW, were included in the original design of the dam while an additional 38 MW generator was incorporated in 1989. The plant generates an average of 618.4 million kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity each year, equal to an average output of 70.6 MW. The cities of Modesto and Turlock receive a large share of their power supplies from New Don Pedro Dam. Don Pedro Reservoir has a capacity of , of which is reserved for flood control and is available for irrigation, municipal water supply, and hydroelectric generation. The flood control reservation is one of the smallest among major California reservoirs because it allows for more water to be stored for power generation, but this has often resulted in inadequate flood protection such as in 1997 when the dam released more than ‚Äì almost six times the capacity of downstream levees. The bottom is considered dead storage, or the lowest point at which water can be released to generate power. At an elevation of (service spillway crest), the reservoir is long, and has an area of with of shoreline. The maximum elevation of the reservoir at the crest of the emergency spillway is above sea level. During construction of the dam, it was anticipated that the large size and scenic location of the reservoir, coupled with its proximity to urban centers, would make it a large tourist draw. A $40,000 plan was put forth to develop the reservoir for recreational activities. This entailed the construction of campsites, picnic areas, boat ramps, a landing strip, and hiking trails, including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake. Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in Central California, attracting 360,000‚Äì400,000 visitors each year. Future development In 1923, the same year that Old Don Pedro was completed, the City of San Francisco finished construction of O'Shaughnessy Dam, which forms a reservoir in the upper Tuolumne River's Hetch Hetchy Valley and is the focus of one of the most longstanding environmental controversies in United States history. Proponents of the dam's removal, including former Sierra Club president David Brower, suggest raising New Don Pedro Dam to replace the storage that would be lost with the draining of Hetch Hetchy. Increasing the height of New Don Pedro by just would add about to the reservoir's storage capacity, replacing most of the storage in Hetch Hetchy, though new tunnels would have to be built to deliver water from Don Pedro Reservoir to the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct and there would be a net loss of hydroelectric generation from O'Shaughnessy. Of note is that San Francisco is already entitled to of the water stored in Don Pedro, although this allocation is overruled by the senior water rights of the irrigation districts during dry years.Righter, p. 188 TID is currently investigating the feasibility of constructing a large pumped-storage hydroelectric plant on Lake Don Pedro in order to better meet peaking power demands without releasing extra water at New Don Pedro Dam. The proposed Red Mountain Bar Project would involve building a high dam across a canyon adjacent to Lake Don Pedro, creating a reservoir with a capacity of . Water would be pumped into this new reservoir using power generated at New Don Pedro Dam during periods of low electricity demand, while during high demand water would be released through a penstock to an 880 MW generating facility. As of September 2011, poor economic conditions had put the project \\"on hold indefinitely\\".

Early life Laodice was the second daughter of the Pontic monarchs Laodice VI and Mithridates V of Pontus. Her father was assassinated in about 120 BC in Sinope, poisoned at a lavish banquet he was hosting.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy p.68 In the will of her father, Mithridates V left the kingdom to the joint rule of her mother and her brothers: Mithridates VI and Mithridates Chrestus.

Laodice VI favoured Mithridates Chrestus over Mithridates VI. During her mother's regency, Mithridates VI had escaped from her plots against him and had gone into hiding. Between 116 and 113 BC Mithridates VI returned to Pontus from hiding and was hailed as King. He was able to remove his mother and brother from the Pontic throne and became the sole ruler of Pontus.

Through their marriage, Laodice became a Queen of Pontus. Laodice bore her brother four sons: Mithridates, Arcathius, Machares, Pharnaces II of Pontus and two daughters: Cleopatra of Pontus and Drypetina (a diminutive form of \\"Drypetis\\"). Laodice and Mithridates VI set about establishing good relations with the citizens of Athens and the Greek island of Delos. Laodice and her brother-husband made benefactions to the Athenians and the Delians. The exact nature of their benefactions and their voluntary donations are unknown.

Keller (February 4, 1913 ‚Äì December 25, 1977) was an American film and television editor with 24 feature film credits from 1958 - 1977.Birthdate confirmed at the Social Security Death Index.Filmography and awards based on . He is noted for the series of films he edited with director Peter Yates, for his four nominations for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (\\"Oscars\\"), and for the \\"revolutionary\\" car chase sequence in the film Bullitt (1968) that likely won him the editing Oscar. Career From 1942‚Äì1945, during the Second World War, Keller worked with editor Norval Crutcher on cataloging the film shot by combat cameramen in Europe. In 1949, Keller was editor Al Clark's assistant on All the King's Men (1949). From 1952-1956, Keller worked as an editor with Frank Capra on the first four films of The Bell Laboratory Science Series, sponsored by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Their work culminated with the 1956 televising (in color) of Our Mr. Sun, which was the first film of the series. The four films were Our Mr. Sun, Hemo the Magnificent (1957), The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays (1957), and Meteora: The Unchained Goddess (1958). Keller later edited the seventh and eighth films in the series, Thread of Life (1960) and About Time (1962), which were produced by Owen Crump for Warner Bros.. Keller's first editing credit on a feature film was for The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), which was a film noir directed by William Witney. In 1961 Keller edited Pocketful of Miracles, which was the last film directed by Frank Capra. Keller's television work included episodes from the series The Avengers (1962) and two episodes from the first season of Star Trek (1967‚Äì69). Keller is noted for editing six of the early films directed by Peter Yates, from Bullitt (1968) through Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976). His last feature film was for Rolling Thunder (directed by John Flynn-1977). Bullitt The car chase from Bullitt is likely the scene from Keller's work that is best remembered, and it has been extensively discussed over the years. Leonard Maltin has called it a \\"now-classic car chase, one of the screen's all-time best.\\" Emanuel Levy wrote in 2003 that, \\"Bullitt contains one of the most exciting car chases in film history, a sequence that revolutionized Hollywood's standards. Chasing the hoodlums, McQueen drives up and down the hills of San Francisco, while an impressive hand-held camera records the perilous pursuit and traffic in thrilling minutia detail, as his sexy vehicle narrowly misses intersecting cars and trucks; other barriers during the chase are pedestrians, buildings, and so on.\\" Paul Monaco has written, \\"The most compelling street footage of 1968, however, appeared in an entirely contrived sequence, with nary a hint of documentary feel about it -- the car chase through the streets of San Francisco in Bullitt, created from footage shot over nearly five weeks. Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a \\"character\\" in the film.\\" Recognition In 1957, Keller won an Emmy Award (Best Editing Of A Film For Television) for Our Mr. Sun. This database lists the film as the \\"AT&T; Science Series\\"; Our Mr. Sun was the first of nine programs in the series. Keller was nominated for the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award for A Pocketful of Miracles (1962). He won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing and the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award for Bullitt (1968), and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing. He was nominated for the Academy Award and for the ACE Eddie Award for three other films: Beach Red (directed by Cornel Wilde-1967), The Hot Rock (with Fred W. Berger; directed by Peter Yates-1972), and Jonathan Livingston Seagull (with James Galloway; directed by Hall Bartlett-1973). He was nominated for ACE Eddie Awards for Room 222 (1969 - best edited TV pilot) and for Gargoyle (1972 - best edited TV special).

In Japanese, it was called Tokubetsu Byoshitsu (ÁâπÂà•ÁóÖÂÆ§, Special Ward) or Jyu Kanbo (ÈáçÁõ£Êàø, Prison for Severe Crimes). Related history In 1909, the first public leprosy policy started in Japan, creating public leprosariums (sanatoriums) which accommodated wandering lepers; some of them criminals. In 1915, the treatment of criminals was discussed by leprosarium directors. In 1916, the leprosy prevention law was amended and this time, decisions of confinement and custody could be made by directors of leprosariums, reduction of meals (this was discontinued in 1947) and 30-day confinement in a leprosarium. Between 1912 and 1951, several riots took place in leprosariums. The prison Kusatsu Special Prison was completed at the end of 1938. There were 8 independent cells; each cell was less than 4.5m in size, with wooden floors with a hole as a latrine. There was a small hole for the distribution of meals. There was no heating system. The cells had tall walls and were physically separate from each other, each cell being a separate building entity. The temperature would often reach -20 ¬∞C.

Quoted in Carew p26 In 1972 he moved with his wife Betty to become pastor of the Hamilton Assembly of God. During his ministry there his influence extended outside his local church through a series of conferences on church growth that attracted many from other Pentecostal denominations as well. In 1975 he became a member of the executive of the NZ AoG. Leadership and influence In 1979 Williams followed Frank Houston as General Superintendent of the NZ AoG. He proved a dynamic leader, gaining popularity as a speaker with his regular programme on the newly formed Radio Rhema.

In October,1993 the Executive of the NZ AoG received a letter from the Australian Assemblies stating that Williams had been guilty of adultery while pastor at the Hamilton Assembly.Clark p223 Williams was replaced as Pastor of the Garden City Christian Church by his deputy Senior Pastor, Pastor Geoff Holdway. Holdway differed from Williams charismatic style by focusing on a more fundamental adherence and teaching of scripture. This was based on his background in the baptist theological seminary with a much more Pentecostal emphasis on scriptural interpretation. At this time Williams was pastoring in Australia. He lost his Australian credentials, but these were eventually returned after a time of counseling. However he remained barred from ministry in the NZ AoG due to a failure to make any efforts to put the matter right in New Zealand.Clark p223 In 2000 it became apparent that the extent of his sexual impropriety was much greater than admitted to the Australian body. His credentials in New Zealand were permanently revoked for \\"adulterous offences and other indiscretions involving different women over an extended period of years\\".Copy of letter from General Superintendent 2002Clark p223 Following this the Hamilton Assembly (Gateway Christian Centre) left the denomination.Clark p223,241 Late in life Williams was no longer associated with the Assemblies of God in Australia, and was pastoring a church The House of Praise in Springwood, Brisbane, Queensland.

He was born in 1922 in the Cordeaux Valley and also died there in 2004. Like the lost town of Sherbrooke near the Cataract Dam on the south coast of New South Wales, Cordeaux was a once-thriving community. It was resumed and par-flooded by the Sydney Catchment Authority who had earmarked the land for water collection as early as the 1860s, just a few years into the establishment of the area for major agriculture. The resumption began in 1901 and ceased in the early 1950s when only three parcels of freehold land remained (two owned by Ellis McNamara and one owned by Bruce Rees - these were eventually sold to the Sydney Catchment Authority in 2007). Most of the exodus occurred between 1943 and 1946, after a fruit fly epidemic had laid waste to most of the industry that had not already been depleted by the suffering of the Great Depression and Second World War. His family arrived in the area in the mid-1860s and by 1874 had settled, building a homestead on an existing orchard that was a landmark of the area. After purchase by the family in 1881, it survived until 2006. Career McNamara spent his life as an expert timber-getter, or self-referentially, a \\"bushman\\", and developed his poetry writing skills in his spare moments. Writings It was not until well into his retirement that what was initially a past time became serious and led to his publishing five books towards the end of his life. If it was not for his recording, researching and writing, it is doubtful that, having now disappeared almost without a trace, much would be known of the Cordeaux Valley/River settlement today along with other south coast New South Wales \\"drowned towns\\" such as Goondarrin Settlement, Kentish Creek, and Sherbrooke. The first book published was Memories of Cordeaux, in 1997. This was followed by Of Kembla Colliery and Other Verses (2000), Life at Cordeaux (2000), Village Greens (2003) and Winning Wollongong's Water (2004).

Legal process  When the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous. If the jury recommends death, it is required to record what it considers the \\"aggravating circumstances\\" about the crime that led it to that decision. In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, the judge issues a life sentence. There is no retrial over sentencing. The power of clemency belongs to the Governor of Mississippi.  Capital crimes  The following crimes are punishable by death in Mississippi: *Treason. *Murder with one of the following aggravating factors:Mississippi Code ¬ß 99-19-101 #It was committed by a person under sentence of imprisonment. #The defendant was previously convicted of another capital offense or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person. #The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons. #It was committed while the defendant was engaged, or was an accomplice, in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit, any robbery, rape, arson, burglary, kidnapping, aircraft piracy, sexual battery, unnatural intercourse with any child under the age of 12, or nonconsensual unnatural intercourse with mankind, or felonious abuse or battery of a child, or the unlawful use or detonation of a bomb or explosive device. #It was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody. #It was committed for pecuniary gain. #It was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement of laws. #It was committed to influence the policy of a governmental entity by intimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a governmental entity by mass destruction or assassination. #It was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel. #It was committed to intimidate or coerce a civilian population. The laws on the books in Mississippi also provide the death penalty for aircraft hijacking under Title 97, Chapter 25, Section 55 of the Mississippi Code, but in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Kennedy v. Louisiana, that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person. However, the ruling meant that crimes \\"against the state\\" such as treason or terrorism would not likely be unconstitutional. Therefore, the offence of aircraft hijacking would likely be considered a crime against the state in Mississippi because it is widely considered to be an act of terrorism and the death penalty in this case may be constitutional.

From the earliest recorded execution in 1818 through 2004, records indicate that the state executed a total of 794 people. Of these, the great majority were black males, who account for 639 of recorded executions. Around the time of the 1901 opening of the Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP), Sunflower County residents objected to having executions performed at MSP because they feared that Sunflower County would be stigmatized as a \\"death county.\\" Therefore, the State of Mississippi originally performed executions of condemned criminals in their counties of conviction.Cabana, Donald A. \\"The History of Capital Punishment in Mississippi: An Overview .\\" Mississippi History Now. Mississippi Historical Society. Retrieved on August 16, 2010. When, in 1940, Mississippi's state legislature decided to change the state's method of execution to electrocution, while continuing to conduct executions in the county of conviction, a portable electric chair was developed and fabricated for the state's use. On October 11, 1940, the state's first execution of a condemned prisoner by electrocution occurred; Hilton Fortenberry was electrocuted in his county of conviction, Jefferson Davis County. The state moved the electric chair from county to county, using it to kill condemned prisoners in their counties of conviction. Mississippi and Louisiana were the only U.S. states to use a portable electric chair. Around the 1950s residents of Sunflower County were still opposed to the concept of housing the execution chamber at MSP. In September 1954, Governor Hugh L. White called for a special session of the Mississippi Legislature to discuss the application of the death penalty. During that year, a gas chamber serving as an execution chamber was installed at MSP. The gas chamber replaced the portable electric chair which, between 1940 and February 5, 1952, had been moved from county to county to execute condemned prisoners. The first person to die in the gas chamber was Gerald A. Gallego, who was executed on March 3, 1955.\\"Mississippi and the Death Penalty.\\" Mississippi Department of Corrections.

The lethal injection table was first used in 2002. Since 1976, Mississippi has executed fewer prisoners than six other southern states despite comparable homicide rates. As of March 2013, 21 inmates were executed after 1976. One critic claims that this stems from the inability of poorer counties to afford legal fees for defendants accused of capital crimes. Because death penalty cases are subject to a high standard of review‚Äîand there is a constitutional requirement for effective assistance of counsel as a matter of Due process of law and subsequent appellate review‚Äîthis has led to a practical and constitutional impediment to its efficient operations.

Dietz had numerous confrontations with law enforcement over the rights of logging companies to pass logs through a dam that was partially on his property. The two most serious shootouts occurred in 1906 and 1910. History He was born April 3, 1861 in Winneconne, Wisconsin. For six years, he maintained a log dam on the Thornapple River. By the time the standoff ended he was a national hero. He was found guilty of murder and given a life sentence. A historical marker near the site reads: > In 1904, John F. Deitz and his family purchased a farmstead on the > Thornapple River about 2 miles south of here. Deitz soon discovered that > Cameron Dam -- one of many logging dams on this important tributary of the > Chippewa River -- lay on his property. He thereupon claimed that the > Chippewa Lumber & Boom Co., a Weyerhaeuser affiliate, owed him a toll for > logs driven downriver. For four years he refused to permit logs to be > sluiced down the Thornapple, defending \\"his\\" dam at gunpoint and > successfully resisting attempts to arrest him. At least one deputy and two > of Deitz's children were wounded in confrontations. In becoming an outlaw, > Deitz also became a folk hero with a nationwide following.

He played for the University of Michigan from 1903 to 1905. He was blamed for Michigan's 1905 loss to the University of Chicago, which ended the Wolverines' 56-game unbeaten streak. He committed suicide at a hotel in Salem, Oregon, in 1932. Early years and lineage A native of Detroit, Michigan, Clark was the son of the Rev. Rufus Wheelwright Clark (1844-1909),\\"Michigan Births, 1867-1902,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NQZY-QFX : 4 December 2014), William D. Clark, 21 Oct 1885; citing item 1 p 46 rn 681, Detroit, Wayne, Michigan, Department of Vital Records, Lansing; FHL microfilm 2,320,842. who served for many years as the rector at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Detroit, and Lucy (Dennison) Clark (1854-1928). His maternal grandfather was William Dennison, Jr. (1815-1882), who served as the 24th Governor of Ohio and as U.S. Postmaster General in the Cabinet of President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. University of Michigan Clark played football for Fielding H. Yost's \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams at the University of Michigan from 1903 to 1905. Clark was a versatile player who played at the halfback, fullback, and end positions. He was the fourth-leading scorer on the 1904 Michigan team with 10 touchdowns. 1905 Chicago game Western Championship Game vs Chicago In the final game of the 1905 season, Clark was blamed for Michigan's 2-0 loss to the University of Chicago, ending a 56-game unbeaten streak dating back to the first game of the 1901 season. Going into the final game of the season, the Wolverines were unbeaten, untied, and unscored upon. The two teams played to a scoreless tie for more than 50 minutes, when Clark was tackled for a safety as he attempted to return a punt from behind the goal line. The Detroit Free Press described the play as follows: > Eckersall, through failure of his team mates to advance it, was called upon > to punt. Chicago at the time was on Michigan's 43-yard line. Barlow and > Clark were playing back to take the kick, but the ball, low and well driven, > went between them. Clark went behind the line after the ball, with two > Chicago players down on him. there was hardly a chance to get away, and he > could have played it safe and avoided a score by merely touching the ball > down behind the line. He shook off the two tacklers, however, and tried to > run the ball back. He was a yard or so over the line on the field when > Carlin reached him, and threw him back, forcing him over his own goal line. > The result was a safety, two points, and the game, Chicago contenting itself > from that time on with kicking out of danger when it could not advance, > being satisfied to win by two points, if possible. After the game, newspapers described Clark's play as \\"the wretched blunder\\" and a \\"lapse of brain work.\\" Clark was reported to have been so despondent after the game that he was reported to have said, \\"O, this is horrible ... I shall kill myself because I am in disgrace.\\"Chicago American, December 1, 1905 However, Clark and his family denied the reports that he was suicidal. Two days after the game, the Detroit Free Press reported: > Denny Clark is alive and well. The plucky little football player, whose > error of judgment lost Michigan her five years' prestige on the western > gridiron, has not committed suicide, nor has he attempted anything of the > sort. He has not lost his reason, and he does not look as though he is in > immediate need of medical attention. Clark told the Free Press: \\"Everybody has been good to me, telling me it wasn't my fault, and so on. But it was my fault, and I haven't any excuses to make. It was a mistake for me to run out with the ball and I shouldn't have done it. I wish people would blame me. If they were only mad at me, because I lost the game, that would give me a chance to get mad too, and I could relieve my feelings.\\" On December 8, 1905, 3,500 supporters crowded into University Hall in Ann Arbor to support Michigan's football team. When Clark's name was mentioned, the crowd cheered for three minutes, \\"showing that Michigan stands by the Detroit lad, and forgives his mistake.\\" Under modern American football rules a safety would not be scored under these circumstances since a ball carrier is always credited for any forward progression prior to contact with an opponent. Legacy as the man \\"who lost the Michigan - Chicago football game\\" Clark became known for the rest of his life as \\"the man 'who lost the Michigan - Chicago football game in 1905.\\" In 1925, Michigan coach Yost wrote an article recounting a recent meeting with Clark, at which Clark constantly recalled his error against Chicago. Yost tried to set Clark at ease and wrote that \\"only Dennis still feels the pain of it.\\" In 1926, Chicago coach Amos Alonzo Stagg published an article in the Saturday Evening Post claiming that Clark had immediately withdrawn from school after the loss because \\"conditions at the university became intolerable.\\" Clark reportedly resented Stagg's article as he believed it had impugned both him and the University of Michigan. Clark stated that he went to his home in Detroit after the game, but he returned to the university after the Thanksgiving holiday and remained there until the school year ended in 1906. He then studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Later years In November 1908, Clark was appointed manager of Bell Telephone Company in Saginaw, Michigan He had previously been the company's manager at Hillsdale, Michigan. During World War I, Clark served as a captain in the United States Army Air Service. Clark married and had three children, Elizabeth, William Dennison, Jr., and Barbara. Suicide in 1932 In 1932, Clark committed suicide, shooting himself in a hotel room in Salem, Oregon. He had reportedly been despondent for a period, and hotel attendants reported that Clark \\"had been drinking considerably before he ended his life.\\" He left an unsent airmail letter to his wife with instructions on his life insurance. Clark also wrote that his decision to end his life was \\"not cowardice, but the very hardest thing I ever did.\\" He added, \\"Also I have tried everything else desperately and without success.\\" His suicide note also reportedly expressed hope that his \\"final play\\" would atone for his error at Marshall Field in 1905.Portland Oregonian and Detroit News, June 2, 1932 Clark was age 46 at the time of his suicide. In the year prior to his death, Clark had been living in Los Angeles, California.

History Washington Seminary (formerly Misses Washington's School for Girls) was founded in 1878 by Anita and Lois Washington, both of whom were great nieces of George Washington's half brother, Lawrence Washington. The school's roots are in a multi-week long visit that Anita paid to her aunt, Mrs. W. S. Walker, who asked Anita to teach her daughter, Lillie Walker. As time passed, Anita began teaching the younger daughters of the house and eventually neighboring children. Anita contacted her sister Lola, to help and Misses Washington's School for Girls was born. In 1878, Lola Washington was the first president of the school while Katie Washington Bond was the first matron.[3] The school was founded primarily as a college preparatory school for women and was located on West Peachtree Street near Baker Street. In 1881, the school moved to Church Street (renamed Carnegie Way) and it was in 1882 that the school was renamed to Washington Seminary. The school moved to Cain Street then to the corner of Walton and Fairlie Streets. In 1885 Mrs. Emily Stewart purchased the school from Miss Lola Washington and moved to a large Victorian house on Walton Street. During this time Mrs. Stewart became Mrs. Robert Park and under her leadership, the school prospered. In 1886, Washington Seminary was listed in the city directory under the aforementioned name, with its location listed as 50 Walton Street, Atlanta, Georgia, a three-story brick home formerly owned by George W. Harrison. In 1889, the school appeared in a half-page advertisement in the city directory listing the music department as part of Mr. Alfredo Barili's music school, the Art School director as Mr. H. W. Barnitz and the Principal as Mrs. Baylor Stewart. Mrs. Park retired in 1891 and sold Washington Seminary to Mrs. Alice Chandler. By 1898 new accommodations were needed again, and it was at this time that land was purchased and a building erected on North Avenue. In 1900, the school moved to 36 East North Ave with Mrs. W. T. Chandler as principal and Llewellyn D. Scott as assistant principal. In 1904 Mrs. Chandler died and was succeeded by her nephew and niece, Mr. Llewellyn D. Scott and Miss Emma B. Scott. Under their stewardship, new departments were added and the faculty was increased. As the enrollment grew it was obvious that another move would be necessary.1953 Facts and Fancies [yearbook], pgs. 2-3. This was the main building of Washington Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia, on Peachtree Street, in use from 1912-1953. In 1912, the school moved to an estate formerly known as La Colina, a name bestowed upon the land by Colonel Clifford L. Anderson, founder of Trust Company of Georgia who was also a lawyer and state legislator. The large property enabled them to add a modern school building to the grounds. Mr. Llewellyn Scott, with the help of his sister, Miss Emma Scott, directed the school with great success for the next 25 years. In 1917, the school hosted its first annual May Day event. Following Llewellyn D. Scott's death in 1937, his sister Emma Scott became the head of the school. In 1953, the school merged with Westminster Schools, a co- educational school. The \\"Home Building,\\" originally constructed in 1895, housed the school until 1953. In 1955 the building was torn down and replaced with the Riviera Motel.

Seidman's 2012 work is On Constitutional Disobedience, where Seidman challenges the viability of political policy arguments made in reference to constitutional obligation. Education and early career Seidman received an A.B. from University of Chicago and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1971. After graduation, he clerked for D.C. Circuit Judge Skelly Wright and later clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. Following his clerkship, Seidman joined the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia. Academic work and influence Seidman is known for his contributions to constitutional legal theory, principally his theory of unsettlement put forward in his book Our Unsettled Constitution: A New Defense of Constitutionalism and Judicial Review (Yale 2001). Drawing from the critical legal studies indeterminacy thesis, Seidman argues that because constitutional law cannot settle fundamental political disputes, constitutional legal discourse and judicial review instead act to \\"unsettle\\" them. Rather than resolving conflicts definitively, the temporary resolution of any controversy in constitutional law through judicial review leaves open the possibility that the losing side may make an equally plausible alternative constitutional argument. In this way, both the prevailing and losing sides in a dispute recognize their positions as unstable and subject to revision within the recognized standards of legal argument. As a result, both winners and losers have reasons to continue their debate within the framework of constitutional law, thereby keeping all parties at the table and consolidating the legal system. Seidman's defense of judicial review provided a counterpoint within the critical legal studies school to his colleague and sometime collaborator Mark Tushnet's attack on judicial review as undemocratic. In addition to Seidman's theory of judicial review, he is also known for his constitutional law casebook, co- authored with Pamela Karlan, Mark Tushnet, Geoffrey Stone and Cass Sunstein. Seidman is also noted for his work in criminal law and his book Silence and Freedom. During the Sonia Sotomayor confirmation hearings, Seidman also attracted attention as an outspoken liberal detractor,http://www.americanprinciplesproject.org/blogs/a-supporter- defects.html writing a scathing response to Sotomayor's claims that she simply applies the law to the facts (arguing that this is impossible to do). In 2009, Seidman was interviewed on Fora tv about healthcare policy in the United States, defending the constitutionality of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act against right-wing and pro-corporate criticism.

The clothes contain texts of Gita Govinda on them. Kenduli Khandua, a special form of Khandua of 12 ft and 2 kani (each kani measures the length of a hand) is offered to Jagannath to wear as khandua with stanzas and illustration from Gita Govinda.  Etymology  The word Khandua in Odia translates to the cloth worn in the lower half of the body. Traditionally Kentuli Khandua is offered to Jagannath as lower cloth. Due to the place of origin is Cuttak and Maniabandha, the other two names Kataki and Maniabandhi are originated.  History  Weaver communities of Maniabandha and Nuapatana of Cuttack traditionally weave this kind of pata. During the rule of Gajapatis Sarees are made and transported to Jagannath Temple. Paramananda Patanaika, the king of Badakhemundi (Nilakantha Deva) was offered khandua sari made of one piece of khandua silk called caukandika.  Color and Design  Khandua is traditionally red or orange in color. The red color is prepared naturally from the shorea robusta (sal tree). The design motif has an auspicious elephant that represents Buddha surrounded by trailing vine with peacocks in it, a large many petaled flower, a unique Orissan animal called Nabagunjara, a deula kumbha.

Early life and education  In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China. Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.  Career  Cui Tiankai with Barack Obama in the Oval Office, April 2013 Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly. After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences and then spokesmen for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan. In 2013, Cui was selected by the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then appointed by President Xi Jinping as the Ambassador to the United States.  Opinions  On March 6, 2013, Cui Tiankai was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. \\"The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is that whether Japan can accept a powerful China.\\" Cui said, \\"If Japan can realize and solve this problem in her mind, all the other problems can be solved easily.\\" On October 8, 2013, Cui Tiankai delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: \\"During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations.\\" \\"This is a downright incorrect viewpoint.\\" Cui emphasizes that, \\"Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.\\" In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: \\"There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!\\" On July 12, 2016, Cui Tiankai spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.

It was an expansion of the former Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line). NARS has been built for the United States Air Force (USAF) by Western Electric (AT&T;) and its sites were maintained under contract by ITT Federal Electric Corporation (now ITT Federal Services Corp.). All NARS stations were supervised and controlled by the USAF, by agreement with the Canadian and Danish Governments. Historical information Distant early warning systems in the North American Arctic by Robert Chasen ¬© Cambridge University Press 1967  In the early 1950s arctic surroundings and weather conditions of northern Canada made construction and manning of HF and VHF radio or microwave relay stations almost impossible. However there was an urgent need of reliable data and communication facilities from the radarstations in the north to their control centers in the south. The initial phase was using tropospheric scatter radio communication (troposcatter). Powerful radio signals in the kiloWatt range were bounced off the troposphere onwards to distant receiving stations using gigantic ‚Äòbillboard‚Äô like antennas picking up just a fraction of the transmitted signals which had been reflected back meaning that the antenna and equipment maintenance and alignment had to be executed very carefully. Construction of this system coded Polevault started in 1954, becoming ops in 1955 and becoming extended as of 1956. This troposcatter system had been supported by an undersea datacable system stretching from Thule airbase Greenland via Cape Dyer to Newfoundland Canada. The undersea cable system however appeared to be unreliable being cut many times by trawlers and icebergs so a better data transfersystem was definitely needed. As of 1962 the new Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system led to a gradual shut down of the Polevault system. SAGE consisted of large computers and associated networking equipment that coordinated data from many radar sites and processed it to produce a single unified image of the airspace over a wide area. SAGE directed and controlled the former North American Air Defense (NORAD) response to a Soviet air attack, operating in this role from the late 1950s into the 1980s. Construction of the large Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) radars at Thule airbase and at Fylingdales (UK) and another radar chain through Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands also called for new powerful troposcatter communication stations linking all radarsites to the NORAD Hq at Colorado (US). This communication chain became known as the North Atlantic Radio System (NARS). Equipment used Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 - 1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W. Johnson, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center The NARS used AN/FRC-39(V) and AN/FRC-56(V) transmitting and receiving equipment, manufactured by Radio Engineering Laboratories, which could be configured for 1 kW, 10 kW or 50 kW power output depending on the range and/or quality of signal required. NARS sites were configured for 10 kW output, with the exception of site 41 in both directions and site 42's connection to site 41. Each set consisted of 2 transmitters and 4 receivers, for redundancy and to boost signal to noise ratios, using vacuum tube technology which proved time consuming to maintain at high levels of efficiency. Levels of service proved extremely variable with the effects of weather and finicky equipment frequently causing loss of connection. Improvements were gained through better maintenance procedures but did not change significantly until the introduction of solid state technology, with the system able to transmit at 9.6kbit/s, (a very fast internet connection for that time), by the time the system was closed down in 1992 after 30 years of service. With the advent of satellite communications (SATCOM) the days of the Troposcatter networks were over, but NARS was closed down early due to the loss of the DYE-2 DEW Line station in 1988, severing the networks connection with the rest of the DEW line. Site 46 also had to close to make way for the new BMEWS Phased Array Radar at RAF Fylingdales. NARS sites From 1960 the troposcatter sites were built as: * Site 41 ‚Äì Rockville Air Station Keflavik at grid 64¬∞02‚Ä≤07‚Ä≥N 22¬∞39‚Ä≤16‚Ä≥W in the SW of Iceland 1952-1992 collected data of all Soviet aircraft in its detection range and passed the info to intercepting aircraft at Keflavik airfield. It also provided the comms link to DEW line sites in Greenland. Today the site is closed, the radar towers are gone and all buildings have been removed. * Site 42 ‚Äì H√∂fn, Iceland at grid 64¬∞14'38\\"N 14¬∞57'50\\"W was a dual-purpose troposcatter radio comms relay site sharing its location with the USAF/NATO radar station at Hofn from 1961 ‚Äì 1992 until its closure. The site was linked to Site 41 (Keflavik, Iceland) and to Site 43 at Sornfelli T√≥rshavn (Faroe Islands) by 235 and 292 mile shots respectively. Equipped with 2x 120 ft antennas for the Keflavik shot operating at 50 kilowatt the Sornfelli T√≥rshavn shot was accomplished by 2x 60 ft antennas operating at 10 kilowatt. The site also served in a secondary role as a relay site for transmissions originating along the DEW Line. When SATellite COMmunications made the troposcatter communications system obsolete, Site 42 was shut down along with the rest of the NARS system in 1988. Remaining idle through the end of manned ops at Hofn Air Station, the troposcatter antennas and support buildings have been demolished in the mid 1990s with the rest of the Air Station. The concrete blocks for the billboard antennas and feed horns still remain. * Site 43 ‚Äì T√≥rshavn, Faroe Islands Sornfelli Mtn at grid 62¬∞4'1\\"N 6¬∞58'0\\"W was a Danish installation (Island Command Faroes) and NATO early warning radar system consisting of 2 radars until closure in 2002. One of the radars is currently still operating as a civilian airtraffic control radar. * Site 44 ‚Äì RAF Mormond Hill at grid 57¬∞36'13\\"N 2¬∞1'58\\"W in the NE of Scotland was home to several troposcatter antennas respectively operated by USAF - providing comms to and from RAF Buchan - the British Army and British Telecom. After USAF closure the site was transferred to the MoD in 1993 and is now used for commercial British Telecom ops. * Site 46 ‚Äì RAF Fylingdales at grid 54¬∞21'32\\"N 0¬∞39'50\\"W station was built by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1962, and maintained by RCA (Great Britain), now Serco Group plc. RAF Fylingdales consisted of 3 geodesic radomes of 130-ft (40 m) diameter containing mechanically steered radar.

History The fountain of S√£o Jo√£o consisting of triangular pediment and backrest The Agnus Dei above the water spout, surrounded by phytomorphic elements Sculpture of the baptizing of Jesus Christ by John the Baptist The fountain dates to 1780, with the payment for the construction funded by Dr. Jo√£o Pedro de S√°, the juiz de fora for the town of Melga√ßo, who lived in the locality of Assadura. He was supported with donations from the nobility of the town of Melga√ßo. In 1903, the fountain was transferred to the Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica in the municipality. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blic was already punctuated with trees; the fountain was located in the area opposite the castle and old Conde de Ferreira Primary School. In May 1970, a ministerial dispatch approved the study into moving the fountain from eastern part of the Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica to the northeast corner of the square. From a document to the director of the Fine Arts School (in 1971), the DGEMN referred to the move of the fountain to the new location, be referred to the, then, uncompleted treatment of joints and connection to the public water system. The project presupposed a garden and landscaping of the space, limited to the corners and public access pavement. Finding that the location of the staircase would create difficulties, the DGEMN decided to solicit the municipal government technicians in order to conclude the project. Characteristics The fountain in located in an urban environment, situated on the northeast corner of the Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica, with a small landscaped area, with pavement running parallel. The zone is delimited by a masonry wall with stone bunks, which constitutes a small lookout over the residences of the town, and the Minho valley. The fountain consists of a tall vertical rectangular backrest and stone body, marked by a wider base and triangular pediment. Above the base are two Tuscan pilasters, that extend into the body, crowned by slender cone-type pinnacles. The triangular/gabled pediment is traced by the lines of the frieze and cornices, also surmounted by a pinnacle. The lower part of the backrest includes a spout, that extends from an anthropomorphic figure, with undulating hair, while the figure is flanked by two serpents, with heads of dragons. Surmounting these figures is a concave niche sheltering an Agnus Dei, with the inscription ECCE AGNUS DEI, surrounded by phytomorphic elements extending vertically. The niche is flanked by inscription stones, with the left panel showing Latin text, while the side opposite in Portuguese, both without rounded corners and 1780 date. Above this is another niche with flanking pilasters, forming a Roman arch, that shelter a sculpture of John the Baptist baptizing Christ. This niche is also surmounted by the Portuguese coat-of-arms in relief and shell. No alinhamento da bica, surge no embasamento bacia rectangular de perfil curvo.

Biography Inaba Masaaki was the third son of the daimy≈ç of Yodo Domain in Yamashiro Province, Inaba Masachika On his father's death, he received a 3000 koku stipend and was allowed to establish his own hatamoto household. In August 1737, he became a page to Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieharu, and received Lower 5th Court Rank and the courtesy title of Etchu-no-kami . He was promoted steadily through the ranks of the hatamoto with the support of Tanuma Okitsugu, gaining 2,000 koku in Hitachi and Kazusa Provinces in 1769, an additional 2,000 koku in Awa Province in 1777, and 3,000 koku more in Awa and Kazusa in September 1781. This last grant qualified him for the status of daimy≈ç, and he was allowed to revive Tateyama Domain in Awa Province, which had been dormant since the fall of the Satomi clan in 1614. In May 1784, he changed his courtesy title to Echizen-no-kami, and in 1785 received an additional 3,000 koku in Awa Province. However, after the death of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieharu and the assassination of Tanuma Okitsugu, he was included in the purge of Tanuma's followers by Matsudaira Sadanobu and lost 3000 koku of his holdings, as well as the domain's residence in Edo. He retired from public life on July 8, 1789, turning Tateyama Domain over to his 4th son, Inaba Masatake. Inaba Masaaki was married to a daughter of Toda Ujifusa, daimy≈ç of Ogaki-Shinden Domain in Mino Province. He died on August 5, 1793 and his grave is at the temple of K≈çfuku- ji in Sumida, Tokyo.

It fought mostly with the Army of Northern Virginia. The 1st Texas Infantry Regiment was assembled at Richmond, Virginia, in August, 1861, with ten companies from Marion, Cass, Polk, Houston, Harrison, Tyler, Anderson, Cherokee, Sabine, San Augustine, Newton, and Nacogdoches counties. Later two companies from Galveston and Trinity County were added to the command. Part of Hood's Texas Brigade, it served under Generals Hood, J.B. Robertson, and John Gregg. The regiment fought with the Army of Northern Virginia from Seven Pines to Cold Harbor except when it was detached with Longstreet at Suffolk, Chickamauga, and Knoxville. It was involved in the Petersburg siege north and south of the James River and later the Appomattox Campaign. This unit had 477 effectives in April, 1862 and lost 186 of the 226 engaged at Sharpsburg, a casualty rate of 82.3% percent.Brigade Marker No. 324 (Wofford's Brigade), Antietam National Battlefield This staggering casualty rate was the highest suffered by any regiment, North or South, on a single day, during the entire war.Otott Jr., George E. \\"First Texas Infantry - A History In incurring these losses during ferocious fighting in Miller's cornfield the regiment lost a battle flag which was picked up by federal troops when they re-occupied the cornfield (the First Texas having previously withdrawn without noticing the loss of their flag). The highest number of casualties, on the other hand, was suffered by the 26th North Carolina Infantry at the battle of Gettysburg. They suffered 72% casualties out of the 820 engaged. The 1st Texas suffered more than twenty percent of the 426 during the same engagement. It surrendered with 16 officers and 133 men. The field officers were Colonels Frederick S. Bass, Hugh McLeod, Alexis T. Rainey, and Louis T. Wigfall; Lieutenant Colonels Harvey H. Black, Albert G. Clopton, R.J. Harding, and P.A. Work; and Majors Matt. Dale and John R. Woodward. The 1st Texas also lost a battle flag on April 8, 1865, at Appomattox Court House when it was captured by 1st Lt. Morton A. Read of the 8th New York Cavalry. Read earned the Medal of Honor for this deed. Battle of Gettysburg On July 2, 1863 Brigadier General Jerome Robertson and his Texas Brigade arrived at Gettysburg around 9:00 A.M. Among the regiments under the command of Robertson was the 1st Texas Infantry. The 1st Texas fought hard during its time at Gettysburg and achieved much for fighting with lesser numbers than the enemy. Lieutenant Colonel Phillip A. Work commanded the 1st Texas and successfully took the major objectives that he was assigned to take. Robertson and his Texas Brigade arrived at their position on Seminary Ridge, along with the rest of the Confederate forces, and quickly organized his regiments left to right with the 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment on the left, then the 1st Texas, 4th Texas, and 5th Texas. Soon after arrival on Seminary Ridge, both Union and Confederate artillery opened fire. According to General R. H. Anderson, the ridge that the enemy forces sat on was about twelve hundred yards away from the ridge that the Confederate forces positioned on. Anderson also mentioned that the area between the two ridges was ‚Äúslightly undulating, enclosed by rail and plank fences and under cultivation.‚Äù For nearly an hour the Confederate troops stood in formation as the Union artillery collided with their lines. The troops of the 1st Texas infantry jumped as the cannon fire hit around them, as did the rest of the Confederate forces, but stood strong in their formation. The order to charge and take the heights was finally issued. As soon as he received the order, Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Work ran to the front of his regiment, pointed to his regiments flag and yelled ‚ÄúFollow the Lone Star Flag to the top of the mountain!‚Äù. Robertson and his Texas Brigade faced many problems almost as soon as they moved off their original position on Seminary Ridge. The Federal batteries in The Peach Orchard area and above Devil's Den increased their fire. Robertson ordered the men to throw down a rail fence that obstructed their path. As soon as this obstruction was out of the way the men moved across Emmitsburg Road and continued forward. Robertson now faced a problem caused by Evander M. Law's Brigade. Robertson had orders to keep his left on Emmitsburg Road and his right on Law's left but Law's Brigade bore too sharply to the right and a large gap formed in the middle of Robertson's forces. The 3rd Arkansas and 1st Texas stubbornly stuck to the Emmitsburg Road while the 4th and 5th Texas regiments stuck with Law's forces. The 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment and 1st Texas now advanced to the west branch of Plum Run (Rock Creek) near the Timber's House and the Rose Woods. At this point the gap in Robertson's forces was over one hundred yards. Robertson tried to move his regiments back together but they were already engaged and so it became impossible. Robertson quickly made the decision to stick with the left wing and sent a message to Evander M. Law telling him to watch out for the 4th and 5th Texas. The 1st Texas Infantry now moved up toward the triangular field and as soon as they were in the open started receiving artillery fire from Smith's battery on Houck's Ridge. The Texans continued moving until they reached a stone wall at the base of the triangular field. The 1st Texas found some safety behind this stone wall because the guns of Smith's battery could not depress far enough to fire on them. The troops formed two lines behind the wall with the front line kneeling behind the wall and the back line standing behind them. The Texans quickly opened fire on Smith's gunners and silenced the guns on the ridge. The men now jumped over the stone wall and rushed forward towards the guns but confusion soon followed. Part way up the hill the regiment heard orders to retreat and so they began to fall back but then received more orders that countermanded the first. Private James Bradfield recalled ‚ÄúNo one seemed to know whence it came, nor from whom‚Äù. This first rush at the enemy made it within fifty yards of Smith's battery but was quickly repelled by the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment and Ward's Brigade. Next the Texans regrouped and pushed slowly forward a few feet at a time but they were once again repelled by the artillery atop the ridge and the 124th New York. The 124th now charged into the line of the 1st Texas and drove them back down the rocky slope. The 1st Texas infantry fell back to the southwest wall of the triangular field and held their ground here. As the New Yorkers charged through the open terrain and got within one hundred feet of the wall, the Texans opened fire and ‚Äúdropped nearly one-quarter of them in their tracks‚Äù. The 124th of New York now surged forward once again but they had gone as far as they could go because Brigadier General Henry Benning's Brigade had arrived to support the tired Texans. Benning began striding back and forth yelling ‚Äúgive them hell boys!‚Äù. Benning's left regiment, the 15th Georgia, now pressed up into the 1st Texas line to relieve them. The Texans refused to back down and so the two regiments mixed together, much to the displeasure of Colonel Work. Work didn't want the Georgians disrupting his line and thought that it would have been better if Benning had flanked the enemy from the side instead. The two regiments could not be separated in the middle of the battle and so they fought as one single unit for the remainder of the evening. This support from Benning caused the 124th New York to fall back to their original position and the Confederate soldiers pushed forward into the rocks on Devil's Den. The battery atop Devil's Den continued firing for as long as they could but were soon overrun by the pressing Confederate forces. The two comingled regiments of the 1st Texas and the 15th Georgia were soon joined by the 20th Georgia and 44th Alabama and together they took on the combination of the remainder of the 124th New York, the 4th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and the 99th Pennsylvania Infantry regiments. After a short, close range melee the Confederates pushed off the Union and the capture of Devil's Den was official. The 1st Texas had managed to hold their ground long enough for reinforcements to arrive and it paid off for them greatly. The Confederates had captured the four guns of Smith's battery and took between one hundred forty and two hundred prisoners from their victory but the day wasn't over yet for the 1st Texas Infantry. Over to the left, the 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment had not made any progress and so General Robertson ordered Colonel Work to leave two companies of his men on Houck's Ridge and to move the rest of his regiment to help support the 3rd Arkansas. The 1st Texas moved to support the 3rd Arkansas and when they arrived they were met with even more support from the 11th Georgia Infantry and 59th Georgia. Together these forces moved toward the enemy line in this area but the Federal troops in this area were too strong to move and every attack failed. The Confederates kept up the attack and eventually the growing pressure on the Federal line became so great that Ward's brigade and the 17th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment had to fall back. The 1st Texas regiment continued to move across the ridge north of Devil's Den, capturing Union soldiers along the way and eventually got to a position that they could fire at Winslow's battery on Little Round Top. Brooke's Union brigade now advanced through the Wheatfield but Colonel Work and the 1st Texas Regiment were ready and waiting. The 1st Texas and the 15th Georgia were sitting atop Houck's Ridge and as Brooke approached, Colonel Work ordered his regiment to put an enfilading fire into Brooke's men. As the enemy forces grew, the 1st Texas was forced to fall back towards the field. Colonel Work quickly became concerned about his ability to withdraw his troops and so he ordered the color bearer and some of his men to maintain their position while the rest of the regiment moved to the rear. Unfortunately this plan didn't work because the men refused to leave their flag behind and so the men stayed and continued to fight the Federal reinforcements by raking Brooke's left. The 1st Texas continued their fight until the evening then nightfall brought the end to the day's battles. Around 2:00 A.M. on July 3, the 1st Texas and 3rd Arkansas moved to their right in order to rejoin the rest of Robertson's Brigade. All of the men were exhausted so they tossed down their gear in front of Little Round Top and got whatever sleep they could. Confederate officers feared an attack from the enemy and so they awakened the men to erect breastworks soon after they had fallen asleep. Major John Bane reported that by dawn the breastworks stood two feet high. Robertson's Brigade stayed in this position through the majority of the day and only participated in some skirmishing in their front. Many men were killed or wounded by the sharpshooting that proceeded through the day as well as the cannonade that preceded Pickett's Charge. Around 3:00 P.M., Colonel Work received an order to move his 1st Texas regiment south to help defend against an anticipated cavalry charge. As the 1st Texas approached the Bushman house they were ordered to knock down part of the wooden fence that obstructed their path. The men proceeded another two hundred yards to take position behind a short stone wall near the edge of the Bushman Woods. Due to many losses from the day before, the 1st Texas didn't have enough men to properly cover the wall and so they deployed in a single thin line along the length of the stone wall. Work sent several units out to his left and right in order to protect against any flanking attacks. On the left flank, the men of the 1st Texas tore down a staked fence and rebuilt it beside the stone wall. Reilly's battery also took position about two hundred fifty yards behind the Texans. The men had just barely completed constructing their breastworks when the 1st West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment appeared. Private W. T. White of the 1st Texas noted that ‚Äúthey formed line of battle in plain view of us and charged. We held our fire until they were within fifty or sixty yards of us, when, taking deliberate aim, we fired on them, bringing down many men and horses.‚Äù The cavalry then retreated to their original position to regroup and then charged once again but were repelled just like the first time. The cavalry continued to charge and at this point the Texans had fired off their guns and so they used the butts of their guns as the cavalry got close. Private James Henderick also stated that many of the cavalry came up within a few feet of the 1st Texas regiment and so the men knocked them off their horses with rocks and whatever else they could find. The 1st Texas continued to kill many of the charging cavalrymen captured over one hundred prisoners. The men of the 1st Texas only got a short reprieve before the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry arrived and charged their position. The Texans once again repelled the enemy and as Private White stated, ‚Äúhaving repulsed the second charge, we felt that we could almost whip all the cavalry the enemy had.‚Äù The Union cavalry continued to make demonstrations against the 1st Texas for another two hours but Texan line held strong. As the evening rolled around, Robertson's Brigade received orders to move around the right flank to their original jump off position on Seminary Ridge. Robertson's brigade was not fully utilized during July 2 and their problems arose almost as soon as they stepped off their position on Seminary Ridge. Even with these problems that their brigade faced, the 1st Texas regiment managed to achieve their major objectives. Colonel Work and the 1st Texas managed to take Devil's Den and Houck's Ridge through utilizing their terrain such as the stone walls of the triangular field. Even with their smaller forces, the 1st Texas managed to take these objectives and it is a testament to those men and their commander. The Texans then continued on to repel a massive Federal cavalry charge when they barely had enough men to cover their position. The use of terrain once again helped the 1st Texas and led them to a victory in their endeavors. This impressive regiment fought hard during their time at the battlefield and finally got a rest when they were ordered to retreat from Gettysburg late the night of July 4.

It is a London borough council, one of 32 in the United Kingdom capital of London. Haringey is divided into 19 wards, each electing three councillors. As of 2020, Haringey London Borough Council comprises 36 Labour Party councillors, 15 Liberal Democrats and 6 Independent councillors, all of whom had been expelled or suspended from Labour. History There have previously been a number of local authorities responsible for the Haringey area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the London Borough of Haringey on 1 April 1965. It replaced three local authorities: Hornsey Borough Council, Tottenham Borough Council and Wood Green Borough Council. It was envisaged through the London Government Act 1963 that Haringey as a London local authority would share power with the Greater London Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \\"wide area\\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for \\"personal\\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. As an outer London borough council it has been an education authority since 1965. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Haringey London Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a \\"most purpose\\" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions. In 2017, the Council proposed a partnership with Lendlease Group for developing council-owned land known as the Haringey Development Vehicle, which was controversial locally. The subsequent political fall-out led to the resignation of council leader Claire Kober. Powers and functions The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation. Haringey has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. It is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. The council shares responsibility with the Greater London Authority for strategic policies including housing, planning and the environment.

Yvette Pierpaoli (18 March 1938 - 18 April 1999) was a French humanitarian who lived in Cambodia and worked in many countries around the world. John le Carr√© dedicated his novel The Constant Gardener to her. Early life Pierpaoli was born in Le Ban-Saint-Martin, the fifth child of an Italian father and a French mother. She first became interested in the Far East during a geography lesson about Indochina. Her turbulent character manifested itself in an aggressive attitude towards her family and classmates, earning her the nickname \\"the pest\\". After leaving school at the age of fifteen, Pierpaoli found a job as an office clerk. During this time she became interested in amateur radio communication and became one of the first French amateur radio operators. In 1958, after a confrontation with her father, she left the family home and went to Paris.Pierpaoli, Yvette. Woman of a Thousand Children, p. 18. Unpublished English translation of La Femme Aux Milles Enfants Paris: Robert Laffont, 1992 Indochinese refugees Pierpaoli came into contact with the Asian community in Paris. After a love affair with a Kampuchean medical student, she became pregnant and had a daughter. In 1967, aged 29, she traveled to Cambodia with her baby daughter. In Phnom Penh she proved to be an excellent businesswoman, selling small planes, tractors and chemicals and trading in rice. By 1974, a large number of refugees were pouring into Phnom Penh, fleeing the advance of the Khmer Rouge. Moved by their plight, Pierpaoli devoted much of her time to helping refugee children, adopting one of them and supporting many others. She became head of Continental Air Services, Inc in Cambodia, which flew regularly between Phnom Penh and Bangkok on behalf of the U.S. Embassy and other organizations. She was described by a journalist as \\"an adventurer with a big heart, works for the CIA.\\" Pierpaoli denied working for the CIA, although the CIA was a source of funding for Continental.Thompson, Larry Clinton.

He described her as a \\"small, sparky, tough, brown-eyed provincial Frenchwoman\\" with \\"an absolutely non-negotiable, visceral requirement...to get food and money to the starving, medicines to the sick, shelter for the homeless, paper for the stateless...This did not in any way prevent her from being a resourceful and frequently shameless businesswoman, particularly when she was pitched against people whose cash, in her unshakable opinion, would be better in the pockets of the needy.\\"Le Carre, John \\"The Constant Muse\\" The Observer Saturday, 24 Feb 2001, https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/25/fiction.features2, accessed 20 Aug 2012 As Phnom Penh came under siege by the Khmer Rouge, Pierpaoli moved to Bangkok. After the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, she began visiting refugee camps on the border of Thailand to help Cambodians who fled their country and sought refuge in Thailand. Plying the border with a small car, she brought them food and medicine and took into her house in Bangkok as many as she could help escape. In 1979, the Thai government forcibly repatriated thousands of Cambodian refugees. Pierpaoli, along with American Lionel Rosenblatt, rescued as many refugees as possible before they were forced across the border, especially at Preah Vihear Temple, where 40,000 Cambodians were pushed off a cliff into a minefield. Thousands died as they attempted to cross the minefield.Thompson, p. 174-178 Refugees International In 1985, Pierpaoli left her business and returned to France, settling near Uz√®s. She met a young monk from Guatemala, who described the plight of his country, just emerging from civil war. She founded a charity, collected money and went to Zaculeu, a village in Guatemala. Joined by several volunteers, she undertook to rebuild the houses, to dig wells and to return the land to cultivation, demonstrating that \\"a single person can sometimes achieve what large organizations cannot....I realized what made me different from others in how I conceptualized humanitarian work. They assumed that a project had to have ideas, personnel, and materials, and funds, all the elements of a project, first. In my mind, things happened in the opposite way....The idea of having to decide in advance how things were going to happen in order to arrive at a fixed objective seemed unnatural to me.\\"Pierpaoli, pp 207-208 Pierpaoli published her autobiography Woman of a Thousand Children in 1992 and became the European Representative of Refugees International (RI) the same year.

This is the only Indian naval air station without a full-fledged runway to operate fixed-wing aircraft. INS Shikra is primarily a heliport. Visiting fixed wing naval aircraft use the city's Mumbai International Airport or the Juhu Aerodrome.  History  NAS Kunjali was commissioned as a new establishment in Mumbai, post-Independence. The locale chosen for the establishment was the old Gun Carriage Basin on the sea front in Colaba, in the heart of South Mumbai. The area was used during the Second World War as a depot for munitions of war and as a boat repair facility. With the acquisition of Allouette III helicopters (now HAL Chetak) in 1963, the establishment was considered suitable for a helipad. The first time a helicopter operated from the base was on a temporary grass helipad in 1964. Allouette flights thereafter continued to operate from the helipad, on a makeshift and as required basis. Finally, on 3 April 1972 ‚ÄòBombay flight‚Äô of the Goa-based INAS 321 was established with one Allouette III helicopter, two pilots and 17 sailors. On 1 August 1980, one more Chetak was added to the flight and the role of the squadron was enhanced to include VIP flight commitment, Fleet Requirement task including tracking for weapon alignment, casualty evacuation and SAR duties. With the introduction of helicopters on board ships, the base housed and operated these helicopters, when disembarked and a helicopter maintenance facility was set up in 1983. The Naval Air Station was renamed to INS Shikra in an impressive commissioning ceremony presided over by the Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, AVSM, PVSM, ADC on 22 January 2009.  Objective  INS Shikra has grown from a small helipad to a full-fledged Air Station providing support and maintenance facilities to the integral flights of the fleet and aviation requirements of the Western Naval Command. The facilities continue to expand to cater for increasing numbers of helicopters being inducted on board ships. Its primary role is to provide administrative, technical and logistic support for all squadrons and flights based in Mumbai. In addition, it undertakes coastal patrol, air surveillance in the area and meets the operational flying requirements of the Western Naval Command. It also has a major helicopter maintenance depot providing accommodation and maintenance facilities for Westland Sea Kings, Kamov Ka 27s and HAL Chetaks, adding up to 17 helicopters and meeting a task of over 4000 flying hours annually.

In most navies, the rank's insignia may consist of two medium gold braid stripes, the uppermost stripe featuring an executive curl in many Commonwealth of Nations; or three stripes of equal or unequal width.

Davies, Gentlemen and Tarpaulins (Oxford University Press, 1991, ), p. 40 and thereafter their seniority was dated from the passing of this examination. A lieutenant was numbered by his seniority within the ship on which he served, so that a frigate (which was entitled to three) would have a first, a second, and a third lieutenant. A first-rate ship was entitled to six, and they were numbered accordingly. At first, a lieutenant's commission was given only for the particular ship in which he served, but after the loss of HMS Wager in 1741 and the subsequent mutiny, the Royal Navy changed its policy and lieutenants were given more general commissions upon passing their examination. During the early days of the naval rank, some lieutenants could be very junior indeed, while others could be on the cusp of promotion to captain; those lieutenants ranged across present-day army ranks from a second lieutenant through to a lieutenant colonel. As the rank structure of navies stabilized, and the ranks of commander, lieutenant commander, and sub- lieutenant were introduced, the rank of naval lieutenant became less wide- ranging and is today the equivalent of an army captain (NATO OF-2 or US O-3). Promotion In the United States Navy, promotion to Lieutenant is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest that 95% of lieutenants (junior grade) should be promoted to lieutenant after serving a minimum of two years at the lower rank. In the Royal Navy, promotion to Lieutenant is done in line with seniority. Officers are typically promoted after serving as a Sub- Lieutenant (OF-1) for 30 months. However, promotion may be quicker if a candidate has previous naval service and commissions from the ranks (Upper Yardsman/Senior Upper Yardsman). Rank insignia The insignia of a lieutenant in many navies, including the Royal Navy, consists of two medium gold braid stripes (top stripe with loop) on a navy blue or black background. This pattern was copied by the United States Navy and various air forces for their equivalent ranks grades, except that the executive curl is removed (see flight lieutenant). {align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  50x100px  50x100px  50x100px  50x100px  50x100px  100x100px  50x100px  50x100px  50x100px  100x100px  50x100px  50x100px  50x100px - align=\\"center\\"  Estonia  France  Germany  Greece  India  Iran  Poland  Portugal  Romania  Spain  United Kingdom  Canada  United States } \\"First lieutenant\\" in naval usage The first lieutenant (1st Lt or 1LT) in the Royal Navy and other Commonwealth navies, is a post or appointment, rather than a rank. Historically, the lieutenants in a ship were ranked in accordance with seniority, with the most senior being termed the first lieutenant and acting as the second-in-command. Although lieutenants are no longer numbered by seniority, the post of \\"first lieutenant\\" remains. In minor war vessels, destroyers and frigates, the first lieutenant (either a lieutenant or lieutenant commander) is second in command, executive officer (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships, where a commander of the warfare specialisation is appointed as the executive officer, a first lieutenant (normally a lieutenant commander) is appointed as his deputy. The post of first lieutenant in a shore establishment carries a similar responsibility to that of the first lieutenant of a capital ship. In the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard, the billet of first lieutenant describes the officer in charge of the deck department or division, depending on the size of the ship. In smaller ships that have only a single deck division, the billet is typically filled by an ensign; while in larger ships, with a deck department consisting of multiple subordinate divisions, the billet may be filled by a lieutenant commander. On submarines and smaller Coast Guard cutters, the billet of first lieutenant may be filled by a petty officer.

Accessed 27 Sept. 2020 C. madagascariense is endemic to the interior of Madagascar and can be found in lower montane forests, at forest margins, in disturbed forest, or in areas of open ground at elevations between 800 and 1000 meters. It is found principally in the central (Analamazaotra and around Moramunga, east of the capital Antananarivo) and southeast (Ranomafana National Park and around Ifanadiana) regions where it receives sufficient rainfall. The culms are tall and erect, usually between 10 and 15 meters but occasionally reaching up to 22 meters; with arching or drooping upper sections often leaning on nearby trees or vegetation for partial support. Culm diameters vary between 5 and 8 (up to 12) cm in diameter with internodes between 40-60 cm. Young shoots are pale to purplish green and covered with sharp, stiff, black to brown hairs. The rhizomes have very long, narrow necks, 2 to 4 meters long, which help it to spread much more rapidly than most clumping forms of bamboo. Shoots are quite bitter and have high concentrations of cyanide. Flowers are both determinant and hemispherical, an unusual form for bamboos.id. It is the main food source for several species of bamboo lemurs, the only primates to subsist principally on bamboo. The destruction of the C. madagascarensis habitat due to slash and burn agriculture and over harvesting of natural stands has drastically reduced the range of both the greater bamboo lemur and especially the golden bamboo lemur.

Regalia of the Russian tsars are the insignia of tzars and emperors of Russia from the 13th to the 20th centuries. Some of the artefacts were changed or substituted, the most radical change happened in the 18th century, when Peter the Great reformed the state and transitioned it to European-style monarchy. After the Russian Revolution the great number of the Romanovs' was sold by the Bolsheviks, but the most important coronation regalia were placed in the Kremlin Armoury. Since 1967 they are displayed as a part of Diamond Fund permanent exposotion. Oldest Russian regalia \\"Cap of Monomakh\\" and Kazan Crown. Alexey Mikhailovich From the 13th up to the end of 14th century the main insignia of knyaz power were the decorated barmas and the knyaz belts. A barma is a neck-piece or a mantle made of gold, encrusted with gems and diamonds. Such treasured items were hereditary and closely connected to the knyazs' names, they were always mentioned in the wills. =The Barmas = Barmas of Old Ryazan were produced by masters of Old Ryazan in late 12th - early 13th century. They are one of the greatest masterpieces of ancient jewellery. The barmas belonged to the local knyaz family, but in 1237 the city was completely destroyed by Batu Khan, so the forsaken jewellery laid underground for nearly 600 years. In 1822, the royal barmas were found by archeologists and brought to the Kremlin Armory. These precious barmas are the high-craft masterpieces, enamelled and encrusted with gems. Some of the barmas have gold medallions with engravings in Greek, presumably of the Byzantine origin. =The Monomakh's Cap= \\"Cap of Monomakh\\" The oldest crown is the \\"Cap of Monomakh\\" or Crown of Monomakh, used in the ceremony of crowning a monarch in Russia. Its name is connected with a Russian legend of the 15th century, according to which it has been brought to Russia in ancient times as a gift from the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Monomachos. The cap is of oriental workmanship of the late 13th or early 14th century. The question of its origin is still unspecified. The oldest section of the crown consists of eight gold plates adorned with very fine gold lace in a pattern of six-pointed rosette-stars and lotus blossoms. The semi-spherical top with a cross, the sable trimming and the pearls and gemstones belong to a later period. It weighs 698 grams and is the lightest Russian crown. Since the late 14th till the late 17th century, the Cap of Monomakh a symbol of power, was used in the ceremony of setting the ruler of the Russian State for reigning. In the first quarter of the 18th century, after Peter the Great's reforms, the ceremonial setting for reigning was replaced by coronation, the main attribute of which became the imperial crown. Since the 18th century the Cap of Monomakh served as the heraldic crown of the \\"Tsardom of Great, Little and White Russia\\". = The Kazan Crown= Kazan crown This 16th century crown is the second oldest in Russia. The gold crown is studded with pearls, garnets, and turquoises. The sable-fur trimming was for comfort. The Kazan Crown is dated by 1553. It was first mentioned in the treasury of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, whose reign was marked by a series of important events in Russian history. Among them is the capture of Kazan in October 1552 and annexation of the Kazan khanate to the Russian state. The precious crown might have been executed by Moscow Kremlin jewelers on the successful solution of \\"The Eastern problem\\", so important for Muscovy. Its name might have immortalized the memory of the glorious victory of Russian warriors. The crown's look combines national and eastern artistic traditions. Some elements are reminiscent of the decor traditions of Russian churches of the epoch. At the same time, the combination of stones, e.g. red tourmalines and rubies with blue turquoise and the carved ornament of knitting herbs on a niello background represent oriental artistic influence. It may have belonged to Ediger Mahmet, the last ruler of the Tatar (Tartar) state of Kazan. Since the 18th century this crown served as the heraldic crown of the \\"Tsardom of Kazan\\". =The Ivory Throne= Ivory throne of Ivan IV The Ivory throne is earliest preserved tsars throne of the mid-16th century. The throne was made of wood faced with plates of ivory and walrus tusk, therefore it was called the \\"carved bone armchair\\". The carved ornament unites the various subjects and representations into a single composition. Decorative scenes include images from Greek mythology and the Old Testament. The depicted themes, the style of the carving and the motifs, which include grotesques and Cupids, enable researches to date most of the pieces to the 16th century and attribute them to Western European Renaissance craftsmen. This bone throne has been renovated several times in Russia: worn pieces of bone were remade by local craftsmen; in 1856, on the occasion of the coronation of Emperor Alexander II, the throne was decorated with a gilded silver two-headed eagle. Regalia of Boris Godunov * Golden throne In addition to the bone chair the showcase includes a throne of oriental workmanship executed in the late 16th century. Having been presented by Shah Abbas I to Tsar Boris Godunov it was called a \\"Persian throne with stones\\". The form of the throne with its low back flowing into sloping arm-rests, reveals features typical of Iranian furniture of the 16th-17th centuries. The makers have used ornament beloved in the East, i.e. strips of gold decorated with a foliate pattern and coloured stones - blue turquoises and red rubies, tourmalines. The back of the seat, the arms and the whole lower section of the throne were covered with gold Persian fabric, replaced by French velvet in 1742 for the coronation of Empress Elizabeth. In total this throne is adorned 552 rubies and pink tourmalines, 825 turquoises, 177 pearls and 700 halves of pearls. Scepter and orb are creations of West-European jewelry of Late Renaissance. By the way, the enamels on relief technique was not known to Russian goldsmiths of that time. There are reasons to consider the scepter and orb to belong to the set of gifts, brought to Tsar Boris Godunov in 1604 by the Great Embassy of Rudolf II, Emperor of the Great Roman Empire. The scepter and orb, miraculously survived through the Time of Troubles, must have been used in 1613 in crowning of Michael Fyodorovich, first Tsar of the Romanov Dynasty. For later on during the whole reigning of Michael Fyodorovich they were unique regalia of the kind and belonged to the so-called \\"Grand set\\" (precious tsars attire) complex of especially valuable regalia. Later \\"Grand set\\", which, except for the state regalia, included an armour set, that accompanied the Tsar in processions, e.g. military companies and hunting. * The sceptre The golden scepter is graceful and proportional, with rich and dainty ornamental motifs. The heads of cherubs, flowers and clusters of fruits suspended on ribbons ‚Äì everything belongs to a unique, rhythmically sized composition. This ancient sceptre has 1 emerald, 20 diamonds and a few other precious stones. * The orb Huge golden orb is crowned with a cross. In the upper hemisphere girdles separate it into four sections each with an Old Testament scene from King David's life: \\"Chrosmation of King David by Prophet Samuel\\", \\"David's mastering Goliath\\", \\"Coming home with the victory\\", \\"Persecution from Saul\\". Shining gems, green emeralds, red rubies, and blue sapphires, encircle the enamel ornamentation. The Orb has 58 diamonds, 89 rubies and tourmalines, 23 sapphires, 51 emeralds and 37 pearls. Except for the 4 enamels, the entire orb, including the cross, is thoroughly encrusted with the various gems. Regalia of Michael Fyodorovich The crown of \\"Grand set\\" - \\"Astrahan crown\\" During the Time of Troubles in 1610-1612 the tzars' treasury was plundered by the Polish troops. They took almost all armour and weapons from the Great Treasury. Still, some items of the utmost value were kept in the occupied Kremlin under the protection of the boyars. When the Seven Boyars agreed to acknowledge W≈Çadys≈Çaw, the king of Poland, as the king of Russia, he spared the historical monarchical insignia. Later the new king of Russia Michael Fyodorovich replenished the treasury with new artefacts. In 1627-1628 the \\"Grand Set\\" of regalia was created for him. * Golden carving chain This chain was presented to Tsar Michael Fyodorovich in 1631 by the Dutch. It was made in Western Europe in 1620s, later in Russia it was altered and became part of the \\"Grand set\\". It consists of 79 carving blackening rectangular links. * Golden chain The golden chain belonged to Tsar Michael Fyodorovich. It was executed by Kremlin makers and first mentioned in papers of the State treasury in 1640. It consists of 89 rounds, slightly convoluted rings with an ornamental inscription on each ring. The inscription includes a praying to the Holy Trinity, the complete title of the Tsar with a list of towns, princedoms and lands of the Russian State and the Tsar's hortation to live according to the precepts of God. * The Crown of the \\"Grand set\\" belonged to Tsar Michael Fyodorovich. It was crafted by Kremlin master E. Telepnev in 1627. Crown has 177 precious stones and pearls. Since 18th century this crown served as heraldic crown of the Astrakhan Khanate. \\"Grand set\\": the crown of Michael Fyodorovich with orb and sceptre of Boris Godunov. *The Golden throne of Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich was crafted at the beginning of the 17th century from the old chair of oriental workmanship which had belonged to Ivan the Terrible. In its form, high back and arms, it resembles Russian armchairs, but oriental motifs still remain in the ornament: The throne is faced with embossed gold and adorned with rubies, pearls, turquoise and other uncut stones. The throne was made in the early 17th century in Kremlin Workshops. Its decoration is similar to that of the throne of Boris Godunov. 13 kilos of gold, gemstones and pearls were used for its ornamentation. Partly throne's decoration haven‚Äôt survived. A part of golden plates in the base as well as the throne's pediment were missing. In total on this throne are surviving 1325 rubies and tourmalines, 559 turquoises, 16 pearls, 28 sapphires and 36 other precious stones. Also \\"Grand set\\" consist from various precious armament and equipment, survived in Kremlin Armoury. Most important from these things are: * Saadak and quiver Saadak (precious bow-case) of \\"Grand set\\", in complect with quiver, was executed in Kremlin c.1627: In total saadak and quiver are adorned 183 diamonds, 5 rubies, 34 sapphires, 153 emeralds and 139 tourmalins. * Shield This precious steel (with carving gold designs) shield was made by master Muchammed Mumin Zernishan in Persia in late of the 16th century: Until 1620 it belonged to prince Fyodor Mstislavsky (former Semiboyarzchina Head), after his death it was taken to Kremlin Armoury and became part of \\"Grand set\\". It is adorned 1478 small gemstones and 32 pearls. * Sabre Sabre of \\"Grand set\\" was made by Kremlin masters in the 1620s. It very rare artefact has 552 diamonds and 165 other precious stones, mostly pink tourmalins. * \\"State helmet\\" This helmet - \\"ericho cap\\" - was made in Turkey in the 1600s, and altered in 1621 in Kremlin Armoury by masters N.Davydov and I.Markov, and later in 1642. Steel helmet with golden carving, it has Turkish inscription - quotations from Qur'an. It is adorned 116 diamonds, 10 emeralds, 225 tourmalines and 164 pearls. By latest legend, this regalia belonged to Saint Alexander Nevsky. Since 18th century it served also as heraldic Helmet of Russian Empire. \\"State helmet\\" on picture of 19th century Broadsword of Tsar Michael Fyodorovich on picture, 19th century. After Tsar Mikhail Fyodorovich death in Kremlin Armoury were given his personal jewels and equipment, not applied to \\"Grand set\\". Most important from them are: * Broadsword Broadsword was executed by master Czech Nil Prosvit in Kremlin Armoury in 1617. It has inscription: ¬´Sy tesak sdeelan poweleniem Gossudara Tzaira i weliko–≤o Knesa Michaila Feodorowitcha vsea Rrusyi v paetoie leeto gossudarstwa ie–≤o, maesetza...

It is made in Turkey in 16th century and has Arabian inscriptions. * Helmet Unique precious helmet of prince Fyodor Mstislavsky, is made of damascene steel and gold in Ottoman Empire in the 16th century: In 1620 it was taken to tsar's treasury. Helmet is adorned rubies and turquoises and has quotations from Koran. * ericho cap \\"Ericho cap\\" of prince Fyodor Mstislavsky. Ottoman Empire, 1600s. * ericho cap \\"Ericho cap\\" of prince A.M.

His \\"Grand Set\\" consists of: * The sceptre Sceptre was executed in Istanbul in 1658 and presented to the Tsar by a Greek Ivan Anastasov: This oriental sceptre has mace form. It has 268 diamonds, 14 emeralds, 360 other precious stones. Golden handle has 12 small carved medallions this pictures of great Christian holidays: The Annunciation, The Ascension of Jesus, Christmas Day, Feast of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Epiphany, Raising of Lazarus, The Transfiguration of Jesus, Palm Sunday, The Crucifixion of Jesus, Resurrection of Jesus, Pentecost, Assuring of St Thomas. * The orb was brought to Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich in 1662 from Istanbul together with the sceptre. It has 179 diamonds and 340 other precious stones. * Barmas Barmas of Alexis Mikhailovich executed in Istanbul on his order in 1662. It is a round silk collar, adorned with seven precious medallions. The centre of medallions are round golden plates with religious compositions of colour enamels. Three large medallions are of particular interest. Two of them are not plane, like all the others, but a little bossy. They were to cover shoulders. The shape of the third medallion is a bit different, so it can be considered a central one. It is adorned with a scene of Our Lady sitting with a Baby in her lap, crowned by two angels. One shoulder medallion includes a cross confronted by Saints ‚Äì Byzantine Emperor Constantine and his mother Helen, who were famous devotees of Christianity. Another shoulder medallion presented Basil the Great and Saint Warrior Mercury, piking Emperor Julian, enemy of Christians. A legend says he was killed by Saint Mercury, who pretended to be an enemy warrior. The precious holy of the 17th century may have hinted the role of the royal power in the Christian world and the mission of the very Russian Tsar. In total all 7 precious medallions have 248 diamonds and 255 other precious stones. Also a private treasury of Alexis Mikhailovich consisted of: Diamond throne of Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich, in Kremlin Armoury. * Diamond throne The shape of the so- called \\"diamond armchair\\" of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, the most elaborate of the Royal thrones in the Armoury collection, is reminiscent of the throne of Tsar Mikhail, his father. The throne was made by Persian craftsmen in 1659 and granted to the Tsar by merchants Ichto Modovletov and Zakharia Saradarov from the Armenian Trading Company in 1660. The throne has been made of sandalwood faced with golden and silver plates with foliate ornamentation. Its bottom is decorated with a bold carved pattern depicting a procession of elephants and drivers on their backs. The back of the throne is covered with black velvet and embroidered images of two genii supporting a crown over the inscription glorifying the Tsar and his power. The whole surface of the throne is faced with an intricate mosaic of turquoise and diamonds. The precious donation was attached to the petition of tax-free trading in the Russian territory. The Armenian merchants got 4000 silver rubles and 19000 copper rubles for this throne. For the prevalence of diamonds the throne was named \\"Diamond Throne\\". In total throne has 876 diamonds and 1223 other gemstones. On the back of this throne there is an embroidered Latin inscription: \\"Potentissimo et invictissimo Moscovitarum Imperatori Alexio, in terris feliciter regnanti, hic thronus, summa arte et industria fabrefactus, sit futuri in coelis et perennis faustum felixque omen. Anno Domini, 1659\\" (\\"To the most powerful and invincible Muscovy Emperor Alexis doth reign felicitously upon the earth the throne made with sumptuous art would be a token of future eternal bliss in heaven. In the Year of Our Lord. 1659\\"). * The staff \\"His Majesty's staff\\": This precious staff was executed in Istanbul in 1658 and presented to Tsar by a Greek Ivan Anastasov in 1662. It has a lily in top. In total this unique oriental staff has 178 diamonds, 259 emeralds, 3 pearls and 369 pink tourmalines. * Plaque-pendant Precious plaque-pendant for tsars coronation clothes was executed in Istanbul in the 1660s. Also, Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich had various personal military equipment of his own \\"Grand set\\". Now these artefacts are on display in Kremlin Armoury, most famous of them are: * Saadak and quiver Precious saadak in complect with quiver was executed in Istanbul and presented to the Tsar by Greeks Ivan Yuriev and Dmitry Astafiev in 1656: In total unique oriental saadak and quiver have 306 diamonds, 40 emeralds and 1256 tourmalines. * Sabre Precious sabre was made in Istanbul and presented to the Tsar by Greek Ivan Bulgakov in 1656: * Helmet Helmet-\\"ericho cap\\" of \\"Grand set\\" was made in Turkey in the 1600s, until 1620 it belonged to prince Fyodor Mstislavsky and later - to Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich: It has golden and silver designs and 61 pearls and gemstones. * Concir State sword-concir in golden sheath was executed in Istanbul and presented to Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich by Greek Dmitry Astafiev in 1657. Concirs sheath is adorned by 63 tourmalins and 205 turquoises. * Busdychan The mace-busdychan of \\"Grand set\\" was executed in Istanbul and presented to Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich by Greek Dmitry Astafiev in 1655. It has 46 emeralds and 109 pink tourmalines. Tsars' regalia 1660s-1680s * Pectoral cross with a chain This cross was executed by Kremlin masters in 1662 and altered in 1682. Only this regalia survived from \\"Grand set\\" of Theodore Alekseevich - elder son of Alexis Mikhailovich. It is golden cross with diamonds, with golden chain. On facial side of cross there is 4 enamelled medallions this pictures of: The Transfiguration of Jesus, The Crucifixion of Jesus, Last Supper and Entombment of Jesus. On the verso of the cross there is an image of a heaven protector of the Tsar - Theodore Stratilates. The figure of the Saint, floral pattern around it, as well as religious scenes on the obverse of the cross are executed in bright shining colours, which make all the compositions similar to a multicolour shining mosaics. In 1682 Russia received two co-rulers - Ivan V Alekseevich and Peter I Alekseevich. Both of them had own jewels (but one throne). * Silver double throne The Double throne of Tsars Ivan Alekseyevich and Peter Alekseyevich, which serves as a vivid illustration of the unique historical moment, when two tsarevitches were crowned together: Tsar Alexis died leaving three sons. After the death of the eldest one, Theodore, fifteen-year-old Ivan should have inherited the throne, but he was feeble-minded and in poor health. So it was decided to crown the two brothers together, Ivan and ten-year-old Peter (the future Peter the Great). The double-seated throne was executed specially for the occasion by the Kremlin craftsmen in the 1680s. Its constriction including open-work arch on twisted columns, silver steps below and a high back with two silver pillars on each side resembles elegant architectural forms. The necessary instructions and advice were transmitted through a small orifice cut into the back of the throne and concealed by the velvet covering. The shape of the throne is finished with a lavish ornamentation. The openwork embossment, three-dimensional animal figures, carving and high relief, contrasting combination of silver and gilt are exemplificative of the Baroque style.

Behind - stand silver double throne. * Cap of Monomach of second set Simple \\"cap of Monomakh of the second set\\" of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich was executed by Kremlin Workshops for the 1682 crowning ceremony, when two small sons of Alexis Mikhailovich ‚Äì Ivan and Peter ‚Äì were inaugurated as Tsars: The creators did their best following the ancient original. It reminds an Eastern headdress and consists of 8 golden plates. The crown has a dome-shaped top with a cross. However, there is certain difference in artistic decoration of the two crowns. The surface of the ancient one is covered with a delicate filigree ornamentation. The golden plates of the new crown were left smooth. Cold shining metal with sharp symmetric decor makes impression of elegant severity, a bit mildened by bright and colourful precious stones. Since 18th centhury this crown served as heraldic crown of Tsardom of the Chersonnese Taurics. * Altabas crown Altabas crown of the third set of Tsar Ivan V Alekseevich was executed by Russian masters in 1684. Altabas is a precious cloth, similar to brocade. So the crown was named altabas. It is the only tsars crown executed of cloth. For the crown would not lose the shape, it had an inner frame of smooth silver arches. The crown was adorned with golden plates enameled with bright colours and coloured with gems. Some of these plates were taken from the not survived Diamond Crown of Tsar Theodore Alekseevich. In total it has circa 100 gemstones and pearls. Since 18th century this crown served as heraldic crown of \\"Tsardom of Siberia\\". Picture of altabas crown, c. 1835. * Diamond crown This crown was executed by Russian masters for Tsar Peter I Alekseevich in the 1680s: A similar crown was made for his elder brother, crowned at the same time. The decor of the crown represents specific features of Russian jewelry of the late 17th century, a specific feature of which was active using of precious stones. Shining diamonds and gems always attracted attention of Russian goldsmiths, and that time they became the main point of jewelry artworks. The Crown of Peter Alekseevich was enriched with green emeralds and red tourmalines. In total metallic golden frame of crown is adorned 807 diamonds (in 32 designs) and 13 other gemstones. * Diamond crown One of the two crowns was made in the 1680s by Russian jewelers for Ivan V Alekseevich: The decor of the crown is traditional for Russian jewelry of the late 17th century, a special point of which was active use of luxurious precious stones. On the crown's top there is a precious crimson lal. This golden crown has circa 900 diamonds and a few other precious stones. Young Russian Tsar with \\"Cap of Monomakh\\", sceptre of Alexis Mikhailovich and orb of Boris Godunov. * Pectoral cross of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich The golden cross of Tsar Peter Alekseevich was made in Kremlin workshops in the 1780s. In the center of its obverse there is a small cross made of magnificent emeralds of different cutting and shape, adorned with openwork vegetation ornament and enamels. The shape and decor of the emerald cross allow to classify it as an artwork of West European silversmiths of the 16-17th centuries. A carved crucifix on one emerald and a carved inscription \\"NIKA\\" on another are of Russian origin and can be dated by the same time.On the cross's reverse there is a front enamelled image of Apostle Peter, the Tsar's patron Saint. The enamelled decor of the cross in combination with shining precious stones give major impression in accordance with the common tendencies of development of Russian art of the time. The bright artistic concept and brilliant craft make the item a true masterpiece of the 18th century jewelry. * Sceptre of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich The sceptre belonging to Tsar Peter I was made of gold and adorned with colour enamels and precious stones. The hexahedral sceptre divides into three with three bolsters and its lower part ends with a bolster with a figured knob. The sceptre's form and details are close to the sceptre of Tsar Michael Fyodorovich of the 17th century. The decor reflects artistic taste of the late 17th century. Black and pink enamels on blue background, vegetation ornament of miniature graceful tulips, leaves and curls ‚Äì all these have analogies in artworks by Kremlin jewelers of the 1780s and 1790s. The sceptre must have been executed in 1682 on the occasion of setting for reigning of brothers Ivan and Peter Alekseevich. While the ceremonial, Ivan Alekseevich took the sceptre of his grandfather, and the new sceptre, created following the pattern of the worshipped holy, was brought for the younger Tsar, Peter Alekseevich. * Mace The mace of \\"Grand set\\" appeared only 15 March 1692. It was presented to Tsar Ivan V Alekseevich by Persian Shah Suleiman among ambassador Sulein-Han. Golden oriental mace, it adorned by precious stones, total length 71,8 cm. In 1790 prince G.Potyomkin (who was also chief of Kremlin Armoury) take it instead of marschallstab, after his death the mace was returned to Kremlin. Regalia of the Russian Empire The coronation in the Russian Empire was a sophisticated ceremony, scrutinized in tiny details and requiring thorough preparation. The final set of Imperial regalia was formed in 1723-1724, since that time it included the Great Imperial Crown, the Small crown, the Imperial sceptre, the Imperial orb, the mantle, the Big Chain and Star of the Order of St. Andrew, the state shield, the state sword, and the state seal. *The Crown of Empress Catherine I was first new-type Imperial crown after the tzars' caps of previous monarchs. It was designed by the court master Samson Larionov and created with the help of 10 Moscow Kremlin masters in 1724 for the coronation of Empress Catherine I, second wife of Peter the Great. In a month after the ceremony the crown of Catherine I was dismantled, its 2000 diamonds and a huge Chinese tourmalin were added to the new crown. The gilded silver carcass of this crown is displayed in Kremlin Armoury. *The Orb of Emperor Peter II is a simple small golden orb with silver belt and cross, not encrusted with any gemstones. It is kept in the Kremlin Armoury since 30 May 1728. *The Crown of Empress Anna Ivanovna is one of the first new-type Russian crowns. It was crafted by Gottlieb Wilhelm Dunkel in St. Petersburg in 1731 for Empress Anna's coronation ceremony. Later, the crown was modified in the 1730s. The crown is made of silver and adorned with 2536 diamonds, 28 other gemstones and one huge red tourmaline in c.500 carat. The form was to become traditional: two open-work hemispheres divided by a movable arc with a cross in the middle and a broad circlet. This regalia was given to Kremlin Armory on 14 March 1741. In 1826 it was used for the personal coronation of Emperor Nikolas I in Warsaw as the polish king. Later this crown served as the heraldic crown of \\"Tsardom of Poland\\". *The Agraf (a buckle for imperial mantle) was made by J√©r√©mie Pauzi√© for Empress Elizabeth in SPb in the 1760s. The Agraf looks as three small branches with leaves and tiny flowers. It is 25 cm long and 11 wide, encrusted with 805 diamonds, 475.44 carat. Currently it is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the Diamond Fund. Anna Ivanovna with her crown, portrait by Louis Caravaque. State sword and shield on Russian post stamp. * The Great Imperial Crown is the largest of Russian the crowns. It was made in SPb by G.F. Ekart and J√©r√©mie Pauzi√© in 1762, in 1797 crown was altered by L.D.Diuval. It has 4936 diamonds, 75 huge pearls and one huge red spinel in 398, 72 carat. The crown nowadays belongs to the Diamond Fund and stays in the permanent exhibition. * The Imperial sceptre was crafted by the court jewellers L. Pfisterer and I. Leontovich for Empress Catherine II in SPb in 1771 and altered in 1774. The sceptre holds the famous \\"Orlov\\" diamond and 196 another diamonds. For the first time it was used in coronation ceremony of Pavel I and thus officially included into the Imperial Insignia. *The Imperial orb was crafted by the jeweller G.F. Ekart for Empress Catherine II in Moscow in 1762 and altered circa 1774. The smooth golden orb has a diamond belt and a cross with huge 195K sapphire, that was added by order of Pual I. The belts have 1370 diamonds. Pavel I in Kremlin. Pavel I as Grand Master of Knights of Malta. Portrait by Salvatore Tonci. * The Maltese crown of Emperor Pavel I, and other Order's relics, were presented to Pavel I in 1798 by the Knights of Malta when he was elected as Grand Master. This regalia was made by stamping gilded silver, surmounted by a golden sphere and golden enamelled \\"maltese\\" cross. Until 1803 it also served as the heraldic crown. In 1827 it was given to the Kremlin Armory. Total weight - 1753,00 gr. * The State sword appeared only in the late 18th century, in Pavel I's time. An old polish steel blade (late 17th century), with a newly gilded silver sword-hilt, was used to make it. Total length with a haft - 141 cm. * The State shield was made by Russian masters in the late 17th century, but it only became the state regalia in Pavel I's time. This shield is adorned by carving golden and silver designs with more than 150 gemstones: Its diameter - 58,4 cm. *The Small Imperial crown was created by master L. Zeftigen for Empress Maria Alexandrovna in St Petersburg in 1856. The design was made on the basis of jeweller's L. D. Diuval (1797) sketches. The crown is kept in the Diamond Fund of Russia.

Loudon used plans for the Histon Road cemetery as illustrative of his views on cemetery design. Research has indicated that the actual work carried out on the cemetery, which opened in 1843 (the year of his death), does not correspond closely with Loudon's announcements.http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option,com_parksandgardens/task,site/id,1754/tab,description/Itemid,/ According to the Parks and Gardens UK website, as part of the rationale for including Histon Road Cemetery on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest at Grade II*: > The cemetery embodies Loudon's most important ideas on cemetery design and > is an early example of the grid pattern layout adopted for many later > cemeteries.

It includes most of the material of the exoskeleton of the insects, Crustacea, Arachnida, and Myriapoda. The fangs in spiders' chelicerae are so sclerotised as to be greatly hardened and darkened Zoea-stage larva is hardly recognisable as a crab, but each time it sheds its cuticle it remodels itself, eventually taking on its final crab form robber crab has tough fabric forming its joints, delicate biomineralized cuticle over its sensory antennae, optic- quality over its eyes, and strong, calcite-reinforced chitin armouring its body and legs; its pincers can break into coconuts Morphology In arthropods, the integument, the external \\"skin\\", or \\"shell\\", is the product of a single layer of ectodermal epithelium. That layer is attached to the external or distal surface of the deepest layer, the non-cellular internal membrane of the integument. That non-cellular membrane is called the basement membrane. The layer of epithelium on the basement membrane produces the cuticle, which begins as a tough, flexible layer of chitin. Such thin, flexible chitin is the major structural part of the integument where flexibility is necessary, such as in bodily parts that must stretch to contain accumulated liquids, or that form joints between rigid parts of the exoskeleton. In other parts of the cuticle the function of the integument demands more rigid materials, such as armoured regions or the biting parts of the jaws, or where the exoskeleton forms the tubular limbs of most Arthropoda. To achieve such rigidity the outer chitin layer of the cuticle is impregnated, thickened, and reinforced with harder, more brittle materials such as sclerotinised proteins or calcite. This main chitinous layer of the cuticle is called the procuticle. The procuticle in most land Arthropoda, particularly insects, is covered externally with a thin, waxy, water-resistant outer layer containing no chitin. That outer layer is the epicuticle, and it is much thinner than the procuticle. The chitinous procuticle is formed of an outer exocuticle and the inner endocuticle, and between the exocuticle and endocuticle there may be another layer called mesocuticle which has distinctive staining properties. The tough and flexible endocuticle is a laminated structure of layers of interwoven fibrous chitin and protein molecules, while the exocuticle is the layer in which any major thickening, armouring and biomineralization occurs. Biomineralization with calcite is particularly common in Crustacea, whereas sclerotization particularly occurs in insects. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially in the larval stages such as caterpillars and the larvae of parasitoidal Hymenoptera. Hardened plates in the exoskeleton are called sclerites. Sclerites may be simple protective armour, but also may form mechanical components of the exoskeleton, such as in the legs, joints, fins or wings. In the typical body segment of an insect or many other Arthropoda, there are four principal regions. The dorsal region is the tergum; if the tergum bears any sclerites, those are called tergites. The ventral region is called the sternum, which commonly bears sternites. The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular pleurum) and any sclerites they bear are called pleurites. Within entomology, the term glabrous is used to refer to those parts of an insect's body lacking in setae (bristles) or scales. Chemical composition Chemically, chitin is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, which is a derivative of glucose. The polymer bonds between the glucose units are Œ≤(1‚Üí4) links, the same as in cellulose. In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient and tough. In arthropods and other organisms however, it generally is a component of a complex matrix of materials. It practically always is associated with protein molecules that often are in a more or less sclerotised state, stiffened or hardened by cross-linking and by linkage to other molecules in the matrix. In some groups of animals, most conspicuously the Crustacea, the matrix is greatly enriched with, or even dominated by, hard minerals, usually calcite or similar carbonates that form much of the exoskeleton. In some organisms the mineral content may exceed 95%. The role of the chitin and proteins in such structures is more than just holding the crystals together; the crystal structure itself is so affected as to prevent the propagation of cracks under stress, leading to remarkable strength. The process of formation of such mineral-rich matrices is called biomineralization.Campbell, N. A. (1996) Biology (4th edition) Benjamin Cummings, New Work. p.69 The difference between the unmodified and modified forms of chitinous arthropodan exoskeletons can be seen by comparing the body wall of say a bee larva, in which modification is minimal, to any armoured species of beetle, or the fangs of a spider. In both those examples there is heavy modification by sclerotisation. Again, contrasting strongly with both unmodified organic material such as largely pure chitin, and with sclerotised chitin and proteins, consider the integument of a heavily armoured crab, in which there is a very high degree of modification by biomineralization. Moulting As mentioned, the integument, and in particular the cuticle, is the product of the single layer of columnar or cuboidal epithelial cells attached to the basement membrane. The cuticle provides muscular support and acts as a protective shield as the insect develops, but it is not in itself cellular, so once established it cannot grow and offers little scope for maintenance, renewal or increase in size as the animal grows. Therefore, the animal periodically sheds the external part of the cuticle in a process called moulting or ecdysis. As the time for moulting approaches, as much as possible of the exocuticle material is internally digested by enzymatic action and reabsorbed through the epithelial layer. As its base gets dissolved away, the old cuticle begins to separate from the epidermis in a process called apolysis. Early in the process of apolysis the epithelial cells release enzymatic moulting fluid between the old cuticle and the epidermis. The enzymes partly digest the endocuticle and the epidermis absorbs the digested material for the animal to assimilate. Much of that digested material is re- used to build the new cuticle. Once the new cuticle has formed sufficiently, the animal splits the remaining parts of the old integument along built-in lines of weakness and sheds them in the visible process of ecdysis, generally shedding and discarding the epicuticle and the reduced exocuticle, though some species carry them along for camouflage or protection. The shed portions are called the exuviae. The animal then expands its body by swallowing liquid or gas and in the process it stretches the new integument to its proper size and shape. The new integument still is soft and usually is pale, and it is said to be teneral or callow. It then undergoes a hardening and pigmentation process that might take anything from several minutes to several days, depending on the nature of the animal and the circumstances.Gene Kritsky. (2002).

Ethnically, in a national sense, they were all with the same sentiments, with the same (Bulgarian) consciousness. and most of the local Slavic population then,During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.

White, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, , p. 236.At the end of the WWI there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Slavs who had developed some sense of national identity then, the majority probably considered themselves to be Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.

Sugarev was born in 1876 in Bitola, then in the Ottoman Empire, today in North Macedonia. His family was very poor and his mother together with his brothers Hristo, Mihail and Vangel emigrated to the United States and actively participate in the activities of the Macedonian Patriotic Organization. Vangel became there a historian and author of several books as \\"The Bulgarian nationality of the Macedonians\\"The Bulgarian nationality of the Macedonians, Author: Vangel Konstantine Sugarev, Publisher: Worcester, Mass, 1919. and \\"The constitution of the Bulgarian revolutionary central committee\\".The constitution of the Bulgarian revolutionary central committee, Author: Vangel Konstantine Sugarev; Publisher: Chicago, 1932. Sugarev completed fourth grade of Bulgarian Men's High School of Bitola. Afterwards he became a Bulgarian teacher initially in Demir Hisar, then in Kichevo, and finally in Bitola. However he left the school system and decided to join the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation. In 1901 he became a chetnik of Nikola Rusinski. With the assistance of the vojvoda Rusinski, they operated together through the regions of Demir Hisar, Smilevo and Bitola. The same year he was elected a member of the Bitola District Revolutionary Committee of the IMRO, and in February 1902 he went underground. Sugarev was a delegate to the Smilevo Congress of the Bitola revolutionary district of IMRO. At the beginning of the Ilinden uprising he was Bitola revolutionary district leader, participating in several battles. Together with the vojvodas Hristo Uzunov he supported Dame Gruev to restore the organization after the suppression of the uprising. Sugarev participate in the Prilep Congress of the IMRO in 1904. He started also anti-Serb campaign in the late summer of 1905. Th–µse actions he coordinated with the IMRO leaders Pancho Konstantinov and Ivan Naumov Alyabaka. Later Sugarev left for Bitola to arrange joint actions against the pro-Serbian bands in the Bitola and Skopje revolutionary districts. By this activity Sugarev was helped by the Bulgarian vojvodas Petar Yurukov and Petar Radev. The tombstone of Sugarev, that after WWII was destroyed by the communist authorities. In March 1906 Sugarev travelled to Mariovo to counter the intensifying Greek bands. Because of betrayal, of March 23, 1906 the cheta was surrounded near the village of Paralevo of numerous Turkish forces and after a fierce battle was completely destroyed.

An eccentric, shy, and often reclusive man, his survey of extinct and vanishing birds provided the base for much subsequent work on bird conservation. Early years Greenway was born in New York City, though grew up on the Lauder Greenway Estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, with his brothers G. Lauder Greenway and Gilbert Greenway, as the son of James Greenway Sr., founder of the Yale School of Public Health. He is also a grandson of George Lauder and a great-grandson of George Lauder, Sr.. He was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, graduating in 1922, and graduated from Yale University in 1926 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then worked for a few years as a reporter for the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper. Expeditions & Research =Expeditions with Delacour= In 1929 Greenway became a partner in the Franco-Anglo- American Zoological Expedition to Madagascar. The expedition was sponsored by the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the British Natural History Museum in London, and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City, and led by French ornithologist Jean Delacour. Greenway took part in the expedition from April to August 1929, after which he and Delacour left Madagascar for Delacour's fifth expedition to Indochina, where they collected zoological specimens in Tonkin and Annam. At some point during his expedition to Annam, Greenway was awarded the Order of the Dragon of Annam by the local authorities. Later in the expedition deep inside the Kingdom of Laos, he was awarded the Order of the Million Elephants and the White Parasol in Luang Prabang. Presumably by King Sisavang Vong himself. When asked about the circumstances of the awards later, he responded: \\"Any outsider who even got to those places got a medal in those days.\\" Order of the Million Elephants and the White Parasol ‡∫≠‡∫¥‡∫™‡∫∞‡∫£‡∫¥‡∫ç‡∫≤‡∫û‡∫≠‡∫ô‡∫•‡ªâ‡∫≤‡∫ô‡∫ä‡ªâ‡∫≤‡∫á‡∫Æ‡∫ª‡ªà‡∫°‡∫Ç‡∫≤‡∫ß Imperial Order of the Dragon of Annam ƒê·∫°i Nam Long Tinh Vi·ªán =Museum of Comparative Zoology= In 1932 Greenway joined the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) at Harvard University as Assistant Curator of Birds until 1952 and then, succeeding James Lee Peters, as Curator until 1960. During the 1930s he participated in several collecting expeditions to the Caribbean, especially the Bahamas. In 1936, he and his brother Gilbert flew across the Bahamas from north to south, and were the first to land a plane on East Caicos in the Turks and Caicos Islands; the school children were let out of school for the special occasion. Greenway also took part in Delacour's seventh expedition to Indochina in 1938‚Äì1939. Greenway, who broke from academia and research during his service in WWII, resumed his ornithological work at the MCZ. It was from there that he produced in 1958 his survey of extinct and near-extinct birds, a book that provided a great stimulus to bird conservation over the next few decades. He was also active in the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection and later in the International Council for Bird Preservation (ICBP). =American Museum of Natural History= In 1960 Greenway left the MCZ for personal reasons, never to return there. Based back at his Greenwich estate, his subsequent ornithological work was carried out in association with the American Museum of Natural History, of which he was a trustee from 1960/61 to 1970/71. In 1962 he became a research associate in the Department of Ornithology there, a position he retained until his death. He began work on a list of the type specimens of birds held by the museum, a massive project not completed at the time of his death. He also instigated, part-financed and participated in a collecting expedition to New Caledonia in 1978, when he was 75 years old. Relatively few other ornithologists had met him in person because an aversion to large gatherings meant that he probably never attended a single professional meeting or congress in his life. His sometime friend and colleague Fran√ßois Vuilleumier wrote of him: > Shy and retiring he was, but his life and career, or at least what can be > traced of them, were at times quite adventuresome. Jim Greenway was so > reluctant to leave tracks behind him that, after his death, even his sons > did not know important details of their father's academic career. > Jim Greenway was a profoundly eccentric man who was probably unable to > tolerate others with a lesser streak of eccentricity than he had. He should > be remembered especially as the person who was in charge of the very rich > MCZ bird collection for many years, who helped avian conservation get a > solid start, who wrote the classic Extinct and Vanishing Birds of the World, > who helped publish Peters' Check-list after Peters' death, and who assisted > the Department of Ornithology at AMNH in many unrecorded but important ways. Publishing & Eponyms =Publications= Although Greenway produced numerous scientific papers and collaborated in the preparation of other ornithological publications, the book Greenway is best known for is his 1958 work, Extinct and Vanishing Birds of the World, which had a second edition published in 1967. Greenway had kept a file detailing extinct and at risk birds for years prior to the publication of the book and over several years created a draft book of the book in 1954, but took another four years to create the final version. This book was one of three published by the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection which were the precursors to the IUCN Red List which details species at risk of extinction; along with Francis Harper's Extinct and Vanishing Mammals of the Old World and Glover Morrill Allen's Extinct and Vanishing Mammals of the Western Hemisphere. Today these books are seen as the inspiration behind the IUCN Red List. =Eponyms= In 1936 Thomas Barbour and Benjamin Shreve named two species of reptiles in Greenway's honor: Leiocephalus greenwayi, a curly-tailed lizard; and Tropidophis greenwayi, a dwarf boa.,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Greenway\\", p. 107) and Donn Rosen named a fish, Scolichthys greenwayi, after him in 1967Rosen, D.E. (1967). New Poeciliid Fishes from Guatemala, with Comments on the Origins of Some South and Central American Forms, American Museum Novitates 2303, 1-15 Military Service During the Second World War Greenway served in the United States Navy. He was commissioned in 1941, becoming a Lieutenant in 1943 and later a Lieutenant Commander, while serving on aircraft carriers in the South West Pacific, in the Solomon Islands and on New Caledonia. Greenway's primary work was with Naval Intelligence spying on the Japanese from islands such as New Caldonia, which inspired some of his later academic work. Marriage and children Greenway's first wife was Helen Livingston Scott (1903-1980), the granddaughter of Thomas A. Scott who was a business associate of Greenways grandfather (Lauder) and great-uncle (Carnegie). They had three children: Helen Greenway Steele; H.D.S. Greenway (a noted journalist with both the Boston Globe and Washington Post), and James C. Greenway III. On December 26, 1959, Greenway's mother, Harriet Lauder Greenway, daughter of George Lauder, died.New York Times, Dec. 29, 1959, page 25 (obituary). Within months after his mother's death, Greenway divorced his first wife and ran off to New York with his mistress, Mary Frances Oakes Hunnewell (died April 22, 1989), who herself also had to divorce her spouse in order to marry Greenway. The Bird Skinner In 2014, Alice Greenway (a granddaughter from Greenway's first marriage) published a fictionalized account of Greenway's World War II years, in the novel The Bird Skinner (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press). The novel was about \\"Jim Kennoway\\" who, like Greenway, was stationed in the Solomon Islands, went on natural history expeditions to far-flung locations, and worked at the American Museum of Natural History. The one key difference is that in the novel, the fictional \\"Kennoway\\" mourned \\"the death of his beautiful wife,\\" who died young. The real Greenway, in contrast, divorced his first wife in order to marry his mistress. The fact that The Bird Skinner is a semi-fictionalized account of the author's grandfather's life ‚Äî with a sanitized version of his marital life ‚Äî gives readers a much better appreciation of the book and the author's motivations.http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy1507/2014434614-d.html Publisher's description; based on an earlier version of the book which used \\"Jim Carroway\\" instead of \\"Jim Kennoway\\" References Category:1903 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Lauder Greenway Family Category:People from Greenwich, Connecticut Category:Scientists from New York City Category:Phillips Exeter Academy alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:American ornithologists Category:Harvard University staff Category:People associated with the American Museum of Natural History Category:20th-century zoologists Category:20th-century American scientists Category:Recipients of the Order of the Dragon of Annam ","title":"James Greenway"},{"id":"29497318","text":"Kosalesvara temple or Kosaleswara temple located at Baidyanatha of Subarnapur district, Odisha, India.

He was the third son of Dr. Cromie J.P., of Clough, the local registrar of births and deaths and ruling elder of Clough Presbyterian church. Robert's elder sister, Annie Howe Cromie,(1849-1939) to whom he was particularly close, was the wife of Sir John Jordan, (the British Ambassador to China between 1906 and 1920) and named her second son after him. Through Cromie's mother, a Miss Henry of Ballyhosset, near Downpatrick, he was descended from Gilbert Howe (c.1626-c.1712), of Ballytrim, near Killyleagh, the confidential servant to James 1st Earl of Clanbrassil, and was thus connected by blood to many of the leading families in East Down. Cromie was born on 17 July 1855 at Clough. He was educated at home before being sent with an older brother to the Royal Belfast Academical Institution where, according to one article, he claimed \\"an unbeaten record in the matter of examinations, having never once failed, by reason...of having never once entered\\".\\"Mr. Robert Cromie\\", The Whitehall Review, July 13, 1895. Instead of pursuing an academic path, he followed one of his brothers, Andrew Gilbert Howe Cromie (died 1937) into the Ulster Bank and worked in various parts of Ireland including Donegal, Trim and Derry. His final posting was to the Ulster Bank's head office in Waring Street, Belfast. While working in Trim, Cromie developed a close friendship with Charles Reichel, Bishop of Meath, an association regarded as influential on the development of Cromie's style. His first book, For England's Sake, was published in 1889. A Plunge into Space, a science fiction novel, was published in 1890. This work predates H. G. Wells's The First Men in the Moon by some 10 years, but contains a number of similarities.

This involved constructing the Grosvenor Bridge over the river Thames. The company later leased its lines and stations to the LB&SCR; and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&DR;) but continued in existence until December 1922 when it was briefly amalgamated with the South Eastern Railway as a result of the Railways Act 1921, which created the Big Four on 1 January 1923.

Career  = Transfield = After working in Australia for five years with SAE, in 1956 both Salteri and Belgiorno-Nettis (as he later became known) jointly decided to leave SAE and form Transfield, in a partnership that lasted 40 years. The company focused on major engineering projects, such as bridges, tunnels, dams, hydro-electric and coal power stations, oil rigs, concert halls, sugar mills and power lines. Included in their list of major achievements are the construction of the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane and the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. By the early 1980s, Transfield had in excess of 3,000 employees and an annual turnover of A$350 million; and within five years grew to the point of being the biggest engineering firm in south-east Asia. The company acquired the Williamstown Dockyard in Melbourne and, in 1989 after winning a A$6 billion contract to build ten ANZAC class frigates for the Australian and New Zealand governments, the largest defence company in Australia. When visiting Australia in 1986 Pope John Paul II toured the Transfield factory located at Seven Hills. The pair stood down as joint managing directors in 1989 in favour of their eldest sons, Paul Salteri and Marco Belgiorno-Zegna. However, in a dispute between Salteri and Belgiorno- Nettis in 1995, the differences between the two families became irreconcilable and Transfield, then valued at A$733.2 million was split in two. The Belgiorno-Nettis family kept the name Transfield and the construction side of the business, while the Salteri family got the company's North Sydney headquarters and the defence operations, which they then renamed as Tenix. = Tenix = Tenix grew quickly on the back of the contracts to construct the ANZAC class frigates and completion of the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) project. The company expanded across the defence sector into engineering infrastructure and service businesses, such as gas, water, electricity, and the supply of speed cameras and traffic wardens. By the time that Salteri retired in 2007, Tenix had annual revenue of A$1.7 billion. Tenix sold its defence business to BAE Systems in June 2008, and its main business interests are in infrastructure and parking and traffic businesses across Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific and the USA. The name Tenix derives from tenacity, inspired by a comment made by Salteri's grandfather when Salteri was a young boy: :\\"...to make one million, one has to start from a 5 centime coin...\\" Salteri reputably kept this coin from that day, until the day of his death.  Personal  In 1999, Salteri was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic by the Italian government. In 2002, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for service as a leader in industrial and technological development in Australia, to the engineering, construction and manufacturing industries, and to the community through a range of artistic, cultural and health-related organisations. Salteri established the Tenix Foundation to provide assistance for education, research and underprivileged children. Up until his death, Salteri was a patron of the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation and was a key supporter of education for indigenous students. Salteri died at the Mater Hospital in Sydney after a short illness, aged 89.

A Swiss national daily newspaper Tages-Anzeiger published Schmitt's interview given to Enver Robelli in Tirana on 25 February 2009, in which it is emphasized that Schmitt claims that Skanderbeg's mother Voisava was Serbian, a member of the Brankoviƒá family and that the Kastrioti surname probably is derived from Greek word kastron (fort). He was accused of committing sacrilege and sullying the Albanian national honor. Ardian Klosi, who translated his book from German to Albanian, was accused of treason.

History QNews was formed in December 2000 following the demise of predecessor publication Brother Sister amidst the collapse of national LGBT publisher Satellite Media. The first edition of QNews was released on 15 December that year. It was operated by Ray Mackereth, who had previously run Brother Sister for Satellite Media. A fortnightly publication from the beginning, it was originally printed as a tabloid newspaper, but changed to a fortnightly magazine in 2005. Historian Shirleene Robinson described QNews as being less \\"highbrow\\" than its then-rival publication, Queensland Pride. In 2013, under earlier ownership, The Australian reported claims that QNews had inflated its distribution figures, alleging that the publication was claiming that it had distributed approximately double the number of copies than had actually been printed. It suggested that the magazine's distribution at that time was averaging approximately 8,500 copies. In 2015, the company ran into financial difficulties and was facing closure, with the operators needing a crowdfunding campaign to keep the publication alive for long enough to secure a new publisher. It faced further issues later that year after its then owner, Ray Mackereth, filed for bankruptcy. Later that month, it was sold to Queensland businessman Richard Bakker. In October 2018, QNews appointed a transgender managing editor, Destiny Rogers, reportedly the first Australian publication to do so. Content QNews is a Queensland-focused LGBTIQ fortnightly lifestyle magazine catering to members of the Australian LGBTIQ community and their allies. The magazine covers local and national LGBTIQ current affairs, community issues, health, entertainment and culture. The print publication and website are available for free and supported entirely by advertising. The company regularly partners with LGBTIQ community groups around Queensland and northern New South Wales, including Brisbane Pride, Cairns Tropical Pride and Tropical Fruits. In April 2016, the publication released its 400th issue and celebrated what it claimed was a record for the largest number of issues for a Queensland LGBTIQ print publication.QNews Celebrates 400 Issues Distribution QNews currently has over 450 distribution points, mostly throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales.

They banded together as the National Association of Flower Arrangement Societies in 1959. In 1984 NAFAS was granted charitable status in recognition of its education activities. It currently has around 70,000 members. History Although the National Association of Flower Arrangement Societies was formed in 1959 it had its origins in the years after the Second World War when various ladies travelled to America and saw how the garden club movement welcomed flower arranging as something to be linked with plant growing. Julia Clements visited America and returned becoming active in lectures and demonstrations on flower arranging to Women‚Äôs Institutes and other clubs. She published her first book Fun with Flowers in 1950. In Dorset Mary Pope, having returned from Canada where she spent some of the war years, set up a panel in 1948 to fill the need for more knowledgeable judges of flower arranging for the increasing number of classes in horticultural shows. She went on to form a club in Dorchester in 1949 to encourage entries in the flower arranging sections of the horticultural societies and it soon had five hundred members. The Flower Academy was an event staged at the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs New Hall in London when the four existing flower arranging clubs in the country joined to stage a floral arrangements exhibition. The Colchester Flower Club, the Dorset Floral Decoration Club, the Leicester and County Flower Lovers Guild and the London Floral Decoration Society arranged 350 floral exhibits which attracted huge crowds and became ‚Äònews‚Äô. Visitors returned home and clubs were formed throughout the country. Guidance from the Royal Horticultural Society was sought in 1954 when Mary Pope approached them for advice and help as there was a need to co-ordinate the many flower clubs being formed. On 7 December 1954 the President of the RHS, David Bowes-Lyon convened a meeting attended by representatives from 45 clubs from England, Scotland and Wales. This led to the formation within the RHS of the Floral Decoration Society in 1955, delegates from 125 clubs attended the meeting and agreed to divide Great Britain into five large regions. At the Chelsea Flower Show in 1956 the RHS provided a large marquee for the five regional organisations to show their artistry, this was visited by both Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother. Huge queues to view the floral designs and this in turn led to an upsurge in membership of flower clubs. As well as exhibiting at Chelsea each of the now seven Areas (North East Area was formed in 1957 and North West Area soon after) held shows in their own regions to great acclaim. Over the next few years the RHS Floral Decoration Committee produced lists of judges, teachers and demonstrators of flower arranging to help clubs organise their programmes and shows and by 1958 it was realised that a separate organisation should be formed. On 26 January 1959 the serving members of the RHS Flower Arrangement Committee agreed to form a Caretaker Committee under the proposed name, The National Association of Flower Arrangement Societies of Great Britain (NAFAS). They had three immediate tasks: to draft a constitution, to accumulate funds and to set up a central administration. Once again the RHS helped by providing a venue, free of charge, for The Festival of Floral Decoration held on 14 and 15 July 1959 in order to raise funds. There was both a competitive section and non competitive section and to the amazement of the committee a clear profit of ¬£800 was made and much valuable publicity gained. By the end of 1959 a new area was formed, Three Counties & South Wales, from clubs originally in the South West Area and the Midlands. The Association was by now employing a part- time national secretary who shared a small room at Denison House, Vauxhall Bridge Road with the Metropolitan Gardeners Association. 1960 saw the first General Meeting of NAFAS, as it had become known, and a National Council was set up and a constitution adopted. From then on it was case of organisation and development as lists of judges, teachers, demonstrators and lecturers were set up and the idea of a national journal was explored. The Flower Arranger magazine was published in March 1961 as an A5 publication and is still going strong fifty years later. Over the next five decades NAFAS developed and became known throughout the world as a flower arranging organisation, of men and women, and membership peaked at 100,000. Activities Activities for members are organised at level, area and national level. At local level each flower club arranges an annual programme which includes flower arranging demonstrations by trained and qualified NAFAS demonstrators, there may also be hands-on workshops, talks and garden visits as well as other social activities. A similar programme is often arranged by the Area Associations but on a larger scale. Nationally the highlight of the year is the National Show at which members compete and display their artistic talents in a variety of classes at a different venue each year. There are also demonstrations, talks and workshops all designed to encourage the public to develop an interest in floral art. Recent shows have been at Edinburgh 2008, Coventry 2009, and Harrogate 2010 and are planned for Torquay 2011 and Southport 2012. These are usually three-day events open to members and the general public. Other events for members which take place in various venues around the UK are the Annual General Meeting and the Annual Assembly. The latter is an opportunity to meet up with members and enjoy flower arranging demonstrations, talks, workshops and visits. A number of NAFAS courses teaching floral art and design are available throughout the United Kingdom. The Association also trains demonstrators, judges and speakers. The Flower Arranger magazine is published quarterly. The Association arranges flowers at Westminster Abbey for major festivals and events including Commonwealth Observance in March and the Order of the Bath every four years. Flowers were provided at Westminster Abbey on 17 September 2010 during Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom, when flowers in the papal colours of white and yellow were arranged. Close links have been maintained since the earliest years of its existence with the Royal Horticultural Society, to which NAFAS is affiliated. NAFAS has been invited to exhibit at Chelsea since 1975 and each year a different NAFAS Area constructs a huge floral exhibit in the floral marquee hoping to be the recipient of a RHS award. Floral exhibits are also staged at many of the RHS London Flower Shows. With the 50th anniversary of NAFAS in 2009 the opportunity was taken to launch a new rose ‚ÄòGolden Fanfare‚Äô at Chelsea by the television presenters Christopher Biggins and Rachel De Thame. The rose is shown on the poster for a flower festival staged at Westminster Abbey to celebrate the golden anniversary of NAFAS. Organisation Members of flower clubs are affiliated to their Area Association and form the affiliated membership of the charity. There are 21 Area Associations providing geographical representation throughout the United Kingdom to which the local clubs are affiliated. It is also possible to be an individual affiliated member for anyone who is not able to join a flower club, and to enjoy the benefits of being a member of NAFAS. Members are also affiliated to WAFA ‚Äì the World Association of Flower Arrangers. Each of the 21 affiliated Areas hold Council Meetings at which each flower club has representation. The Areas in turn are represented at National Council which meets four times a year. A Board of nine Trustees is elected at National Council to oversee the policy and finances of the charity. A national chairman, 1st vice-chairman and 2nd vice-chairman head the organisation for a period of two years in each office. A company secretary is employed as are three other full-time staff. The Headquarters of the Association is a splendid Georgian merchant‚Äôs house at 12 Devonshire Square in the city of London bought in 2001. Previously the Headquarters were at 21 Denbigh Street in Pimlico. The present building usually opens every two years as part of the London Open House Weekend when the public may visit and see some of the organisation‚Äôs activities.

Infanteriedivision) was a German Army infantry division in World War II.  History  The 35th Infantry Division was raised in October 1936 in Germany's re-militarisation. It was used mostly used on the eastern front. In May 1940, the division was part of the German forces sent to invade France and Belgium, remaining as an occupational formation in the two nations until June the next year, when it took part in Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union). Between then and April 1945 the division would remain in the central and southern sectors before being forced back to East Prussia by the advancing Red Army. The 35th Infantry Division was one of many Wehrmacht units which committed war crimes in the Soviet Union. During early 1944 it was involved in an operation in the Gomel Region of Belarus in which 40,000 civilians were expelled from their homes as the German Army retreated; approximately 9,000 civilians died. The 35th Infantry Division undertook a similar operation in early April 1944 in which it rounded up civilians who it then either used for forced labour or expelled from the region; 3,500 were expelled. During that month, the divisional engineer battalion's third company massacred civilians in the towns of Karpilovka and Rudabelka. This operation was planned by the company's officers, who retained control over their soldiers during the killings. Nine members of the division were convicted of this massacre by a Soviet military tribunal in 1947 and sentenced to 25 years hard labour.

He is considered a founder of Slovak film education and filmmaking. He helped establish the genre of ethnographic film in Czechoslovakia.  Biography  Plicka was born to Czech parents in Vienna.≈†toll (2009), p. 426 He spent his childhood in the Austro-Hungarian metropolis and in ƒåesk√° T≈ôebov√° (from 1900 to 1909). Following his graduation at the Teachers Institute in Hradec Kr√°lov√© (1909-1913), Plicka studied violin and music theory privately in Prague and Berlin. His early interest in music resulted in founding various choirs in √öpice and Nov√© Mƒõsto nad Metuj√≠, and most importantly he co-founded the choir of the Czech Philharmonic, together with conductor V√°clav Talich and composer Jaroslav K≈ôiƒçka. He was the artistic director of the choir from 1920 to 1924. During World War I, he was engaged as a singer in the Court Opera in Vienna. Additionally, Plicka focused his interest on collecting Slovak folk songs. From 1919 to 1938 he managed to collect 64,000 melodies and about 100,000 texts of folk songs. His ethnographic works made during that period include over 22,000 photographs and 30 km of film material.≈†toll (2009), p. 427 During his travels, Plicka also visited exiled Slovaks in Romania, Austria, Yugoslavia and the USA. His stays were arranged by Matica slovensk√° in Martin. Plicka's grave, in Martin (Slovakia) In the late 1920s, Plicka began using a camera on his travels. He created his first silent films in 1928 (Za Slovensk√Ωm ludom) and in 1929 (Po hor√°ch, po dol√°ch). The latter received a Gold Medal at the 1st Venice International Film Festival, held in 1932. In 1932, he met and befriended the photographer and filmmaker Alexandr Hackenschmied, with whom he co-created the \\"film poem\\" Zem spieva (The Earth Sings), considered a magnum opus of Czechoslovak documentary film.≈†toll (2009), p. 428 In the 1930s and 40s, he collaborated as an expert assistant in production of Slovak and Soviet films (e.g. J√°no≈°√≠k (1935) by Martin Friƒç and films by Ilya Kopalin and Vasily Belyayev). In 1938 he founded the courses of photography and cinematography at the ≈†kola umeleck√Ωch remesiel (School of Applied Arts) in Bratislava. It was the first attempt at film education in Czechoslovakia. Later, in 1946, he co- founded the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), of which he became the first dean. However, in 1950 Plicka left FAMU due to health issues, and devoted himself mainly to landscape and architectural photography. His photographic and ethnographic work was published in many books and was highly regarded both by public and experts. In his books, Plicka concentrated on documenting folk traditions, Slovak landscape, and Prague. During his life, Plicka received the highest state awards, such as ≈ò√°d pr√°ce (Order of Work) (1954), National Artist (1968), Prize for the Best Book of the Year (1971), National Prize of the Slovak Socialist Republic (1975) and Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk (in memoriam, 1991).

As musical director in the town of Elberfeld he championed the works of the then unknown English composer Frederick Delius before that composer's works were heard in his native country. Biography Haym was born in Halle. He was educated at the universities of Jena and T√ºbingen, where he studied philosophy and classical philology. After graduating, he studied music in Munich, including classes in composition, the piano, organ and singing.Carley, Lionel, \\"Hans Haym: Delius's Prophet and Pioneer\\", Music & Letters, Vol. 54, No. 1 (January 1973), pp. 1‚Äì24, accessed 6 November 2010 Haym succeeded Julius Buths as conductor of the Concert Society, or Elberfelder Concertgesellchaft, in 1890. On 17 December 1892 he programmed works of Beethoven, the Kantate auf den Tod Kaiser Josephs II (cantata in memory of Joseph II), his Piano Concerto No. 5 and his Ninth Symphony, with soloists Julia Uzielli, Jenny Hahn, Franz Naval and Anton Sistermans. Despite the conservative tastes of his audiences he programmed new music when he could, including early performances of Richard Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks in 1895 and Delius's Over the hills and far away (under its German title √úber die Berge in die Ferne) in 1897 and his Paris: The Song of a Great City in 1899. He introduced Delius's music to Buths, who had gone from Elberfeld to the more important musical directorship of D√ºsseldorf. Buths, who was later an early exponent of Elgar's music, also became an admirer of Delius's work. Haym also introduced Delius's music to Fritz Cassirer, musical director of the Stadttheater, Elberfeld, where Delius's opera Koanga was premiered in 1904. At about this time, Haym fell ill and was obliged to convalesce in the Tirol. Haym hoped to be appointed to the more prestigious musical directorship of Strasbourg, but was unsuccessful. At Elberfeld, Haym and his orchestra attracted leading musicians to appear with them, including Raoul Pugno, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, Pablo Casals, Ferruccio Busoni and Artur Schnabel. He retired from the musical directorship in 1920 and died in Elberfeld at the age of 60 on 15 February 1921.

It is a bilingual (English/French) association with the French name L'Association canadienne des sciences de l'information, also known as ACSI. Established in 1971, the association publishes a quarterly journal, The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science (CJILS) and sponsors an annual conference. Along with contact information, the association's web site, www.cais-acsi.ca, provides information about past and future conferences and access to conference proceedings. CAIS members include information scientists and archivists, librarians, computer scientists, documentalists, economists, educators, journalists, psychologists, and others who support its objectives.  History  The Computing and Data Processing Society of Canada, formed in 1958, was the first professional association for information technology professionals in Canada; in 1968 it became the Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS). Canadians who were interested in broader aspects of managing and using information joined the American Society of Information Science (ASIS). In 1969, a group of Ottawa ASIS members met with the intention of forming an Ottawa chapter of ASIS. Some members argued that to represent Canada adequately at the international level a Canadian association was needed. By the next year Letters Patent incorporating the Canadian Association for Information Science were granted, and CAIS was formally operational in early 1971. The first conference was held in 1973. Modelling itself on larger associations such as ASIS, the initial structure included active chapters across the country. Ultimately this structure proved to be unsustainable in the relatively small population of information scientists in Canada and the last remaining chapter closed in the early 1990s. Since then, the association has functioned as a single national association serving members through its journal and annual conferences.  Membership  In the 1970s members were often computer scientists and other practitioners from industry and government, with only a sprinkling of academics. Corporate and government people were involved in early days of information technology implementation, and membership provided a means of learning new developments and exchanging experiences. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the association evolved into a more academic (learned) society. Today the membership is heavily weighted to academics from the library and information science faculties at Canadian universities. Membership in CAIS is automatic for all who attend the annual conference and includes a subscription to The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science. Membership can also be purchased by simply subscribing to the journal through the University of Toronto Press Website.  Conferences  Starting in 1973, the annual conferences have provided a venue for discussion and information exchange. for the first decade, the meetings were generally held in hotels, but since 1985, all of the conferences have been held at universities, reflecting the changing nature of the membership. The early conferences, directed at IT professionals, included vendor displays and private sector sponsorship. Simultaneous translation was provided, but federal or provincial funding assistance dried up forcing the association to drop the service in 1985. Currently, papers continue to be given either in English or French; it is assumed that audience members can understand both languages. In the 1970s and early 1980s speakers were often practitioners from industry and government. Papers were not usually submitted in advance; proceedings were published and distributed after the conference. Through the 1980s, as the membership became more academic, the conference also evolved. Conference papers became more research focussed rather than practitioner oriented. Abstracts of papers began to be evaluated by a conference committee, and accepted papers were submitted in advance so that published proceedings could be distributed at the conference. Some experiments in issuing proceedings in microfiche or audio tape proved unpopular, and proceedings were generally published on paper until 2003. Beginning in 2004,the proceedings are published in advance on the CAIS-ACSI website. Retroactive digitization of earlier conferences is ongoing. In 1997, the association began to hold most conferences in conjunction with the Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences' annual Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities.  Publications  CAIS-ACSI has been publishing since its inception and even before the Letters Patent were issued the first two issues of a projected quarterly journal entitled Information Science in Canada appeared in Winter and Spring of 1970,. For lack of sufficient subscribers, the journal ceased after production of the second issue. From 1971 to 1983, CAIS published 25 numbers of a Newsletter. intended for ephemeral or time related information, covering recent developments. In 1976, the association began publishing Canadian Journal of Information Science/ La Revue canadienne des sciences de l'information, as an annual publication directed at IT and library practitioners. The journal became a peer reviewed quarterly beginning with volume 12 in 1986. In 1993, with volume 18, the title was changed to Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science/ La Revue canadienne des sciences de l'information et de biblioth√©conomie (CJILS) The change of name occurred when the Canadian Library Association ceased publishing Canadian Library Journal. In 1987, with volume 12, the association began publishing CJILSl with the University of Toronto Press (UTP).

The line was opened in sections between 1851 and 1864 and is one of the oldest railways in Germany. Route The line is a non-electrified main line that is equipped with GSM-R digital radio. The line has a speed limit of 120 km/h. The infrastructure- owner, DB Netze classifies the line as D4 class, permitting a maximum axle load of 22.5 tonnes and linear loads of 8.0 tonnes/metre. History  Map of the L√ºbeck‚ÄìL√ºneburg line The L√ºbeck‚ÄìB√ºchen section was opened in 1851 by the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company (), after negotiations failed to agree on a direct connection between L√ºbeck and Hamburg through Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt, which was ruled by the King of Denmark. The section between B√ºchen and Lauenburg on the Elbe was built by the Berlin-Hamburg Railway Company and opened in 1851. In 1864 the Lauenburg‚ÄìHohnstorf train ferry was opened, establishing a connection to the Hanover rail network. The line was part of the shortest rail link from Hamburg to Hanover until the rail bridge over the Elbe in Hamburg was opened in 1872. In 1865, the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company, which retained its name, opened the direct L√ºbeck‚ÄìOldesloe‚ÄìHamburg line. In 1878 an entirely iron bridge was built over the Elbe in Lauenburg, replacing the train ferry. Until 1937, travellers from Lauenburg benefitted from the Lauenburg privilege (Lauenburger Privileg), allowing them to travel on the Berlin-Hamburg railway without having to pay for travel on the Lauenburg‚ÄìB√ºchen section. At the end of the 1980s several long-distance services on the bird flight line to Denmark used the L√ºbeck‚ÄìL√ºneburg line to bypass the Hamburg rail node. A new station was opened at L√ºbeck- Hochschulstadtteil (the university district) northwest of L√ºbeck Airport in December 2013. Operations  The line has been served by Regionalbahn trains, operated by DB Regio, at an hourly frequency since December 2009, using class 648 diesel multiple units. Rates on the Ratzeburg‚ÄìL√ºneburg section are set by the Hamburg Transport Association (Hamburg Transport Association); rates on the L√ºbeck‚ÄìLauenburg section are set in accordance with the Schleswig-Holstein-Tarif. Little freight transport uses the route. On 26 May 2008, a station was opened at L√ºbeck Airport (L√ºbeck-Flughafen). At the same time an electronic interlocking was established in L√ºbeck, replacing six old signal boxes in Pogeez, Ratzeburg, M√∂lln and G√ºster. In addition, another platform was built in Ratzeburg to enable train crossings. This meant that train could cross in Pogeez, Ratzeburg, M√∂lln, B√ºchen, Lauenburg and in J√§ger operations station, north of L√ºneburg. Future  In the long term it is planned to operate services from L√ºbeck Airport and Ratzeburg to L√ºbeck at a half-hourly frequency.Bahn-Report 1/2010, p. 39 In addition, the route will be electrified and double tracked to connect with the proposed Fehmarn Belt tunnel by about 2022. The line will then be used as a secondary route for freight trains. The main line will be the L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg railway.

His family lived and ran a business from the High Street in DundeeDundee Post Office Directory 1809Sir James Ivory the mathematician was his uncle, and James Ivory, the watchmaker was his grandfather. After attending Dundee Academy he studied for the legal profession at the University of Edinburgh was admitted as a member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1810, and in that year was enrolled as a burgess of Dundee. When, in 1819, the select committee of the House of Commons was engaged in making inquiries into the state of the Scottish burghs, Ivory was examined with reference to the municipal condition of Dundee, and strongly advocated for the abolition of self-election, which was then prevalent in the town councils of Scotland, and continued in force till 1833. Ivory was chosen as advocate depute by Francis Jeffrey, Lord advocate, in 1830; two years later he was appointed Sheriff of Caithness, and in 1833 was transferred to a similar office in Buteshire. He was Solicitor-General for Scotland under Lord Melbourne's ministry in 1839, was made a Lord Ordinary of Session the following year, and sat as judge in the Court of Exchequer. In 1848 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposer was James Russell. In 1849 he was appointed a lord of justiciary (taking the title of Lord Ivory), and served both in the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary until his retirement in October 1862. For several years before that date he was the senior judge of both courts. As a lawyer Ivory was distinguished by the subtlety of his reasoning, his minuteness of detail, and profound erudition.

Founded in 1973, it specializes in the design of contextual and high-performance design projects. The firm has designed a diverse range of buildings and infrastructure projects in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa. \\\\- Omrania's best-known projects include the Kingdom Centre (Kingdom Tower), the Public Investment Fund (PIF) (formerly Capital Market Authority Headquarters) Tower, and the Aga Khan Award-winning Tuwaiq Palace in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. The firm's most recent high-profile project in development is the King Salman Park in Riyadh, which will become the largest city park in the world. With approximately 500 employees, Omrania has two offices in Riyadh and additional offices in Jeddah and Amman, Jordan. The four office teams include professionals from more than 30 countries. The company is led by a board of directors representing all design disciplines and administration units.  History and growth  Omrania was founded when architects Basem Al- Shihabi and Nabil Fanous collaborated to win an international design competition for the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) Headquarters in Riyadh. \\\\- In order to design and supervise the building's construction, they opened a small office that eventually grew into a large, multi-disciplinary practice of Omrania. Since then, Omrania has become a major contributor to Riyadh‚Äôs urban expansion, as the capital city grew from 150,000 people in 1960 to 7.6 million by 2017. In 1980, Omrania established a branch office in London, designing international projects such as the Tuwaiq Palace, the Radwa 4 planned community in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, and the interior renovation of historic Four Millbank in the City of Westminster, London. In addition to designing numerous corporate headquarters, one of the firm's key early projects was the Tuwaiq Palace, a diplomatic club in Riyadh completed in 1985. In collaboration with Buro Happold and Frei Otto, Omrania's design drew from vernacular architectural forms such as the tent and fortification, adapted to the desert climate. The solution resonates with the natural landscape and incorporates innovative modern technology and sustainable design features, according to architectural historian Chris Abel. Omrania continued to expand its portfolio of mixed-use projects throughout the 1990s. In 1999, in conjunction with Ellerbe Becket, Omrania designed and supervised the construction of Riyadh's iconic Kingdom Centre; a shopping center, hotel, office, and residential complex with a 300-meter (984-feet) tower and skybridge overlooking Riyadh. In the 21st century, the firm has increased its portfolio of urban planning and public space designs. Omrania designed (with Aukett Fitzroy Robinson) Riyadh's Salam Park (2003), a 25-hectare public park that offers an oasis of urban green space. \\\\- \\\\- Omrania also completed a comprehensive Olayya-Batha Corridor planning and transportation study with Perkins + Will and Dornier Consulting. While most of Omrania's completed works are within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the company opened branch offices in Bahrain and Jordan and, from this expanded base of operations, has completed projects in Tunisia, Yemen, Lebanon, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Bahrain. The firm also was an equity holder from 1992 to 2004 in Chovet Engineering, a French manufacturing and process engineering company. In 2013, Omrania was selected‚Äîalong with architects Zaha Hadid Architects, Sn√∏hetta, and Gerber Architekten‚Äîto design one of the four main intermodal transit hubs of the new Arriyadh Metro (Riyadh Metro) system. Omrania's Arriyadh Metro Western Station, when completed in 2020, will incorporate public gardens and community space as well as a fully enclosed intermodal transit hub serving the new Metro and express bus network. \\\\- In 2018, Omrania's newly completed Grand Mosque in King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) in Riyadh gained international recognition for its angular geometric forms and delicate treatment of light. The mosque's distinctive design reflects its modern context, the arid environment of Saudi Arabia, and the traditions of Islam. In 2019, the firm was master planning 25 new residential communities covering 45 square km (17.3 square mi.) in Saudi Arabia's western region on behalf of the nation's Ministry of Housing, all with pedestrian-friendly streetscapes and sustainable infrastructure. The firm's largest skyscraper is the 385-meter (1,263-foot) Public Investment Fund (PIF) Tower (formerly known as CMA Tower) designed by Omrania and HOK in a joint venture. \\\\- The tower is the tallest building in Riyadh and the anchor of the city's King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD). Its hexagonal-shaped plan tapers inward and outward as it rises, providing open floor plans and a distinctively crystalline profile on the skyline, \\"inspired from geologic formations polished by the hand of man,\\" according to the architects. Additional Omrania projects completed in 2019 include the Riyadh Hilton Hotel & Residences and the Radission Blu Hotel & Residences in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. The 2019 announcement of Omrania's role in designing the future King Salman Park, said to be the world's largest city park, placed the firm once again in the international spotlight. Omrania has teamed with the Center for the Study of the Built Environment since 2008 to sponsor of the Omrania  CSBE Student Award for Architectural Design, which recognizes outstanding design projects by graduating students in architecture across the Middle East. Omrania and sustainable design The new headquarters campus of the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) ‚Äî one of the firm's current large-scale projects ‚Äî includes vast rooftop solar arrays, computer-modeled shading systems and other passive design measures to reduce energy consumption. This \\"green building\\" project has also been described in the architectural media as a healthy building, \\"designed with the ultimate comfort of its employees in mind.‚Äù Other examples of Omrania's sustainable design include high-performance fa√ßade systems on the PIF Tower, Waha Office Building, and the Radisson Blu Diplomatic Quarter, all in Riyadh. The PIF Tower, designed with HOK to achieve LEED_NC Gold certification, has an external layer of fins, gantries, and perforated panels that provide enhanced shade, minimize internal cooling loads, and reduce energy costs. A photovoltaic array further boosts energy performance. The King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) in Riyadh, the site of Omrania's PIF Tower and Grand Mosque, was the largest green development in the world seeking green building accreditationin 2011 and is set to become the world's first LEED- certified district.

Long before the islands became part of the United States in 1917, the islands, particular the island of Saint Croix, was exploited by the Danish from the early 18th century and by 1800 over 30,000 acres were under cultivation, earning Saint Croix a reputation as \\"The Garden of the West Indies\\". Since the closing of the last sugar factory on Saint Croix in 1966, the industry has become only a memory. History The island of Saint Croix has long been associated with sugar production and has been the dominant cash crop for the economy for over two hundred years. Due to its considerable accomplishments in agriculture, the island of Saint Croix became one of the wealthiest sugar producing islands and gained a reputation as \\"The Garden of the West Indies\\". The Caribbean island of Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands was a major sugar producing area from at least 1734 when the Danish West India and Guinea Company bought the islands from the French. The Danish colonists exploited the island, including the area around Belvedere on the north coast of the island from 1763. There is a historic sugar plantation located at Belvedere and sugar mill which was built by the Danish.Newsletter, Volumes 31-32, Society for Historical Archaeology, 1998 When the Danes arrived on Saint Croix they found a number of British families raising cane and making rum. The Danes divided the islands into 150 and 300 acre plantations and into nine quarters but faced stiff competition from the British who at one point owned 5 times as many plantations as the Danish. Due to extremely low land costs and tax benefits, planters came to Saint Croix from the surrounding islands of St. Thomas, Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Montserrat and elsewhere and by 1755 the island had a population of over 10,000. Although the Danes almost went bankrupt in 1753, they steadily grew to dominate Saint Croix, operating 375 plantations not only cultivating sugar, but also cotton, indigo and tobacco. The sugar industry reached its peak between 1795 and 1800 after the Danes declared the slave trade in 1792 which ensured a plentiful supply of African labor, coinciding with high prices on the world market. At the peak of output in sugar production in the Virgin Islands at the close of the 18th century, more than 30,000 acres of Saint Croix were under sugar cultivation. The island of St. Croix contained nearly 150 sugar mills during this period; 115 of which are still standing today. Sugar mill in Saint Croix Sugar farmers in Bethlehem, Saint Croix in December 1941 The ruined remains of a sugar mill in the US Virgin Islands The Danish Crown formally abolished the transatlantic slave trade in 1803, but not the selling of slaves within the Virgin Islands, the stature prohibiting importation having been passed 11 years earlier. In the 19th century the sugar industry began to decline. However, it is evident that slaves continued to be used to propel the industry, even if illegally, as in 1848, Governor von Scholten freed the slaves on St. Croix, after rioting broke out. During the Napoleonic wars, the Danish were at odds with the British, snatching the island back off of them after a conflict in 1801 and again after the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. However over the next few decades the economy declined miserably, with the sugar industry plagued by drought and coinciding with political and economic uncertainty in Europe, its most important market and after 1810 faced serious competition from beet sugar producers and from the East Indies. In the 1860s and 1870s a series of disasters deeply affected the sugar industry in St. Croix, with a major fire in Christiansted in February 1866, an earthquake and tsunami in 1867, and a major hurricane which destroyed crops and buildings in 1872. In 1875, the Danish government funded a Central Sugar Factory on St. Croix in a bid to help the industry out of depression. However, prices continued to fall due to the increasing competition from beet sugar and from the East Indies. After the United States bought the islands in 1917, production diminished considerably. According to the 1930 census, only were under sugar cultivation in 1929, and the annual yield was 56,400 tons as compared to 84,000 in 1917.

Stephen Morris was finished in 1923 while Shute was working at Stag Lane for de Havilland, and Pilotage was written in 1924. Unpublished during his lifetime, but published by his estate in one volume as many of the characters are common to both novels. They are set in the budding (but nascent) post-war aviation industry in Britain, and also on yachts (Pilotage). Stephen Morris Stephen Morris studies mathematics at Oxford, but when he finishes the unusually good job in rubber in Malaya he expects has fallen through as business is bad and the firm cannot afford him. He sees no prospect of marrying now or in the future and sets fellow student Helen Riley free of any promise to him instead of carrying through with his letter proposing marriage. He gets a low paid job as a pilot cum mechanic in the Isle of Wight Aviation Company with her cousin Malcolm Riley and his partner Stenning. The firm fails after the wartime ministry hangar they are occupying is taken back, and he goes (initially on trial, unpaid) to Captain Rawdon‚Äôs Rawdon Aircraft Co. He becomes head, for a while the only staff, of the technical department; he studies aeronautical engineering and publishes a paper on fuselages. He turns down an offer from an armament firm Pilling-Henries and gets a new screw or rise when Rawdon gets an order for their new two-seater fighter ‚Äì from Denmark, not from the Air Ministry: we must hope the government won‚Äôt risk a war with Denmark. Morris tells Riley about breaking his engagement to Helen, saying he thinks that she will wait for him. But she is shortly to marry Lechlane, who is going into politics and needs a hostess wife. Riley funks telling Helen in person, but drafts a letter to her. He is then killed when a plane he is piloting for Rawdon makes a forced landing. Christie, back from the Argentine, tells Morris about Helen‚Äôs engagement, having seen a newspaper item about it. Morris gives up hope of Helen, but while motoring near the Riley‚Äôs place in Bevil Crossways in Gloucestershire is seen by her. She tells him that she broke off the engagement after Lechlane, who was sent to sort out Riley‚Äôs affairs finds the draft letter and sends it to her: a most reliable man, Lechlane; a man who could be trusted to always do the right thing. Pilotage Peter Denniston proposes to Sheila Wallace; he knew her four years ago, and has a job in Hong Kong with his uncle, as a maritime solicitor. He drops in on the Wallaces while supposedly on a walking tour, but as Jimmie Wallace says: Whoever heard of a man taking a dinner-jacket with him on a walking tour?. She turns him down, saying she could not live in China. So Denniston returns to London for a week solo on the yacht Irene that he shares with Lanard. In the Solent he collides with Sir David Fisher‚Äôs large yacht the Clematis which fails to give way to him. Fisher, who as skipper was steering her realises that he was in the wrong. So Fisher takes him on board the Clematis to recover, and gets the Irene repaired. Rawdon and Morris are also on board, discussing a secret aeronautical venture. Morris is married to Helen, though most of their family think that she has married badly. He is described as lean or cadaverous, and says to Denniston that he also knows the Wallaces of Little Tinney, Berkshire. The secret venture is a proposed transatlantic urgent cargo service; a ship carries a flying boat carrying 500 pounds of urgent cargo which is catapulted off when within range (950 to 1000 miles) of the destination so reducing the transit time from 7 days to 5. The trial flight from New York to Padstow, Cornwall with Morris as pilot and Dennison as navigator is awaited by Rawdon and Wallace, with Helen who is accompanied by Sheila. As it is overdue and will have used all the petrol they fear the worst, but the plane which has taken off 963 miles away but strikes a headwind has landed in Ireland. They refuel with the extra petrol which Morris has taken at the last minute as he had the wind up instead of a dummy load of 500 lbs of firebars. So the scheme appears commercial but is to go to Milford Haven not Padstow. Sheila tells her brother has refused to go with Dennison to Hong Kong as she knows he will not like it there, not just because she won‚Äôt like it. But Dennison regards her acceptance as a test ‚Äì so she was a damn sight too clever, and Antony says he won‚Äôt come back as she hopes; he urges her to write to Dennison which she does; a very long letter. She tells her brother that she had to have a shot at piloting him out (of Hong Kong; a reference to the book title?). At the end she says that she wrote to him before she heard of the test flight saying she had changed her mind, and he tells her the Hong Kong scheme is off. He has a good job with Fisher, sailing his yacht Chrysanthe at Cowes in season and working in the Fisher Line legal department for an old chap ... And it‚Äôs the work I‚Äôm keen on. Rawdon and Morris watch them sitting in the sandhills: Rawdon says They don‚Äôt want any breakfast. Publishing History The introduction says that the two complete novels were left in his papers when he died in 1960. The publisher and family (Heather Felicity Norway) decided to publish them as: They are good stories in themselves, and published in one volume because of the continuity of some of the characters ‚Äì particularly Stephen Morris ‚Äì through both. Not only do they provide evidence of Shute‚Äôs fine narrative gift, but they each contain strong personal elements which readers will find an interesting supplement to the author‚Äôs autobiography, Slide Rule. Shute himself wrote about them that:Slide Rule page 53-4 I finished my first novel in 1923, sent it to three publishers, and put it on the shelf, where it will remain because it is a very poor book. I read it the other day after brushing off the dust of nearly thirty years, or rather skimmed it through; I don‚Äôt thing anyone would have the patience to read the whole thing. I doubt very much, if any, of it was written twice; the evidence of the type was against that, and the timing. I wrote another one in 1924 which was equally bad, and again I was content to put it on the shelf and do something else. They were typed on an old Blick portable: he said it may not be quite a coincidence that his first published novel Marazan was written on a brand new typewriter.Slide Rule page 49 Both novels are short: 140 pages (Stephen Morris) and 129 pages (Pilotage). There are some discrepancies which may have been removed if proofread: :Stenning switched off the engine before he lands (!), and the book then says after he lands that he switched off the engine.Stephen Morris pages 10-11 :Morris says that he was unpublished so his name would not be known, but earlier it is stated that a paper on fuselages by him has been published.Stephen Morris pages 118, 111 Similarities with the author Stephen Morris himself like Shute starts in the budding British aviation industry after studying at Oxford, though unlike Shute he was a wartime fighter pilot. Riley tells Rawdon that Morris first flew in Rawdon fighters: \\"Rats and Robins .. then he crashed and became a ferry pilot, and after that he went to the Handley Pages .. he's flown pretty well everything ... He'll be a useful man on the design side ...\\"Stephen Morris page 35 Shute‚Äôs Great War experience was restricted to training at Woolwich and as a gunner and failing to get a commission, before enlisting \\"in the ranks\\" in August 1918 and guarding the Isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary, plus serving in military funeral parties in Kent during the 1918 flu pandemic. Peter Dennison is also an Oxford graduate, and as Morris says the right sort. Morris and Dennison are both well-educated, but though helped by family connections to get employment do not inherit money. A subplot is marriage and the girl who may not wait until her fianc√© can support a family, or may not accompany him to a colonial job. Stephen Morris breaks off with Helen Fisher after he loses a proposed job with prospects with an uncle (an old rubber merchant Stephen Morris page 5) in Malaya. Peter Dennison is turned down by Sheila Wallace when he takes a job in Hong Kong (as a junior partner with his uncle's firm Stephen Morris page 147). Both couples finally reconcile at the end of each book.

Club career =Villarreal= Born in Cartaya, Province of Huelva, Joselu came through the ranks of Villarreal CF, and made his senior debut for their third team. He first appeared at the professional level on 12 June 2010, in the reserves' penultimate game of the season, as a half-time substitute in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against CD Numancia; he scored his first goal roughly one year later, opening a 1‚Äì2 defeat at Real Betis also for the Segunda Divisi√≥n championship. The following campaign, Joselu netted 11 times in 29 matches, including a hat- trick on 30 September 2011 in a 3‚Äì2 home win over Gimn√†stic de Tarragona. The team was eventually relegated due to the descent of their parent club, and he made 16 competitive appearances for the latter ‚Äì mostly from the bench ‚Äì that year, including in the UEFA Champions League; his debut was a goalless La Liga away draw to Getafe CF, replacing Jonathan de Guzm√°n for the final four minutes. =Later years= On 23 June 2012, Joselu was loaned to C√≥rdoba CF for the upcoming campaign. He remained in his native Andalusia and the second level a year later, signing a three-year deal with the option of a fourth at Recreativo de Huelva. In January 2015, with Recre in serious financial problems halfway through a season that would end with relegation, Joselu transferred to RCD Mallorca for a year and the option of a second. He remained there only until August, when he was signed by fellow division two side CD Lugo. On 14 June 2017, after being crowned top scorer of the second tier with 23 goals, Joselu agreed to a three-year contract with Granada CF, recently relegated from the top flight. On 13 August of the following year, he moved to Real Oviedo of the same league on a four-year deal. Personal life Joselu's younger brother, Sim√≥n, was also a footballer and a forward. He too came through Villarreal's system.

This special was an exception to others in that it had more studio segments and a \\"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\\" segment within the episode; the second special was a full-length special edition entitled \\"Middle East Special\\", which aired five days later on 26 December. Following Ben Collins' departure, a new Stig was introduced. Episodes Criticism and Controversy =Mexican Slurs comments= Following the broadcast of the second episode of Series 16, controversy arose from the episode's News segment and the discussion between the presenters about Mexico's first supercar. During the discussion, two of the hosts described Mexicans as being lazy and that no-one would complain because they were all too busy sleeping, provoking the Mexican ambassador, Eduardo Medina Mora, to accuse the presenters of resorting to \\"outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults to stir bigoted feelings against the Mexican people\\", while stating that the remarks were offensive, xenophobic and humiliating and reinforced negative stereotypes of Mexican people. While the BBC defended the presenters anti-Mexican jokes, it apologised about some of the remarks made. Comedian Steve Coogan, however, criticised the programme for its pitiful apology following the broadcast, suggesting that the usual defence of \\"a bit of a laugh\\", or \\"harmless fun\\" was no longer appropriate, that the insults had gone too far, and described the comments as being \\"as funny as a cold sweat followed by shooting pains down the left arm\\". However, Mastretta appeared to have brushed off the insults, with general director Carlos Mastretta clarifying that the car was simply used as a pretext for the jokes, and that the controversy has increased interest in the MXT. The Mexican comments were cut when the episode was broadcast in the United States. =Albanian Road Trip film= After the third episode of Series 16 was aired, the BBC received several complaints in regards to the road trip film, in which the presenters were finding a car suitable for the \\"Albanian Mafia\\". A number of complaints were directed to a segment of the film in which the presenters 'murdered' a fat Albanian and attempted to find out which of three car boots he would fit into the best, while the stereotypical views that Albania was a nest for mafia car thieves, were also criticised. =Inspiration for episode location= After the airing of earlier episode of the trio touring the US, which included upsetting people in the US due to politically incorrect phrases painted on their vehicles designed to cause controversy,Top Gear: US Special a viewer in the Southeastern US posted on the show's forumhttp://www.topgear.com suggesting, as presenter Jeremy Clarkson would often describe scenic roads they visit, that North Carolina's Blue Ridge Parkway was among the more scenic roads in the world.

History In 1862 the Sektion Austria was founded in Vienna by the academics Paul Grohmann, Friedrich Simony and Edmund von Mojsisovics. It was the first mountaineering club on the continent, modelled on the London Alpine Club. About seven years later, the Austrian mountaineer Franz Senn founded the Bildungsb√ºrgerlicher Bergsteigerverein in Munich. Both organisations merged in 1873 to form the German and Austrian Alpine Club. The main organisation consisted of numerous legally independent sections responsible for the upkeep of Alpine club huts and footpaths. In 1918 the Du√ñAV purchased about of land at the Pasterze Glacier of the Grossglockner massif, which became the nucleus of the present-day High Tauern National Park. From the mid 1920s the club placed an increased focus on environmental concerns of the high mountain regions. On the other hand, club life was shaped by rising nationalism and antisemitism. Some sections, such as in Vienna or Munich, implemented an \\"Aryan paragraph\\" even before World War I. After 1919, Jewish members were expelled from the club. In turn, the Sektion Donauland was founded by Viktor Frankl and Fred Zinnemann as a resort for Jewish alpinists; it was excluded from the Du√ñAV main organisation in 1924. Even in most Alpine club huts, Jewish mountaineers were not admitted. While the cross-national Du√ñAV first could not be co-opted into the Nazi German League of the Reich for Physical Exercise (DRL), the organisation lost its independence upon the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany and the occupation of the Czechoslovak Sudetenland in 1938. After World War II the Austrian Alpine Club (√ñAV) was re-established in 1945, followed by the separate German Alpine Club (DAV) in 1952.

The present-day division established for the German-speaking world (less Switzerland) was compiled by the German, Austrian and South Tyrol Alpine Clubs and published in 1984 and is also used for the basic numbering of Alpine Club maps for mountaineering.  Classification system  The Eastern Alps are divided into four main areas: the Northern Limestone Alps, the Central Eastern Alps, the Southern Limestone Alps, and the Western Limestone Alps. These four main ranges are further divided into 75 sub-groups. The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each, while the Southern Limestone Alps have 15. The six groups of the Western Limestone Alps are also classed with the Central Eastern Alps. The classification is based principally on orographic considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups. The amendments of 1984 address a number of geological problems and have dropped many of the 1924 Morrigl groups, making more precise sub-divisions for them in other areas. These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub-division letters. The Western Limestone Alps were added, an area which is not covered by the three Alpine Clubs and actually is a continuation of the Southern and Swiss Alps. Unlike the previous scheme, the Salzburg Slate Alps were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps as they are part of the greywacke zone that forms the basement of the Limestone Alps. The Ortler Alps and the Sobretta-Gavia range were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps, though geologically, they are north of the Periadriatic Seam and ranked part of the Austroalpine nappes.  Geographical characteristics  The Eastern Alps extend across six European countries: Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia. With 57 mountain groups, Austria has the largest share. It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten. There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia. Liechtenstein shares one group. The only four- thousander and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the Piz Bernina at . Thus the Bernina Range is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps. Next are the Ortler Alps, whose highest peak, Mt. Ortler at , is the highest mountain in South Tyrol. The third highest range is the Glockner Group with the highest mountain in Austria: the Grossglockner at . Another 22 groups reach a height of 3,000 metres. The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three-thousander is the Lechtal Alps, whose highest summit is the Parseierspitze at . 39 groups are over 2000 metres high. Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres‚Äîexcept for the Vienna Woods, whose highest mountain, the Sch√∂pfl, just reaches an altitude of .  Mountain groups as per the Alpine Club classification  See List of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps  Other classifications  Up to today, there is no internationally accepted classification of the Alps. Beside the common AVE arrangement, the Swiss Alpine Club subdivides the Swiss Alps (including the East Alpine parts) along cantonal boundaries, while Austrian hydrography uses a slightly different orographic system. In Italy and France the segmentation is usually based on the 1926 Partizione delle Alpi. In 2005, a new proposal was made by the Italian Alpinist, Sergio Marazzi, to merge the competing systems of the Alpine states into the Suddivisione Orografica Internazionale Unificata del Sistema Alpino (SOIUSA), but this has not gained acceptance.

Palis√°dy Street () is a major street in Bratislava's Old Town connecting Hod≈æovo n√°mestie and Bratislava Castle in the Slovakia's capital. The street is served by public transport trolleybusses. Near the Bratislava Castle and National Council of the Slovak Republic building it bends sharply and continues as Mudro≈àova Street, together forming the main passageway through the western part of the Bratislava Old Town.  Bratislava tree  There is an old Linden tree located at Palis√°dy Street no. 12 - 14. which survived several centuries. It is probably a survivor of one of the famous renaissance gardens that used to be in this area. There is a copperplate from A. Kaltschmied from 1735, according to a geometer Mikov√≠ny, providing historical evidence of the widespread linden trees in the area of contemporary \\"Palisades\\". On the plan from 1768 there is a dominant tree marked in the garden of baron Jesen√°k, it is mentioned also by M. Korabinsk√Ω in his publication on Bratislava from 1781. The tree raised attention of the Slovak revival generation. The tree represented a symbol to so called ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r - movements - the linden is considered to be a symbol of Slavs. In this period, lindens were popular trees all over Europe. Lindens are subject of making gardens and tree alleys (for example \\"Unten den Linden\\" (Under the lindens) in Berlin). Later, the garden of baron Jesen√°k became the ownership of a spirit producing entrepreneur Slubek. In 1865, the members of the general meeting of the Austrian Monarchy Doctor Association and Scientists admired the most spectacular sightseeing of the city and one of the most attractive natural objects of the whole Austrian Monarchy. According to historian Ortvay, these specialists estimated the tree's age to be one thousand years. In the 19th century, the tree had a perimeter at the root of 11 metres and at chest height of 8 metres whereas one of the side twigs was 4 metres. In the 20th century, during the construction boom in Bratislava, the area of the linden tree was endangered. In 1982, the tree was proclaimed to be a preserved tree. The area was protected by fencing which enabled huge boughs to grow. Today the holes in the tree are the evidence of it. The linden tree however deprecated and today survived just as a remainder. In the 1990s its protection was cancelled. In 2003, the tree was designated as the Tree - the Hero of the year 2003. The Bratislava tree is being referred to as the \\"Palffy¬¥s tree\\" because it was displayed so in one masterpiece from 18th century. Referring to existing historical documents, the tree can be proven to be at least 236 years old. The tree could be even older because no data is kept to prove whether the tree was not in the past a tree connected and being part of \\"Prepost\\" gardens and maybe even the remainder of the original primeval forests of the Small Carpathian Mountains.  Access  The street is 5 minutes walking distance from the edge of the historical city centre of Bratislava. It is currently served by trolleybuses no. 203, no. 207, no. 208, auxiliary mini-bus line no. 147 and night trolleybus no. 47.

His father, Julius Cassirer, was one of nine children; Julius was distantly related to his wife, Julcher (Julie) n√©e Cassirer, through a common great- grandfather.Falk, Jim. \\"Cassirer and Cohen: histories, relatives and descendants\\", accessed 7 January 2012 Fritz Cassirer studied music with Hans Pfitzner and Gustav Holl√§nder, after which he was appointed to conducting posts in a succession of German opera houses: L√ºbeck, Posen, Saarbr√ºcken and Elberfeld.Blyth, Alan, \\"Cassirer, Fritz.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, accessed 6 November 2010 While Cassirer was in charge of the Elberfeld opera, his colleague Hans Haym introduced him to the music of Frederick Delius, which was little known in Germany and hardly known at all anywhere else.Carley, Lionel, Hans Haym: Delius's Prophet and Pioneer\\", Music & Letters, Vol. 54, No. 1 (January 1973), pp. 1-24, accessed 6 November 2010 Cassirer, like Haym, became a strong advocate of Delius's music. He conducted the premi√®re of Delius's opera Koanga at Elberfeld in 1904, helped Delius choose the Nietzsche text for his secular choral work, A Mass of Life and organised the premiere of another Delius opera, A Village Romeo and Juliet at the Berlin Komische Oper in 1907. Cassirer was a member of the Komische Oper company that visited London in 1907, playing Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann.The Times, 18 April 1907, p. 8 While in London he conducted concerts, at one of which, with Thomas Beecham's New Symphony Orchestra, he presented Delius's Appalachia. Beecham, who had hitherto known nothing of Delius's music, expressed his \\"wonderment\\" and was from then on a lifelong devotee of the composer's works.Beecham, pp. 63‚Äì4 Beecham praised Cassirer for having \\"naturally good if slightly fastidious taste\\".Quoted in Blyth (Grove Online) After turning down an offer to appear at the Manhattan Opera House, New York, Cassirer retired to Munich, and devoted himself to philosophical and literary studies. He died in Berlin at the age of 55. Family life Fritz Cassirer was married to Lilly Dispecker. They had one daughter, Eva Charlotte Cassirer, who married her father's cousin, Friedrich Wilhelm Cassirer (also known as Fritz); he was for a time managing director of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, and Max Reinhardt's business manager.

Wyer (born 24 March 1964) is a British composer.  Early life  Wyer was born in Cheltenham, England.  Career  He began his career as a guitarist with pop and jazz bands in the 1980s. He became a music teacher in the 1990s, while developing as a composer. = Concert works = He composed May Peace Prevail On Earth, for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, with London voices, Burntwood girls choir and baritone Matthew Sharp, which premiered at The Barbican, London, in 2003. If I Had Known I Was Dreaming (for Japan 2001 Festival) premiered at The Purcell Room, London with soprano, Evelyne Beech and the Tippett String Quartet. Chelsea-Chelsea (for the Juilliard School) premiered at Jazz at Lincoln Center, New York in 2005, with two saxophones and string quartet and live link from Chelsea London, with poetry read by Steve Rubie at the 606 Club, London. Insomnia Poems is a one-hour work inspired by the Insomnia Poems of Steve Dalachinsky that was broadcast on BBC Radio 3's 'Jazz on 3' in March 2009. Wyer is the Associate Composer of the Orchestra of the Swan, Stratford on Avon. = Opera and ballet = Wyer's music has often been inspired by other art forms, particularly dance, for which he has written many scores, including: Discoveries Uncovered, choreographed by Jessica Lang for the Juilliard School in 2003, and 'Senbazuru' also with Lang, created for Juilliard's centenary in 2006 for soprano, alto, tenor and bass with large orchestra. The Far Shore was commissioned by the British Council and English National Ballet in 2010, and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra. It was to be performed for \\"Great Britain Day\\" at the Shanghai World Expo in front of Prince Andrew and other luminaries, but was withdrawn. He has a long-standing relationship with film-maker Tobin Rothlein and choreographer Amanda Miller, artistic directors of the Philadelphia-based company, Miro Dance Theatre. His operatic works include Cremenville in 2006, for which he also wrote the libretto and Numinous City, a work in progress commissioned by the Royal Opera House's development arm, ROH2. In 2002 he formed the music-theatre company, SharpWire, with actor, singer and cellist, Matthew Sharp. Together they created a 'multi-media song-cycle' at Battersea Arts Centre, London, entitled Adam's Apple, based on Wyer's settings of poets Charles Simic, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Giuseppe Ungaretti and others. The work featured acting, singing, choreography and film (by Tobin Rothlein, who also designed the set) and toured the United Kingdom in 2004, with additional performances at the Philadelphia Live Arts Festival and a guest performance and interview on the long-running show, New Sounds, on WNYC, New York. The company produced several experimental works including Saccades And Fixations and Cremenville, written for Opera North's Resonance programme in 2006. In 2007, Wyer wrote an opera- storytelling work Johnny's Midnight Goggles as a one-man show, later performed by Sharp. It premiered at the Brighton Festival in 2008, with performances at Chichester, Bath, Glastonbury, Edinburgh and other festivals. Sharp also performed the sequel, Finkelstein's Castle.  Time structured mapping  Time Structured Mapping is a scoring system that uses the convention of barlines to indicate durations and gives guidelines for improvisation, text, movement, alongside standard musical notation. It is in a way similar to graphic notation scores and the scores of Musique Concr√®te composers. It led to a variety of exploratory new works, including the one-hour Insomnia Poems based on the book of poetry by Steve Dalachinsky. It was recorded for BBC Radio 3's 'Jazz on 3' programme and subsequently nominated for their 'Best of 2009' broadcast. The work featured musicians Chris Cundy Robert Perry, Evelyne Beech, Mike Cross with Wyer performing on guitar, piano and sound manipulation performing from a 'time-structured map' with stopwatches on music stands, allowing coherent movement from section to section. Other works featuring Time Structured Mapping include the one-hour Listening to the Sky performed in the atrium of Birmingham Symphony Hall in 2010 by members of the Orchestra of the Swan along with components from local schools, according to directions given from the 'map'. The system was used by Welsh National Opera for the educational element of their 2010 tour. A 20-minute film, Beware Inanimate Objects (Bearing Grudges) was created by Gavin Porter, with a Wyer score for the first half of the film and a time-structured map for the second half, giving musical guidelines to groups of students in order for them to create the second half of the score in a one-day workshop.

Office of Personnel Management, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001) is a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit addressing a two decade-old conflict between the United States Congress and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over the depth of whistleblower protection available to federal civilian employees covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The discourse revolves around the meaning of the word 'any'.  Facts of the case  The complainant, Kenneth Huffman alleged that he made protected disclosures to Inspector General Patrick McFarland of the Office of Personnel Management, including that McFarland improperly preselected an agency employee for the Senior Executive Service (SES). The allegation included the accusation that the complainant was removed as an Assistant Inspector General following these communications.Mahoney and Jeffery, PLLC, What Constitutes Whistleblowing, WIFLE (Women in Federal Law Enforcement) E-News (Sept. 2009). Huffman's removal prompted his complaint under the Whistleblower Protection Act. In 1994, the United States Congress passed an amendment to the Act. The legislative history of that amendment stated, \\" . . . it also is not possible to further clarify the clear language in section 2302(b)(8) that protection for 'any' whistleblowing disclosure truly means 'any.' A protected disclosure may be made as part of an employee's job duties, may concern policy or individual misconduct, and may be oral or written and to any audience inside or outside the agency, without restriction to time, place, motive or content.\\"Remarks of the Honorable Carl Levin (D-MI), United States Senator, Cong. Rec. (June 10, 2003) at 14238-9. Under Senator Levin's view, Huffman's disclosures would have been protected. Huffman took his case to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Whistleblower Protection Act to intervene in Huffman's removal.Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., No. DC-1221-99-0178-W-1 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 25, 1999) (initial decision); Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., 84 M.S.P.R. 569, 570 (Dec. 14, 1999) (final order). The case was argued before Chief Judge Mayer and Circuit Judges Bryson and Dyk of the Federal Circuit. James M. Eisenmann of Passman & Kaplan, P.C. argued for Huffman. James C. Caine was the trial attorney for the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, U.S. Department of Justice argued for the Office of Personnel Management. The government argued that whistleblower disclosures to persons who did not have authority to correct wrongdoing were not entitled to protection under the statute. The Federal Circuit remanded the case with respect to Huffman's disclosures concerning the conduct of employees other than his immediate supervisor.  The Rule as a Summarization of Existing Case Law  Despite this Congressional intent in the 1994 amendment, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit curtailed the scope of federal law by defining some communications outside the definition of 'whistleblower'. A series of Federal Circuit cases subsequent to 1994 took a narrow view of the scope of whistleblower protection. In Horton v. Dep't of the Navy, the court ruled that communications to co-workers, the wrong-doer, or to a supervisor were not acts of whistleblowing.Levin remarks at 14239; see also Robert G. Vaughn, Merit Systems Protection Board: Rights and Remedies (American Lawyer Media 2004) at ¬ß 15.03(3); Barbara Sapin, 'Beyond Garcetti: The Limits of Protection' in Retaliation and Whistleblowers (Kluwer Law International 2009) at 605. In Willis v. Dep't of Agriculture, the court ruled that a whistleblower's disclosures to officials in the agency chain of command or those made in the course of normal duties were not protected. Then, finally, the court issued Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management, reaffirming Horton and Willis through the rule in Huffman.Levin remarks at 14239. Finally, in Meuwissen v. Dep't of the Interior, the court ruled that a whistleblower's communication of previously known information does not qualify as a disclosure. In 2003, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan took to the Senate floor and noted that \\"[a]ll of these rulings violate clear Congressional intent to afford broad protection to whistleblower disclosures.\\" Criticism of the case Immediately following the release of Huffman, then-U.S. Special Counsel Elaine Kaplan noted that the court did actually reject the Justice Department's argument that would have left whistleblowers unprotected except when disclosures were made to persons with the actual authority to correct the alleged wrongdoing. Kaplan noted that \\"had the Court endorsed this argument, it would have gutted the WPA; obviously, whistleblowers cannot be required to guess at their peril whether the individual to whom they are disclosing wrongdoing possesses the legal authority to correct it.\\" \\"Moreover,\\" she noted, \\"the adoption of this argument would have meant that whistleblowers would not be protected when they made disclosures to the media or the public at large‚Äîprecisely the opposite of what Congress intended when it enacted the WPA.\\"U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Press Release, Special Counsel Expresses Concern Over Court's Narrow Interpretation of the Whistleblower Protection Act (Aug. 20, 2001 ). In her 2001 press statement, Kaplan also observed that the court's other rulings \\"appear to undermine in crucial respects the policies underlying the Whistleblower Protection Act: to encourage employees to come forward when they uncover serious wrongdoing during the course of their employment.\\" The Office of Special Counsel noted that under the court's ruling employees are not protected when they make disclosures during the course of performing their duties, \\"an auditor at the Department of Defense, for example, who uncovers massive fraud and waste of funds, would not be protected against retaliation when he reports the fraud as part of his job duties up the chain of command. Similarly, a meat inspector with the Department of Agriculture would not be protected against retaliation by his superiors if they were displeased with his reports of serious health and safety violations by a meat packing plant.\\" \\"The whole point of the WPA,\\" Special Counsel Kaplan observed, \\"is that government employees, because of their job duties, are in a position to discover misconduct and malfeasance.\\"U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Press Release (Aug. 20, 2001 ). Finally, Kaplan noted, \\"the Federal Circuit's ruling that the WPA does not protect employees who make their disclosures directly to the person they suspect of wrongdoing is contrary to public policy because it would discourage employees from attempting to raise and resolve their concerns within the chain of command. An employee may reasonably suspect that their superior has engaged in misconduct, but may wish to confront the superior with their suspicions first, before making them public.\\" In such situations, Special Counsel Kaplan observed, \\"the Federal Circuit's ruling would perversely require the employees to go public and embarrass the agency in order to maintain the Act's protection, where their concerns might well have been resolved in-house.\\"  References   External links  * * U.S. Office of Special Counsel.

It was the first K-12 school to specialize in educating twice-exceptional (2e) students, though it later came to include (and currently does accept) a wider range of gifted students. Mission The Lang School offers high ability, gifted, and twice exceptional (2e) learners in grades K through 12 a child- centered, empirically validated, STEM- and STEAM-driven education. They embrace each student‚Äôs individuality ‚Äì cognitively and affectively ‚Äì and empower students with self-knowledge and problem-solving skills through a collaborative, scalably supportive, differentiated approach to learning. At Lang, they teach the whole child and students thrive ‚Äî often for the first time ‚Äî learning at their level with ability and affinity peers in classes of no more than 12 students. Their standards-based, multi-sensory academics evolve to both challenge and support students as they develop self-regulation and independence. Their capstone Talent Development Program is designed to inspire passions, creativity, and a sense of purpose; to identify and deepen areas of interest and strength, transforming native promise into talent; and to facilitate early specialization and the acquisition of professional-level skills and commitment. Lang is an alternative school designed to prepare tomorrow's leaders and innovators.  Curriculum  Lang's interdisciplinary MESH‚Ñ¢ (Math, Engineering, Science, and the Humanities) curriculum culls benchmark ‚Äúthinking and doing‚Äù skills from The Common Core and marries them to a framework that emphasizes depth over breadth, process over product, and Socratic dialog over rote learning. MESH is powered by STEM, driven by the humanities and arts, and evaluated by ethics. Through research-based best practices that are flexibly deployed by Lang's experienced teaching and therapy teams, students‚Äô skills related to organization/planning, failure- tolerance, perseverance, self-advocacy, self-esteem, and empathy are grown.  Students  Twice exceptional students are identified as being gifted/talented (\\"G&T;\\") and diagnosed with specific learning challenges, such as ADHD, dyslexia and other language-based learning disabilities, anxiety, high functioning autism, social communication disorder, or sensory processing challenges. These students are often unable to master curriculum to their potential in a traditional classroom; they are often labelled \\"lazy\\" and misunderstood by teachers, administrators, and peers. Identifying 2e students is difficult, because a gifted child's strengths often mask their needs for supports or remediation, and their attentional or behavioral challenges might obscure their strengths. These children are eligible for special educational services under the IDEA Act, but they often face difficulties accessing these services, because their \\"special needs\\" can be difficult to recognize. History The Lang School grew out of the founder's frustration to find an appropriate school placement for her two sons. It opened in September 2010 with two classes totaling 13 students.Nikki Dowling, No bullying, support for a new kind of school, Downtown Express (\\"The Newspaper of Lower Manhattan\\"), Volume 23, Number 6, June 18‚Äì24, 2010 By its eighth year (2017), the school had five classes containing approximately 50 gifted and twice-exceptional students. Name The Lang School is named after Cyril Lang, the founder's tenth grade English teacher. Mr. Lang was a suburban Maryland public school teacher who, in 1979, taught what the local Board of Education deemed overly challenging material to his \\"ungifted\\" students, engaging them in Socratic debates about Machiavelli‚Äôs The Prince and Plato‚Äôs Republic, texts normally limited to 12th-grade Advanced Placement classes.

Only a few years of his life have an historical account, from 413 to 408 BC. Orator The historian Diodorus Siculus presents Diocles as a famous and respected orator, when he proposed, on the day following the victory over the Athenians in 413 BC, a punishment of the greatest severity against the vanquished: execution of Demosthenes and Nicias, the two Athenian generals, condemnation to slavery in the stone quarries for the Athenian soldiers,Which was equivalent to death in a short time, for according to Diodorus, with the exception of some clemencies, \\"the whole remainder were poorly maintained and mistreated in irons and in the works, there perished miserably\\" (Diod. Sic., Book XIII, chapter X) and the fate of being sold into slavery for the soldiers of the allies of Athens. Reinforced by the speech of Gylippus, that emphasized that a fate so cruel was intended for the Syracusans in case of Athenian victory, the suggestion was adopted against the opinion of those favoring clemency backed by the strategist Hermocrates.Diod. Sic. Book XIII, chapter VIII (According to Plutarch and Thucydides, Gylippus wanted to take the two Athenian generals back to Sparta as proof of his own military success.) Democratic legislator After the victory of 413 BC, the Syracusans that actively participated in the defense of the city were in a position to demand democratic reforms,Aristotle Politics Book VIII (ordinarily fifth placed), chapter 3, ¬ß6 following the example of the favor given to political democracy in Athens following the Battle of Salamis that was won by an Athenian navy principally composed from the common people.Aristotle, Politics Book VIII (ordinarily fifth placed), chapter 3, ¬ß5 Diocles first put into practice two measures: *; The term limit for the exit of the magistrates: This limitation by designation method, already practiced to Athens, is for Aristotle a characteristic of the democracies. Thus, the way of the exit for the designation of the magistrates is a democratic institution. The principle of the election, on the contrary, is oligarchic; Aristotle, Politics Book VI (ordinarily the fourth placed), VII, ¬ß3. *; The nomination of a group of experts in charge of composing laws: Then, having been named in this group of experts, Diocles there takes a preponderant role, so well that the laws created carry his name. The justice and accuracy of his system of penalties and of rewards won him the admiration of its fellow countrymen, and beyond the city-state of Syracuse, with numerous Greek cities of Sicily that adopted and preserved the laws down to the time of the domination of Roman laws. =Legal changes= In 412 BC, a committee, led by Diocles, erected a law which (among other things) forbade the people to bear weapons in the agora under pain of the death penalty. This law was met with popularity, as it began to be adopted outside of Syracuse in many other city-states in Sicily.Jon Ploug J√∏rgensen, The taming of the aristoi - an ancient Greek civilizing process? History of the Human Sciences: July 2014 vol. 27 no. 3, pg 41 Military leader in failure In 410 BC, Hermocrates was forced into exile and historians believe this event gave Diocles undisputed control of Syracuse. In 409 BC, Diocles was named at the head of an army of 4000 armed men to bring relief to Himera, which was being besieged by the Carthaginians led by Hannibal Mago, who had landed in Sicily with Iberian troops and won a first victory at the Battle of Selinus. The Syracusan expedition was a failure: after the first battle at Himera, the Syracusan army was forced to turn back in fear of a Carthaginian attack against Syracuse. Himera then fell and was razed, leaving to the Syracusans the only consolation of rescuing some Himeran women and children who fled with the Syracusan army.Diod. Sic., Book XIII, chapters LIX-LXI In 408 BC, some time after the Battle of Himera, Hermocrates returned to Sicily and had some military successes against the Carthaginians, turning Syracusan public opinion against Diocles. It is known that Diocles himself was forced into exile in 408 BC and seems to vanish from the historical record. It is believed that he died shortly afterwards, and there is a legend about his death, similar to those surrounding the deaths of Zaleucus and Charondas.

L. Learmonth subsequently entered on pastoral pursuits on the fine country the party then discovered farther to the north-west. In the following year the two brothers and some friends explored the course of the Loddon, and reached a prominent peak, which they afterwards called Ercildoune, from an old keep on the Scottish border associated with their ancestral history. Here the brothers established a second station. In November 1859, Thomas Learmonth made a donation towards building a church in the town: > Thomas Learmonth, Esq., of Ercildoun, with his usual liberality has > contributed ¬£20 towards the erection of a Church of England place of worship > at Lake Learmonth.
