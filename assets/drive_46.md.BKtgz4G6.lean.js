It is connected by a hose (18, green) to the air circuit and arms automatically when the air circuit is opened. A PASS device (Personal Alert Safety System) also known as a Distress Signal Unit (DSU) or ADSU (Automatic Distress Signal Unit), is a personal safety device used primarily by firefighters entering a hazardous or Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) environment such as a burning building. The PASS device sounds a loud (95 decibel) audible alert to notify others in the area that the firefighter is in distress. On a fireground, the sound of an activated PASS device indicates a true emergency and results in an immediate response to rescue the firefighter(s) in distress. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association sets standards for PASS devices in NFPA 1982.NFPA 1982 (registration required) The PASS device is normally used in conjunction with breathing apparatus; it is a small, battery powered device attached to the self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) harness which enables the firefighter to summon help by activating a loud, piercing electronic bleeper. Early models were only able to be activated manually; more recent PASS devices automatically activate if the device does not detect motion for 30 seconds, so that the alert will sound if the firefighter is seriously injured or otherwise incapacitated. Some devices use a ball bearing on a track to sense firefighter movement and others use an infrared beam against a mirror mounted on a spring. When activating for a lack of motion, the PASS device will typically emit a few seconds of a muted warning that activation is about to occur, so that a firefighter who has simply been motionless for a time but is otherwise safe will be able to move slightly and thus reset the activation timer before a false activation occurs. The PASS device can also be activated manually in an emergency, such as when a firefighter is lost or trapped. Older models of PASS devices required manual arming by firefighters prior to entering a dangerous environment. The unit was equipped with a key which, when removed, armed the unit. This key was left outside the hazard area with an entry control officer. When the unit activated, it could only be switched off by inserting this key. Current applications integrate the PASS device into the SCBA worn by firefighters so that it automatically arms when the SCBA air supply is engaged or when the SCBA is removed from its mounting bracket. This style devices are powered by battery, are easily activated while wearing gloves, and are intrinsically safe to operate in flammable or explosive atmospheres. It was reported that shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, the sound of many activated PASS devices could be heard beneath the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center. 343 firefighters (including a chaplain and two paramedics) of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) were killed on that day.

It dramatizes the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, seen from the perspective of the US political leadership. Kevin Costner stars as top White House assistant Kenneth P. O'Donnell, with Bruce Greenwood featured as President John F. Kennedy, Steven Culp as Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and Dylan Baker as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. While the film carries the same title as the 1969 book Thirteen Days by former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, it is in fact based on the 1997 book, The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis, by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow. It is the second docudrama made about the crisis, the first being 1974's The Missiles of October, which was based on Kennedy's book. The 2000 film contains some newly declassified information not available to the earlier production, but takes greater dramatic license, particularly in its choice of O'Donnell as protagonist. It received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the screenplay and performances of the cast but was a box office bomb grossing $66.6 million against its $80 million budget. Plot In October 1962, U-2 aerial surveillance photos reveal that the Soviet Union is in the process of placing intermediate-range ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons in Cuba. President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his advisers must come up with a plan of action to prevent their activation. Kennedy is determined to show that the United States will not allow a missile threat. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advise immediate U.S. military strikes against the missile sites followed by an invasion of Cuba. Kennedy is reluctant to attack and invade because it would very likely cause the Soviets to invade Berlin, which could lead to an all-out war. Citing The Guns of August, Kennedy sees an analogy to the events that started World War I, where the tactics of both sides' commanders had not evolved since the previous war and were obsolete, only this time nuclear weapons are involved. War appears to be almost inevitable. The Kennedy administration tries to find a solution that will remove the missiles but avoid an act of war. They reject a blockade, as this is formally regarded as an act of war, and settle on what they publicly describe as a quarantine. They announce that the U.S. naval forces will stop all ships entering Cuban waters and inspect them to verify they are not carrying weapons destined for Cuba. The Soviet Union sends mixed messages in response. Off the shores of Cuba, the Soviet ships turn back from the quarantine lines. Secretary of State Dean Rusk (Henry Strozier) says, \\"We're eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked.\\" The administration continues to order spy plane pictures, but one of Kennedy's top advisers, Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), calls the pilots to ensure the pilots do not report that they were shot at or fired upon, because if they were, the country would be forced to retaliate under the rules of engagement. John A. Scali, a reporter with ABC News, is contacted by Soviet \\"emissary\\" Aleksandr Fomin (Boris Lee Krutonog), and through this back-channel communication method the Soviets offer to remove the missiles in exchange for public assurances from the U.S. that it will never invade Cuba. A long message in the same tone as the informal communication from Fomin, apparently written personally by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, is received. This is followed by a second, more hard line cable in which the Soviets offer a deal involving U.S removal of its Jupiter missiles from Turkey. The Kennedy administration interprets the second as a response from the Politburo, and in a risky act, decides to ignore it and respond to the first message, assumed to be from Khrushchev. There are several mis-steps during the crisis: the defense readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) is raised to DEFCON 2 (one step shy of maximum readiness for imminent war), without informing the President; a nuclear weapon test proceeds (Bluegill Triple Prime) and a routine test launch of a U.S. offensive missile is also carried out without the President's knowledge. In a bid for time while under intense pressure from the military for an immediate strike, President Kennedy authorizes attacks on the missile sites and an invasion of Cuba, to commence the following Monday. An Air Force U-2 reconnaissance plane is sent over Cuba to gather intelligence for the attack, but is shot down, killing the pilot. After much deliberation with the Executive Committee of the National Security Council, Kennedy makes a final attempt to avoid a war by sending his brother, Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp), to meet with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin on Friday night. Bobby reiterates the demand that the Soviets remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return promises not to invade or assist in the invasion of Cuba. Dobrynin insists that the U.S. must also remove all Jupiter missiles from Turkey, on the border of the Soviet Union. Bobby says that a quid pro quo is not possible, but in exchange for Khrushchev removing all the missiles from Cuba, there will be a secret understanding that the U.S. will remove all of its \\"obsolete\\" missiles from Turkey within six months as part of a pre-scheduled plan. The Soviets announce on Sunday that they will remove their missiles from Cuba, averting a war that could have escalated to the use of nuclear weapons. The film ends with President Kennedy dictating a letter of condolence to the family of the reconnaissance pilot, Rudolf Anderson, who was shot down over Cuba as part of the preparations for the invasion, and the Kennedy brothers and O'Donnell outside of the Oval Office as actual audio of President Kennedy's commencement speech at American University played in the background.

The Department of Defense co-operated to some extent by allowing the producers to film on several bases. To keep the film \\"in period,\\" filming took place on ships from the time of the crisis that still existed in the active fleet () and ships that are preserved as museums (). Aircraft (both a preserved F-8 Crusader and Lockheed U-2 spyplane were featured) that still exist from the period were refurbished to appear operational as well. The RF-8 Crusader (and an F-5) and the scenes of Cuba were shot in the Philippines. The air base scene was taken at Clark Air Base, Philippines, a former American facility, which substituted for NAS Key West, Florida, where the actual RF-8As of Light Photographic Squadron SIX TWO (VFP-62) launched from on their Cuban overflight missions. At the time of the shooting, the F-8 was still in the inventory of the Philippine Air Force but was no longer operational. The F-5 was retired in 2005. Reception =Box office= The film was given a limited theatrical release on Christmas Day 2000, and a wide release on January 12, 2001, with a staggered release to various countries throughout most of the year. The film grossed $66,579,890 worldwide against a production budget of $80 million. =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 121 critics have given the film positive reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus states: \\"Thirteen Days offers a compelling look at the Cuban Missile Crisis, and its talented cast deftly portrays the real-life people who were involved.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream film critics, gives Thirteen Days a score of 67, based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A-. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Thirteen Days a rating of 3 stars out of 4, and said \\"The movie's taut, flat style is appropriate for a story that is more about facts and speculation than about action. Kennedy and his advisers study high-altitude photos and intelligence reports, and wonder if Khrushchev's word can be trusted. Everything depends on what they decide. The movie shows men in unknotted ties and shirt-sleeves, grasping coffee cups or whiskey glasses and trying to sound rational while they are at some level terrified...[T]hings might not have happened exactly like this, but it sure did feel like they did.\\" =Political response= Some former Kennedy administration officials and contemporary historians, including Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Special Counsel Ted Sorensen, and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, criticized the film for the depiction of Special Assistant Kenneth O'Donnell as chief motivator of Kennedy and others during the crisis. Prior to seeing the movie, McNamara reacted to the premise in a PBS NewsHour interview: > For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever in the > missile crisis; he was a political appointment secretary to the President; > that's absurd.McNamara, Robert (March 2001). > https://web.archive.org/web/20010905114944/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/forum/february01/thirteendays3.html > \\"Online NewsHour Forum: Thirteen Days\\".

According to McNamara, the duties performed by O'Donnell in the film were closer to the role Sorensen played during the actual crisis: \\"It was not Kenny O'Donnell who pulled us all together‚Äîit was Ted Sorensen.\\" After seeing the movie McNamara remarked that while he still thought the filmmakers took some creative liberties with certain characters, he ultimately thought that it was a reasonable historical portrayal of the crisis: > I think it's an absolutely fascinating portrayal and a very constructive and > responsible portrayal of a very, very serious crisis not only in the history > of this nation but in the history of the world.

Situated in the High Weald of Sussex some 15 miles (24 km) inland from the port of Hastings, it is located five miles (8 km) south-west of Hurst Green, on the A265 road, and on the River Dudwell, a tributary of the River Rother. In an area steeped in history, some nine miles (14 km) to the south-east lies Battle Abbey and eight miles (13 km) to the east is Bodiam Castle. Its main claim to fame is that for half of his life Rudyard Kipling (1865‚Äì1936) lived in the village at Bateman's. Kipling used the house's setting and the wider local area as the setting for many of his stories in Puck of Pook's Hill (1906) and the sequel Rewards and Fairies (1910), and there is a Kipling room at \\"The Bear\\" public house, one of two pubs located along Burwash High Street. Rudyard's son, John Kipling, died during the First World War and is named on the village war memorial at the end of Bell Alley Lane. He was named after Rudyard's father, the artist John Lockwood Kipling, (1837‚Äì1911), who provided illustrations for The Jungle Book. A complete collection of Kipling's works, including Just So Stories, Rewards and Fairies, The Man Who Would Be King and Kim, was published as the \\"Burwash Edition\\" (1941). History The village developed as a trading place when King Henry III authorised a weekly market in 1252. He also allowed a three-day fair in May. Smuggling took place in the 18th and 19th centuries, and several smugglers' graves can still be seen in the churchyard of St Bartholomew's. The main road through Burwash, today's A265, was improved in the 18th and 19th centuries after it came under the administration of the Ringmer and Hurst Green turnpike trust. The trust was formed in 1765 after fifteen petitions were presented to parliament on 25 December 1764 calling for the road to be turnpiked because it was stated to be \\"in many places impassable for wheeled conveyances in winter\\". The highway covered by the trust extended for across east Sussex from Ringmer, near Lewes, in the west, to Hurst Green in the east, where it met the principal turnpike road from London to Hastings (today's A21). The first section of road to be turnpiked ran from Hurst Green to Burwash; the rest followed three years later. A number of toll gates and bars were erected in the Burwash area on the principal highway and side roads. Although the trust repaired and improved the existing parish roads it was not until around 1830 that entirely new sections of main road were built, including one at Burwash Common. In a parliamentary return of 1840 the trust reported the roads it administered to be in good condition, with the exception of a short branch running from Burwash Common towards Stonegate. The trust was wound up in November 1864. The road through Burwash was a notorious spot for highwaymen. Burwash was one of the villages involved in the Wealden iron industry, and there was a forge located at Burwash Weald, close to the site of the historic \\"Wheel\\" public house.Mees, K. 2010 A traditional marriage-rhyme includes the archaic pronunciation of the name: \\"To love and to cherish, / From Battle to Berrish, / And round about Robertsbridge home ...\\" (\\"Burrish\\" is a variant pronunciation mentioned in 1933).Egerton, John Coker (1933) Sussex Folk and Sussex Ways; 4th ed. London: Methuen; p. vii Landmarks The High Street has been designated a Conservation area by Rother District Council. The intention is to preserve the character of the village by strictly controlling building within the area. Additionally, the buildings along the High Street have been given listed building status by English Heritage, including a garden wall. The Bateman's mansion, a fine example of Jacobean architecture formerly owned by Rudyard Kipling, is now a National Trust property, open to the public. It can be found just outside the main village on the Burwash Weald and Common side, and is set within of the Sussex Weald, and includes a working watermill and millpond, which connects to the River Dudwell. The location was used while shooting the film My Boy Jack (2007), starring Daniel Radcliffe There is a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the parish‚ÄîDallington Forest, an area of ancient woodland. Its interest lies in a nationally rare habitat as a result of a steep-sided stream flowing through the site. The church of St Bartholomew Burwash is located within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Governance The lowest level of government is the Burwash parish council, which meets once a month. The parish council is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. It also provides a voice into the district council meetings. The parish council comprises thirteen councillors with elections being held every four years. Rother District Council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Burwash lies within the Darwell ward, which provides two councillors. East Sussex County Council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Burwash falls within the Rother North West ward. The UK Parliament constituency for Burwash is Bexhill and Battle, which has been represented by Huw Merriman since the 2015 general election. Notable people As Kipling's main home, Bateman's was host to many notable visitors including fellow author Sir Henry Rider Haggard and Kipling's cousin Stanley Baldwin, who was Britain's Prime Minister from 1935 to 1937. Kingsley Amis visited Bateman's whilst preparing a tribute to Kipling (Amis's father was a resident of Burwash in the 1960s). Ex-Prime Minister James Callaghan lived just outside the village. Picture Post photographer Thurston Hopkins was educated at St Joseph's Salesian school in the village. Cricketer Albert Relf (1874‚Äì1937) was born here, The Who frontman Roger Daltrey maintains a Holmshurst Manor country estate and Lakedown fishery near Burwash Common, Robert Smith, singer and founding member of rock band The Cure is a resident.

The system is said to be open in the sense that the system can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir, so that various possible states of the system can differ in both their total energy and total number of particles. The system's volume, shape, and other external coordinates are kept the same in all possible states of the system. The thermodynamic variables of the grand canonical ensemble are chemical potential (symbol: ) and absolute temperature (symbol: ). The ensemble is also dependent on mechanical variables such as volume (symbol: ) which influence the nature of the system's internal states. This ensemble is therefore sometimes called the ensemble, as each of these three quantities are constants of the ensemble.  Basics  In simple terms, the grand canonical ensemble assigns a probability to each distinct microstate given by the following exponential: :P = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\Omega + \\\\mu N - E}{k T}}, where is the number of particles in the microstate and is the total energy of the microstate. is Boltzmann's constant. The number is known as the grand potential and is constant for the ensemble. However, the probabilities and will vary if different are selected. The grand potential serves two roles: to provide a normalization factor for the probability distribution (the probabilities, over the complete set of microstates, must add up to one); and, many important ensemble averages can be directly calculated from the function . In the case where more than one kind of particle is allowed to vary in number, the probability expression generalizes to :P = e^{\\\\frac{\\\\Omega + \\\\mu_1 N_1 + \\\\mu_2 N_2 + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s N_s - E}{k T}}, where is the chemical potential for the first kind of particles, is the number of that kind of particle in the microstate, is the chemical potential for the second kind of particles and so on ( is the number of distinct kinds of particles). However, these particle numbers should be defined carefully (see the note on particle number conservation below). Grand ensembles are apt for use when describing systems such as the electrons in a conductor, or the photons in a cavity, where the shape is fixed but the energy and number of particles can easily fluctuate due to contact with a reservoir (e.g., an electrical ground or a dark surface, in these cases). The grand canonical ensemble provides a natural setting for an exact derivation of the Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics or Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics for a system of non-interacting quantum particles (see examples below). ; Note on formulation : An alternative formulation for the same concept writes the probability as \\\\textstyle P = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathcal Z} e^{(\\\\mu N-E)/(k T)}, using the grand partition function \\\\textstyle \\\\mathcal Z = e^{-\\\\Omega/(k T)} rather than the grand potential. The equations in this article (in terms of grand potential) may be restated in terms of the grand partition function by simple mathematical manipulations. Applicability The grand canonical ensemble is the ensemble that describes the possible states of an isolated system that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir (the derivation proceeds along lines analogous to the heat bath derivation of the normal canonical ensemble, and can be found in Reif). The grand canonical ensemble applies to systems of any size, small or large; it is only necessary to assume that the reservoir with which it is in contact is much larger (i.e., to take the macroscopic limit). The condition that the system is isolated is necessary in order to ensure it has well-defined thermodynamic quantities and evolution. In practice, however, it is desirable to apply the grand canonical ensemble to describe systems that are in direct contact with the reservoir, since it is that contact that ensures the equilibrium. The use of the grand canonical ensemble in these cases is usually justified either 1) by assuming that the contact is weak, or 2) by incorporating a part of the reservoir connection into the system under analysis, so that the connection's influence on the region of interest is correctly modeled. Alternatively, theoretical approaches can be used to model the influence of the connection, yielding an open statistical ensemble. Another case in which the grand canonical ensemble appears is when considering a system that is large and thermodynamic (a system that is \\"in equilibrium with itself\\"). Even if the exact conditions of the system do not actually allow for variations in energy or particle number, the grand canonical ensemble can be used to simplify calculations of some thermodynamic properties. The reason for this is that various thermodynamic ensembles (microcanonical, canonical) become equivalent in some aspects to the grand canonical ensemble, once the system is very large.To quote Reif, \\"For purposes of calculating mean values of physical quantities, it makes no noticeable difference whether a macroscopic system is isolated, or in contact with a reservoir with which it can only exchange energy, or in contact with a reservoir with which it can exchange both energy and particles. [...] In some problems where the constraint of a fixed number of particles is cumbersome, one can thus readily circumvent the complication by approximating the actual situation with [...] the grand canonical distribution.\\" Of course, for small systems, the different ensembles are no longer equivalent even in the mean. As a result, the grand canonical ensemble can be highly inaccurate when applied to small systems of fixed particle number, such as atomic nuclei. Properties  Grand potential, ensemble averages, and exact differentials  The partial derivatives of the function give important grand canonical ensemble average quantities:http://www.theory.physics.manchester.ac.uk/~judith/stat_therm/node87.html Exact differential: From the above expressions, it can be seen that the function has the exact differential : d\\\\Omega = - S dT - \\\\langle N_1 \\\\rangle d\\\\mu_1 \\\\ldots - \\\\langle N_s \\\\rangle d\\\\mu_s - \\\\langle p\\\\rangle dV . First law of thermodynamics: Substituting the above relationship for into the exact differential of , an equation similar to the first law of thermodynamics is found, except with average signs on some of the quantities: : d\\\\langle E \\\\rangle = T dS + \\\\mu_1 d\\\\langle N_1 \\\\rangle \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s d\\\\langle N_s \\\\rangle - \\\\langle p\\\\rangle dV . Thermodynamic fluctuations: The variances in energy and particle numbers arehttp://micro.stanford.edu/~caiwei/me334/Chap9_NPT_Grand_Canonical_Ensemble_v04.pdf : \\\\langle E^2 \\\\rangle - \\\\langle E \\\\rangle^2 = k T^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\langle E \\\\rangle} {\\\\partial T} + k T \\\\mu_1 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\langle E \\\\rangle} {\\\\partial \\\\mu_1} + k T \\\\mu_2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\langle E \\\\rangle} {\\\\partial \\\\mu_2} + \\\\ldots , : \\\\langle N_1^2 \\\\rangle - \\\\langle N_1 \\\\rangle^2 = k T \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\langle N_1 \\\\rangle} {\\\\partial \\\\mu_1}.

In each case the grand potential is calculated on the basis of the relationship :\\\\Omega = -kT \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\sum_\\\\text{microstates} e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu N - E}{kT}}\\\\right) which is required for the microstates' probabilities to add up to 1. =Statistics of noninteracting particles= Bosons and fermions (quantum) In the special case of a quantum system of many non-interacting particles, the thermodynamics are simple to compute. Since the particles are non-interacting, one can compute a series of single-particle stationary states, each of which represent a separable part that can be included into the total quantum state of the system. For now let us refer to these single- particle stationary states as orbitals (to avoid confusing these \\"states\\" with the total many-body state), with the provision that each possible internal particle property (spin or polarization) counts as a separate orbital. Each orbital may be occupied by a particle (or particles), or may be empty. Since the particles are non-interacting, we may take the viewpoint that each orbital forms a separate thermodynamic system. Thus each orbital is a grand canonical ensemble unto itself, one so simple that its statistics can be immediately derived here. Focusing on just one orbital labelled , the total energy for a microstate of particles in this orbital will be , where is the characteristic energy level of that orbital. The grand potential for the orbital is given by one of two forms, depending on whether the orbital is bosonic or fermionic: \\\\Big)  & = - kT \\\\ln\\\\Big(1 + e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu - \\\\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\\\Big) \\\\end{align} 2= For bosons, may be any nonnegative integer and each value of counts as one microstate due to the indistinguishability of particles, leading to a geometric series: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Omega_i & = -kT \\\\ln \\\\Big( \\\\sum_{N=0}^{\\\\infty} e^{\\\\frac{N\\\\mu - N\\\\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\\\Big)  & = + kT\\\\ln\\\\Big(1 - e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu - \\\\epsilon_i}{k T}}\\\\Big). \\\\end{align} }} In each case the value \\\\scriptstyle\\\\langle N_i\\\\rangle = -\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial \\\\Omega_i}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} gives the thermodynamic average number of particles on the orbital: the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution for fermions, and the Bose‚ÄìEinstein distribution for bosons. Considering again the entire system, the total grand potential is found by adding up the for all orbitals. Indistinguishable classical particles  In classical mechanics it is also possible to consider indistinguishable particles (in fact, indistinguishability is a prerequisite for defining a chemical potential in a consistent manner; all particles of a given kind must be interchangeable). We again consider placing multiple particles of the same kind into the same microstate of single- particle phase space, which we again call an \\"orbital\\". However, compared to quantum mechanics, the classical case is complicated by the fact that a microstate in classical mechanics does not refer to a single point in phase space but rather to an extended region in phase space: one microstate contains an infinite number of states, all distinct but of similar character. As a result, when multiple particles are placed into the same orbital, the overall collection of the particles (in the system phase space) does not count as one whole microstate but rather only a fraction of a microstate, because identical states (formed by permutation of identical particles) should not be overcounted. The overcounting correction factor is the factorial of the number of particles. The statistics in this case take the form of an exponential power series :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Omega_{\\\\rm orb} & = -kT \\\\ln \\\\Big( \\\\sum_{N=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{N!} e^{\\\\frac{N\\\\mu - N\\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm orb}}{k T}}\\\\Big)  & = -kT \\\\ln \\\\Big( e^{e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu - \\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm orb}}{k T}}}\\\\Big)  & = - kT e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu - \\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm orb}}{k T}}, \\\\end{align} the value \\\\scriptstyle\\\\langle N_{\\\\rm orb}\\\\rangle = -\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial \\\\Omega_{\\\\rm orb}}{\\\\partial \\\\mu} corresponding to Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics. =Ionization of an isolated atom= Surface ionization effect in a vaporized cesium atom at 1500 K, calculated using the method in this section (also including degeneracy). Y-axis: average number of electrons; the atom is neutral when it has 55 electrons. X-axis: energy variable, which is equal to the surface work function. The grand canonical ensemble can be used to predict whether an atom prefers to be in a neutral state or ionized state. An atom is able to exist in ionized states with more or fewer electrons compared to neutral. As shown below, ionized states may be thermodynamically preferred depending on the environment. Consider a simplified model where the atom can be in a neutral state or in one of two ionized states (a detailed calculation also includes the degeneracy factors of the states): * charge neutral state, with electrons and energy . * an oxidized state ( electrons) with energy * a reduced state ( electrons) with energy Here and are the atom's ionization energy and electron affinity, respectively; is the local electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the atom, and is the electron charge. The grand potential in this case is thus determined by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Omega & = -kT \\\\ln \\\\Big(e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu N_0 - E_0}{k T}} + e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu N_0 - \\\\mu - E_0 - \\\\Delta E_{\\\\rm I} - q\\\\phi}{k T}} + e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu N_0 + \\\\mu - E_0 + \\\\Delta E_{\\\\rm A} + q\\\\phi}{k T}}\\\\Big).  & = E_0 - \\\\mu N_0 -kT \\\\ln \\\\Big( 1 + e^{\\\\frac{-\\\\mu - \\\\Delta E_{\\\\rm I} - q\\\\phi}{k T}} + e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu + \\\\Delta E_{\\\\rm A} + q\\\\phi}{k T}}\\\\Big).  \\\\end{align} The quantity is critical in this case, for determining the balance between the various states. This value is determined by the environment around the atom. If one of these atoms is placed into a vacuum box, then , the work function of the box lining material. Comparing the tables of work function for various solid materials with the tables of electron affinity and ionization energy for atomic species, it is clear that many combinations would result in a neutral atom, however some specific combinations would result in the atom preferring an ionized state: e.g., a halogen atom in a ytterbium box, or a cesium atom in a tungsten box. At room temperature this situation is not stable since the atom tends to adsorb to the exposed lining of the box instead of floating freely. At high temperatures, however, the atoms are evaporated from the surface in ionic form; this spontaneous surface ionization effect has been used as a cesium ion source. At room temperature, this example finds application in semiconductors, where the ionization of a dopant atom is well described by this ensemble. In the semiconductor, the conduction band edge plays the role of the vacuum energy level (replacing ), and is known as the Fermi level. Of course, the ionization energy and electron affinity of the dopant atom are strongly modified relative to their vacuum values. A typical donor dopant in silicon, phosphorus, has ;http://www.iue.tuwien.ac.at/phd/wittmann/node7.html the value of in the intrinsic silicon is initially about , guaranteeing the ionization of the dopant. The value of depends strongly on electrostatics, however, so under some circumstances it is possible to de-ionize the dopant. Meaning of chemical potential, generalized \\"particle number\\" In order for a particle number to have an associated chemical potential, it must be conserved during the internal dynamics of the system, and only able to change when the system exchanges particles with an external reservoir. If the particles can be created out of energy during the dynamics of the system, then an associated term must not appear in the probability expression for the grand canonical ensemble. In effect, this is the same as requiring that for that kind of particle. Such is the case for photons in a black cavity, whose number regularly change due to absorption and emission on the cavity walls. (On the other hand, photons in a highly reflective cavity can be conserved and caused to have a nonzero .) In some cases the number of particles is not conserved and the represents a more abstract conserved quantity: * Chemical reactions: Chemical reactions can convert one type of molecule to another; if reactions occur then the must be defined such that they do not change during the chemical reaction. * High energy particle physics: Ordinary particles can be spawned out of pure energy, if a corresponding antiparticle is created. If this sort of process is allowed, then neither the number of particles nor antiparticles are conserved. Instead, is conserved.Of course, very high temperatures are required for significant thermal generation of particle- antiparticle pairs, e.g., of order 109 K for electron-positron creation, and so this process is not a concern for everyday thermodynamics. As particle energies increase, there are more possibilities to convert between particle types, and so there are fewer numbers that are truly conserved. At the very highest energies the only conserved numbers are electric charge, weak isospin, and baryon number ‚àí lepton number. On the other hand, in some cases a single kind of particle may have multiple conserved numbers: * Closed compartments: In a system composed of multiple compartments that share energy but do not share particles, it is possible to set the chemical potentials separately for each compartment. For example, a capacitor is composed of two isolated conductors and is charged by applying a difference in electron chemical potential. * Slow equilibration: In some quasi-equilibrium situations it is possible to have two distinct populations of the same kind of particle in the same location, which are each equilibrated internally but not with each other. Though not strictly in equilibrium, it may be useful to name quasi-equilibrium chemical potentials which can differ among the different populations. Examples: (semiconductor physics) distinct quasi-Fermi levels (electron chemical potentials) in the conduction band and valence band; (spintronics) distinct spin-up and spin-down chemical potentials; (cryogenics) distinct parahydrogen and orthohydrogen chemical potentials. Precise expressions for the ensemble The precise mathematical expression for statistical ensembles has a distinct form depending on the type of mechanics under consideration (quantum or classical), as the notion of a \\"microstate\\" is considerably different. In quantum mechanics, the grand canonical ensemble affords a simple description since diagonalization provides a set of distinct microstates of a system, each with well-defined energy and particle number. The classical mechanical case is more complex as it involves not stationary states but instead an integral over canonical phase space. = Quantum mechanical = A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a density matrix, denoted by \\\\hat \\\\rho. The grand canonical ensemble is the density matrix :\\\\hat \\\\rho = \\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{1}{kT}(\\\\Omega + \\\\mu_1 \\\\hat N_1 + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s \\\\hat N_s - \\\\hat H)\\\\big), where is the system's total energy operator (Hamiltonian), is the system's total particle number operator for particles of type 1, is the total particle number operator for particles of type 2, and so on. is the matrix exponential operator. The grand potential is determined by the probability normalization condition that the density matrix has a trace of one, Tr \\\\hat \\\\rho = 1: :e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{k T}} = \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\exp\\\\big(\\\\tfrac{1}{kT}(\\\\mu_1 \\\\hat N_1 + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s \\\\hat N_s - \\\\hat H)\\\\big). Note that for the grand ensemble, the basis states of the operators , , etc. are all states with multiple particles in Fock space, and the density matrix is defined on the same basis. Since the energy and particle numbers are all separately conserved, these operators are mutually commuting. The grand canonical ensemble can alternatively be written in a simple form using bra‚Äìket notation, since it is possible (given the mutually commuting nature of the energy and particle number operators) to find a complete basis of simultaneous eigenstates , indexed by , where , , and so on. Given such an eigenbasis, the grand canonical ensemble is simply :\\\\hat \\\\rho = \\\\sum_i e^{\\\\frac{\\\\Omega + \\\\mu_1 N_{1,i} + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s N_{s,i} - E_i}{k T}} \\\\psi_i\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_i  :e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{k T}} = \\\\sum_i e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_1 N_{1,i} + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s N_{s,i} - E_i}{k T}}. where the sum is over the complete set of states with state having total energy, particles of type 1, particles of type 2, and so on. =Classical mechanical= In classical mechanics, a grand ensemble is instead represented by a joint probability density function defined over multiple phase spaces of varying dimensions, , where the and are the canonical coordinates (generalized momenta and generalized coordinates) of the system's internal degrees of freedom. The expression for the grand canonical ensemble is somewhat more delicate than the canonical ensemble since: * The number of particles and thus the number of coordinates varies between the different phase spaces, and, * it is vital to consider whether permuting similar particles counts as a distinct state or not. In a system of particles, the number of degrees of freedom depends on the number of particles in a way that depends on the physical situation. For example, in a three-dimensional gas of monoatoms , however in molecular gases there will also be rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. The probability density function for the grand canonical ensemble is: :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} e^{\\\\frac{\\\\Omega + \\\\mu_1 N_1 + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s N_s - E}{k T}}, where * is the energy of the system, a function of the phase , * is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of one microstate and providing correct dimensions to .(Historical note) Gibbs' original ensemble effectively set , leading to unit- dependence in the values of some thermodynamic quantities like entropy and chemical potential. Since the advent of quantum mechanics, is often taken to be equal to Planck's constant in order to obtain a semiclassical correspondence with quantum mechanics. * is an overcounting correction factor (see below), a function of . Again, the value of is determined by demanding that is a normalized probability density function: :e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Omega}{k T}} = \\\\sum_{N_1 = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\ldots \\\\sum_{N_s = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int \\\\ldots \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{h^n C} e^{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_1 N_1 + \\\\ldots + \\\\mu_s N_s - E}{k T}} \\\\, dp_1 \\\\ldots dq_n This integral is taken over the entire available phase space for the given numbers of particles.  Overcounting correction  A well-known problem in the statistical mechanics of fluids (gases, liquids, plasmas) is how to treat particles that are similar or identical in nature: should they be regarded as distinguishable or not? In the system's equation of motion each particle is forever tracked as a distinguishable entity, and yet there are also valid states of the system where the positions of each particle have simply been swapped: these states are represented at different places in phase space, yet would seem to be equivalent. If the permutations of similar particles are regarded to count as distinct states, then the factor above is simply . From this point of view, ensembles include every permuted state as a separate microstate. Although appearing benign at first, this leads to a problem of severely non-extensive entropy in the canonical ensemble, known today as the Gibbs paradox. In the grand canonical ensemble a further logical inconsistency occurs: the number of distinguishable permutations depends not only on how many particles are in the system, but also on how many particles are in the reservoir (since the system may exchange particles with a reservoir). In this case the entropy and chemical potential are non-extensive but also badly defined, depending on a parameter (reservoir size) that should be irrelevant. To solve these issues it is necessary that the exchange of two similar particles (within the system, or between the system and reservoir) must not be regarded as giving a distinct state of the system.This can be compared to the canonical ensemble where it is optional to consider particles as distinguishable; this only gives -dependent error in entropy, which is unobservable as long as is kept constant. In general, however, there is no such freedom: \\"when the number of particles in a system is to be treated as variable, the average index of probability for phases generically defined corresponds to entropy.\\" (Gibbs). In order to incorporate this fact, integrals are still carried over full phase space but the result is divided by :C = N_1! N_2! \\\\ldots N_s!, which is the number of different permutations possible. The division by neatly corrects the overcounting that occurs in the integral over all phase space. It is of course possible to include distinguishable types of particles in the grand canonical ensemble‚Äîeach distinguishable type i is tracked by a separate particle counter N_i and chemical potential \\\\mu_i. As a result, the only consistent way to include \\"fully distinguishable\\" particles in the grand canonical ensemble is to consider every possible distinguishable type of those particles, and to track each and every possible type with a separate particle counter and separate chemical potential.

He has one son, Andrew, who resides in New York City. He is a Darien, Connecticut, resident and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for the Connecticut seat held by Christopher Dodd in the 2004 U.S. Senate election. Orchulli, previously an independent, became a Republican in August 2003 shortly before launching his bid for the U.S. Senate and ran for office with no prior political experience. Just months before deciding to run for the U.S. Senate, Orchulli sold his family's ownership interest in Michael Kors (a fashion enterprise) in 2003 and announced his retirement from business. Orchulli had started the Michael Kors Company with Kors in 1981 and remained its CEO/partner until he left the company which, then, had a retail sales volume of about $200 million worldwide. Upon leaving the business world, his sole intent was to offer service to his fellow citizens without the taint of special interests or the compromise of political expediency. In November 2004, Orchulli garnered only 32% of the vote in a largely self-financed bid. He never improved from long-shot standing against incumbent Senator Christopher Dodd, who won his 5th consecutive term for the Democrats with 66% of the vote. Two years later, Orchulli promoted himself as a possible mid-campaign replacement for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Alan Schlesinger, who had come under media fire for a claim that Schlesinger had gambled in the past under an assumed name at Connecticut casinos. Schlesinger was running for the seat held by U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman in the November 2006 election. It was rumored in the media that Schlesinger had been called on by Gov. M. Jodi Rell and then Republican State Chairman George Gallo to withdraw from the race against Lieberman and Ned Lamont. The rumors were not substantiated. Schlesinger failed to withdraw and Orchulli received no support for his bid. . In November 2004, Orchulli garnered 33 percent of the vote as a long-shot standing against incumbent Senator Christopher Dodd, who won his fifth consecutive term for the Democrats with 66 percent of the vote. In 2006 and 2007, Orchulli, as a newcomer to small-town politics, led the local Darien (CT) Republican Party to its largest defeat in the history of the town's municipal elections. In November 2007, in the town where Republicans outnumber Democrats 3 to 1, Orchulli and the Republicans lost control of the Board of Selectmen to the Democrats by a vote of 65% to 35%, unprecedented for the town and mirroring Orchulli's 66% to 32% defeat by Dodd three years earlier He was the state Republican Party finance chair in 2007. In addition, he was a board member of the Connecticut Development Corporation for over three years, a quasi-state government organization which looks to retain and grow jobs in the state. On January 10, 2008, in an unprecedented and surprising local political event, a huge turnout of the Republican Caucus of Darien town electors rejected 19 of 21 members of a slate of candidates proposed by the Nominating Committee. Orchulli was one of the nominees rejected. Trying his hand once again at the State political level, on May 22, 2010, Orchulli was nominated to be the Republican candidate for State Comptroller, the post being vacated by incumbent Democrat Nancy Wyman. Orchulli went on to lose the general election to Democrat Kevin Lembo, receiving 43% of the vote. In 2016, Orchulli sought the Republican nomination to run for U.S. Senate against the incumbent Democrat Richard Blumenthal. He placed third at the state Republican convention on May 9 and urged his delegates to support party nominee Dan Carter.

Characterized by rolling hills and winding paths overlooking the James River, it is the resting place of two United States Presidents, James Monroe and John Tyler, as well as the only Confederate States President, Jefferson Davis. It is also the resting place of 28 Confederate generals, more than any other cemetery in the country; these include George Pickett and J.E.B. Stuart. History The Harvie family plot The land that Hollywood Cemetery currently stands on was once part of William Byrd III's estate. Later, it was owned by the Harvie family and was known as \\"Harvie's Woods.\\" William H. Haxall was one of the original founders of Hollywood Cemetery. In the spring of 1847, two citizens of Richmond, Joshua J. Fry and William H. Haxall, while on a visit to Boston, visited Mount Auburn Cemetery, a beautiful cemetery near that city. They were impressed by the solemn grandeur of the place and resolved that they would, on their return to Richmond, propose the establishment of a rural cemetery near the city. It was through their original efforts and the subsequent cooperation of local citizens that Hollywood Cemetery was created. On June 3, 1847, Haxall, Fry, William Mitchell Jr., and Isaac Davenport Sr. purchased from Lewis E. Harvie, who sold under a deed of trust from Jacqueline B. Harvie for the sum of $4,075, a certain portion of the lots or parcels of land in the town of Sydney, in the County of Henrico, together with \\"the privileges and appurtenances to the belonging, which said portion is adjoining to Clarkes Spring and contains by survey forty-two acres, three roods, but of which one rood, known as Harvie's rood, or graveyard, with free ingress and egress to the said graveyard is reserved.\\" This purchase was made with the design of establishing a rural cemetery.https://www.hollywoodcemetery.org/william-h- haxall; Source of information: Library of Virginia Digital Collection; LVA Titled Files: Survey Report, Hollywood Cemetery: March 23, 1937; research by Malcolm T. Earley. Hollywood Cemetery was designed as a garden cemetery, or park cemetery, which was the trend at the time borrowed from the French in an effort to provide more green space in urban areas. In the late 1840s, William Haxall, William Mitchell Jr. and Joshua Fry hired John Notman (architect of Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia) to design the cemetery in the rural garden style. Its name, \\"Hollywood,\\" came from the holly trees dotting the hills of the property. Oliver P. Baldwin delivered the dedication address in 1849.Alfred L. Brophy, \\"The Road to the Gettysburg Address,\\" Florida State University Law Review 43 (2016):831-905. James Monroe was reinterred from New York City to the \\"President's Circle\\" section of Hollywood cemetery on July 4, 1858 due to the efforts of Governor Henry A. Wise. The Monument of Confederate War Dead at Hollywood Cemetery In 1869, a high granite pyramid designed by Charles H. Dimmock was built as a memorial to the more than 18,000 enlisted men of the Confederate Army buried in the cemetery. It was a project supported by the Hollywood Ladies Memorial Association, a group of Southern women dedicated to honoring and caring for the burial sites of fallen Confederate soldiers. The capstone of the pyramid has been a source of legend for Richmonders. No one could determine how to place the capstone atop the lofty 90-foot pyramid. Thomas Stanley, a criminal working on the pyramid proposed and executed the solution. In retellings, locals say the prisoner was freed due to his contribution to the pyramid's construction. The only evidence of this is a note was added to his prison schedule that read ‚Äútransferred,‚Äù suggesting he was moved rather than freed. The pyramid became a symbol of the Hollywood Memorial Association, appearing on its stationery as well as on the front of a pamphlet of buried soldiers, the Register of the Confederate Dead. In 1890, a chapel was constructed next to the entrance of the cemetery. This chapel now serves as the cemetery office. In 1915, the original entrance was closed and the present one was opened to better facilitate cars. Interior of Palmer Chapel Mausoleum at Hollywood Cemetery The Palmer Chapel Mausoleum was built 1992, adding 730 crypts for caskets and 160 cremation niches. Hollywood Cemetery is one of Richmond's major tourist attractions. There are many local legends surrounding certain tombs and grave sites in the cemetery, including one about a little girl and the black iron statue of a dog standing watch over her grave. Other notable legends rely on ghosts haunting the many mausoleums. One of the most well-known of these is the legend of the Richmond Vampire. A place rich in history, legend, and gothic landscape, Hollywood Cemetery is also frequented by many of the local students attending Virginia Commonwealth University.  Confederate Memorial Day  In the 1870s, the South was crumbling, and southerners yearned to preserve their culture and heritage. One preservation effort was Confederate Memorial Day, a series of celebrations that ‚Äúbecame imbued with cultural and religious symbolism that underscored the gravity of what it meant to be a southerner.‚Äù Though some of these celebrations were ornate with speeches, poems, and prayers, the ones at Hollywood Cemetery were simple, and ultimately set the trend for future celebrations: a modest procession to the cemetery and decoration of the graves. Young men would also recreate Thomas Stanley's heroic act and climb the monument to hang a wreath from the top. Though simple, it is estimated that around 20,000 people attended the first Confederate Memorial Day at Hollywood Cemetery in 1866.

From Freud to the British Object Relations School, Routledge ed., 2017, is defined as redirection of a psychotherapist's feelings toward a client ‚Äì or, more generally, as a therapist's emotional entanglement with a client.  Early formulations  The phenomenon of countertransference () was first defined publicly by Sigmund Freud in 1910 (The Future Prospects of Psycho-Analytic Therapy) as being \\"a result of the patient's influence on [the physician's] unconscious feelings\\"; although Freud had been aware of it privately for some time, writing to Carl Jung for example in 1909 of the need \\"to dominate 'counter-transference', which is after all a permanent problem for us\\".W. McGuire ed., The Freud/Jung Letters (1974) p. 231 Freud stated that since an analyst is a human himself he can easily let his emotions into the client.Neil R. Carlson & C.Donald Heth page 595Laplanche, J & Pontalis, J-B. (1973) The Language of Psycho-Analysis p. 92 Because Freud saw the countertransference as a purely personal problem for the analyst, he rarely referred to it publicly, and did so almost invariably in terms of a \\"warning against any countertransference lying in wait\\" for the analyst, who \\"must recognize this countertransference in himself and master it\\".Freud, quoted in Peter Gay, Freud: A life for our time(London 1989) p. 302 and p. 254 However, analysis of Freud's letters shows that he was intrigued by countertransference and did not see it as purely a problem.J. Holmes (2014) 'Countertransference before Heimann: An historical exploration', Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association The potential danger of the analyst's countertransference ‚Äì \\"In such cases, the patient represents for the analyst an object of the past on to whom past feelings and wishes are projected\\"Annie Reich, quoted in Patrick Casement, Further learning from the patient (London 1997), p. 177n ‚Äì became widely accepted in psychodynamic circles, both within and without the psychoanalytic mainstream. Thus, for example, Jung warned against \\"cases of counter-transference when the analyst really cannot let go of the patient...both fall into the same dark hole of unconsciousness\\".C. G. Jung, Analytical Psychology: its Theory and Practice(London 1976) p. 159 and p. 157 Similarly Eric Berne stressed that \\"Countertransference means that not only does the analyst play a role in the patient's script, but she plays a part in his...the result is the 'chaotic situation' which analysts speak of\\".Eric Berne, What Do You Say after You Say Hello? (London 1975), p. 352 Lacan acknowledged of the analyst's \\"countertransference...if he is re-animated the game will proceed without anyone knowing who is leading\\".Jacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection(London 1997) p. 229-230 In this sense, the term includes unconscious reactions to a patient that are determined by the psychoanalyst's own life history and unconscious content; it was later expanded to include unconscious hostile and/or erotic feelings toward a patient that interfere with objectivity and limit the therapist's effectiveness. For example, a therapist might have a strong desire for a client to get good grades in university because the client reminds her of her children at that stage in life, and the anxieties that the therapist experienced during that time. Even in its most benign form, such an attitude could lead at best to \\"a 'countertransference cure'...achieved through compliance and a 'false self' suppression of the patient's more difficult feelings\\".Patrick Casement, On Learning from the Patient (London 1990), p. 174 Another example would be a therapist who did not receive enough attention from her father perceiving her client as being too distant and resenting him for it. In essence, this describes the transference of the treater to the patient, which is referred to as the \\"narrow perspective\\".  Middle years  As the 20th century progressed, however, other, more positive views of countertransference began to emerge, approaching a definition of countertransference as the entire body of feelings that the therapist has toward the patient. Jung explored the importance of the therapist's reaction to the patient through the image of the wounded physician: \\"it is his own hurt that gives the measure of his power to heal\\".Jung quoted in Anthony Stevens, Jung (Oxford 1994) p. 110 Heinrich Racker emphasised the threat that \\"the repression of countertransference...is prolonged in the mythology of the analytic situation\\".Heinrich Racker, Transference and Countertransference (London 1982) p. 131 Paula Heimann highlighted how the \\"analyst's countertransference is not only part and parcel of the analytic relationship, but it is the patient's creation, it is part of the patient's personality\\".Casement, Further learning p. 12 As a result, \\"counter-transference was thus reversed from being an interference to becoming a potential source of vital confirmation\\".Robert Hinshelwood and Susan Robinson, Introducing Melanie Klein (Cambridge 2006) p. 151 The change of fortune \\"was highly controversial. Melanie Klein disapproved on the grounds that poorly analyzed psycho-analysts could excuse their own emotional difficulties\\" thereby; but among her younger followers \\"the trend within the Kleinian group was to take seriously the new view of counter- transference\\"Hishelwood/Robinson ‚Äì Hanna Segal warning in typically pragmatic fashion however that \\"Countertransference can be the best of servants but is the most awful of masters\\".David Bell, Reason and Passion (London 1997) p. 30  Late twentieth-century paradigm  By the last third of the century, a growing consensus appeared on the importance of \\"a distinction between 'personal countertransference' (which has to do with the therapist) and 'diagnostic response' ‚Äì that indicates something about the patient...diagnostic countertransference\\".Casement, Further learning p. 8 and p. 165 A new belief had come into being that \\"countertransference can be of such enormous clinical usefulness....You have to distinguish between what your reactions to the patient are telling you about his psychology and what they are merely expressing about your own\\".\\"Aaron Green\\", quoted in Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: the impossible profession(London 1988), p. 115 A distinction between \\"neurotic countertransference\\" (or \\"illusory countertransference\\") and \\"countertransference proper\\"Mario Jacoby, The Analytic Encounter (Canada 1984) p. 38 had come (despite a wide range of terminological variation) to transcend individual schools. The main exception is that for \\"most psychoanalysts who follow Lacan's teaching...counter-transference is not simply one form of resistance, it is the ultimate resistance of the analyst\\".Jean-Michel Quinodoz, Reading Freud (London 2005) p. 72 The contemporary understanding of countertransference is thus generally to regard countertransference as a \\"jointly created\\" phenomenon between the treater and the patient. The patient pressures the treater through transference into playing a role congruent with the patient's internal world. However, the specific dimensions of that role are colored by treater's own personality. Countertransference can be a therapeutic tool when examined by the treater to sort out who is doing what, and the meaning behind those interpersonal roles (The differentiation of the object's interpersonal world between self and other). Nothing in the new understanding alters of course the need for continuing awareness of the dangers in the narrow perspective ‚Äì of \\"serious risks of unresolved countertransference difficulties being acted out within what is meant to be a therapeutic relationship\\";Casement, Learning but \\"from that point on, transference and counter-transference were looked upon as an inseparable couple...'total situation.Quinodoz, Reading Freud p. 71  Twenty-first- century developments  Further developments in the current century might be said to be the increased recognition that \\"Most countertransference reactions are a blend of the two aspects\\", personal and diagnostic, which require careful disentanglement in their interaction; and the possibility that nowadays psychodynamic counsellors use countertransference much more than transference ‚Äì \\"another interesting shift in perspective over the years\\".Michael Jacobs, Psychodynamic Counselling in Action(London 2006), p. 146 One explanation of the latter point might be that because \\"in object relations therapy...the relationship is so central, 'countertransference' reactions are considered key in helping the therapist to understand the transference\\",Jan Grant and Jim Crawley, Transference and Projection (Buckingham 2002), p. 50 something appearing in \\"the post-Kleinian perspective...[as] Indivisible transferencecountertransference\\".James S.

Supporters claim that it is safe, effective and long-lasting while critics argue that claims have been made since the 1840s that amalgam is unsafe because it may cause mercury poisoning and other toxicity. Supporters of amalgam fillings point out that it is safe, durable, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use. On average, amalgam lasts twice as long as resin composites, takes less time to place, is tolerant of saliva or blood contamination during placement (unlike composites), and is often about 20-30% less expensive. Consumer Reports has suggested that many who claim dental amalgam is not safe are \\"prospecting for disease\\" and using pseudoscience to scare patients into more lucrative treatment options. Those opposed to amalgam use suggest that modern composites are improving in strength. In addition to their claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account for as much as 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. In the United States, most dental practices are prohibited from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions. The World Health Organization recommends a global phase out of dental mercury in the WHO‚Äôs 2009 report on \\"Future Use of Materials For Dental Restorations, on the basis of aiming for a general reduction of the use of mercury in all sectors, and on the basis of environmental impacts of mercury product production.\\" It is the position of the FDI World Dental Federation as well as numerous dental associations and dental public health agencies worldwide that amalgam restorations are safe and effective. Numerous other organizations have also publicly declared the safety and effectiveness of amalgam. These include the Mayo clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New England Journal of Medicine, International Journal of Dentistry, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, Consumer Reports Prevention, and WebMD.  History  Dental amalgam has had a long history and global impact. It was first introduced in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted. = Further developments = In 1855, Dr. J. Foster Flagg, a professor of dental pathology in Philadelphia, experimented with new mixtures of amalgam. In 1861, he presented his findings to the Pennsylvania Association of Dental Surgeons and, in 1881, he published his book, Plastic and Plastic Fillings (Figure 4). (Amalgam fillings were often called \\"plastic fillings\\" at the time.) The inevitable result of this affair was that silver amalgam was proven to be, \\"an excellent filling material,\\" and expanded dentistry's, \\"ability to save teeth.\\" Around the same time, John and Charles Tomes in England conducted research on the expansion and contraction of the various amalgam products. During the American Civil War, the debate on the merits of amalgam continued. In dental meetings, with now decades of use and dental research came the recognition of the importance of good technique and proper mixture on long- term success. It was argued that, \\"the fault was not in the material but in the manipulation....Some men's amalgam is good universally, and some men's gold is bad universally; the difference lies in the preparation of the tooth and in the plug (filling).\\" More controversy came in 1872, when an amalgam filling was reported as the cause of death of a Nebraska middle-aged man, resulting in a public outcry against the use of amalgam. His physicians reported that the filling caused swelling of his mouth, throat and windpipe, completely hindering respiration. Given that the involved tooth was a lower second molar, it was later considered very likely that the patient died from Ludwig's Angina, which is a type of cellulitis, rather than mercury poisoning. Another alleged case of \\"pytalism\\" causing headache, fever, rapid pulse, metallic taste, loss of appetite, and generalized malaise was reported in 1872 in a female patient following the insertion of eight amalgam fillings. Later, however, another dentist examined the fillings and noted they had, in a short period of time, washed away, and that upon gentle pressure the metal crumbled away. He removed all the fillings with an explorer in three minutes; and concluded poor workmanship alone could have explained the patient's symptoms. Alfred Stock was a German chemist who reported becoming very ill in the 1920s and traced his illness to his amalgam fillings and resulting mercury intoxication. He described his recovery after the fillings were removed and believed that amalgam fillings would come to be seen as a, \\"sin against humanity.\\" Stock had also previously been exposed to toxic levels of mercury vapor during the course of his work, due to his use of liquid mercury in some novel laboratory apparatus he invented. = 1990s to present = In the 1990s, several governments evaluated the effects of dental amalgam and concluded that the most likely health effects would be due to hypersensitivity or allergy. Germany, Austria, and Canada recommended against placing amalgam in certain individuals such as pregnant women, children, those with renal dysfunction, and those with an allergy to metals. In 2004, the Life Sciences Research Office analyzed studies related to dental amalgam published after 1996 and concluded that mean urinary mercury concentration (Œºg of Hg/L in urine, HgU) was the most reliable estimate of mercury exposure. It found that those with dental amalgam were unlikely to reach the levels where adverse effects are seen from occupational exposure (35 Œºg HgU). Some 95% of study participants had Œºg HgU below 4-5. Chewing gum, particularly for nicotine, along with more amalgam, seemed to pose the greatest risk of increasing exposure. One gum- chewer had 24.8 Œºg HgU. Studies have shown that the amount of mercury released during normal chewing is extremely low. It concluded that there was not enough evidence to support or refute many of the other claims such as increased risk of autoimmune disorders, but stated that the broad and nonspecific illness attributed to dental amalgam is not supported by the data. Mutter in Germany, however, concludes that \\"removal of dental amalgam leads to permanent improvement of various chronic complaints in a relevant number of patients in various trials.\\" Hal Huggins, a Colorado dentist (previous to having his license revoked), was a notable critic of dental amalgams and other dental therapies he believed to be harmful. His views on amalgam toxicity were featured on 60 Minutes and he was later criticized as a dentist, \\"prospecting for disease\\" and having only an \\"aura of science\\" by Consumer Reports. In 1996, a Colorado state judge recommended that Huggins's dental license be revoked, for tricking chronically ill patients into thinking that the true cause of their illness was mercury. Time reported the judge's conclusion that Huggins, \\"diagnosed 'mercury toxicity' in all his patients, including some without amalgam fillings.\\" Huggins's license was subsequently revoked by the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners for gross negligence and the use of unnecessary and unproven procedures.  Mercury exposure  According to the WHO, all humans are exposed to some level of mercury. Factors that determine whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned (methylmercury and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually discussed in terms of the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors. The greatest degree of mercury exposure occurs during filling placement and removal. However, this is not the only time mercury vapors are released. When chewing for extended periods of time (more than 30 minutes) an increased level of mercury vapor is released. Vapor levels will return to normal approximately 90 minutes following chewing cessation. This contributes to a daily mercury exposure for those with amalgam filling. According to one dental textbook, eating seafood once a week raises urine mercury levels to 5 to 20 ¬µg/L, which is equivalent to two to eight times the level of exposure that comes from numerous amalgam fillings. Neither exposure has any known health effect. Scientists agree that dental amalgam fillings release elemental mercury vapor, but studies report different amounts. Estimates range from 1-3 micrograms (¬µg) per day according to the FDA. The effects of that amount of exposure are also disputed. Newer studies sometimes use mercury vapor analysis instead of the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, Consumer Reports has reported that this is not an accurate method of analysis for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled. Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and not found to be valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva and swallowed, some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled. Of these amounts, it is important to note that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury. A study conducted by measuring the intraoral vapour levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed that the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapour was 1.7 Œºg (range from 0.4 to 4.4 Œºg), which is approximately 1% of the threshold limit value of 300 to 500 Œºg/day established by the WHO, based on a maximum allowable environmental level of 50 Œºg/day in the workplace. Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury body burden; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk). A test that was done throughout the 1980s by some opposition groups and holistic dentists was the skin patch test for mercury allergies. As part of \\"prospecting for disease,\\" Consumer Reports wrote that these groups had placed high doses of mercuric chloride on a skin patch which was guaranteed to produce irritation on the patient's skin and subsequent revenue for the person administering the test. The current recommendations for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The ATSDR Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1 ¬µg/m3 and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2 ¬µg/m3 According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is an estimate of the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2 ¬µg mercury/m3 would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4 ¬µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m3/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed. A 2003 monograph on mercury toxicity from the WHO concluded that dental amalgam contributes significantly to mercury body burden in humans with amalgam fillings and that dental amalgam is the most common form of exposure to elemental mercury in the general population, constituting a potentially significant source of exposure to elemental mercury. Estimates of daily intake from amalgam restorations range from 1 to 12.5 Œºg/day, with the majority of dental amalgam holders being exposed to less than 5 Œºg mercury/day. They also note that this will continue to decline as the number of amalgam restorations is declining.  Health research  As public pressure demands more research on amalgam safety, an increasing number of studies with larger sample sizes are being conducted. Those who are not opposed to amalgam claim that, aside from rare and localized tissue irritation, recent evidence-based research has continued to demonstrate no ill effects from the minute amounts of mercury exposure from amalgam fillings. A 2004 systematic review conducted by the Life Sciences Research Office, whose clients include the FDA and NIH, concluded that, \\"the current data are insufficient to support an association between mercury release from dental amalgam and the various complaints that have been attributed to this restoration material.\\" A systematic review in 2009 demonstrated that mercury released from amalgam restorations does not give rise to toxic effects on the nervous system of children. More recently, a Cochrane Systematic review in 2014 found \\"insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects associated with amalgam or composite restorations.\\" Those opposed to dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam may lead to nephrotoxicity, neurobehavioural changes, autoimmunity, oxidative stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations, non-specific symptoms and complaints, Alzheimer's disease, calcium-building in the kidneys, kidney stones, thyroid issues, and multiple sclerosis. = Autoimmune disorders = Both those opposed and those not opposed to dental amalgam recognize that amalgam has been found to be a rare contributor to localized and temporary tissue irritation known as oral lichenoid lesions. These mild, lichenoid reactions have also been reported in composite resin fillings. Those opposed to amalgam believe that amalgam fillings are also associated with increased risk of other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, thyroiditis, and eczema. Consumer Reports considered these alleged associations between amalgam and chronic disease made by some health practitioners as \\"prospecting for diseases\\". The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) similarly has stated, \\"There is no scientific evidence to connect the development or worsening of MS with dental fillings containing mercury, and therefore no reason to have those fillings removed. Although poisoning with heavy metals-such as mercury, lead, or manganese can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms such as tremor and weakness, the damage is inflicted in a different way than occurs in MS and the process is also different.\\" The Lupus Foundation of America also states on their website, \\"At the present time, we do not have any scientific data that indicates that dental fillings may act as a trigger of lupus. In fact, it is highly unlikely that dental fillings aggravate or cause SLE.\\" = Neurologic disorders = A large retrospective cohort study found a significant association of mercury based fillings with the development of Parkinson's disease. = Dental staff impact = In 2006, a literature review was undertaken to evaluate the research on amalgam and its potential health effects on dentists and dental staff. It was reported that there is currently no conclusive epidemiological evidence regarding risks for adverse reproductive outcomes associated with mercury and dental professionals. It is mentioned that evidence to date fails to account for all confounding variables (such as alcohol consumption) and recommends more comprehensive and rigorous studies to adequately assess the hazards faced by dental personnel. = Removal of amalgam = The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology say that research confirms that mercury from amalgams does not cause illness because the amount of mercury that they release is not enough to cause a health problem. In response to some people wanting their existing amalgam removed for fear of mercury poisoning, these societies advise that the removal of fillings is likely to cause a greater exposure to mercury than leaving the fillings in place. These societies warn that removal of amalgam fillings, in addition to being unnecessary health care and likely to cause more mercury exposure than leaving them in place, is also expensive. Far more mercury is released when amalgam fillings are removed than over their entire lifetime if left undisturbed. This led to some dentists who advocate removal of amalgam fillings (who may describe themselves as \\"holistic dentists\\") to develop special techniques to counter this, such as wearing breathing apparatus, using high-volume aspiration, and performing the procedure as quickly as possible. The impact of such techniques on the dose of mercury received during filling removal is unknown, and the techniques have been criticized as merely advertising gimmicks which enable such dentists to charge far more than a normal dentist would for the same procedure. Sources of mercury from the diet, and the potential harm of the composite resins (which mimic female sex hormones) to replace the purportedly harmful amalgam fillings, are also ignored by these dentists. Consumer Reports has warned its readers on several occasions that, \\"if a dentist wants to remove your fillings because they contain mercury, watch your wallet.\\" = Alternative materials = Alternative materials which may be suitable in some situations include composite resins, glass ionomer cements, porcelain and gold alloys. Most of these materials, with the notable exception of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds. Teaching of amalgam techniques to dental students is declining in some schools in favor of composite resin, and at least one school, University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, eliminated dental amalgam from the curriculum entirely in 2001. This is largely a response to consumer pressure for white fillings for cosmetic reasons, and also because of the increasing longevity of modern resin composites. These alternative dental restorative materials are not free of potential health risks, such as allergenicity, inhalation of resin dust, cytotoxicity, and retinal damage from blue curing light. = Chelation therapy = Anti-amalgam sources typically promote removal of amalgam fillings and substitution with other materials. Detoxification may also be advised, including fasting, restricted dieting to avoid mercury containing foods, and quasi-chelation therapies, allegedly to remove accumulated mercury from the body. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology recommend against chelation therapy and say that chelation therapy can artificially and temporarily elevate the levels of heavy metals in the urine (a practice referred to as \\"provoked\\" urine testing). They also mention that the chelating drugs may have significant side effects, including dehydration, hypocalcemia, kidney injury, liver enzyme elevations, hypotension, allergic reactions, and mineral deficiencies. = Epidemiology = Better dental health overall coupled with increased demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, have resulted in a steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come. Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury. = Prenatal = There is little evidence to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted to determine the effects of dental amalgam on babies in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. A larger study, consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among the study group, 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term. These women had little to no difference in infant birth weight compared to the women whom did not undergo amalgam restoration during pregnancy. = Public awareness = A 2006 Zogby International poll of 2,590 US adults found that 72% of respondents were not aware that mercury was a main component of dental amalgam and 92% of respondents would prefer to be told about mercury in dental amalgam before receiving it as a filling. A 1993 study published in FDA Consumer found that 50% of Americans believed fillings containing mercury caused health problems. Some dentists (including a member of the FDA's Dental Products Panel) suggest that there is an obligation to inform patients that amalgam contains mercury. A prominent debate occurred in the late 20th century, with consumer and regulatory pressure to eliminate amalgam being \\"at an all-time high\\". In a 2006 nationwide poll, 76% of Americans were unaware that mercury is the primary component in amalgam fillings, and this lack of informed consent was the most consistent issue raised in a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel on the issue by panel members. The broad lack of knowledge that existed among the public was also displayed when a December 1990 episode of the CBS news program \\"60 Minutes\\" covered mercury in amalgam. This resulted in a nationwide amalgam scare and additional research into mercury release from amalgam. The following month Consumer Reports published an article criticizing the content of the broadcast, stating that it contained a great deal of false information and that the ADA spokesperson on the program was ill-prepared to defend the claims. For example, 60 Minutes reported that Germany was planning to pass legislation within the year to ban amalgam, but the institute of German Dentists said one month later that there was no such law pending. Also, one physiologist interviewed by Consumer Reports noted that the testimonials are mostly anecdotal, and both the reported symptoms and the rapid recovery time after the fillings are removed are physiologically inconsistent with that of mercury poisoning. Consumer Reports goes on to criticize how 60 Minutes failed to interview the many patients who had fillings or teeth removed only to have the symptoms stay the same or get worse. In 1991, the United States Food and Drug Administration concluded that, \\"none of the data presented show a direct hazard to humans from dental amalgams.\\" In 2002, a class action lawsuit was initiated by patients who felt their amalgam fillings caused them harm. The lawsuit named the ADA, the New York Dental Association, and the Fifth District Dental Society for deceiving, \\"[the] public about health risks allegedly associated with dental amalgam.\\" On February 18, 2003, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the two amalgam-related lawsuits against organized dentistry, stating the plaintiffs had, \\"failed to show a 'cognizable cause of action'.\\" = Research directions = The proper interpretation of the data is considered controversial only by those opposed to amalgam. The vast majority of past studies have concluded that amalgams are safe. However, although the vast majority of patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in the upper 99.9 percentile) exhibit urine test results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety. Two recent randomized clinical trials in children discovered no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over a five-year period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. In contrast, one study showed a trend of higher dental treatment need later in children with composite dental fillings, and thus claimed that amalgam fillings are more durable. However, the other study (published in JAMA) cites increased mercury blood levels in children with amalgam fillings. The study states, \\"during follow-up [blood mercury levels were] 1.0 to 1.5 Œºg higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group.\\" EPA considers high blood mercury levels to be harmful to the fetus and also states that, \\"exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages.\\" Currently, EPA has set the \\"safe\\" mercury exposure level to be at 5.8 Œºg of mercury per one liter of blood. While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above \\"safe\\" levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects. Environmental impact Amalgam separator Environmental concerns over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.EPA (2017-06-14). \\"Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Dental Category.\\" Federal Register, The WHO reported in 2005 that in the United Kingdom mercury from amalgam accounted for 5% of total mercury emissions. In Canada, dental amalgam was estimated to contribute one-third of the mercury in sewer system waste, but it is believed amalgam separators in dental offices may dramatically decrease this burden on the public sewer system. The 2005 WHO report stated that mercury from amalgam was approximately 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that one-third of the total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown this to be a gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries \\"accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent\\". Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an external cost not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment and the vast majority of the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury. Cremation of bodies containing amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, as the temperature in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam- containing teeth prior to cremation to installing activated carbon adsorption or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, it is estimated that globally about 3.6 tonnes of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions. Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care. Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations. According to work done in Great Britain, mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.  Organizational statements  = American Dental Association (ADA) = The American Dental Association (ADA) has asserted that dental amalgam is safe and has held that, \\"the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical\\". Under the comments of the American Dental Association before the FDA's Dental Products Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the ADA supports the 2009 FDA ruling on dental amalgam. ADA states that \\"dental amalgam has an established record of safety and effectiveness, which the scientific community has extensively reviewed and affirmed.\\" The ADA also supports the 2017 EPA wastewater regulation and is providing information and assistance to its members in implementation of amalgam separators. The ADA asserts the best scientific evidence supports the safety of dental amalgam. Clinical studies have not established an occasional connection between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in the general population. = Dental Material Commission = In 2002, Dr. Maths Berlin of The Dental Material Commission published an overview and assessment of the scientific literature published between November 1997 ‚Äì 2002 for the Swedish Government on amalgam and its possible environmental and health risks. A final report was submitted to the Swedish Government in 2003 and included his report as an annex to the full report. In the final report from 2003, Berlin states that the 1997 summary had found that \\"... no known epidemiological population study has demonstrated any adverse health effects in amalgam\\". He reports that researchers have been able to show effects of mercury at lower concentrations than before and states that \\"...the safety margin that it was thought existed with respect to mercury exposure from amalgam has been erased.\\" He recommends eliminating amalgam in dentistry for medical and environmental reasons as soon as possible. = Food and Drug Administration = After FDA's deliberations and review of hundreds of scientific studies relating to the safety of dental amalgam, the FDA concluded that \\"clinical studies have not established a causal link between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in adults and children age six and older.\\" The FDA concluded that individuals age six and older are not at risk of mercury-associated health effects from mercury vapor exposure that come from dental amalgam. In 2009, the FDA issued a final rule which classified dental amalgam as a \\"Class II\\" (moderate risk) device, placing it in the same category as composite resins and gold fillings. In a press release announcing the reclassification, the agency again stated that \\"the levels [of mercury] released by dental amalgam fillings are not high enough to cause harm in patients.\\" Also, in the FDA final regulation on dental amalgam in 2009, the FDA recommended the product labeling of dental amalgam. The suggested labeling included: a warning against the use of dental amalgam in patients with mercury allergy, a warning that dental professionals use appropriate ventilation when handling dental amalgam, and a statement discussion of scientific evidence on dental amalgam's risks and benefits in order to make informed decisions amongst patient and professional dentists.  Regulation  The use of mercury in dental fillings is considered safe and effective in all countries practicing modern dentistry (see below). There are currently two countries, Norway and Sweden, that have introduced legislation to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings; however, in both cases amalgam is part of a larger program of reducing mercury in the environment and includes the banning of mercury-based batteries, thermometers, light bulbs, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc. In many countries, unused dental amalgam after a treatment is subject to disposal protocols for environmental reasons. Over 100 countries are signatories to the United Nations \\"Minamata Convention on Mercury\\". Unlike mercury-based batteries, cosmetics, and medical devices (which will be banned by the year 2020), the treaty has not banned the use of dental amalgam, but allows phasing down amalgam use over a time period appropriate to domestic needs, an approach advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO). = International groups = FDI World Dental Federation recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. FDI is a federation of approximately 200 national dental associations and dental specialist groups representing over 1.5 million dentists. In collaboration with the WHO, they have produced an FDI position statement and WHO consensus statement on dental amalgam. Their position regarding the safety of dental amalgam is that, aside from rare allergic reactions and local side effects, \\"the small amount of mercury released from amalgam restorations, especially during placement and removal, has not been shown to cause any other adverse health effects.\\" The paper goes on to say that there have been \\"no controlled studies published that show adverse systemic effects\\" from amalgam restorations and there is no evidence that removing amalgam restorations relieves any general symptoms. More recently, FDI has published a resolution confirming that their position on the safety and effectiveness of amalgam has not changed despite the phasing-down in some countries = North America = In the United States, numerous respected professional and non-profit organizations consider amalgam use to be safe and effective and have publicly declared such. In addition to the American Dental Association, other American organizations, including the Mayo clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New England Journal of Medicine, International Journal of Dentistry, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, Consumer Reports and WebMD have all given formal, public statements declaring that amalgam fillings are safe based on the best scientific evidence. On July 28, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recategorized amalgam as a class II medical device, which critics claim indicates a change in their perception of safety. The ADA has indicated that this new regulation actually places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials, including composite and gold fillings. Despite the research regarding the safety of amalgam fillings, the state of California requires warning information given to patients for legal reasons (informed consent) as part of Proposition 65. This warning also applied to resin fillings for a time, since they contain Bis- phenol A (BPA) a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity at high doses. In Canada, amalgam use is considered safe and effective by some groups. A 2005 position statement from the Canadian Dental Association (CDA) states that \\"current scientific evidence on the use of dental amalgam supports that amalgam is an effective and safe filling material that provides a long-lasting solution for a broad range of clinical situations. The CDA has established its position based on the current consensus of scientific and clinical experts and on recent extensive reviews of strong evidence by major North American and international organizations, which have satisfactorily countered any safety concerns.\\" Amalgam use is regulated by Health Canada as are all medical treatments and Health Canada has also stated that dental amalgam is not causing illness in the general population. Not all organizations in Canada share this view. In a recent publication, the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors states that \\"... mercury is the most toxic non- radioactive material on earth, and since it is constantly being released from amalgam, its use should be abandoned. They recommend a gradual detox and chelation therapy over several months to minimize the toxic effects of amalgam fillings. = Australia = Australia recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. In 2012, the Australian Dental Association published a position paper on the safety of dental amalgam. Their position is that \\"Dental Amalgam has been used as a dental restorative material for more than 150 years. It has proved to be a durable, safe and effective material which has been the subject of extensive research over this time\\" and that \\"amalgam should continue to be available as a dental restorative material\\". = Europe = Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) is a scientific committee within the European Commission. In a 2008 document of 74 pages, its research on the subject of amalgam safety concluded that \\"there is no scientific evidence for risks of adverse systemic effects exist [sic] and the current use of dental amalgam does not pose a risk of systemic disease.\\" England and Scotland recognize the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A policy statement from the British Dental Health Foundation states that they do not consider amalgams containing mercury a significant health risk. Ireland recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. The Irish Dental Association has published on their website: \\"Dental amalgam has been used on patients for over 150 years. All available world-wide research indicates that amalgam is not harmful to health.... No Government or reputable scientific, medical or dental body anywhere in the world accepts, on any published evidence, that dental amalgam is a hazard to health.\\" The Irish Dental Association provides additional detail in a published patient information letter. France has publicly recognized the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A position paper on the Association Dentaire Fran√ßaise website states that amalgam restorations have proven to have no biological or toxic effect. They also mention that no serious pathological fact has ever been observed and no general toxic action has been scientifically proven to date. The most exposed subjects remain dentists in whom it did not identify occupational diseases related to mercury and other rare that any allergies. These amalgam allergies are about 40 times less than that of resin fillings During the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, there was considerable and intense public debate on the use of dental amalgam. The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people who believe they suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems. In 1991, organized through the ministry of the environment, Norway began phasing out the use of most mercury-containing products (not limited to amalgam fillings but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc.). The ban on the import, export, and use of most mercury-based products began on 1 January 2008. The Norwegian officials stressed that this is not a decision based on using an unsafe health product, but rather that the \\"overall, long term goal is to eliminate the use and release of mercury to the environment\\". Despite the mercury ban, dental offices in Norway may apply for exemptions to use amalgam on a case-by-case basis. Similar to Norway, from 1995 to 2009 the Environment Ministry of the Government of Sweden gradually banned the import and use of all mercury-based products (not limited to amalgam fillings alone, but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, lightbulbs, analytical chemicals, cosmetics, etc.). These mercury-based products were phased out for environmental reasons and precautionary health reasons. Like Norway, there was considerable public pressure in the years leading up to the ban. Since the ban, the Government of Sweden continued to investigate ways of reducing mercury pollution. The Swedish Chemicals Agency state that they may grant exemptions on the use of amalgam on a case-by-case basis. Following the Minamata Convention on Mercury, from July 2018 onwards, the EU Mercury Regulation prohibits the use of dental amalgam in children under 15 years old and pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Additional requirements include the use of pre-encapsulated mercury and ethical disposal of waste amalgam. The British Dental Association (BDA) has worked with the Council of European Dentists (CED) to prevent an immediate ban of amalgam until further research into practicalities has been undertaken. The European Commission will report to European Parliament by June 2020, and to the European Council by 2030 regarding the viability of ending dental amalgam use by 2030.

He reigned for about 41 years from 1022 to his death in 1063, and was the longest reigning Song dynasty emperor. He was the sixth son of his predecessor, Emperor Zhenzong, and was succeeded by his cousin's son, Zhao Shu who took the throne as Emperor Yingzong because his own sons died prematurely. His original personal name was Zhao Shouyi but it was changed by imperial decree in 1018 to \\"Zhao Zhen\\", which means 'auspicious' in Chinese. Reign His father Emperor Zhenzong died in 1022 leaving Renzong who was only 12 at the time as the new emperor. His stepmother Liu was the regent since he was young. In 1027, he was old enough to rule on his own but Liu refused to step down and ruled until her death. Compared to other famous Chinese emperors, Emperor Renzong was not widely known. His reign marked the high point of Song influence and power but was also the beginning of its slow disintegration that would persist over one and a half centuries. One possible reason behind its weakness was its interpretation of its own foreign policy. The official policy of the Song Empire at the time was of pacifism and this caused the weakening of its military. The Tangut-led Western Xia state took advantage of this deterioration and waged small scale wars against the Song Empire near the borders. In 1038, the Tangut chieftain Li Yuanhao named himself emperor of Da Xia and demanded Emperor Renzong recognise him as an equal. The Song court recognised Li Yuanhao as governor but not as \\"emperor\\", a title it regarded as exclusive to the Song emperor. After intense diplomatic contacts, in 1043 the Tangut state accepted the recognition of the Song emperor as emperor in exchange for annual gifts, which implied tacit recognition on the part of the Song of the military power of the Tanguts. When Emperor Renzong came to power, he issued decrees to strengthen the military and paid massive bribes to the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, an adversary of Western Xia, in the hope that this would ensure the safety of the Song Empire. However, these policies involved a heavy price. Taxes were increased severely and the peasants lived in a state of perpetual poverty. This eventually caused organised rebellions to take place throughout the country and the breakdown of the Song government. However, according to the records of History of Song, Renzong was considered to be merciful, tolerant, modest, lenient, and frugal, and seldom revealed his feelings on expressions. One popular folk story of him was about that Emperor Renzong felt hungry one night and was eager to eat mutton. When the servant was about to order the cooks to prepare it, Renzong stopped him and explained that this might cause wastage if the cooks kept cooking mutton from then on, and hence, he preferred to suffer from hunger rather than waste too much. Renzong ordered that officers of government must be very cautious in using the death penalty, and if an officer wrongly sentenced an innocent person to death even once, he would never be promoted. Renzong once said to his near ministers : \\"I have never used the word 'death' to scold others, how dare I abuse the death penalty?\\" During Emperor Renzong's reign, the culture of Song Dynasty, especially literature, began to prosper. Many most famous litterateurs and poets in Chinese history lived or started their creating careers during his reign, such as Fan Zhongyan, Ouyang Xiu and Mei Yaochen. In the 2nd year of Jiayou, the Imperial Examination enrolled some students who would become famous throughout China. The students included Su Xun, Su Shi, Su Zhe, Zeng Gong, etc. They became the most important litterateurs in Chinese history and also began a new era of Chinese literature. Emperor Renzong elevated the 46th-generation descendants of Confucius to the current title of Duke Yansheng. They were previously of lower noble ranks. In 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded the explosion of SN 1054, a supernova. In 1055, Emperor Renzong became critically ill and started to worry about having no successor because his sons all died prematurely. Acting on the advice of his ministers, Emperor Renzong agreed to bring two of his younger male relatives into his palace. One of them was Zhao Zongshi, the future Emperor Yingzong, who was eventually chosen and designated as the Crown Prince. He died of an illness in 1063 and was succeeded by Emperor Yingzong. Many people mourned his death, including the new Emperor Yingzong and, oddly enough, Emperor Daozong of Liao. Legend According to the 14th-century classical novel Water Margin, the first 27 years of Emperor Renzong's reign were known as the \\"Era of Three Abundances.\\" But this was followed by a great plague around the year 1048 that decimated the population.

Cadillac produced two of only three production, gasoline-fueled V16 engine models in history. Both were used in the Cadillac V-16 automobile, the first from 1930 until 1937, and the second between 1938 and 1940. The company has twice attempted to build a new V16 engine, once in the 1980s and again in 2003, but these have yet to be put into production. The only other 16-cylinder automotive engines ever attempted were Bugatti's 1915 U16, Marmon's V16, the BMW Goldfisch V16 and Cizeta-Moroder's V16 (actually 2xV8). BRM fielded a V-16 in supercharged 1.5 liter form in 1954, which was powerful but unreliable. In addition, BRM developed an \\"H-16\\" engine (flat 8s stacked one atop another driving a third crank to the transmission) for the 1966 3 liter Formula One season. It was heavy and did not produce the expected amount of power. It was used by Lotus in the Model 43, and by BRM in its own F1 car. BRM abandoned the engine in 1967, replacing it with a V-12. A modern, quad-turbocharged W16 engine was used in the EB 16/4 Veyron built by the new Volkswagen-owned Bugatti in the 2000s. Series 452 With its chief competitor, Packard, already having sold a V12 engine against Cadillac's eight-cylinder cars, work began late in the 1920s under Hemmings to produce a car of real impact. Lawrence Fisher, Cadillac General Manager, leaked to the press that the company would also build a V12, hoping to keep the real engine secret. The original Cadillac V16 could be said to be two straight-8 engines on a common crankshaft and crankcase, because each bank operated entirely independently of the other with no other shared components. It sported a narrow 45¬∞ bank angle for use in the new Cadillac chassis (which became the Fleetwood).Editors of Automobile Quarterly. General Motors: The First 75 Years. (New York: Crown Publishers, Inc, 1983), p.58. The engine was well engineered, with a counterweighted crankshaft (quite a mathematical challenge at the time), overhead valves,General Motors: The First 75 Years, p.58. and hydraulic tappets. It also had only two single barrel carburetors, one for each bank. The 452 V16 had a bore and a stroke, giving an engine displacement of . It was therefore known as the Series 452. Cadillac initially rated the engine at . It was capable of powering the heavier models to speeds in excess of , and for some of the lighter examples. In all, 3878 Series 452s were built. This engine was used in the various V-16 models: * 1930‚Äì1934 Series 452 (\\"A\\" through \\"C\\") * 1935 Series 60 * 1936‚Äì1937 Series 90 Series 90 The second generation of V16 used an unusually wide vee-angle of 135¬∞, giving a wide but much lower engine to suit the styling tastes of the late 1930s. The two carburetors, one on each bank, and air cleaners were mounted on top of the engine block in this design. These engines had 'square' proportions; bore and stroke were both , giving an overall displacement of . Cadillac rated these engines at the same 185 bhp (138 kW) as the previous series. These engines were known as the Series 90, as were the cars that used them. The Series 90 V16 was produced from 1938 through 1940. This engine was used in the 1938-1940 Series 90. The 431-cubic-inch displacement 1938-40 Cadillac V16 was one of the last new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is \\"The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine,\\" by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design. It was published by the industry journal \\"Automotive Industries,\\" November 27, 1937. V12 Cadillac also built a V12 engine based on the Series 452 engine for 1930 through 1937. It retained the 45¬∞ vee-angle and displaced from a bore and stroke. Output was rated at with two carburetors. The cars were designed to make a statement, so all engine wiring and plumbing was hidden from view. The V12 was used in the Fleetwood-bodied V-12 models: * 1930‚Äì1935 Series 370 (\\"A\\" through \\"E\\") * 1936‚Äì1937 Series 80/85 Later developments The Cadillac Sixteen concept utilized an all-aluminium pushrod V16 engine based on the same architecture as GM's then-current small- block V8 developments. A production version with a base V8 and the option of the V12 engine was planned, but was never approved for production and was ultimately shelved around 2008.

He earned his Victoria Cross as a pilot in the Royal Air Force Bomber Command during the Second World War. Born in Baillieston, Lanarkshire, he applied to join the RAF on the outbreak of war. After initial training, he was selected as a bomber pilot, and soon became a flying instructor himself. He was eventually given an operational posting, flying several raids before that on D√ºsseldorf which led to the award of the VC. On a later raid he was shot down and became a prisoner of war in Germany. He left the RAF after the war, and worked in the agricultural industry. On 19 November 2009 his VC was sold at auction for ¬£384,000, a record for a VC awarded to a recipient from the United Kingdom. Early life William Reid was born in Baillieston, near Glasgow, on 21 December 1921 the son of a blacksmith. He was educated at Swinton Primary School and Coatbridge Higher Grade School and studied metallurgy for a time, but then applied to join the RAF. After training in Canada, he received his wings and was a sergeant when he was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve on 19 June 1942. He then trained on twin-engined Airspeed Oxfords at Little Rissington before moving to the Operational Training Unit at RAF North Luffenham. There, his skill as a pilot led to his being selected as an instructor, flying the Vickers Wellington, albeit with the promise of a posting to an Avro Lancaster heavy bomber unit. He was promoted to flying officer on 19 December 1942. The posting did not materialise until July 1943, when he was sent to 1654 Conversion Unit, RAF Wigsley, near Newark-on-Trent, where he flew his first operational mission as second pilot, in a Lancaster of 9 Squadron, in a raid on M√∂nchengladbach. In September he was posted to 61 Squadron at RAF Syerston, Newark, to commence Lancaster bombing operations, and flew seven sorties to various German cities before the raid on D√ºsseldorf. D√ºsseldorf Reid was a 21-year-old acting flight lieutenant serving in 61 Squadron when he took part in the raid on D√ºsseldorf in Germany which led to the award of his VC. On the night of 3 November 1943, on the way to D√ºsseldorf, the windscreen of Flight Lieutenant Reid's Lancaster (serial LM360) was shattered by fire from a Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the gun turrets and cockpit badly damaged. Saying nothing of his multiple injuries, he continued on his mission and soon afterwards the bomber was attacked again by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190. His navigator was killed and the wireless operator fatally wounded. He was wounded again, as was the flight engineer, while the Lancaster received more serious damage. The starboard part of the tailplane had been lost. He decided to carry on, rather than turn back. Reid later said that his main reason for pressing on was that turning back would have involved flying through or across the following bomber stream, with a danger of mid-air collision.Interview, The World at War, Thames Television documentary (1973‚Äì74). Pressing on to his target, Reid released the bombs, then set course for home. On the way back to Syerston, he saw the searchlights of RAF Shipdham, a USAAF-operated base in Norfolk. Despite being wounded and suffering from loss of blood, Reid succeeded in landing his plane ‚Äì though the undercarriage collapsed and the aircraft slid along the runway. The wireless operator died in Shipdham's medical centre but the rest of the crew survived. He was awarded the VC on 14 December 1943. The citation reads: 617 Squadron After a period in hospital, Reid went to C Flight, 617 (Dambuster) Squadron at RAF Woodhall Spa in January 1944 and flew sorties to various targets in France. He was promoted to substantive flight lieutenant on 14 June 1944. On 31 July 1944, 617 Squadron was linked with 9 Squadron for a \\"Tallboy\\" deep penetration bomb attack on a V-weapon storage dump at Rilly-la- Montagne, near Rheims. As Reid, flying in Lancaster Mk.I ME557 KC-S,Record for Lancaster ME557 on lostaircraft.com released his bomb over the target at 12,000 ft, he felt his aircraft shudder under the impact of a bomb dropped by another Lancaster 6,000 ft above. The bomb ploughed through his aeroplane's fuselage, severing all control cables and fatally weakening its structure, and Reid gave the order to bail out. As members of his crew scrambled out, the plane went into a dive, pinning Reid to his seat. Reaching overhead, he managed to release the escape hatch panel and struggled out just as the Lancaster broke in two. He landed heavily by parachute, breaking his arm in the fall. Within an hour he was captured by a German patrol and taken prisoner. After various transfers, he ended the war in Stalag III-A prisoner of war camp at Luckenwalde, west of Berlin. Post war Reid was demobilised in 1946 and resumed his studies, first at the University of Glasgow and later at the West of Scotland Agricultural College. After graduating from the University of Glasgow in 1949, he went on a travelling scholarship for six months, studying agriculture in India, Australia, New Zealand, America and Canada. He retained a reserve commission until 15 January 1949. Later years In 1950, he became an agricultural adviser to the MacRobert Trust, Douneside. From 1959 to his retirement in 1981, he was an adviser to a firm of animal feed manufacturers. Reid is interviewed and provides a vivid description of the mission for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross in episode 12, \\"Whirlwind ‚Äì Bombing Germany (September 1939 ‚Äì April 1944)\\", of the acclaimed British documentary television series, The World at War. Family Reid married Violet Campbell Gallagher, a daughter of William Gallagher, sports editor of the Glasgow Daily Record in 1952. She was reportedly unaware that he was a VC holder until they were married. Death William Reid died at the age of 79 on 28 November 2001, survived by his wife and their two children. On 19 November 2009, his VC was sold at an auction by medal specialists Spink. It went to an anonymous bidder for ¬£384,000, a record for a VC awarded to someone from the United Kingdom. The bidder was later revealed to be Melissa John, in memory of her late brother, and that she had outbid the buyers acting for Michael Ashcroft in the auction.

This unity government was formed after the Soviet attack on Finland in November 1939, the Winter War, and was dissolved on 31 July 1945. G√ºnther, whose father had been Swedish diplomat and whose grandfather briefly had been prime minister, had entered the Civil Service at the age of 30. He was eight years later transferred to the foreign ministry from the position as personal secretary of Prime Ministers Hjalmar Branting and Rickard Sandler. In the foreign ministry, he advanced in the 1930s to the position immediately beneath Foreign Minister Rickard Sandler, as under secretary of state for foreign affairs and then was accredited as ambassador to Norway, where he intended to stay until retirement. G√ºnther's main achievement was to defend Sweden's neutrality during the Second World War, thus escaping the fate of the occupied Norway and the defeated Finland. The dominant historiography for decades after the war ignored the Holocaust and used what it called the \\"small state realist\\" argument: neutrality and co-operation with Germany were necessary for survival since Germany was vastly more powerful Concessions were limited and made only if the threat was too great, neutrality was bent but not broken, national unity was paramount, and Sweden had the neutral right of trading with Germany. Swedish iron was needed by Germany, whjch had nothing to gain and much iron to lose by an invasion. Sweden was run by a unity government that included all major parties in the Riksdag.John Gilmour, Sweden, the Swastika, and Stalin: The Swedish Experience in the Second World War (2011) pp 270-81 online  Personal background  G√ºnther was hardly a typical representative for the diplomatic corps. Although a perpetual student of law, his ambitions were rather that of a writer's ‚Äì of drama, lyrics, and a few novels ‚Äì not without some success. Unanimous testimony describes him as a man of unassuming ways, high intelligence, and a bohemian personality, with a significant lack of ambition, who made his visits in the office as brief as possible. He was passionate for harness racing and had the nerves of a habitual gambler. G√ºnther represents the last generation of cultural Scandinavists, sympathetic to the relative political liberalism in Denmark and Norway, that was influenced from French and English thinking, contrasted to les Ancient r√©gimes of Austria, Prussia, and Russia; but beside that, he was virtually ignorant of the English speaking world. Like many Liberal Swedes, he was untouched and rather alienated by Finland's political and cultural development after 1809, signified by a high regard for the autocratic Gustavian Constitution of 1772, fervent anti-Germanic fennomania, and the bloody aftermath of the Civil War. As a foreign minister, G√ºnther favoured policies that were rather in the taste of pro-German Conservatives than of pro-Soviet Radicals. Both during the war, and after the Allies' victory, he was the target of criticism that, chiefly, argued that the nation's soul would have been better saved by a less indulgent position vis-√†-vis Nazi Germany, and a more yielding attitude towards the Allies, also if this had resulted in a German invasion and occupation. Together with his aristocratic appearance and bourgeois upbringing, this has rendered him being sometimes characterized as a Conservative. G√ºnther himself would hardly have approved, ardent anti-Nazist, religious skeptic, and, according to his wife Ingrid, a cautious supporter of the Social Democrats as he was. Christian G√ºnther, who had distanced himself from the state church already by a civil marriage, was buried in a civil funeral.  The situation at G√ºnther's appointment as Foreign Minister  A serious cabinet crisis in Stockholm put an end to his mission in Norway: The failure of Foreign Minister Rickard Sandler's policy, that had been characterized by high-profile diplomatic support for Finland without sufficient agreement from other Social Democratic Ministers for concrete military actions outside of Sweden's borders, was starkly illuminated by the run up to, and outbreak of, the Winter War. The cabinet's refusal to authorize even limited military actions for the defence of the de-militarized √Öland Islands before the war and, even more significant, the waters between √Öland and Stockholm made Sandler's resignation unavoidable, although somewhat postponed due to the tense international situation. The outbreak of the Winter War put Sweden in one of the worst political crises since the secession of Finland in 1809. A strong and vociferous public opinion demanded unlimited solidarity with Finland. However, a broad parliamentary majority opposed not only military support of Finland, but also other actions that might put Sweden in danger of an invasion by either Nazi Germany or her ally, the Soviet Union. To overcome this crisis, a National Unity Government was deemed essential, which proved difficult since the Rightist Party, led by G√∂sta Bagge, supported at least moderately Activist policies for the defence of Finland. To solve these difficulties, it was agreed to appoint a \\"non-political\\" Foreign Minister from among Sweden's top diplomats, which was thought to put the foreign policies in the firm grip of the party leaders in the cabinet, where they planned to broker compromises.  G√ºnther as Foreign Minister  G√ºnther left no memoirs, no diaries, very few personal letters of interest for historians, and actually remarkably few notes and writings from his time as foreign minister. Hence, an assessment of G√ºnther has to rely on the account of colleagues in the cabinet and in the foreign ministry. As a Foreign Minister, G√ºnther represented a stark contrast to Sandler's idealist policies. G√ºnther's preferred line was a cautious realpolitik, adapted to the very limited options of a small country during a war between Great Power neighbours. Like many, maybe most, of his contemporary peers, he expected German culture to be inherently stronger than the Nazi barbarism. Thus, he did not subscribe to the idea of the world war as primarily a clash of democracy against fascism, but rather as a traditional war on dominance of the European continent. In that light, a German victory over the Soviet Union, the latter being the latest appearance of Sweden's old arch-enemy, could not be perceived as particularly alarming. On this point, G√ºnther stood close to the most conservative of the cabinet members. In popular culture In the Swedish television movie Four Days that shook Sweden - The Midsummer Crisis 1941 (Sveriges Television TV1, from 1988), he is played by Swedish character actor Sven Lindberg.

History  Schweizer-Reneke was formerly part of the old Transvaal Republic. Founded on 1 October 1888, the town is situated on the banks of the Harts River, with six regional roads exiting the town. The town is named after Captain C.A. Schweizer and Field Cornet C.N. Reyneke. Both men distinguished themselves and were among the ten soldiers killed while storming the stronghold of the Khoi Koi Koranna Khoe and their chief David Massouw on the nearby Mamusa Hill on 2 December 1885 during an action to put an end to cattle rustling in the area. The remains of the stone fortifications of Chief David Massouw can still be seen on Mamusa Hill.  Economy  The principal crops of the region around Schweizer-Reneke are mainly maize, sorghum, groundnuts and sunflower seeds. In addition, cattle and sheep farming is practiced in the region on a relatively large scale on the grasslands where the soil is unsuitable for cultivation. Schweizer-Reneke is rich in diamond deposits. This led to large scale private diamond mining in the area. Wenzel Dam, just north of the town on the Harts River, has been developed into a holiday resort but sadly is now abandoned.  Demographics  According to the 2001 census, the town of Schweizer-Reneke proper has a population of 2,601, while the adjacent township of Ipelegeng has a population of 30,053, giving the urban area a total population of 32,654. 91.5% of the people in the urban area described themselves as \\"Black African\\", 5.6% as \\"White\\", 2.5% as \\"Coloured\\", and 0.4% as \\"Indian or Asian\\". 69.8% of the people of the town proper described themselves as \\"White\\", whereas 98.4% of the people of Ipelegeng township described themselves as \\"Black African\\". 85.6% of the people in the urban area speak Tswana as their first language, while 7.3% speak Afrikaans, 3.5% speak Sotho and 1.7% speak Xhosa.

In her free time she does motivational speaking. Swimming career Du Toit first competed internationally at the age of 14, when she took part in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. During the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Du Toit, who was then 18 years old, won both the multi-disability 50 m freestyle and the multi-disability 100 m freestyle in world record time. She also made sporting history by qualifying for the 800 m able-bodied freestyle final ‚Äì the first time that an athlete with a disability had qualified for the final of an able-bodied event. At the closing of the Manchester Commonwealth Games, she was presented with the first David Dixon Award for Outstanding Athlete of the Games. In 2003, competing against able-bodied swimmers, Du Toit won gold in the 800 metres freestyle at the All-Africa Games as well as silver in the 800 metres freestyle and bronze in the 400 metres freestyle at the Afro-Asian Games. She narrowly missed qualifying for the Olympics in Athens in 2004, but during the Paralympics that were held in the same city, she won one silver and five gold medals. In the same year, her courage and achievements were acknowledged with a nomination for the Laureus World Sportsperson of the Year 2004 with Disability Award. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games she repeated her previous performance by winning the same two golds as she had in Manchester. In 2006 Du Toit also won six gold medals at the fourth IPC World Swimming Championships, finishing third overall in a race which included 36 males and 20 females. On 3 May 2008, Du Toit qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympics after finishing fourth in the 10 km open water race at the Open Water World Championships in Seville, Spain. Her time was only 5.1 seconds off the winner in a race that made its first Olympic appearance in Beijing. At the Beijing Olympics women's 10 km race, she finished in 16th place, 1:22.2 minutes behind the winner. She also took part in the 2008 Summer Paralympics, winning five gold medals. 13 June 2008 On 27 August 2012, just three days before the start of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, she announced her intention to retire at the end of the event. 2008 Olympic and Paralympic opening ceremonies South Africa's Olympic Committee chose Du Toit to carry their flag at the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, making her the first athlete to carry a flag in both Olympics and Paralympics in a single year.

He argues that \\"advanced industrial society\\" created false needs, which integrated individuals into the existing system of production and consumption via mass media, advertising, industrial management, and contemporary modes of thought. This results in a \\"one- dimensional\\" universe of thought and behavior, in which aptitude and ability for critical thought and oppositional behavior wither away. Against this prevailing climate, Marcuse promotes the \\"great refusal\\" (described at length in the book) as the only adequate opposition to all-encompassing methods of control. Much of the book is a defense of \\"negative thinking\\" as a disrupting force against the prevailing positivism. Marcuse also analyzes the integration of the industrial working class into capitalist society and new forms of capitalist stabilization, thus questioning the Marxian postulates of the revolutionary proletariat and the inevitability of capitalist crisis. In contrast to orthodox Marxism, Marcuse champions non-integrated forces of minorities, outsiders, and radical intelligentsia, attempting to nourish oppositional thought and behavior through promoting radical thinking and opposition. He considers the trends towards bureaucracy in supposedly Marxist countries to be as oppositional to freedom as those in the capitalist West. One-Dimensional Man made Marcuse famous. Summary Marcuse strongly criticizes consumerism and modern \\"industrial society\\", which he claims is a form of social control. Marcuse argues that while the system we live in may claim to be democratic, it is actually totalitarian. A form of technological rationality has imposed itself on every aspect of culture and public life, and has become hegemonic. Our identification with this hegemonic ideology of modern industrial society, this ideology does not represent a form of \\"false- conscious\\", but rather has succeeded in becoming reality. Modern industrial societies have furthermore created an \\"affluent society\\", which in increasing comfort have disguised the exploitative nature of the system, and have therefore strengthened means of domination and control. Modern \\"affluent society\\" therefore limits opportunities for political revolution against capitalism. In modern consumer societies, Marcuse argues that a small number of individuals are empowered to dictate our perceptions of freedom by providing us with opportunities to buy our happiness. In this state of \\"unfreedom\\", consumers act irrationally by working more than they are required to in order to fulfill actual basic needs, by ignoring the psychologically destructive effects, by ignoring the waste and environmental damage it causes, and by searching for social connection through material items. It is even more irrational in the sense that the creation of new products, calling for the disposal of old products, fuels the economy and encourages the need to work more to buy more. An individual loses his humanity and becomes a tool in the industrial machine and a cog in the consumer machine. Additionally, advertising sustains consumerism, which disintegrates societal demeanor, delivered in bulk and informing the masses that happiness can be bought, an idea that is psychologically damaging. There are alternatives to counter the consumer lifestyle. Anti-consumerism is a lifestyle that demotes any unnecessary consumption, as well as unnecessary work, waste, etc. But even this alternative is complicated by the extreme interpenetration of advertising and commodification because everything is a commodity, even those things that are actual needs. Reception The critical theorist Douglas Kellner wrote that One-Dimensional Man was one of the most important books of the 1960s and one of the most subversive books of the twentieth century. Despite its pessimism, represented by the citation of the words of Walter Benjamin at the end of this book that \\"Nur um der Hoffnungslosen willen ist uns die Hoffnung gegeben\\"W. Benjamin, Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften, Gesammelte Schriften I.1, Frankfurt am Main 1991, p. 201. (\\"It is only for the sake of those without hope that hope is given to us\\"), it influenced many in the New Left as it articulated their growing dissatisfaction with both capitalist societies and Soviet communist societies. The philosopher Ronald Aronson wrote in 2018 that One-Dimensional Man is more prescient than Marcuse could have ever realized and that it is more relevant today than ever.Aronson, R.

They were created by shepherds on hilltops and were apparently the setting for ritual dances, the nature of which has been lost. At the centre of each caerdroia was a small hillock‚Äîin Welsh, twmpath. A gathering for folk dancing in Wales is still called a twmpath dawns. It is a typical labyrinth of Welsh but there is a specimen in Italy to Petrella Tifernina discovered by the historian Mario Ziccardi. This specimen is the only one in the Mediterranean area for now. Etymology Caerdroea or Caer Droea is a Welsh word meaning \\"a labyrinth, a maze; maze cut by shepherds in the sward, serving as a puzzle.\\" It also means \\"Troy, Walls-of- Troy\\".Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru Geiriadur yr Academi Variations include Caer Droia and Caerdroia, the latter being the spelling generally used today. Because of the similarity between Welsh troeau (a plural form of tro 'turn') and the second element Troea ('Troy'), the name was later popularly interpreted as meaning 'fortress of turns' (caer = 'fort'). Many turf mazes in England were named Troy Town or The Walls of Troy (or variations on that theme) presumably because, in popular legend, the walls of the city of Troy were constructed in such a confusing and complex way that any enemy who entered them would be unable to find his way out. Gwydir Forest Plan of the Caerdroia labyrinth as displayed in Gwydir Forest One of the paths at the Caerdroia in Gwydir Forest. Most of the labyrinth comprises woodland paths like this. There is a Caerdroia in Gwydir Forest, above the Conwy Valley, Wales. It is a permanent Forest Labyrinth, built in 2005 by Theatre Cynefin, Golygfa Gwydyr (a social enterprise based in Llanrwst), and local young people. The paths measure a mile in length, making it possibly the largest labyrinth of its kind in the world. The Caerdroia has been a venue for a number of performances, initially by Theatr Cynefin, and since 2012 by Theatr Dan-y-Coed. Since its inception and construction on a grassy site at Pen-y- Parc, one of the highest parts of the forest, the low conifers between the paths have grown considerably, and it is now an integral part of the forest. Mythical link There is another tenuous connection between Wales and Troy that has been disproven by historians but remains a resilient myth. Geoffrey of Monmouth, following the early Welsh historian Nennius, created a Christian/classical genealogy which placed Brutus of Troy, grandson of Aeneas and liberator of enslaved Trojans, as founder of Britain. This Brutus is generally considered a medieval fiction.

They are best known for their eccentric cover version of Barrett Strong's \\"Money\\" featuring Deborah Evans-Stickland on lead vocals, which reached the UK and US record charts in 1979. They followed with their self-titled album that year, reaching number 60 in the UK albums chart. Career Formed and led by record producer David Cunningham, the group was a loose collective of avant- garde and free improvising musicians, such as David Toop and Steve Beresford as instrumentalists, with Deborah Evans-Stickland, Patti Palladin and Vivien Goldman as main vocalists. In August 1979 the band appeared twice on BBC's Top of the Pops performing their hit single \\"Money (That's What I Want).\\" They also appeared in February 1980 performing follow up single \\"TV.\\" Virgin Records extended the band's recording contract after the success of \\"Money.\\" The group released their d√©but album The Flying Lizards in 1980. The album included two songs ‚Äì \\"Her Story\\" and \\"The Window\\" ‚Äì written and sung by Goldman. Their single issues included their postmodern cover versions of songs such as Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"Money.\\" The 1981 album Fourth Wall received praise from critics but did not sell well. Top Ten (1984), with vocalist Sally Peterson, released by Statik records, consisted entirely of covers, done in a similarly deliberately emotionless, and robotic style, (described by the NME at the time as \\"Sloane Rap\\"), including two singles, James Brown's \\"Sex Machine\\" and \\"Dizzy, Miss Lizzy\\" as well as an album track of Leonard Cohen's \\"Suzanne\\". Cunningham and Peterson worked together on music production for film and advertising after Top Ten was released, including a re-recording of \\"Money.\\" The Flying Lizards version of Barrett Strong's \\"Money\\" remained popular, and was used in the film soundtracks for The Wedding Singer, Empire Records, Charlie's Angels and Lord of War, as well as in the Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning American television medical drama Nip/Tuck and the follow-up to the UK TV drama Life on Mars, called Ashes to Ashes. It was also used in the episode \\"Venus Rising\\" of WKRP in Cincinnati, and in a commercial for Taco Bell in 2011. An album of dub instrumentals, The Secret Dub Life of the Flying Lizards, recorded by David Cunningham mostly in 1978, was finally released in 1995. The first two albums, The Flying Lizards and Fourth Wall, were re-released by RPM in 2010, with the catalogue number RETROD883. \\"Money\\" reached the UK Top 40, and was the band's only single to do so.

The effect varies according to the instrument and at what volume it is played, ranging from cooing sounds on a recorder to an effect similar to the growls used by jazz musicians.  Notation  Tremolo notation In sheet music, the technique is usually indicated with the standard tremolo markings on a note alongside a text instruction to flutter the note. The German marking \\"Flatterzunge\\" is often abbreviated to \\"Flz.\\" or \\"Flt.\\". The Italian \\"frullato\\" is sometimes abbreviated to \\"frull\\".DeBost, Michael. The Simple Flute: from A to Z Oxford University Press, 2002. p. 253. . In English, the most common indication is \\"f.t.\\" Other markings that composers have used to indicate flutter tonguing include: coupe de lange roul√©, en roulant la langue, tremolo dental, tremolo avec la langue, tremolo roul√©, vibrata linguale, vibrando, and colpo di lingua among others.Toff, Nancy. The Flute: A Complete Guide for Students and Performers. Oxford University Press, 1996. p. 120. . However, simply writing (3-line) tremolo marks on all rhythmic values without other indication is most generally accepted.  Usage  One of the earliest uses of flutter-tonguing was by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his ballet The Nutcracker. In the opening of the final act, Tchaikovsky makes the flutes flutter-tongue to depict the cascading river of rose-oil seen as Clara and the Nutcracker are welcomed to the kingdom of Confiturembourg: he named the effect frullato, as did the flautist who first introduced him to the technique, Alexander Khimichenko.Wiley, Roland John. Tchaikovsky's Ballets, Oxford University Press: 1997, p. 230. . The effect has since been called for in many classical compositions, where it is most often used on flutes, recorders, bassoons, trumpets, and trombones, but can be used on other brass and woodwind instruments as well. The technique became quite common in the 20th century, notably occurring in the music of Schoenberg and Shostakovich, where it can have a nightmarish or sarcastic effect, or conversely by Benjamin Britten who uses the effect on the recorder in Noye's Fludde to imitate the cooing of a dove,Britten Noye's Fludde pocket score, Boosey & Hawkes 1958 or in Curlew River on solo flute to suggest both the mental state of the Madwoman and also the curlews she identifies with.Britten Curlew River full score, Faber Music 1964 Both Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss used the effect as well. In Don Quixote, Strauss imitates the distant bleating of sheep with flutter-tongued notes in the horns. Notably, he uses the marking \\"Zungenschlag\\" (tongue-beat) in this passage from Variation II. Elsewhere in the score, he used the traditional German \\"Flatterzunge\\". Mahler used this traditional marking as well, but he also deviated from it in the finale of his Second Symphony, where he uses the marking \\"Zungenstoss\\" (tongue-thrusts). On sustained whole notes, the tongue thrusts Mahler requires have the effect of a flutter tongue.Del Mar, Norman. Anatomy of an Orchestra\\". University of California Press, 1983. p. 194. . Flutter-tonguing is also common in jazz music, particularly that which is associated with New Orleans or Vaudeville style. Cootie Williams was a master of combining a plunger mute with the flutter tongue to create a conversational effect.Harnum, Jonathan. Sound the Trumpet: How to Blow Your Own Horn. Sol Ut Press, 2010. p. 170. . Method The traditional method for producing a flutter tongue effect is to roll the tip of the tongue as rapidly as possible. This is done by performing an isolated alveolar trill while playing the notes desired. Some players find it difficult or even impossible to roll their tongues in this way, possibly due to ankyloglossia.Dovel, Jason. \\"The influence of jazz on the solo trumpet compositions of Eugene Bozza\\", DMA Dissertation. University of North Texas, Diss. p. 20. Uvular fluttertonguingPost, Nora. \\"Monophonic sound resources for the oboe: Part I - Timbre\\". Journal of New Music Research, Volume 11, Issue 3, 1982. is a method of producing a flutter tongue effect with the back of the tongue. The instrumentalist performs an uvular trill, which produces the traditional growl sound from the jazz idiom. Uvular fluttertonguing can also be used when an alveolar trill is not appropriate to achieve the effect of fluttertonguing, e.g. in the low range of the flute, or when a faster fluttertongue is desired. Fluttertonguing can also be used in conjunction with other types of articulation. Either method requires more than the usual volume of air to produce the effect.G√§bel, Denis, and Michael Villmow.

Cupressus sempervirens is a medium-sized coniferous evergreen tree to 35 m (115 ft) tall, with a conic crown with level branches and variably loosely hanging branchlets.See also Uses section for the differing cultivated variants It is very long-lived, with some trees reported to be over 1,000 years old. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green in colour. The leaves are scale-like, 2‚Äì5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed cones are ovoid or oblong, 25‚Äì40 mm long, with 10-14 scales, green at first, maturing brown about 20‚Äì24 months after pollination. The male cones are 3‚Äì5 mm long, and release pollen in late winter. It is moderately susceptible to cypress canker, caused by the fungus Seiridium cardinale, and can suffer extensive dieback where this disease is common. The species name sempervirens comes from the Latin for 'evergreen'. Uses Mediterranean cypress has been widely cultivated as an ornamental tree for millennia away from its native range, mainly throughout the whole Mediterranean region, and in other areas with similar hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters, including California, southwest South Africa and southern Australia. It can also be grown successfully in areas with cooler, moister summers, such as the British Isles, New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest (coastal Oregon, Washington and British Columbia). It is also planted in Florida and parts of the coastal southern United States as an ornamental tree. In some areas, particularly the United States, it is known as \\"Italian\\" or \\"Tuscan cypress\\". 4000-year-old Cypress of Abarqu, Iran The vast majority of the trees in cultivation are selected cultivars with a fastigiate crown, with erect branches forming a narrow to very narrow crown often less than a tenth as wide as the tree is tall. The dark green \\"exclamation mark\\" shape of these trees is a highly characteristic signature of Mediterranean town and village landscapes. Formerly, the species was sometimes separated into two varieties, the wild C. sempervirens var. sempervirens (syn. var. horizontalis), and the fastigiate C. s. var. pyramidalis (syn. var. fastigiata, var. stricta), but the latter is now only distinguished as a Cultivar Group, with no botanical significance. It is also known for its very durable, scented wood, used most famously for the doors of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City, Rome. Cypress used to be used in distilleries as staves to hold mash ferments to make alcohol before the invention of stainless steel. Commonly seen throughout New Mexico, the Mediterranean cypress is also known as the \\"drama tree\\" because of its tendency to bend with even the slightest of breezes. In cosmetics it is used as astringent, firming, anti-seborrheic, anti-dandruff, anti-aging and as fragrance. It is also the traditional wood used for Italian harpsichords. Iran's ancient cypresses Cypress, Cupressus sempervirens, was the first choice for Iranian Gardens. In all of the famous Persian Gardens, such as Fin Garden, Shazdeh Garden, Dowlat-Abad, and others, this tree plays a central role in their design. The oldest living Cypress is the Sarv-e-Abarkooh in Iran's Yazd Province. Its age is estimated to be approximately 4,000 years. Symbolism In classical antiquity, the cypress was a symbol of mourning and in the modern era it remains the principal cemetery tree in both the Muslim world and Europe. In the classical tradition, the cypress was associated with death and the underworld because it failed to regenerate when cut back too severely. Athenian households in mourning were garlanded with boughs of cypress.Servius, note to Vergil's Aeneid 3.680. Cypress was used to fumigate the air during cremations.Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae 17.7.34. It was among the plants that were suitable for making wreaths to adorn statues of Pluto, the classical ruler of the underworld.Natalis Comes, Mythologiae 2.9. The poet Ovid, who wrote during the reign of Augustus, records the best-known myth that explains the association of the cypress with grief. The handsome boy Cyparissus, a favorite of Apollo, accidentally killed a beloved tame stag. His grief and remorse were so inconsolable that he asked to weep forever. He was transformed into cupressus sempervirens, with the tree's sap as his tears.Ovid, Metamorphoses 10.106ff. In another version of the story, it was the woodland god Silvanus who was the divine companion of Cyparissus and who accidentally killed the stag. When the boy was consumed by grief, Silvanus turned him into a tree, and thereafter carried a branch of cypress as a symbol of mourning.Servius, note to Vergil's Georgics 1.20. In Greek mythology, besides Cyparissus, the cypress is also associated with Artemis and Hecate, a goddess of magic, crossroads and the underworld. Ancient Roman funerary rites used it extensively. The most famous Muslim cemetery in Turkey where C. sempervirens is used widely is Istanbul Karacaahmet Cemetery. In Istanbul Turkish the tree is referred to as \\"Mezarlƒ±k Selvisi\\" (Cemetery Tree); its common name in Turkish and the name used in Turkish forestry is \\"Kara Selvi\\" (Black Cypress). Cypresses are mentioned extensively in the Shahnameh, the great Iranian epic poem by Ferdowsi. In Jewish tradition, the cypress was held to be the wood used to build Noah's Ark and The Temple, and is mentioned as an idiom or metaphor in biblical passages, either referencing the tree's shape as an example of uprightness or its evergreen nature as an example of eternal beauty or health. It is popular in modern Israeli cemeteries, with contemporary explanation being that its shape resembles a candle and its being an evergreen symbolized the immortality of the soul. In popular culture the Italian cypress is often stereotypically associated with vacation destinations to the Mediterranean region; Italy in particular. The tree has been seen on travel posters for decades. Image:Vincent Van Gogh 0016.jpgCypresses (1889) by Vincent van Gogh, Saint- R√©my-de-Provence. Other van Gogh cypress paintings include Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night. Image:Cupressus sempervirens Stricta.jpgFastigiate Mediterranean cypress Cupressus sempervirens 'Stricta', planted in Hawaii Other characteristics In July 2012, a forest fire, lasting five days, devastated 20,000 hectares of forest in the Valencian village of Andilla. However, amid the charred landscape, a group of 946 cypress trees about 22 years old was virtually unharmed, and only 12 cypresses were burned. Andilla cypresses were planted by the CypFire European project studying various aspects of the cypresses, including fire resistance.

(1980) is a novel by British writer and academic David Lodge. It was renamed Souls and Bodies when published in the United States. It won the Whitbread Book of the Year award (1980), and went straight into paperback in Penguin Books in 1981. Plot summary The book deals with the intersecting lives of a group of English Catholics from their years as students at University College London in the early 1950s up to the late 1970s. The characters are confronted with a wide range of issues and experiences including marriage, contraception, adultery, illness, grief and, most important of all, the changes in the Catholic Church brought about by the Second Vatican Council and the papal encyclical against contraception, Humanae vitae (1968). The title's meaning is twofold: it is on the one hand a reference to how far you ought to go with a member of the other sex before marriage, but also to the question of disorientation in the face of abrupt changes in the Church within only a few years. Major themes The novel is a bitterly funny satire on life for young English Catholics in the 1950s and 1960s, depicting them juggling the pressures of youth, sexual desire and the modern world with rigid rules about the avoidance of pleasures, the shame of disappointing Christ and the Virgin, and the fear of hell. Yet it also describes how the loss of faith leads to disorientation and sadness in the characters. Cover Image As explained in the novel \\"The name of the game was Salvation, the object to get to heaven and avoid Hell. It was like Snakes and Ladders: sin sent you plummeting down towards the Pit; the sacraments, good deeds, acts of self-mortification, enabled you to climb back towards the light.\\" References Category:1980 British novels Category:Novels by David Lodge Category:Costa Book Award-winning works Category:Catholic novels Category:Secker & Warburg books ","title":"How Far Can You Go?"},{"id":"1129275","text":"Drake's Island as seen from Mount Edgecumbe View of Drake's Island from the southern end of Mount Edgecumbe Drake's Island is a island lying in Plymouth Sound, the stretch of water south of the city of Plymouth, Devon. The rocks which make up the island are volcanic tuff and lava, together with marine limestone of the Devonian period. Early history The first recorded name for the island was in 1135, when it was referred to as St Michael's after the chapel erected on it. At some later date the chapel was rededicated to St Nicholas and the island adopted the same name. From the latter part of the 16th century the island was occasionally referred to as Drake's Island after Sir Francis Drake, the English privateer who used Plymouth as his home port. Even well into the 19th century, maps and other references continued to refer to the island as St Nicholas's Island and it is only in about the last 100 years that this name has slipped into disuse and the name Drake's Island has been adopted. It was from Plymouth that Drake sailed in 1577, to return in 1580 having circumnavigated the world, and in 1583 Drake was made governor of the island. From 1549 the island began to be fortified as a defence against the French and Spanish, with barracks for 300 men being built on the island in the late 16th century. For several centuries, the island remained the focal point of the defence of the three original towns that were to become modern Plymouth. In 1665 the Roundhead Robert Lilburne died imprisoned on the island. He had been sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the regicide of Charles I. A few years later John Lambert, a Roundhead General, was moved to Drake's Island from Guernsey, where he had been imprisoned since 1662. Like Lilburne, he never regained his liberty, dying on Drake's Island in the winter of 1683. In June 1774 the first recorded submarine fatality in history occurred north of Drake's Island, when a carpenter named John Day perished while testing a wooden diving chamber attached to the sloop Maria. Drake's Island Battery The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom recommended a huge programme of new fortifications to defend Plymouth. On Drake's Island, the existing battery at the centre of the island was to be replaced by five 12-inch muzzle loading guns in open emplacements. A new battery was to be built on the southwestern end, of 21 9-inch guns in an arc of stone casemates with iron shields. The work was not complete in 1880. Six 12-pounder quick firing guns were added in 1897 and three 6-inch guns became the main armament in 1901; the original muzzle loaders were dumped under a pile of earth. Finally, in 1942, a modern twin 6-pounder gun was installed. Recent history HMS Portland passing Drake's Island Following World War II Drake's Island remained under the administration of the War Office, which, despite having announced in 1956 that it was no longer needed for defence purposes, did not finally vacate the island until 1963, when Plymouth City Council obtained a lease from the Crown with the aim of establishing a youth adventure training centre there. This centre was opened in 1964, the year in which a mains water supply finally reached the island. On 1 May 1987 the island got its first telephone line, using a cable attached to the mains water pipe. The telephone number was Plymouth 63393. The warden had previously used the Ministry of Defence system. Drake's Island Adventure Centre, under the custody of the Mayflower Centre Trust, operated until 31 March 1989, when the Mayflower Trust surrendered their lease to the Crown and sold off the boats and sports equipment. In 1995, Drake's Island was put up for sale by the Crown Estate, with an asking price of ¬£235,000, and had numerous offers. In the end, a bidding war commenced between former Plymouth Argyle chairman, Dan McCauley, and a Cheshire-born businessman who wanted to open it to the public. McCauley's bid was successful and he bought the island for ¬£384,000 in 1995, with plans to turn it into a hotel complex. In 2003, Plymouth City Council turned down a planning application from McCauley to build a hotel and leisure complex complete with helipad. As of 2014 the island contained derelict military barracks and buildings from the Napoleonic era, and an MoD radio mast. In May 2005 the island attracted British media attention when one of the empty buildings on the island was squatted by a group of anti-nuclear protestors, Trident Ploughshares. With planning consent secured in April 2017, details were released showing how the Grade II-listed Island House, barracks block and ablutions building could be linked to form a ¬£10 million-plus hotel and spa complex containing 25 bedrooms. In October 2018, the island was put up for sale for ¬£6 million. It was purchased by Morgan Phillips for ¬£2m. Phillips plans to open the island to the public with a museum and heritage centre, thirty years after previously closing.

Hardgate has probably been settled since neolithic times with a burial site at Knappers Farm, a cup and ring marked stone and a Burial chamber near Cochno Loch providing evidence of this. Although it is a far older settlement, it is administratively part of nearby Clydebank along with the neighbouring village of Duntocher and now lies in the West Dunbartonshire local authority area.

It has an estimated population of 6,850. The etymology of the name of the village indicates that its name means \\"the fort on the causeway\\". Duntocher has effectively become a northern suburb of the nearby town of Clydebank, as have neighbouring Hardgate and Faifley. Duntocher expanded due to housebuilding by Clydebank Burgh Council after the Second World War, although the area was never formally absorbed into the burgh. When burghs were abolished by local government reorganisation in 1975, however, Duntocher was included in the larger Clydebank District, which existed until the creation of West Dunbartonshire in 1997. Further housing was built by the Wimpey firm in the late 1960s and early 1970s, on what had been green belt land. Along with Faifley and Hardgate, Duntocher falls within West Dunbartonshire's Kilpatrick ward with a combined population of 12,719 in 2011.Kilpatrick Central Ward - Area Profile, West Dunbartonshire Council At one time this was the most north westerly point on the Glasgow Corporation Transport tram system, trams operating from here via Hardgate to Clydebank, and at times, on to Partick depot. Duntocher historically had several cotton and corn mills, driven by the Duntocher Burn which is the traditional boundary between Duntocher and neighbouring village Hardgate. The Antonine Wall also runs through the village, and ancient Roman fortifications are still visible in the local Goldenhill Park. Lottery funding is to provide funds for a children's playpark at Goldenhill. Sir George Macdonald wrote about the findings at Duntocher. Duntocher has a Roman Catholic church - St. Mary's, a United Free Church of Scotland - Duntocher West, and a Church of Scotland - Duntocher Trinity. The village also has one Roman Catholic primary school - St Mary's and one non-denominational, Carleith Primary School. The village has a main street (Dumbarton Road) which acts as the main focal point for village activity. The majority of the villages shops and pubs, the cafe and the local churches and village halls are located along or very close to a small stretch of this road The village is at the southern edge of the Kilpatrick Hills.

Altar dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus Two distance slabs of the Second Legion were found in the area. Other distance slabs by the Second Legion have been mapped with RTI and include one from Balmuildy. The Second Legion is also associated with The Bridgeness Slab. The slabs are two of the four inscriptions on stone found at Duntocher. The first, with its upper right corner missing, also lacks information about its discovery. Both slabs have a capricorn (half goat, half fish) above and a Pegasus (winged horse) below their inscriptions; these are both emblems of the Second Legion. Both slabs also have two decorative pelta shields, one on either side of the slab each of which is embellished with two griffins' heads. Symmetry suggests both were designed with four rosettes in the corners though one has the upper right rosette missing. Other differences between the slabs are the amount of decoration around the inscription, the Emperor's title, but most notably the number of paces being 4,140 versus 3,271. Other find which have been RTI mapped include rooftile fragments, a water nymph fountainhead, and a hypocausted tile. file:Golden Hill Trig Point (geograph 4533092).jpgGolden Hill Trig Point file:Golden Hill triangulation pillar (geograph 4786272).jpgGolden Hill file:Exposed stone base of the Antonine Wall - geograph.org.uk - 1511463.jpgbase of the Wall file:Millstones in Goldenhill Park - geograph.org.uk - 1511442.jpgMillstones in Goldenhill Park Until 1649 the villages of Bowling, West Dunbartonshire, Duntocher, Hardgate, Milton and Old Kilpatrick were all part of Kilpatrick Parish, then for a further 240 or so years formed part of Old or West Kilpatrick Parish. In 1889 however, the formation of Dumbarton County Council saw the transfer of authority to that body where it remained until 1975 when the villages were finally split up. Bowling and Milton became part of the Dumbarton District Council area and Duntocher, along with Old Kilpatrick and Hardgate, was absorbed by Clydebank District. Industry around the village was aided by the nearness of the Duntocher Burn, a fast flowing waterway ideal for industrial purposes. Between 1808 and 1831 four large cotton mills were set up there leading to a significant population increase and subsequent improvements being instituted to road, canal and river transport links. The boom was relatively short lived however and the demise of the cotton industry towards the end of the 1800s left Duntocher the loser. There were coal and lime mines near Duntocher in the 19th century. Today all five of the villages form a bedroom community for commuters to Clydebank, Dumbarton and Glasgow.

The individual segments were directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, Charles Crichton, Basil Dearden and Robert Hamer. It stars Mervyn Johns, Googie Withers, Sally Ann Howes and Michael Redgrave. The film is best remembered for the concluding story, which features Redgrave and concerns a ventriloquist's malevolent dummy. Dead of Night stands out from British films of the 1940s, when few horror films were being produced there (horror films had been banned from production in Britain during the war). It had an influence on subsequent British films in the genre. Both of John Baines' stories were recycled for later films and the possessed ventriloquist dummy episode was adapted into the pilot episode of the long-running CBS radio series Escape. While primarily in the horror genre, there are shades of the comedy that would make the studio's name. Plot A car drives up a country road and stops. The man driving the car looks up to see a country cottage, and his expression becomes puzzled. He drives up to the cottage, where his host Elliot Foley (Roland Culver) greets him in the driveway. He is Walter Craig (Mervyn Johns), an architect whom Foley has invited to his country home in Kent to consult on some renovations. Upon admittance to the sitting room of the cottage, Craig reveals to Foley and his assembled guests that, despite never having met any of them, he has seen them all in a recurring dream. He appears to have no prior personal knowledge of them but he is able to predict spontaneous events in the house before they unfold. Craig partially recalls with some dismay that something awful will later occur and becomes increasingly disturbed. Dr. Van Straaten (Frederick Valk), a German-accented psychologist, tries to persuade Craig that his fears are unfounded. The other guests attempt to test Craig's foresight and set him at ease, while entertaining each other with various tales of uncanny or supernatural events that they experienced or were told about. These include a racing car driver's premonition of a fatal bus crash announced by a hearse driver who says \\"just room for one inside, sir\\", a ghostly encounter during a children's Christmas party, a haunted antique mirror, a light-hearted tale of two obsessed golfers, one of whom becomes haunted by the other's ghost and the story of an unbalanced ventriloquist (Michael Redgrave) who believes his amoral dummy is truly alive. After the stories have been told, Craig murders one of the guests, then somehow runs into characters from the house guests' tales. One of these attempts to strangle Craig on a cot against the wall of a prison cell. Craig finally finds himself struggling against his bedclothes in a sunlit bedroom as a phone rings. His wife brings him the phone, it is a call from Elliot Foley, inviting him to his country home to consult on some renovations. Craig's wife suggests that spending a weekend in the country might help him get rid of his terrible nightmares. Ultimately, Craig drives up a country road to Foley's cottage in Kent.

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"With four accomplished directors contributing, Dead of Night is a classic horror anthology that remains highly influential.\\" From a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the tale of the ventriloquist, stating that it was \\"perhaps the best\\" and that it was perhaps Cavalcanti's \\"most polished work for many years\\". The review praised Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne for \\"providing excellent comic relief\\", and concluded that the art direction (Michael Relph), lighting (Stan Pavey and Douglas Slocombe) and editing (Charles Hassey) combine to make the smoothest film yet to come from an English studio\\". Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 4 out of a possible 4 stars. Legacy The circular plot of Dead of Night inspired Fred Hoyle's steady state model of the universe, developed in 1948.Jane Gregory, Fred Hoyle's Universe, Oxford University Press, 2005. , pp.36‚Äì7 Mario Livio in Brilliant Blunders cites the impact of a viewing of Dead of Night had on astrophysicists Fred Hoyle, Herman Bondi, and Thomas Gold. \\"Gold asked suddenly, \\"What if the universe is like that?' meaning that the universe could be eternally circling on itself without beginning or end. Unable to dismiss this conjecture, they started to think seriously of an unchanging universe, a steady state universe. In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. Dead of Night placed at number 35 on their top 100 list. Director Martin Scorsese placed Dead of Night 5th on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Writer/director Christopher Smith was inspired by the circular narrative in Dead of Night when making his 2009 film Triangle. A shot of Redgrave from the film is featured on the cover of Merrie Land, an album by The Good, the Bad & the Queen.

He was the son of George, Master of Angus, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden, and succeeded as Earl of Angus on the death of his grandfather, Archibald. Marriage to Margaret Tudor In 1509, Douglas married Margaret Hepburn, daughter of the Earl of Bothwell. After her death, and that of his father, in 1513, on 6 August 1514 the new Earl of Angus married the dowager queen and regent, Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV, mother of two-year-old James V, and elder sister of Henry VIII of England. The marriage stirred up the jealousy of the nobles and the opposition of the faction supporting French influence in Scotland. Civil war broke out, and Margaret lost the regency to John Stewart, Duke of Albany. Angus withdrew to his estates in Forfarshire, while Albany besieged the queen at Stirling and got possession of the royal children; then he joined Margaret after her flight at Morpeth, and on her departure for London, returned and made his peace with Albany in 1516. He met her once more at Berwick in June 1517, when Margaret returned to Scotland on Albany's departure in vain hopes of regaining the regency. Meanwhile, during Margaret's absence, Angus had become involved with a daughter of the Laird of Traquair. Angus had a daughter named Lady Janet Douglas with Lady Jane of Traquair and seized some property belonging to his then wife, Margaret Tudor, an estate at Newark and proceeded to live in it openly with his wife and illegitimate child. Margaret, however, was more annoyed with Douglas over his seizure and usage of her dower income as dowager queen of Scotland more so than the birth of his illegitimate daughter. Margaret avenged his neglect by refusing to support his claims for power and by secretly trying through Albany to get a divorce. In Edinburgh, Angus held his own against the attempts of the Earl of Arran, to dislodge him. But the return of Albany in 1521, with whom Margaret now sided against her husband, deprived him of power. The regent took the government into his own hands, Angus was charged with high treason in December and in March 1522 was sent practically a prisoner to France, whence he succeeded in escaping to London in 1524. Conquest of power He returned to Scotland in November with promises of support from Henry VIII, with whom he made a close alliance. Margaret, however, refused to have anything to do with her husband. On the 23rd, therefore, Angus forced his way into Edinburgh, but was fired upon by Margaret and retreated to Tantallon Castle. He now organized a large party of nobles against Margaret with the support of Henry VIII, and in February 1525 they entered Edinburgh and called a parliament. Angus was made a Lord of the Articles, was included in the Council of regency, bore the king's crown on the opening of the session, and with Archbishop Beaton held the chief power. Treaty of Berwick (1526) Angus was appointed Lord Warden of the Marches in 1526, and suppressed the disorder and anarchy on the border. He had contracted a treaty for three years of peace with England on 10 October 1525 at Berwick upon Tweed, but was unable to return to Berwick to exchange papers as arranged on 13 January 1526 because he had to deal with his political opponents at Linlithgow. Instead, he sent a delegation of commissioners including Adam Otterburn to Berwick to conclude the treaty. The terms of the treaty included abstinence from war, safe-conducts for legitimate travellers, redress for cross-border robbery and rendition of criminals. Trade by sea was assured according to the previous treaty made by Edward IV and James III in 1464. Among the provisions was the traditional clause, that neither side should dismantle or rebuild the fishgarth, where the River Esk meets the Solway. A new clause addressed the issue of border people robbing trees and timber from across the marches. It was hoped that during the three years Scottish commissioners would come to London to negotiate a new treaty of Perpetual Peace. Henry VIII signed on 17 August. The King's keeper In July 1526 the guardianship of the King James V was entrusted to him for a fixed period till 1 November, but he refused at its close to retire, and advancing to Linlithgow put to flight Margaret and his opponents. He now with his followers engrossed all the power, succeeded in gaining over some of his antagonists, including Arran and the Hamiltons, and filled the public offices with Douglases, he himself becoming Chancellor. \\"None that time durst strive against a Douglas nor Douglas's man\\" (Lindsay of Pitscottie, 1814). Counsel of King James The young king James V, now fourteen, was far from content under the tutelage of Angus, but he was closely guarded, and several attempts to free him were foiled. Angus defeated John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, who had advanced towards Edinburgh with 10,000 men in August at the Battle of Linlithgow Bridge, and he subsequently took Stirling. After his military successes, he reconciled with Beaton, and in 1527 and 1528 was busy in restoring order through the country. On 11 March 1528, Margaret succeeded in obtaining her divorce from Angus, and about the end of the month she and her lover, Henry Stewart, were besieged at Stirling. A few weeks later, however, James escaped from Angus's custody, took refuge with Margaret and Arran at Stirling, and immediately took revenge by proscribing Angus and all the Douglases, forbidding them to come within seven miles of his person. This did not include his half-sister, Margaret, who James, even at sixteen, could see was innocent and was allowed to be with them - though, as she was in England, the twosome would never actually meet. Alliance with and exile in England Angus, having fortified Tantallon, was attainted and his lands confiscated. Repeated attempts by James to subdue the fortress by siege failed, and on one occasion Angus's men captured the royal artillery. Angus based himself at Coldingham Priory.State Papers Henry Eighth, vol. 4 part 4 (London, 1836), pp. 521-3. At length, Tantallon was given up as a condition of a truce between England and Scotland, and in May 1529 Angus sought refuge with Henry VIII in England. He obtained a pension and took an oath of allegiance, with Henry's promise to make his restoration a condition of peace. Angus had been largely guided in his intrigues with England by his brother, Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich, Master of Angus, (died 1552), a far more clever diplomat than himself. George's life and lands were also declared forfeit, as were those of his uncle, Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie (died 1535), known by the nickname of Greysteil, who had been a friend of King James. These men fled into exile. James avenged himself on such Douglases remaining in Scotland as he could. Angus's third sister Janet, Lady Glamis, was summoned to answer a charge of communicating with her brothers, and when she failed to appear, her estates were forfeited. In 1537, she was tried for conspiring against the king's life. She was found guilty and burnt on the Castle Hill, Edinburgh on 17 July 1537. Her innocence has been generally assumed, but the historian Patrick Fraser Tytler considered her guilty. In 1540, James Hamilton of Finnart was executed for conspiring with the Douglases to assassinate James in 1528. Angus remained in England until 1542, joining in the attacks upon his countrymen on the border, while James refused all demands from Henry VIII for his restoration, and kept firm to his policy of suppressing the Douglas faction. However, despite his remaining in England and the fact that he was her father, Henry VIII kept guardianship of Douglas's daughter, Margaret, who was raised in the royal household. Return to Scotland On James V's death in 1542, Angus returned to Scotland, with instructions from Henry to negotiate a marriage between Mary, Queen of Scots, and Edward VI. His forfeiture was rescinded, his estates restored and he was made a privy councillor and lieutenant-general. In 1543, he successfully negotiated a peace treaty and the marriage, and the same year he married Margaret, daughter of Robert Maxwell, 5th Lord Maxwell. Shortly afterwards, a struggle between Angus and the regent Arran broke out, and in April 1544 Angus was captured and imprisoned in Blackness Castle.Laing, David, ed., The Works of John Knox, vol.1, Bannatyne Society (1846) p.120. Break with England The same year Lord Hertford's marauding expedition, which did not spare the lands of Angus, made him join the anti-English party. Angus was released from ward when Hertford's army landed at Granton near Edinburgh. Angus made a bond with Arran and others to maintain their allegiance to Mary, and gave his support to the mission sent to France to offer the latter's hand to the Dauphin. In July 1544 he was appointed lieutenant of the south of Scotland, and distinguished himself on 27 February 1545 in the victory over the English at Ancrum Moor. Following this victory, Angus was invested with the insignia of a Knight of the Order of St Michael by Francis II of France. He still corresponded with Henry VIII, but nevertheless signed in 1546 the act cancelling the marriage and peace treaty, and on 10 September 1547 commanded the van in the great defeat of Scotland at Pinkie, when he again won fame. Early in October 1547, Angus tried to recapture the island of Inchcolm from the English with five ships. However, he kept up a secret correspondence with Andrew Dudley, the English commander at Broughty Castle, and wrote that he had made excuses to Regent Arran and prevented his retainers from joining the siege of Broughty., no. 102 In February 1548 an attempt to capture him and punish him for his duplicity failed. His son-in- law, the Earl of Lennox, and the English border warden Thomas Wharton marched from Dumfries to intercept Angus at Drumlanrig Castle. Angus surprised and cut off a part of the force led by Wharton's son Henry while they were burning Durisdeer. Wharton claimed that when his forces were reunited they killed 500 men, some drowned in the Nith. Meanwhile, his stores at Dumfries were robbed and spoiled, and he was driven back to Annan and back to Carlisle. Angus escaped his English would-be captors again after the capture of Dalkeith Palace by Grey of Wilton in June 1548. He sailed from Tantallon Castle to Edinburgh, while George Douglas of Pittendreich escaped by a secret way with only a single companion., no. 118 Death Under the regency of Mary of Guise his restless and ambitious character and the number of his retainers gave cause for frequent alarms to the government. On 31 August 1547 he resigned his earldom, obtaining a re-grant, sibi et suis haeredibus masculis et suis assignatis quibuscumque (\\"to him and his male heirs and their assignees\\"). His career was a long struggle for power and for the interests of his family, to which national considerations were completely subordinate. He died in January 1557 at Tantallon Castle, Scotland, from erysipelas. He was buried at Abernethy, Perthshire, Scotland. Children and royal grandchild By Margaret Tudor he had Margaret, his only surviving legitimate child, who married Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, and was the mother of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley who was the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. Angus outlived his illegitimate daughter Janet Douglas who died around 1552. Janet had married Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven and produced several children and the main Ruthven line. Angus also had an illegitimate son George Douglas, who became Bishop of Moray. Since his only legitimate son, James Douglas, by his wife Margaret Maxwell died young, he was succeeded by his nephew David, the son of George Douglas of Pittendreich. Popular culture Angus is the subject of the ballad, Archibald Douglas, written by Theodor Fontane in 1854, and most famously sung by Carl Loewe.

It is also sometimes known in the United States as \\"wild licorice\\", to distinguish it from the related European liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) which is occasionally cultivated. The plant grows in moist soils; although it will grow in heavy soil it prefers sandy soil. It grows to tall, and has long tough brown roots which are said to be sweet and were used as food and for medicinal purposes by Native Americans. After eating a roasted root in 1806, Meriwether Lewis described an \\"agreeable flavour not unlike the sweet pittaitoe.\\" Burr (seeds) of the wild licorice growing along the South Saskatchewan River bank near Saskatoon, SK American licorice is not sweet from sugar but from glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin may increase blood pressure (aka hypertension) by interfering with cortisol conversion. The Zuni people chew the root to keep the mouth sweet and moist. American licorice is grazed by cattle, but not preferred and will increase under grazing as competing plants are grazed off. The new growth can be toxic. It has light green to white flowers in the spring which ripen in the fall to clusters of burs which contain pods of small bean-like seeds.

To the north of Carradale is the coastal peak known as Torr Mor; nearby are the hamlet of Dippen and Dippen Bay. Population: 1,350~ (2009) In the 17th and 18th centuries there were small communities of crofters and fishermen working in and around Carradale. The introduction of steam ships transformed Kintyre and from the 1830s until the Second World War daily steamers went from Campbeltown to Glasgow, calling at Carradale. With the herring industry thriving, Carradale's first pier was built in 1858, developing and encouraging the holiday trade. This situation persisted until the Second World War, with hotels developing and a tradition of families returning year after year. Now this situation is reversing again. Carradale still has a fishing fleet, - largely dealing in shellfish. Since the 1950s, forestry has also played an important part in the village with large scale afforestation taking place. The novelist and poet Naomi Mitchison lived in Carradale House from 1937 until her death in 1999. Segments of the village The village has five main areas: *Carradale Village, situated at a crossroads formed by the junction of the B842 and B879 roads. *Carradale Bay, site of a large caravan park overlooking a beautiful expanse of white sand. *Carradale Harbour (and the surrounding area), situated at the end of the B879. *Port Righ Bay, overlooking a small sheltered beach. *Waterfoot, at the mouth of the Carradale River. Transport The only public transport available to Carradale is a bus service operated by West Coast Motors, to and from Campbeltown via Peninver, and Saddell.

He succeeded to the title and estates in 1558, being brought up by his uncle, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, a Presbyterian. In 1573 he was made a Privy Councillor and Sheriff of Berwickshire; in 1574 Lieutenant-General in Scotland; in 1577 Warden of the West Marches and Steward of Fife; and in 1578 Lieutenant-General of the realm. As a supporter of Morton and \\"ultra-Protestant\\" policy he was twice forced in exile in England. Life Archibald Douglas was educated at the University of St Andrews and was tutored at Regent Morton's court by John Provan.David Reid, David Hume of Godscroft's History of the House of Angus, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 2005), p. 276. In 1580 Angus gave a strong support to Morton during the attack upon the latter, made a vain attempt to rescue him, and was declared guilty of high treason on 2 June 1581. He then entered into correspondence with the English government for an invasion of Scotland to rescue Morton, and on the latter's execution in June went in exile to London, where he was welcomed by Queen Elizabeth. After the Raid of Ruthven in 1582 Angus returned to Scotland and was reconciled to King James, but soon afterwards the king shook off the control of the Earls of Mar and Gowrie, and Angus was again banished from Court. In 1584 he joined the rebellion of Mar and Glamis. Their supporters held Stirling Castle and Mar's Wark in April.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 657. The movement failed, and the insurgents fled to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Later they took up residence at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which became a centre of Presbyterianism and of projects against the Scottish government, encouraged by Elizabeth, who regarded the banished lords as friends of the English and antagonists of the French interest. In February 1585 they came to London, and cleared themselves of the accusation of plotting against James's life. A plan was then prepared for their restoration and for the overthrow of James Stewart, Earl of Arran. In October they invaded Scotland and gained an easy victory over Arran, captured Stirling Castle with the King in November, and secured from him the restoration of their estates, and the control of the government. In January 1586 he was granted the Earldom of Morton with the lands entailed upon him by his uncle; this made him 5th Earl of Morton. In November 1586 Angus was appointed Warden of the Marches and Lieutenant-General on the Border, with a force of 100 horsemen and 100 foot soldiers, and their officers, drummers and pipers, and \\"furriers\\" or quartermasters.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 111. He performed good services in restoring order; but he was unable to overcome the king's hostility to the establishment of Presbyterian government. Death in July 1588 it was reported that he had travelled from the west of Scotland \\"sick of the flux and burning ague.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1916), p. 586. He died on 4 August 1588 at Smeaton, near Dalkeith Palace.David Reid, David Hume of Godscroft's History of the House of Angus, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 2005), p. 396. He was buried at Aberdour in Fife.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1916), p. 600. As reported in the Newes from Scotland tract of 1591 his death was said to have been caused by witchcraft. His physician found his illness strange and there was no cure or remedy causing him to languish until his death. During the North Berwick witch trials, Gilles Duncan accused Barbara Napier of causing his death by witchcraft. Euphame MacCalzean, Agnes Sampson, and Richard Grierson were also accused.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1603, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 497.

Angus began proceedings to divorce Margaret Leslie in August 1586, which were strongly opposed by the Earl of Rothes who considered he had been Angus's ally during his banishment. A French diplomat in Edinburgh, Camille de Preau, sieur de Courcelles, heard that Angus claimed she had flirted with a stableboy, which was thought unlikely, and the Earl of Bothwell joked he would divorce his wife Margaret Douglas for the same. She was Angus's sister.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1914), p. 637. He was succeeded in the Earldom of Angus by his cousin William, a descendant of the 5th earl. A closer line of the Douglas family to the former Earls of Morton inherited the Earldom of Morton. For the Morton title, see James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton and William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton.

A Chinese variant - Type 033 - was built in China from 1962 to 1984.  Project 633  Project 633 was a further development of the Soviet navy's post-war 611 (Zulu-) and 613 (Whiskey-class) designs. The project was undertaken by Lazurit Central Design Bureau of Gorky. Only 20 of the Soviet Union's originally intended 56 were completed between October 1957 and the end of December 1961Korabli VMF SSSR, Vol. 1, Part 2, Yu. Apalkov, Sankt Peterburg, 2003, because of the introduction of the nuclear submarine into the Soviet Navy. By today's standards Romeo class submarines are considered obsolete, but they still have some value as training and surveillance vessels. Chinese Type 033 Romeo- class and its variants A Chinese Type 033 submarine Under the 1950 Sino- Soviet Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty, the Soviets passed to China (and later to North Korea) the documentation necessary to produce Romeo submarines in 1963. The Chinese variant is known as the Type 033 Romeo. A total of 84 Type 033 submarines were built in China from 1962 to 1984, plus several exported to other countries. The Chinese Type 033 incorporated some improvements over the original Romeo, including noise reduction of 20 dB. Sonar on board was also continuously upgraded: the original Soviet sonar was first replaced by domestic Chinese Type 105 sonar, which consequently was replaced by H/SQ2-262A sonar built by No. 613 Factory. Today most of the Type 033 subs have been retired or preserved, with a few remaining in service for training purposes. A total of six Chinese Romeo class submarine variants were developed: *Type 6633: Original Chinese built Romeo, China was to have assembled these Romeos from knock-down kits provided by the Soviet Union, 6 were planned, but only 2 were completed. The construction program came to a complete stop when the USSR stopped delivery of parts following the Sino- Soviet split. Construction of the 3rd unit at Wuhan was stopped, and available parts were diverted to complete the first pair, but many parts had to be developed indigenously. The primary improvement of Type 6633 over the original Soviet boats is the use of domestic Chinese batteries, which had slightly superior performance to that of the original Soviet batteries. *Type 033: Complete domestic production in China was achieved in 1967, and subsequently the project was renamed the Type 033. However, experience from deployment of completed boats in warmer climates proved that the original Soviet refrigeration and air conditioning system designed for subarctic and arctic area was woefully inadequate for subtropical and tropical regions, so redesigns were needed to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and all boats to be stationed in tropical and subtropical regions went through such a refit. In September 1969 construction of new Type 033s, with improved air conditioning and refrigeration capability, began at Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, eventually, 13 units were completed. *ES5A: Upgraded Type 033, with improvements mainly involving the replacement of equipment of Soviet origin with domestic Chinese systems, which includes: QZHA‚Äï10 (Type 779) attack periscope and QDYA‚Äï10 (Type 778) general purpose periscope. Addition of H/SQG-2 ranging sonar, Type 063 communication systems, and countermeasure systems. Domestic Chinese Type 801 sonar replaced the original Soviet MARS-24 sonar. The only difference between the Type 801 sonar and the MARS-24 sonar is that there are 24 transducer elements for the Type 801 as opposed to 12 in the original MARS 24, so the Chinese sonar had better accuracy. Domestic Chinese H/SQZ-D reconnaissance sonar (with Type 105 transducers) replaced the original Soviet system, the performance of the SQZ-D is almost identical to the original Soviet sonar it was developed from, except for the sector of scan, which is increased by 15 degrees. Additional noise reduction measures were also adopted. This is the type China originally sold to Egypt in the 1980s. *Type 033G: Development of the ES5A, with the incorporation of the capability to launch acoustic homing torpedoes; analog computers installed to achieve automation of, and speeding up of, torpedo fire control calculations that were previously manually calculated. All Chinese Romeos were converted to this standard. The NATO reporting name for this type is rumored to be the Wuhan- class. *Type 033G1: A single Type 033G was modified to carry 6 YJ-1 (CSS-N-4) anti-ship missiles, this variant is called Type 033G1, with the rumored NATO reporting name of Wuhan A. The missile had to be fired while the boat was surfaced, with a total exposure time on the surface of less than 7 minutes. The most significant improvement, however, is the reduction of noise level by 12 dB. *ES5B: Development of the Type 033G, primarily intended for export. This is an upgrade package for Romeo submarine users. The primary improvement of this class is the ability to launch wire guided torpedoes and anti-ship missiles (AShM) while submerged. The program originally begun in the mid-1980s, and Egypt is reported to be the only customer when China won a contract to upgrade its Romeo-class submarine fleet, including both Soviet built and Chinese built units. This is the last type of Chinese Romeo class submarine; with noise reduction of 20 dB to 140 dB in comparison to the 160 dB of the original Soviet Project 633 submarines acquired by China. Operators Currently using Romeo class submarines in an operational capacity: * North Korea operates 20 Romeo class submarines. Seven were directly imported from China between 1973 and 1975, and the remainder locally assembled with Chinese supplied parts between 1976 and 1995. One apparently sank in an accident in 1985. Four Chinese imported units are based on the western coast.http://www.mod.go.jp/e/publ/w_paper/pdf/2016/DOJ2016_1-2-2_web.pdf * Egypt operates four of an original eight Romeo class submarines that are upgraded variants of the Chinese design. Currently using Romeo class submarines in non-operational capacities (i.e. training): * Russia and the Soviet Union had 20 Romeo class vessels in service. These vessels are no longer used as combat vessels in the Russian Navy, although one or two remain in service as immobile training facilities. * China has operated an estimated 84 of the Type-33 submarine (Romeo) during the Cold War. Most have been scrapped, but 13 are still in use for training. No longer using Romeo class submarines in any reported capacity: * Bulgaria operated one Romeo class submarine (Slava) until it was decommissioned in 2011; it was the last remaining of four boats that were exported from the Soviet Union. * Syria received three Romeo class submarines in 1961, imported from the Soviet Union; decommissioned in the mid 1990s, sold for scrap in 1996.https://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/article/34567/ * Algeria has decommissioned its two Soviet Romeo class submarines.

The company was formed as a subsidiary of Scottish Transport Group in March 1985. Since September 2005 it has been operated as a 65/35 joint venture between ComfortDelGro and Stagecoach. Operation Scottish Citylink operates an extensive network of long-distance express services within Scotland, operating 19 routes linking the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling and Inverness, as well as linking some rural Highland communities to the main urban areas of Scotland.Timetables Scottish Citylink Services also operate to Northern Ireland via the ferry link between Stranraer and Belfast, and there are seasonal workings to Blackpool. In all, over 200 destinations are served by Scottish Citylink within Scotland, using about 90 coaches provided by operators local to the 'destination' area, carrying over three million passengers annually. Despite the extent of Citylink's operations in Scotland, there are notable geographical regions, including large urban areas, that have poor or no connections with the network. These tend to be areas served by subsidiaries of Stagecoach, which operate their own comprehensive Stagecoach Express network, to destinations such as Ayrshire (Kilmarnock, Ayr and Irvine), Fife (Kirkcaldy, Dunfermline and St Andrews), Dumfries & Galloway, Aberdeenshire and Moray. An exception is the Scottish Borders, which is covered by West Coast Motors, though they have no regular express service. Citylink also operates in the Republic of Ireland, operating between Dublin, Galway City, Clifden, Cork and Shannon. History Van Hool Aliz√©e bodied DAF SB3000 in Oban in October 2007 Scottish Citylink Coaches was formed in 1985 during the reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group to co-ordinate and manage the long-distance express services operated by the other SBG subsidiaries, particularly the Western Scottish and Eastern Scottish services from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London and the south. By combining the SBG express network, Citylink became the largest operator of long-distance express services within Scotland, and from Scotland to England and Wales. With the main hubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh, many services to the Highlands and Islands were in some cases vital to rural areas as the only public transport link available (which still holds true today). One vehicle was owned to satisfy licensing conditions, but this was operated as part of the Western Scottish fleet. Citylink itself did not operate any vehicles, but a uniform two-tone blue and yellow livery was introduced for coaches operating Citylink services, with the subsidiary's corporate fleetname displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle. Previously, only cross-border services had adopted some form of corporate look in the late 1970s, with vehicles wearing a simple but striking blue-and-white livery with bold Scottish fleetnames in the SBG corporate logo style. Subsidiary companies operated Citylink vehicles on express services originating from their operating area, and where long- distance services spanned one or two operating areas, the routes were shared between the companies. The level of involvement of the subsidiary firms in providing Citylink work varied with size and geography. Central Scottish, Strathtay Scottish, Kelvin Scottish and Clydeside Scottish were the smaller contributors as no major city or destination lay within their main operating regions. Indeed, Clydeside marketed its own express services within its area as Clydeside Quicksliver with its own distinct brand. As the Scottish Bus Group prepared for privatisation, Citylink franchises were no longer exclusive to the SBG subsidiaries. Private companies such as Rapson's Coaches of Inverness, Henry Crawford Coaches of Neilston, West Coast Motors of Campbeltown, Skye-Ways and Park's of Hamilton were awarded Citylink contracts and provided vehicles of their own for this work. Also seen using a Citylink livery but with the distinctive Ulsterman lettering, Ulsterbus provided coaches for services between Londonderry / Belfast to Birmingham and London via towns in Dumfries and Galloway. This route was also operated by Dodds of Troon and Western Scottish. Citylink itself was privatised in August 1990, when sold in a management buyout to its management and employees. As the Scottish Bus Group broke up, the number of private operators working Citylink contracts increased. Park's, West Coast Motors and Rapson's were now major contributors, while the former SBG companies now owned by Stagecoach (Fife Scottish, Western Scottish, Bluebird Buses) began operating their own Stagecoach Express network. Plaxton Panther bodied Volvo B12B in September 2010 In 1993 Scottish Citylink was sold to National Express.Competition Commission report 1996 Page 31 Competition Commission At that time, cross border services to England were replaced by National Express services, leaving Citylink with Scottish domestic services, and co-ordinated timetabling and ticketing was introduced between the two operators. During this period, Citylink took a stake in West Coast Motors, purchased Skye-Ways Coaches and also Highland Country Buses, which was an offshoot of Highland Scottish. With the privatisation of British Rail, in 1997 National Express won the ScotRail franchise. The Mergers & Monopolies Commission ruled this would give National Express a monopoly on long-distance services in Scotland and ordered the sale of Scottish Citylink. In August 1998 Scottish Citylink was sold to Metroline, the London-based subsidiary of ComfortDelGro.National Express told to sell Citylink local.gov.uk 29 May 1998History of Metroline Metroline In 2002, the company began trading in the Republic of Ireland, acquiring Cummer Commercials, which operated on the Dublin to Galway route (and also traded as CityLink Express).

From 2004, the operating companies faced heavy competition from Megabus and Motorvator, both subsidiaries of Stagecoach. In September 2005 ComfortDelGro and Stagecoach agreed to a joint venture to provide express coach services in Scotland, ending the competition between the two operators. Under the terms of the agreement, Stagecoach gained a 35% shareholding in Scottish Citylink and in return granted certain rights to the Megabus and Motorvator brands in Scotland. Despite being a minority shareholder, Stagecoach appeared to have assumed operational control. Stagecoach staff replaced much of the former Citylink management, while Stagecoach's Scottish subsidiaries began operating many of the routes formerly operated by subcontractors displaced from Citylink work. Citylink service numbers, timetables and routes were also sacrificed in favour of Megabus where the two brands overlapped. In March 2006 the Competition Commission launched an investigation and ruled that the joint venture substantially reduced competition and that evidence suggested it led to higher fares on some routes.Competition Commission - Scottish Citylink report Competition Commission 2006 Stagecoach immediately criticised the ruling, stating that a period of further consultation would cause uncertainty among passengers and leave vital services in limbo, while jeopardising Scotland's intercity coach network and its ability to compete with both train and carStagecoach Group reaction to Competition Commission announcement Stagecoach Group 23 October 2006 Criticism of the Competition Commission's draft findings grew in Scotland and the joint venture received support from across the political spectrum in the Scottish ParliamentCompetition Commission - Citylink responses draft Competition Commission 2006 In early 2008, certain routes, which were at the time already contacted out to Park's, were divested to comply with the ruling.Citylink confirms partial divestment of intercity coach services Scottish Citylink 4 February 2008Scottish Citylink Completes Sale of Services Competition Commission 5 February 2008 Today many of the services are operated by Stagecoach subsidiaries Stagecoach East Scotland, Stagecoach Highlands and Stagecoach West Scotland.

He is best known for his role in the verdict against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, which resulted in the death penalty. His other notable verdict was restoration of the parliament of Pakistan dissolved by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The Supreme Court held that dissolution order was based on an incorrect appreciation of the role assigned to the president and of the powers vested in him by the constitution. The Prime Minister is not answerable to the President. In fact, it is the president who is obliged to act on the advice of the Prime Minister except when he enjoys discretionary powers. An inspiring man physically 56 inches tall and 50 inches in girth, he overcame his handicap to become the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan from 17 April 1993 to 14 April 1994.

A division bench comprising Justices Sheikh Abdur Rashid and Bilal Khan held that the petition hardly qualified for processing because the judge of a bench could not be proceeded against in a case which had already been decided. The members of the bench felt that petitioner Mian Mohammad Hanif Tahir of the People's Lawyers Forum(PLF) was hardly prepared to address legal aspects of the case and questions arising out of the petition. Instead, he was agitating legal points in a political manner. One member of the bench remarked; :In a situation where the judgment of a case was effective for citation as a reference, an ambiguous statement of one of the members of a panel of judges hearing the case, could in no way prejudice the decision after two decades. If such things were allowed to happen, the whole judicial system would collapse. (PLF) leader Hanif Tahir had quoted the former chief justice as saying in two of his press interviews that the Supreme Court judgment in the appeal of the late Bhutto against his death sentence awarded by the Lahore High Court, was a wrong decision and it was a fit case for lesser punishment. The petitioner submitted that Mr Shah was part of the 7-member bench of the Supreme Court which upheld the death penalty. He contended that comments of the former chief justice amounted to a confessional statement and that he had shown no such sentiments while agreeing with the majority opinion of apex court's bench which confirmed the execution of Mr Bhutto. When the proceedings began, the petitioner requested the court that a larger bench be constituted to hear the case which was of paramount importance. Rejecting the request, the court informed Mr Tahir that petitions seeking registration of FIRs were usually heard by a single bench. It was because of the nature of case that the chief justice had constituted a division bench. Later, the petitioner requested for time to collect evidence and sought an adjournment. The court refused to do so and directed him to argue his case as he should have gathered evidence before coming to the court. The petitioner started with quotes from the interview of Mr Shah. The court asked him if such quotes, taken from a television interview, carried any legal significance. When the petitioner submitted that the text of interview was a \\"public document\\", the court asked the lawyer to define the legality of public documents and remarked that points raised in the petition were based on hearsay. As for petitioner's contention that Mr Shah had made a confessional statement in his interview, the court directed him to examine the relevant law to know what a confessional statement was and if it carried a legal weight if given on a non-judicial or extrajudicial forum. He must also differentiate between a press statement and a legal statement recorded in a court of law. The bench of the Lahore High Court on 12 February 2004 dismissed in limina. On 25 February 2010, President Asif Ali Zardari said in Quetta: \\"I believe former Justice Naseem Hassan Shah as the murderer of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\\"http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=1024882&currPageNo;=1&query;=&search;=&term;=&supDate;= Public service record = Pakistan Cricket Board President= Justice Nasim Hasan Shah has remained President of the Board between 1993 and 1994 and during his tenure an ad hoc committee was placed on the Karachi City Cricket Association (KCCA) whose affiliation with the Board had been suspended after the shock confession in a television interview by Dr Nasim Hasan Shah, a member of the Supreme Court bench which rejected Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's appeal, that he had joined the rejectionists under pressure.

Throughout his career, Poniatowski served in various military offices, and was a general in both the Swedish and Polish‚ÄìLithuanian militaries. He also held numerous civil positions, including those of podstoli of Lithuania and Grand Treasurer of the Lithuanian army in 1722, voivode of the Masovian Voivodeship in 1731, regimentarz of the Crown Army in 1728, and castellan of Krak√≥w in 1752. Throughout his lifetime, he served in many starost positions. Poniatowski was involved in Commonwealth politics, and was a prominent member of the Familia, a faction led by the Czartoryski family. On a number of occasions he was in service of Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski, the principal rival of Augustus II for the throne of Poland. Having served under Leszczy≈Ñski as a military officer and envoy during the Great Northern War, Poniatowski later embraced the Russian-supported Augustus. Subsequently, during the War of the Polish Succession, he returned, with the majority of the Familia, to his earlier allegiance. He later effected a reconciliation with Augustus III, and eventually became one of the new king's chief advisors. Poniatowski's fifth son, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, reigned as the last king of Poland from 1764 until 1795, when he abdicated as a result of the Third Partition of Poland by the Russia, the Prussia, and the Austria. His grandson, Prince J√≥zef Antoni Poniatowski, was a Polish general and later a Marshal of the First French Empire, serving under Napoleon I. Biography =Early life= Poniatowski was born on 15 September 1676 in the village of Chojnik, now part of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. He was the son of Franciszek Poniatowski (1651-1691), \\"Master of the Hunt\\" in 1680 and cup- bearer at Wyszogr√≥d in 1690, and his wife Helena Niewiarowska (died 1673/74). He was also the paternal grandson of one Jan Poniatowski, who died before 1676, although rumors regarding his parentage claimed that he was the son of Hetman Jan Kazimierz Sapieha by an unknown Polish Jewish woman, later adopted by Franciszek.Jerzy ≈Åojek, Dzieje zdrajcy, Katowice, 1988; , p. 189. He received elementary education in Krak√≥w, at either the Krak√≥w Academy or at the Nowodworski School. At 13, he was sent to Vienna, capital of the Holy Roman Empire where he spent two years, and afterward traveled to Serbia, then a province of that empire. There, he volunteered to join Imperial forces campaigning against the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War. He served as an adjutant to Micha≈Ç Franciszek Sapieha, and later commanded a company of cuirassiers. He participated in the Battle of Zenta in 1697. After the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, which ended the war, he returned to Lithuania. Upon his return, he wed Teresa Woynianka-Jasieniecka, but their marriage ended abruptly with her death not long afterward. The union, however, raised his social status. In 1700, he participated in the Lithuanian Civil War as a supporter of the Sapieha family, fighting in the Battle of Olkieniki. Here, he was captured, but managed to escape, and he later served as Sapieha's emissary to Charles XII, king of Sweden. = The Great Northern War and subsequent Swedish service = In 1702, Swedish forces invaded the Commonwealth as part of the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of Saxony, was an ally of the Russian tsar Peter I. Augustus's forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to Saxony. He was replaced by Charles with Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, a Polish nobleman and count of the Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczy≈Ñski and distanced himself from the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons. In 1708, Leszczy≈Ñski appointed Poniatowski his personal representative to Charles XII.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 472. He participated in the Battle of Holowczyn that year, and served as an aide to Charles XII during his exile in the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Poltava in 1709. Here, he worked to establish an alliance between the Ottomans and the Swedes, aiming to bring the Ottomans into the war against Russia. Due to diplomatic efforts on the part of the French, aligned with Sweden, the Ottomans began to campaign against the Russians in 1710. With this change in Ottoman foreign policy came the dismissal of √áorlulu Ali Pasha, Grand Vizier of Ahmed III. His successor, K√∂pr√ºl√º Numan Pasha, was an acquaintance of Poniatowski and had been a supporter of an anti-Russian shift in Ottoman politics. Poniatowski accompanied the Ottomans during the Pruth River Campaign, but was dissatisfied with the Treaty of the Pruth, which saw the withdrawal of the Ottomans from the war. His attempts to prolong and inflame the conflict failed, resulting in a loss of his status in the Empire and his eventual departure from it in 1713.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 473. Poniatowski did not return to Poland, as Lesczy≈Ñski had been forced to retreat to Swedish Pomerania upon the return of Augustus in 1709. With the support of Russian forces, Augustus had forced Lesczy≈Ñski from the throne and had retaken the crown in that year. Instead, Poniatowski entered the service of Sweden, serving as a diplomat for both Charles XII and Lesczy≈Ñski. He was later involved in mediation attempts between Lesczy≈Ñski and Augustus, and also joined the Swedish army in various campaigns, being wounded during one in 1716. During the course of his diplomatic activities, he traveled throughout Europe, including to such countries as Prussia, France, and Spain.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 474. For his service to Charles XII, he received the position of the governor of the Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, then in personal union with Sweden. =Later years: Polish politician and magnate= Portrait of Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski and Konstancja Czartoryska Upon Charles's death in 1718, he continued to serve Leszczy≈Ñski as a diplomat. In 1719 he was briefly imprisoned in Copenhagen, and requested official leave from the Swedish government, which he received that year, thus ending his service as a Swedish diplomat. He returned to the Commonwealth, where he used the title of a general of cavalry. On 14 September 1720 he married Princess Konstancja Czartoryska; this marriage brought him significant wealth. Over the next few years, he became increasingly involved in the creation of the Familia political faction, and most of his ensuing actions had the goal of increasing the Familia's political power. On 5 December 1722 he received the office of Podstoli of Lithuania (podstoli litewski) in 1722, and 16 December, Grand Treasurer of Lithuanian Army (podskarbi wielki litewski), and became increasingly allied with August II On 20 December 1724 he received the military rank of General of the Lithuanian Army (genera≈Ç lejtnant wojsk litewskich).Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 475. In 1726 he became the Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. He was also promised the position of Grand Crown Hetman by August II, receiving in 1728 the rank of a Crown regimentarz. During a period in which no Crown hetmans were appointed, he acted as de facto commander of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian army. He enjoyed support from the military, but his forays into politics gained him significant opposition among the szlachta, led by the Potocki family. He became the voivode of the Masovian Voivodeship in 1731. After August II's death in 1733, he rekindled his old ties with Leszczy≈Ñski, but made some attempts to secure his own election to the throne.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 476. Eventually, however, he decided to grant Leszczy≈Ñski his full support, doing so during the convocation sejm of 1733. He again served as Leszczy≈Ñski's diplomat during the following War of the Polish Succession. In 1734, he switched sides and joined the supported Augustus III. After several years of distrust, August III started treating Poniatowski as one of his major advisers.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 477. Over the next few years, throughout the 1740s, he and familiar supported plans for reform and strengthening the Commonwealth, however most of them have failed due to liberum veto disrupting the Sejm proceedings.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 478. Those failures likely resulted in his apathy, and he became much less active on the political scene in the 1750s.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 479. On 6 June 1752 he received the office of castellan of Krak√≥w. Near the end of his life, Poniatowski was among the richest magnates in the Commonwealth, with the value of his estates estimated at about 4 million zlotys. He died in Ryki on 29 August 1762, shortly after suffering a serious fall while walking. Family He was the son of Franciszek Poniatowski (1640/16501691‚Äì1695), ≈Çowczy podlaski in 1680 and cze≈õnik wyszogrodzki in 1690, and his wife Helena Niewiarowska, who he had married in 1673 or 1674.Poniatowski Stanis≈Çaw, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, Zeszyt 171 (tom XXVII), 1983, p. 471. His older brother J√≥zef Poniatowski (1674after 1731) was a genera≈Ç wojsk koronnych and married Helena Otfinowska, without issue. His younger siblings were Micha≈Ç Jacenty Poniatowski, a Dominican, and Zofia Agnieszka Poniatowska, a Carmelitan Abbess in Krak√≥w.

The work was dedicated to Thomas Moore. Background Its poetry, divided into cantos (like Dante's Divine Comedy), narrates the story of the corsair or privateer Conrad, how he was in his youth rejected by society because of his acts and his later war against humanity (excepting women). In this tale the figure of the Byronic hero emerges, \\"that man of loneliness and mystery\\", who perceives himself a \\"villain\\", an anti-hero. The grand opera The Pacha's Bridal (1836) with music by Francis Romer and a libretto by Mark Lemon, the opera Il corsaro (1848) by Giuseppe Verdi, the overture Le Corsaire (1845) by Hector Berlioz, and the ballet Le Corsaire (1856) by Adolphe Adam were based on this work. Edward Elgar composed the song \\"Deep in My Soul\\" in 1908 with lines from \\"The Corsair\\". Many Americans believed that Lord Byron's poem \\"The Corsair\\" was based on the life of the privateer/pirate Jean Lafitte.Ramsay (1996), pp. 138-9. French painter Eugene Delacroix depicted in a watercolor a scene from the work, \\"Episode from The Corsair\\", in 1831, showing Gulnare visiting the imprisoned pirate Conrad in his cell. Henry Fuseli did a sketch in 1815 entitled \\"Conrad Rescues Gulnare\\" based on The Corsair. Henry Singleton and Richard Corbould produced paintings based on the work.Moore, Grace, ed. Pirates and Mutineers of the Nineteenth Century: Swashbucklers and Swindlers. Routledge, 2011. In 1840, American editor and author N. P. Willis named his new periodical The Corsair after Byron's poem. Summary The plot centers around the main character of Conrad, the Corsair, a pirate or privateer. The first canto recounts Conrad's plan to attack the Pacha Seyd and to seize his possessions. His wife, Medora, however, is determined to convince him to abandon his plan and not embark on the mission. He sails from his island in the Aegean Sea to attack the pasha on another island. The second canto describes the attack. Disguised, Conrad and his brigands begin their assault against Pacha Seyd by surrounding and infiltrating his palace. The attack goes well and according to plan. But Conrad then hears the cries of the women in the pasha's harem whom he tries to free. The diversion from the plan enables the pasha's forces to mount a counterattack. They are able to kill most of the attackers and to seize Conrad. Gulnare, the pasha's slave, sneaks to Conrad's prison cell where she informs him that she will make an attempt to save him. This is in gratitude for his attempt to save her. In the third and final canto, Gulnare initiates the escape plan by seeking to hoodwink Syed into freeing Conrad. The plan does not succeed. The pasha threatens to kill her and Conrad. Gulnare tries to convince Conrad to kill Seyd. She secretly has a knife taken to his cell. Conrad, however, refuses to kill the pasha in cold blood without a fair fight. She then kills the pasha herself. They are both able to escape. Conrad takes Gulnare home with him. Upon his return, he discovers that his wife Medora has died due to grief and despair, believing that Conrad had died. In the final scene, Conrad departs from the island alone, not marrying Gulnare: \\"He left a Corsair's name to other times,/Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes.\\" References Sources * Drucker, Peter.

(or simply Criterion) is an American home video distribution company which focuses on licensing \\"important classic and contemporary films\\" and selling them to film aficionados. Criterion has helped to standardize characteristics of home video such as film restoration, using the letterbox format for widescreen films, and adding bonus features and commentary tracks. History The company was founded in 1984 by Robert Stein, Aleen Stein, and Joe Medjuck, who later were joined by Roger Smith. In 1985, the Steins, William Becker, and Jonathan B. Turell founded the Voyager Company, to publish educational multimedia CD-ROMs (1989‚Äì2000), during which time the Criterion Collection became a subordinate division of the Voyager Company. In March 1994, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH bought 20% of Voyager for US$6.7 million; the four founders each retained a 20% owner's share. In 1997, the Voyager Company was dissolved (Aleen Stein founded the Organa LLC CD-ROM publishing company), and Holtzbrinck Publishers sold the \\"Voyager\\" brand name, 42 CD-ROM titles, the Voyager web site, and associated assets, to Learn Technologies Interactive, LLC (LTI). Robert Stein sold 42 Voyager titles to LTI from his Voyager‚ÄìCriterion company share. The remaining three partners, Aleen Stein, William Becker (President) and Jonathan Turell (CEO) owned the Criterion Collection company, which has a business partnership with Janus Films, and had one with Home Vision Entertainment (HVE) until 2005, when Image Entertainment bought HVE. On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment would handle distribution. =Home Vision Entertainment= In 1986, Charles Benton founded Home Vision Entertainment (HVE), the home-video division of Public Media Inc. (PMI), which he had previously founded in 1968. The HVE company sold, advertised, marketed, and distributed Criterion Collection DVDs, and also sold its own HVE brand of DVDs (co-produced with Criterion), including The Merchant Ivory Collection, and the Classic Collection, a joint venture between Home Vision Entertainment and Janus Films. The latter enterprise published HVE imprint films, for which Janus Films owned the video rights, but which were unavailable from the Criterion Collection; however, Criterion published the Classic Collection films. In 2005, Image Entertainment bought HVE, thus it became the exclusive distributor of Criterion Collection products until 2013. =Online ventures and marketing= The Criterion Collection began to provide video on demand (VOD) in partnership with MUBI (formerly The Auteurs) in 2008. In February 2011, Criterion began switching its VOD offerings exclusively to Hulu Plus. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection. Some Criterion films were streamed by Kanopy. On October 26, 2018, Warner Bros. Digital Networks and Turner announced that FilmStruck would be shutting down on November 29. Criterion stated in a blog post that they were \\"trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible.\\" On November 16, 2018, Criterion announced that they would be launching the Criterion Channel as a standalone service, wholly owned and operated by the Criterion Collection, beginning in the United States and Canada, then hopefully elsewhere. Some of the VOD service's offerings are also available through HBO Max, WarnerMedia's streaming platform . Criterion also maintains a YouTube channel with which it markets its films. One notable feature is the \\"Three Reasons\\" playlist it has produced in which the company overlays in a few words or phrases three reasons that the film is worth watching or has entered the Criterion catalogue. In response YouTube users offer their own \\"Three Reasons\\" to promote nominations.Three Reasons: Punishment ParkThree Reasons: The Devils No \\"Three Reasons\\" video has been released by Criterion since June 30, 2015. British film magazine Sight & Sound revealed in their April 2016 issue that Criterion would be expanding its releases to the United Kingdom. The first six titles were released on April 18, 2016. Contributions and influence The Criterion Collection video company pioneered the correct aspect ratio letterboxing presentation of movies, as well as commentary soundtracks, multi-disc sets, special editions, and definitive versions. These ideas and the special features introduced by the Criterion Collection have been highly influential, and have become industry-wide standards for premium home video releases. =Letterboxing= With its eighth LaserDisc release, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Criterion introduced the letterbox format, which added black bars to the top and bottom of the 4:3 standard television set in order to preserve the original aspect ratio of the film. Thereafter, Criterion made letterboxing the standard presentation for all its releases of films shot in widescreen aspect ratios. =Commentary soundtracks= The Criterion Collection's second catalog title, King Kong (1933), was the debut of the scene-specific audio commentaryFrom the Archives: The KING KONG commentary on Vimeo contained in a separate analog channel of the LaserDisc. It featured US film historian Ronald Haver reporting about the production, cast, screenplay, production design and special effects. He is also the commentator for the LaserDisc editions of Casablanca (1942), Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Singin' in the Rain (1952), and The Wizard of Oz (1939). Typically, the chapter-indexed commentaries are exclusive to the Criterion releases and their initial DVD reissues; they became collector's items when the original-owner studios re-issued titles previously licensed to Criterion (with newly produced commentary tracks or not). =Special editions= The Criterion Collection began in 1984 with the releases of Citizen Kane (1941) and King Kong (1933) on LaserDisc, the latter's source negatives courtesy of the Library of Congress. The company later became known for pioneering the ‚Äúspecial edition‚Äù DVD concept, containing bonus materials (trailers, commentaries, documentaries, alternate endings, deleted scenes, et cetera), \\"a film school in a box\\", as it were, the success of which established the special edition version in the DVD business. In 2006, taking advantage of better film-transfer and film-restoration technologies, Criterion published improved-image versions, with bonus materials, of early catalog titles such as Amarcord (1973), Brazil (1985), and Seven Samurai (1954). =Film restoration= Originally, the Criterion company released art, genre, and mainstream movies on LaserDisc such as Halloween (1978), Ghostbusters (1984), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Armageddon (1998), and The Rock (1996). Increasingly, the Criterion Collection has also focused on releasing world cinema, mainstream cinema classics, and critically successful obscure movies. Using the best available source materials, the company produced technologically improved and cleaner versions. For example, The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), M (1931), Children of Paradise (1945), The Third Man (1949), Seven Samurai (1954), and Amarcord (1973) discs contain film-cleaning and film-restoration demonstrations, comparing the restored and un-restored images. =Licenses= Some previously licensed Criterion Collection titles, such as The Harder They Come (1972), are now commercially unavailable as new product, and are only available in resale (used) form. Titles such as RoboCop (1987), Hard Boiled (1992), The Killer (1989), and Ran (1985), became unavailable when their publishing licenses expired, or when Criterion published improved versions, such as Beauty and the Beast (1946), M (1931), The Wages of Fear (1953), and Seven Samurai (1954). As of September 2018, 188 of the 954 titles (19%) from the list of Criterion Collection LaserDisc releases have been re-released. Another example is the film Charade (1963), which had become a public-domain property for lacking the legally required copyright notice. The Criterion company produced a restored edition under license from Universal Pictures for the initial edition, and for the later anamorphic widescreen re-release edition of the film.To Martin Scorsese, the Criterion Collection and Anyone Else Who‚Äôll Listen: More Public Domain Classics Worth SavingHuffPosCharade (Universal 100th Anniversary): DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video Periodically, Criterion does release material on DVD/Blu-ray licensed from the studios they previously dealt with (e.g., Universal and Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil); these new releases are generally done on a case-by-case basis.25 Essential DVD/Blu-ray Releases from The Criterion Collection ¬´ Taste of Cinema Formats =LaserDisc and DVD= The original \\"Criterion\\" logo The Criterion Collection began publishing LaserDiscs on December 1, 1984 with its release of Citizen Kane. In 1998, Criterion began publishing DVDs as well. On March 16, 1999, Criterion issued its final LaserDisc release, Michael Bay's Armageddon. As with its laserdiscs, Criterion's early DVD editions of widescreen films were presented in the letterbox format, but Criterion did not enhance its discs for 16:9 monitors until mid-1999 with its release of Insomnia (1997), catalog number 47. Criterion was slow to expand into high-definition releases, partly due to the HD format wars between Blu-ray and HD DVD. Once Blu-ray had emerged as the industry-standard high-definition home video format, Criterion expanded into releasing Blu-ray editions of select films from its collection, beginning with the Blu-ray release of Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express (#453; currently out of print) on December 16, 2008. In late 2013, Criterion announced that with the November release of the Zatoichi boxset (spine #679), all their releases would be in dual format (DVD and Blu-ray packaged together) rather than individual releases.Why Dual-Format?The CurrentThe Criterion Collection This decision also applied to most upgrade re-releases introduced after November 2013. After customer feedback revealed some reluctance to this approach, All That Jazz (#724) became the last chronological spine number released as a dual format edition, and the decision was reversed back to separate releases for titles released in and after September 2014.Re:FormatThe CurrentThe Criterion Collection Despite the emergence of Blu-ray as the industry-standard high-definition format, Janus/Criterion remain committed to supporting the DVD format. Not only are all their new Blu-ray releases accompanied by a standard- definition DVD version, but revised and upgraded releases are also released on both formats (barring the brief foray into dual-format releases). Moreover, the company's stand-alone line of Eclipse releases are currently only made available in the standard DVD format. Aside from the core catalog, the company has also released films through its Essential Art House, Eclipse, and Merchant Ivory Collection lines, as well as a few releases outside of any product line. Many of these releases have also been collected and sold in various box sets. In April 2016 for the first time in its history, Criterion announced it would begin releasing their catalogue outside of the U.S. (earlier international Criterion titles like the Japanese LaserDisc of Blade Runner were licensed to other companies). In partnership with Sony Entertainment, releases began to be distributed with the launch of six titles in the UK during the month. =Video on demand services= The company has also expanded into online distribution, through online video on demand rental services, first in partnership with MUBI (formerly known as The Auteurs), then Hulu. Criterion's Hulu Plus subscription channel also offered titles for streaming as-yet unreleased on DVD/Blu-ray, including dozens of the Janus-owned films produced by London Films. In November, 2016, Criterion ended its deal with Hulu, and partnered with Turner Classic Movies to launch a dedicated streaming service called FilmStruck. After two years, TCM parent company WarnerMedia restructured its streaming offerings, and it was announced that the future online home for Criterion's films would be a dedicated channel. The Criterion Channel launched on April 8, 2019 and offers subscribers access to both 'complete' releases from the collection, specially-produced supplementary programming and other films controlled by Janus/Voyager, alongside limited engagements of select films from other companies, particularly Warner/TCM.At Criterion Channel, programming a movable movie feast - ABC News On November 25, 2008, on its website, Criterion began offering video on demand (VOD) downloading services, for US$5.00 per select movie, marking the beginning of a cross-promotional video on demand (VOD) service from the Criterion and The Auteurs websites. In early 2011, many Criterion titles also became available through the Hulu Plus premium subscription service. In November 2016, FilmStruck, a film streaming service from Turner Classic Movies, succeeded Hulu as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection; FilmStruck was discontinued on November 29, 2018. Since then, Criterion has launched the Criterion Channel, making a curated selection of its library available to Canadian and U.S. subscribers. Criterion Collection content is also accessible via the library VOD service Kanopy. =Blu-ray= A Criterion Collection logotype: Blu-ray Criterion label, dates from the first movies released on December 16, 2008. Criterion began publishing on Blu-ray Disc in December 2008. Unlike its DVD releases, which are a mixture of NTSC-standard Region 0 (region-free) and Region 1 DVDs, Criterion Collection Blu-ray Discs are Region A locked in North America or Region B locked in the United Kingdom (with the exception of Roma, which is region-free in both territories). =Eclipse= Eclipse is a line started in 2007 separate from the Criterion Collection. It is described by Criterion as \\"a selection of lost, forgotten, or overshadowed classics in simple, affordable editions\\". Product pricing The retail list prices for Criterion Collection releases typically range from US$30 to US$40 for one-disc and two- discs sets, respectively, while boxed sets typically range from US$80 to US$200. Twice-yearly sales at 50% off full price are held both at the Criterion website and at the Barnes & Noble website and stores. Janus Films' \\"Essential Art House\\" collection consists of Janus-owned Criterion films without many special features, as lower-cost alternatives to individual purchases of regular Criterion titles. Demand for out-of-print re-releases has spawned the business of counterfeit (bootleg) copies, often advertised as a Criterion Collection \\"Asian\\" edition to disguise their bootleg nature. The company's website instructs buyers to shop carefully, advises about identifying bootleg merchandise, and notes that the Criterion Collection has never published Asian editions of its film catalog.

In its simplest form it is an uncomplicated squared metal spike, and was used extensively during the Middle Ages. The typical bodkin was a square-section arrowhead, generally up to long and thick at its widest point, tapered down behind this initial \\"punch\\" shape. Bodkin arrows complemented traditional broadhead arrows, which continued to be used, as the sharp, wide cutting surface of the broadhead caused more serious wounds and tissue damage than the bodkin arrowhead. History  The name comes from the Old English word or , a type of sharp, pointed dagger. Arrows of the long bodkin type were used by the Vikings and continued to be used throughout the Middle Ages. The bodkin point eventually fell out of use during the 16th and 17th centuries, as armour largely ceased to be worn and firearms took over from archery. Armour penetration It has been suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research by the Royal Armouries has found no hardened bodkin points, though only two bodkin points were actually tested, not a statistically relevant number. Bodkins did, however, have greater ability to pierce mail armour than broadheads, and historical accounts do speak of bodkin arrows shot from close range piercing plate armour. Broadheads were made from steel, sometimes with hardened edges, but were more often used against lightly armoured men or horses than against an armoured adversary. In a modern test, a direct hit from a steel bodkin point penetrated mail armour, although at point blank range.Pope, Saxton. Hunting with the Bow and Arrow: \\"To test a steel bodkin pointed arrow such as was used at the battle of Cressy, I borrowed a shirt of chain armour from the Museum, a beautiful specimen made in Damascus in the 15th Century. It weighed twenty-five pounds and was in perfect condition. One of the attendants in the Museum offered to put it on and allow me to shoot at him. Fortunately, I declined his proffered services and put it on a wooden box, padded with burlap to represent clothing. Indoors at a distance of seven yards, I discharged an arrow at it with such force that sparks flew from the links of steel as from a forge. The bodkin point and shaft went through the thickest portion of the back, penetrated an inch of wood and bulged out the opposite side of the armour shirt. The attendant turned a pale green. An arrow of this type can be shot about two hundred yards, and would be deadly up to the full limit of its flight.\\" However, the test was conducted without a padded jack or gambeson, which was layered cloth armour worn under heavier armour for protection against projectiles, as it was known to stop even heavy arrows.Embleton, Gerry & Howe, John: \\"S√∂ldnerleben im Mittelalter\\", p. 47, Motorbuchverlag 1994. Armour of the medieval era was not completely proof against arrows until the specialised armour of the Italian city-state mercenary companies.\\"Medieval Military Surgery\\", Medieval History Magazine, Vol 1 issue 4, December 2003 Archery was thought not to be effective against plate armour in the Battle of Neville's Cross (1346), the Battle of Bergerac (1345), and the Battle of Poitiers (1356); such armour became available to European knights and men at arms of fairly modest means by the late 14th century, though never to all soldiers in any army.Strickland, M.; Hardy, R. The Great Warbow. Sutton Publishing 2005. Pages 272‚Äì278: \\"even at a range of 240 yards heavy war arrows shot from bows of poundages in the mid- to upper range possessed by the Mary Rose bows would have been capable of killing or severely wounding men equipped with armour of wrought iron. Higher-quality armour of steel would have given considerably greater protection, which accords well with the experience of Oxford's men against the elite French vanguard at Poitiers in 1356, and des Ursin's statement that the French knights of the first ranks at Agincourt, which included some of the most important (and thus best-equipped) nobles, remained comparatively unhurt by the English arrows.\\" Some recent tests have demonstrated that needle bodkins could penetrate all but heavy steel plate armour; one test used padded \\"jack\\" armour, coat of plates, iron and steel mail and steel plate. A needle bodkin penetrated every type, but may not have been able to inflict a lethal injury behind plate. As with all other tests, accuracy of these tests is called into question as the arrowheads were all high carbon steel and hardened, and the historical accuracy of the armour tested is unknown. In one test of historical arrows from the London Museum, a \\"type 16\\" barbed arrowhead was indeed found to be steel; the composition of the other types of arrowheads (including bodkins) was not tested. Computer analysis by Warsaw University of Technology in 2017 demonstrated that heavy bodkin-point arrows could penetrate typical plate armour of the time at . However, the depth of penetration would be slight at that range; penetration increased as the range closed or against armour lesser than the best quality available at the time.

The name Saddell is derived from the Norse for sandy dale. Saddell Abbey Saddell is home to the ruins of a Cistercian Abbey. This was founded around 1160 by Somerled, and completed by his son, whose descendants became the Clan MacDonald and eventual Lords of the Isles. Stone carving was a speciality at Saddell and there are fine examples of carved medieval grave slabs displayed under cover in the grounds of the abbey, now a cemetery. Relief carvings on the stones show warriors in their armour, clerics, ships, huntsmen with stags, large swords and Celtic knotwork designs. Most were carved at Saddell Abbey but some are more typical of the Iona school of stone-carving. Saddell Castle Saddell Castle, a tower house to the southeast and nearer the shore, was built for the Bishop of Argyll in the early 16th century. When the Campbells took it over in the late 17th century, stone from the abbey was used to add farm buildings to the castle. The family moved into a new house nearby around 1774, and the castle deteriorated over the years before being bought by the Landmark Trust. In 1976 the Landmark Trust contracted Mr Robert R Mauchline to restore the castle to its former glory. Soon after its completion the castle appeared in Paul McCartney's \\"Mull of Kintyre\\" music video. Mr Mauchline's daughters Joanna and Hazel were also featured in the video. The Trust now owns both Saddell Castle and the newer Saddell House, and allows pedestrian access to the beach below at Saddell Bay. Kildonan Dun Kildonan Dun Interior of Kildonan Dun At the end of Saddell bay is Pluck Wood, and the remains of Kildonan Dun, a late Iron Age hillfort, dating from no earlier than 200BC, and made from Stone. In contrast to the mostly round Duns, it has a D-shaped ground plan, like Barsalloch Fort and Castle Haven, in Galloway. The Dun measures about within the outer two, one meter high and two meter thick ring wall. The impressive entrance with the well-recognizable door construction is located in the south- west. The double staircase on the rampart, located within the wall on the west side, and a round wall niche in the north east are intact. In form and design some novelties are shown, as occurred with Brochs in the same period. The excavation of Dun Kildonan between 1936 and 1938 resulted in a precise chronology. Objects from the 1st and 2nd centuries demonstrate the time of construction of the dun, while objects from the 6th and 9th to 12th century or from later times show that the central square also remained an important focus. The finds are located in the Campbeltown Museum. See also * Dippen Bay * Kildonald Bay * Saddell Bay References *Norman S.

She played a political role as a driving force within the Familia (political party). Life She was the daughter of magnate Kazimierz Czartoryski and Izabela El≈ºbieta Morsztyn. She was given a fashionable French-influenced education. She married Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski on 14 September 1720. The marriage was arranged by the assistance of Jakub Henryk Flemming as an alliance between the Poniatowski and Czartoryski family. After marriage, she frequently attended the royal court. Konstancja Czartoryska came to acquire a great influence within the family and be described as a driving force behind the political career of her spouse and her brothers. Through the connections she made at court, she could benefit the career of her brothers. She reportedly persuaded August Czartoryski to leave Imperial employ. At the interregnum and royal election after the death of king August II in 1733, Konstancja Czartoryska, alongside her mother and Zofia Czartoryski, are described as the most influential people in the Familia Party. The French ambassador initiated negotiations with her regarding the election of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski in connection to Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski and J√≥zef Potocki. In September 1733, she left Warsaw with her family and spent the War of the Polish Succession in Gda≈Ñsk. She is described as a serious person with an interest in education and politics and strongly devoted to her mother, and reportedly made sure that her children be given a good education, in contrast to what was often the case in contemporary Poland. In January 1736, she visited Koszalin and successfully persuaded Micha≈Ç Czartoryski to support August III as king. She returned permanently to Warsaw in 1739. Konstancja Czartoryska devoted a lot of her time to politics, mainly to secure the alliance between her and her husband's family as a united political party, and she is depicted in the diary of Stanis≈Çaw August as always attending the family meetings, where she was a driving force in the party's political policy; often supporting Micha≈Ç Czartoryski, but rephrasing his emotional outbursts and discussing the issues in a more constructive tone with August Czartoryski. In 1743, she was involved in the scandal when her son was Kazimierz challenged to a duel by Adam Tar≈Ça after having danced with Tarla's wife. After her son escaped the first duel unharmed, she allegedly told her son that she would rather see him dead than covered in shame. This led to the second duel, in which Tarla was killed in the famed Marymont-duel. In 1745, she resolved the conflict between Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski and Czerniak Stanis≈Çaws and Antoni Lubomirski. In 1752, the wife of the French ambassador, countess de Broglie, accused her of being behind the poisoning of L.A Duperron de Cast√©r and described her as a person capable of anything. In 1753, she called her son back from France and supported him being sent to Russia in cooperation with Ch. H. Williams. In 1755, she lost her political influence within the family political party because of her opposition to a Polish participation in the Seven Years' War and discord with her brothers, who no longer respected her opinions. The death of her mother caused her to fall in to depression and a greater interest in religion. In culture She was portrayed in a novel by Maria Derna≈Çowicz, \\"Portret Familia\\" (W. 1974).

However, it is still used by many governments. The subject of this article is the use of torture since the adoption of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which prohibited it. Torture in modern society Torture is widely practiced worldwide: Amnesty International received reports of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in more than 150 countries during the four-year period from 1997 to 2000. These accusations concerned acts against political prisoners in 70 countries and other prisoners and detainees in more than 130 countries.Amnesty International, Combating torture ‚Äì a manual for action , October 2002, p. 2. State torture has been extensively documented and studied, often as part of efforts at collective memory and reconciliation in societies that have experienced a change in government. Surveys of torture survivors reveal that torture \\"is not aimed primarily at the extraction of information ... Its real aim is to break down the victim's personality and identity.\\"Orlando Tizon, CovertAction Quarterly, Summer 2002. Tizon is assistant director of the Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition (TASSC) in Washington, D.C. When applied indiscriminately, torture is used as a tool of repression and deterrence against dissent and community empowerment. While many states use torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to international bodies. So a variety of strategies are used to circumvent their legal and humanitarian duties, including plausible deniability, secret police, \\"need to know\\", denial that certain activities constitute torture, appeal to various laws (national or international), use of a jurisdictional argument, claim of \\"overriding need\\", the use of torture by proxy, and so on.Amnesty International, End impunity: Justice for the victims of torture , 2001. Almost all regimes and governments engaging in torture (and other crimes against humanity) consistently deny engaging in it, in spite of overwhelming hearsay and physical evidence from the citizens they tortured. Through both denial and avoidance of prosecution, most people ordering or carrying out acts of torture do not face legal consequences for their actions. UN Special Rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights, Sir Nigel Rodley, believes that \\"impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of human rights violations and, in particular, torture.\\"Nigel Rodley, \\"Report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,\\" UN Document A/54/426, 1 October 1999. While states, particularly their prisons, law enforcement, military and intelligence apparatus, are major perpetrators of torture, many non-state actors also engage in it. These include paramilitaries and guerrillas, criminal actors such as organized crime syndicates and kidnappers. A recent approach to interrogations has been to use techniques such as waterboarding, sexual humiliation and sexual abuse, and dogs to intimidate or pressure prisoners in a manner claimed to be legal under national or international law. Electric shock techniques such as the use of stun belts and tasers have been considered appropriate provided that they are used to \\"control\\" prisoners or suspects, even non-violent ones, rather than to extract information. These techniques have been widely criticized as torture. Technology While methods of torture are often quite crude, a number of new technologies of control have been used by torturers in recent years. The Brazilian government devised a number of new electrical and mechanical means of torture during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985, and proceeded to train military officials from other right-wing Latin American countries in their techniques.Lawrence Weschler, A Miracle, A Universe: Settling Accounts with Torturers, 1990: 62‚Äì63. One is the use of tasers and electro-shock devices now widely sold to prison authorities around the world. Minor refinements of ancient techniques‚Äîincluding tearing out fingernails and toenails with iron tools, burning the soles of the feet with clothes irons, and probing between the toes with electric wood-burning pencils‚Äîare also widely applied. Some African nations employ an iron foot-squeezing device patterned after the medieval French boot. Inter-state collaboration A Viet Cong prisoner captured in 1967 by the U.S. Army awaits interrogation. He has been placed in a stress position by tying a board between his arms. Substantial cooperation between states in the methods and coordination of torture has been documented. Through the Phoenix Program, the United States helped South Vietnam co-ordinate a system of detention, torture and assassination of suspected members of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong. During the 1980s wars in Central America, the U.S. government provided manuals and training on interrogation that extended to the use of torture (see U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals). The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. The manuals have a chapter devoted to \\"coercive techniques\\". The southern cone governments of South America ‚Äì Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil ‚Äì involved in Operation Condor co-ordinated the disappearance, torture and execution of dissidents in the 1970s. Hundreds were killed in coordinated operations, and the bodies of those recovered were often mutilated and showed signs of torture. This system operated with the knowledge and support of the United States government through the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department.J. Patrice McSherry, \\"Operation Condor: Clandestine Inter-American System\\", Social Justice, Winter 1999 v26 i4. The United States government has, at least since the Bush administration, used the tactic of legal rendition in which suspected terrorists were extradited to countries where they were to be prosecuted for crimes allegedly committed. In the \\"war on terror\\" this has evolved into extraordinary rendition, the delivery of prisoners or others recently captured, including terrorism suspects, to foreign governments known to practice torture are Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Human rights activists have alleged that the practice amounts to kidnapping for the purpose of torture, or torture by proxy. A related practice is the operation of facilities for imprisonment, and it is widely believed torture, in foreign countries. In November 2005, the Washington Post reported ‚Äî- citing administration sources ‚Äî- that such facilities are operated by the CIA in Thailand (until 2004), Afghanistan, and several unnamed Eastern European countries.Dana Priest, \\"CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons\\", The Washington Post, 2 November 2005.

A review by Amnesty International, which did not use the United Nations Convention Against Torture as its definition of torture, of its case files found \\"reports of torture or ill-treatment by state officials in more than 150 countries from 1997 to 2000\\". These reports described widespread or persistent patterns of abuse in more than 70 countries and torture-related deaths in more than 80.\\"Denounce Torture\\" , Amnesty International. =Afghanistan= Torture has been reported in Afghanistan under each of its recent governments. Under Najibullah's Soviet-backed regime, beating and electric shocks were widely reported.Richard S. Ehrlich, \\"Psychiatric center treats victims of Afghanistan torture\\", The Washington Times, 11 April 1988. After the mujahidin victory, Afghanistan fell into a state of chaos, and, according to Amnesty International, \\"Torture of civilians in their homes has become endemic ... In almost every jail run by the armed political groups, torture is reported to be a part of the daily routine\\".\\"International responsibility for a human rights disaster\\" , Amnesty International, November 1995. > AI Index: ASA/11/09/95. The Taliban are likewise reported to have engaged in torture.Christina Lamb, \\"I was one of the Taliban's torturers: I crucified people\\", The Daily Telegraph, London, 30 September 2005. Since the U.S. overthrow of the Taliban, torture has been reported on several occasions, both by Afghan groups and by U.S. troops. In the Herat region, dominated by the warlord Ismail Khan, Human Rights Watch reported extensive torture in 2002.\\"Afghanistan: Torture and Political Repression in Herat\\", Human Rights Watch, 5 November 2002. Torture by US troops has been alleged in news reports by the New York Times.Tim Golden, \\"In U.S. Report, Brutal Details of 2 Afghan Inmates' Deaths\\", The New York Times, 20 May 2005. In March 2008 the UK Ministry of Defence claimed that they and the Afghan army had uncovered a Taliban torture chamber where two individuals were believed to have been beaten.\\"Coldstream Guards Find torture Chamber\\" , Ministry of Defence, 11 March 2008. =Albania= Under Enver Hoxha's People's Socialist Republic of Albania, torture was widely used by police and prison camp guards. Since the fall of communism, Amnesty International has reported police abuses amounting to torture; the government says it has \\"made efforts to punish all acts of torture under the Albanian criminal justice system\\". =Algeria= According to Pierre Vidal-Naquet in \\"Torture; Cancer of Democracy\\" and \\"Les Damnees de la Terre\\" by Franz Fanon, torture was practiced endemically by the French forces, commanded by General Jacques Massu, bringing together the experience of \\"Les Paras\\" in the Indo-China War and German troops in the French Foreign Legion. One of the most notorious methods was the geg√®ne, or generator, in which victims were tied down and electrocuted with a primitive device that delivered electric shocks to the genitalia. =Angola= In Angola's 27-year civil war, according to Amnesty International, \\"many were tortured\\" by both sides.\\"Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\", U.N. Commission on Human Rights.\\"Angola: A new cease-fire ‚Äì a new opportunity for human rights\\" , Amnesty International USA, AI Index AFR 12/002/2002 ‚Äì News Service Nr.60, 5 April 2002.

The National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons concluded: > In nearly all the cases brought to the attention of the Commission, the > victims speak of acts of torture. Torture was an important element in the > methodology of repression. Secret torture centres were set up, among other > reasons, to enable the carrying out of torture to be carried out > undisturbed. =Bahrain= Torture has been used frequently by the Bahraini government in the 20th century. Notable cases include that of Ian Henderson, a former colonial officer employed in Bahrain who was accused by multiple witnesses of torturing prisoners. Adel Flaifel, a notorious security officer identified by many detainees as having overseen torture, was given immunity under Royal Decree 56 of 2002. Between 1980 and 1998, nine people died in detention as a result of torture, with five more dying shortly after being released as a result of injuries sustained from torture. Reports released by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in the 1990s point to the widespread use of torture in Bahraini prisons. During the Bahraini uprising, torture was described by many human rights reports as widespread and systematic. Up to 1866 who make up 64% of detainees reported cases of torture. Three government agencies, namely the Ministry of Interior, the National Security Agency and the Bahrain Defence Force, were involved in interrogating detainees in relation to the events of the uprising. The NSA and MoI followed a systematic practice of physical and psychological mistreatment, which in many cases amounted to torture. Only four of the individuals who alleged torture were arrested by the BDF. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry have attributed the deaths of five individuals to torture. =Brazil= Torture was used regularly by the Brazilian dictatorship regime from 1964 to 1977 against dissidents. It included torturing their children, some of whom were less than 2 years old at the time. =Chile= The regime of Augusto Pinochet in Chile in the 1970s used torture extensively against political opponents. Chile's National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture (Comisi√≥n Nacional sobre Prisi√≥n Pol√≠tica y Tortura) concluded in 2004 that torture had been a systematically implemented policy of the government, and recommended reparations. The commission heard the testimony of more than 35,000 witnesses, whose testimonies are to be kept secret for fifty years.\\"Chile\\", Human Rights Watch World Report 2006. Among those tortured were future president Michelle Bachelet, who was held along with her mother at the notorious Villa Grimaldi detention center in the capital Santiago. =China= Although torture was outlawed in China in 1996, a UN investigator found torture to still be widespread in 2005, particularly because the narrow definition of the law, leaving a mark, does not comply with the UN definition.Jonathan Watts, \\"Torture still widespread in China, says UN investigator\\", The Guardian, London, 3 December 2005. =Cuba= People imprisoned by the communist regime are reportedly tortured. =East Germany= In the socialist German Democratic Republic of divided Germany, torture and inhumane and degrading treatment were systematically used by security forces, including the Stasi secret police, against suspected opponents of the regime. =France= During the Algerian War of Independence (1954‚Äì1962), the French military used torture against the National Liberation Front and the civilian population. The French interrogators were notorious for the use of man-powered electrical generators on suspects: this form of torture was called (la) g√©g√®ne. That France has provided a pivotal role in the evolution of western torture practices is the central thesis of the French film Death Squadrons: The French School by Monique Robin. The French had themselves developed practices in defence of its declining empire through the 20th century, setting up torture \\"universities\\" at Poulo Condor (now C√¥n S∆°n) ‚Äì an island off Vietnam (then French Indo-China, subsequently taken over by the United States) and at Philippeville (now Skikda) in Algeria. Police abuse remains a reality in France today, while France has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) for the conditions of detention in prisons, including the use of torture on detainees. Although the law and the Constitution prohibits any kind of torture, such practices happen. In 2004, the Inspector General of the National Police received 469 registered complaints about illegitimate police violence during the first 11 months of the year, down from 500 during the same period in 2003. There were 59 confirmed cases of police violence, compared to 65 in the previous year. In April 2004, the ECHR condemned the government for \\"inhumane and degrading treatments\\" in the 1997 case of a teenager beaten while in police custody. The court ordered the government to pay Giovanni Rivas $20,500 (15,000 euros) in damages and $13,500 (10,000 euros) in court costs.\\"2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in France\\", US Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The head of the police station in Saint-Denis, near Paris, has been forced to resign after allegations of rape and other violence committed by the police force under his orders. Nine investigations concerning police abuse in this police station were carried out in 2005 by the IGS inspection of police.\\"Viols, vols, violences: neuf enqu√™tes visent des policiers du commissariat de Saint-Denis\\", Le Monde, Paris, 9 September 2005. \\"Mais que fait la Police?\\" (What are the police up to?), Marianne, Paris, 14 September 2005. These repeated abuses are said to be one of the causes of the 2005 civil unrest.\\"Vies g√¢ch√©es dans les cit√©s\\", La Croix, Paris, 30 October 2005. Conditions in detention centers for illegal aliens have also been widely criticized by human rights NGOs. In 2006 a young 20-year-old Serbian girl accused a policeman of attempting to rape her in such a centre in Bobigny, in the suburbs of Paris, the year before.\\"Anita, expulsable, accuse un policier de tentative de viol\\", Lib√©ration, Paris, 9 August 2006. =Guatemala= During the Guatemalan civil war and the repression by the army against civilians and suspected opponents of the military dictatorship, murder (even genocide), torture, rape and inhumane and degrading treatment was systematically used by the Guatemalan armed forces and police. There is evidence that the CIA, in anticommunist campaigns during the 1980s, was involved in these tortures (in Latin America the threat of communism was often used as justification for dictatorship during the Cold War). Thousands of victims were tortured and murdered. For example, Dianna Ortiz, an American nun who was teaching poor Mayan children in the Guatemala highlands, claims that U.S. personnel were present in interrogation and torture rooms in Guatemala City in 1989 when she was kidnapped, taken to a secret prison and repeatedly raped and tortured by Guatemalan right-wing forces. Ortiz survived because of her American citizenship. Sister Ortiz chronicled her experiences and recovery in a book, The Blindfold's Eyes.Dianna Ortiz and Patricia Davis, The Blindfold's eyes: My journey from torture to truth, Maryknoll, New York, 2002. \\"There were other people in the clandestine cell, the clandestine prison, as well, and I could hear terrible screams. Many were killed. I saw some bodies. There were children, as well\\", wrote Dianna Ortiz. =India= India has not ratified the UN Convention against Torture. Custodial deaths and extrajudicial killings are on the rise. The Asian Centre for Human Rights released its report, Torture in India 2010, at a press conference in New Delhi. The report stated that, taking 2000 as the base year, custodial deaths have decreased by 41.66% government between 2004‚Äì2005 to 2007‚Äì2008. This includes 70.72% increase of deaths in prison and 12.60% increase while in police custody. The government has stated that it intends to pass the Anti Torture Act 2010 so it can ratify the UN convention against torture. The bill provides up to a 10-year sentence for physical or mental torture by the police. =Iran= Article 38 of the constitution of the Islamic Republic forbids \\"all forms of torture for the purpose of extracting confession or acquiring information\\" and the \\"compulsion of individuals to testify, confess, or take an oath.\\" It also states that \\"any testimony, confession, or oath obtained under duress is devoid of value and credence.\\"Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran The Islamic Republic itself vehemently denies the existence of torture by the government. Nonetheless, human rights groups and observers, such as Amnesty International, the United Nations, and Human Rights Watch, have complained that torture is frequently used on political prisoners in Iran.Amnesty International, Iran (London 1987)Amnesty International, Iran: Imprisonment, Torture, and Execution of Political Prisoners (New York, 1992)United Nations (Economic and Social Council), Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (New York, February 1990)United Nations (Economic and Social Council), Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran (New York, January 1994)Human Rights Watch, World Report: 1990 (New York, 1991) A substantial number of Iranians have been tortured and imprisoned by the religious police. Arya Aramnejad, a singer, was jailed for his song \\"Ali Barkhiz\\" where he denounces the Islamic regime's crimes during the 2009 Ashura protests. During his time in prison, he was reportedly tortured (sexually humiliated ‚Äì photographed naked, laughed at, obliged to walk barefooted on aids' patients blood). Farzad Kamangar was repeatedly tortured in prison. Amnesty International reports that Kamangar was repeatedly beaten, flogged, and electrocuted, and that he now suffers from spasms in his arms and legs as a result of the torture. After she died in the custody of Iranian officials, Zahra \\"Ziba\\" Kazemi-Ahmadabadi, an Iranian-Canadian freelance photographer, was found to show obvious signs of torture, including a skull fracture, broken nose, signs of rape and severe abdominal bruising.INDEPTH: ZAHRA KAZEMI \\"Iran's changing story\\" CBC News Online  Updated 16 November 2005.

The post-invasion Iraqi government holds thousands of people in prison. After investigating from July to October 2004, Human Rights Watch found that torture was \\"routine and commonplace.\\" According to their report, Despite apparently credible claims that people were fed into Saddam Hussein's plastic shredder (most likely within Abu Ghraib) prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, no such device was found after the war. In October 1990, it was alleged that Iraqi soldiers had \\"thrown babies from incubators\\" during the invasion of Kuwait. This story was supposed to have come from the 'eyewitness testimony' of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl, Nurse Nayirah. Years later it emerged that she was the daughter of Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah, Kuwait's ambassador to the United States, and that the story was the creation of the Hill & Knowlton public relations firm employed by the Kuwaitis.

State of Israel, 15 July 1999. that all torture - even moderate physical pressure - was illegal. This decision was praised by human-rights organizations. Despite this reform of the law, Amnesty International continued to express concerns to Israel about treatment which amounts to torture, and remained unhappy about the steps taken by Israel to eliminate torture. Amnesty International stated in 2002: The human rights group B'Tselem estimated that 85% of all Palestinian detainees suspected of terrorism were subject to prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged sight deprivation or sensory deprivation; forced, prolonged maintenance of body positions that grow increasingly painful; confinement in tiny, closet- like spaces; exposure to temperature extremes, such as in deliberately overcooled rooms; prolonged toilet and hygiene deprivation; and degrading treatment, such as forcing detainees to eat and use the toilet at the same time. Allegations have been made of frequent beatings. Such acts violate Article 16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In January 2000, B'Tselem claimed that the Israeli General Security Service's (GSS) methods of interrogation amounted to the five techniques: \\"[The] GSS used methods comparable to those used by the British in 1971, viz. sleep deprivation, infliction of physical suffering, and sensory isolation. But the GSS used them for much longer periods, so the resulting pain and suffering were substantially greater. In addition, the GSS used direct violence... Thus,... in practice, the GSS methods were substantially more severe than those used by the British in 1971...\\"B'Tselem, Legislation allowing for the use of physical force, January 2000, pp.32,48. =Kenya= Mau Mau inflicted torture and death on 1,819 Kikuyu during their uprising in the 1950s, along with 58 people of European and Asian descent. =Lebanon= Suspected Hezbollah guerrillas, their families and Lebanese civilian internees were previously detained in the South Lebanon Army (SLA) prison at Khiam in the then Israeli-occupied Southern Lebanon. Torture, including electric shock torture, by the SLA was routine. This was detailed after the end of the occupation in 2000, when Lebanese who freed the prisoners found instruments of torture.\\"Torture and ill-treatment: Israel's Interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories\\", Human Rights Watch, June 1994.\\"Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture: Israel. 18/05/98\\" by UNHCR Committee Against Torture, Twentieth session, 4‚Äì22 May 1998, A/53/44, paras.232‚Äì242. =Nigeria= In 2005, Human Rights Watch documented that Nigerian police in the cities of Enugu, Lagos and Kano routinely practice torture. Dozens of witnesses and survivors stepped forward to testify to repeated, severe beatings, abuse of sexual organs, rape, death threats, injury by shooting, and the denial of food and water. These abuses were used in campaigns against common crime.\\"Rest in Pieces: Police Torture and Deaths in Custody in Nigeria\\", Human Rights Watch, July 2005.

Political prisoners were often beaten, burned with irons, placed in stress positions, sexually abused, and subjected to electric shock, among other severe methods. = Portugal = During the Estado Novo in Portugal, the secret police is known to have used torture on political prisoners. Detainees were forced to remain standing for hours on end in a method called the \\"statue\\" (Portuguese: est√°tua), were kept in cramped, wet cells with no natural light, were beaten during trials, faced threats against themselves and their family members, or were forced to listen to the same music or sounds for extended periods of time. These practices were revealed in an inquiry and subsequent investigation and trial of secret police practices in 1957. = Romania = Under the communist regime of Georghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and later that of Nicolae Ceausescu, torture was often used against political and religious prisoners, including those incarcerated during the notorious Pitesti Experiment. =Russia= Excavation of Red Terror victims outside the headquarters of the Kharkov Cheka in Kharkov The Constitution of Russia forbids arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. Part 2 of Article 21 of the Constitution states that \\"no one may be subjected to torture, violence or any other harsh or humiliating treatment or punishment‚Ä¶\\". However Russian police are regularly observed practicing torture ‚Äì including beatings, electric shocks, rape, asphyxiation ‚Äì in interrogating arrested suspects.\\"UN Committee against Torture Must Get Commitments From Russia to Stop Torture\\", Human Rights Watch, 13 November 2006. Torture and humiliation, or dedovshchina, are also widespread in Russian's military, according to Human Rights Watch.\\"The Consequences of Dedovshchina\\", Human Rights Watch, 2004.

One of the most prevalent and effective types of torture was sleep deprivation, nicknamed \\"conveyor\\" due to interrogators replacing one another to keep the inmate from sleeping.Alexander Solzhenitsyn. \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\" The use of torture was authorized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and personally by Joseph Stalin.

Torture was still used after Stalin by the KGB but not on the same extent and level. =Spain= Torture was widespread against dissidents and those associated with them in the years that Francisco Franco ruled Spain. Such abuses continued into the 1970s and included severe beatings and waterboarding. The Spanish kingdom today categorically denies the existence of torture.Amnesty International, AI Report 2004 . However, the Spanish authorities consistently fail to implement recommendations by the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture to combat the use of torture in detention. The UN committee expressed its concern \\"about the length of judicial procedures and made reference to reports that indicated that five years had sometimes passed between crime and sentence. The Committee warned that this problem reduces the effect of penal action and discourages people to file complaints.\\" It further indicated that \\"all members of the Committee were also deeply concerned about the legal practice of five days incommunicado detention\\" (since October 2003, a reform of the Criminal Procedure Code has extended that period to a maximum of 13 days).Committee for the Prevention of Torture, \\"Spain\\", Council of Europe. =Syria= Torture has reportedly been used in the Adra Prison near Damascus. In 2010, the prison held 7,000 prisoners. The Tadmor Prison in Palmyra was known for harsh conditions, extensive human rights abuse, torture and summary executions. It was closed in 2001 and all remaining political detainees were transferred to other prisons in Syria. However, Tadmor Prison was reopened on 15 June 2011 and 350 individuals arrested for participation in anti-regime demonstrations were transferred there for interrogation and detainment. A number of captured Israelis have been tortured in Syria. This includes Eli Cohen, who was executed in 1965. In 1955, five Israeli soldiers were captured in a covert operation on the Golan Heights and brutally tortured in a Syrian prison.Syria returns the body of a soldier captured in Damascus , Israel Defense Forces One of the soldiers, Uri Ilan, committed suicide when falsely informed by his captors that his comrades had been killed.Syria returns the body of a soldier captured in Damascus , IDF Ilan became a symbol of courage and patriotism in Israel.

The video includes the man being tortured with a cattle prod to his genitals, sand in his mouth and being run over by a Mercedes SUV. A man in a UAE police uniform is seen on the tape tying the victim's arms and legs, and later holding him down. The official response of the UAE government was that Sheik Issa is the man shown in the video but he did nothing wrong. The incidents depicted in the videotapes were not part of a pattern of behaviour, the Ministry of the Interior said. =United Kingdom= Kenya During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, British colonial forces rounded up more than a million of Kikuyu people ‚Äî most of them innocent victims of collective punishment ‚Äî and imprisoned them in concentration camps in order to flush out the Mau Mau insurgency. In order to extract information about the insurgency and terrorize the enemy, the British used brutal methods to force Kenyans to confess and repudiate the Mau Mau oath. Under slogans like \\"labor and freedom\\" and other variations on \\"Arbeit macht frei,\\" inmates were worked to death as slave labor filling in mass graves under cruel conditions. Some men were anally raped with knives. Some women had their breasts mutilated and cut off. Eyes were gouged out and ears cut off and skin lacerated with coiled barbed wire. Interrogation involved stuffing a detainee's mouth with mud and stamping on his throat until he passed out or died. Survivors were sometimes burned alive, while British guards and interrogators took joy and laughed. British troops denying access to medical aid to the detainees were widespread. A former British officer described a British detention camp in Kenya in 1954: \\"Short rations, overwork, brutality, humiliating and disgusting treatment, flogging ‚Äî all in violation of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.\\" According to Canon Bewes, a British missionary, there was a \\"constant stream of reports of brutalities by police, military and home guards. Some of the people had been using castration instruments and two men had died under castration.\\" Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was Hussein Onyango Obama, the grandfather of U.S. President Barack Obama. According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated. One British settler described the typical British interrogation: On 22 November 1954, Colonel Arthur Young sent a letter to Governor Evelyn Baring about the \\"inhumanity\\" of various parts of the security forces amid his investigations of wrongdoing: In January 1955, Baring sent a telegram to Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and a cabinet minister, and told them that eight white European officers who had been accused of serious crimes, including accessory to murder, would be given immunity from prosecution. One district officer was accused of the \\"beating up and roasting alive of one African\\". A Kenyan Regiment Sergeant and a field intelligence assistance had been implicated in the burning of two further suspects \\"during screening operations\\". \\"I had not myself realised until today that the extension of the principle of clemency to all members of the security forces involved so many cases with Europeans as principals,\\" wrote Baring. In 1956, Baring's administration devised the \\"dilution technique\\" ‚Äî a system of assaults and psychological shocks to detainees, to force the compliance of the toughest Mau Mau supporters. Lennox-Boyd was told that one commander, Terrence Gavaghan, had developed the techniques at the Mwea camps in central Kenya - and he needed permission to treat the worst detainees in a \\"rough way\\". Baring telegrammed the Colonial Secretary in London asking for his approval to use \\"overpowering\\" force, and the cabinet minister's approval came within weeks. A ministerial delegation saw firsthand prisoners beaten for refusing to don camp clothes. Ringleaders of the \\"Mau Mau moan\\" - a chant of defiance - were singled out for special punishment. They were beaten and forced to the ground. Once there, a boot was placed on their throat while mud was forced into their mouths. Gavaghan also explained how difficult detainees would be subjected to the \\"third degree\\". \\"The measures adopted were to be kept awake all night, having water thrown at him and to be beaten up on a variety of pretexts.\\" One Hanslope Park document is a letter between Kenyan Special Branch police officers about treatment of \\"fanatical\\" detainees at the Mwea camps. In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is \\"distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia\\". Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, \\"vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys\\", and it was important that \\"those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate\\". He also agreed to draft legislation that sanctioned beatings, as long as the abuse was kept secret, and reminded the governor that \\"If we are going to sin,\\" he wrote, \\"we must sin quietly.\\" Northern Ireland During the Troubles, members of the British Army and the British security forces had routinely used torture on Irish Republican Army (IRA) suspects in Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. In 1971, as part of Operation Demetrius, fourteen arrested men were subjected to a programme of \\"deep interrogation\\" at a secret interrogation centre. The interrogation methods involved sensory deprivation and were referred to as the \\"Five Techniques\\". The European Court of Human Rights defined them as wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept hooded and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a stress position for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was severe pain, severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.The Guineapigs by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). Chapter 4: The Experiment.The Guineapigs by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). Chapter 6: Replay. The fourteen so-called \\"Hooded Men\\" were the only detainees subjected to all Five Techniques together.

These allegedly included waterboarding,\\"Prisoners in Northern Ireland 'subjected to waterboarding by British army officers'\\".

Details of the \\"deep interrogation\\" programme became known to the public, sparking outrage. In response, the British Government commissioned an inquiry, under Lord Parker, to look into the Five Techniques. In 1972 the Parker Report concluded that the Five Techniques were illegal under domestic law. British Prime Minister Edward Heath, then announced that the Five Techniques would no longer be used under his government. However, he said that if a future British government decided to reintroduce them, it would need to be approved by Parliament.Kelly, Tobias. This Side of Silence: Human Rights, Torture, and the Recognition of Cruelty. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011. pp.34-35 The Irish Government had begun international legal action against the British Government over the Hooded Men in 1971.

In 1978 it ruled that the programme amounted to \\"inhuman and degrading treatment\\" which breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to torture. In 2014, evidence emerged that the British Government had withheld information from the Court. Following these revelations, the Irish Government announced in December 2014 that it would be asking the Court to review its judgement and acknowledge the Five Techniques as torture.\\"State to apply to have 'Hooded Men' judgment revised by ECHR\\" (RT√â News);\\"Government asks European court to revise 'Hooded Men' ruling\\" (Irish Times); \\"Hooded Men: Irish government bid to reopen 'torture' case\\" (BBC News).

Police often raided homes without search warrants and individuals were imprisoned without evidence. While initially detained, individuals faced torture in instances of interrogation. Political police targeted, arrested, tortured and killed his opponents. Those who were attacked include future Venezuelan president R√≥mulo Betancourt, Jaime Lusinchi and Luis Herrera Campins. Lusinchi was jailed for two months in 1952 and was beaten with a sword. According to Human Rights Watch, the Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez administration also tortured and executed opponents with a judicial branch that largely ignored abuses by his government. The Caracas Metropolitan Police [es] and DISIP were used as tools to persecute dissenters. Following the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempts, a crackdown on alleged plotters resulted in accusations of torture by those arrested. During the Bolivarian Revolution, levels of torture occurred that had not been seen since the dictatorship of P√©rez Jim√©nez.\\"tatement of Santiago A.

When flying at sea level under International Standard Atmosphere conditions (15 ¬∞C, 1013 hPa, 0% humidity) calibrated airspeed is the same as equivalent airspeed (EAS) and true airspeed (TAS). If there is no wind it is also the same as ground speed (GS). Under any other conditions, CAS may differ from the aircraft's TAS and GS. Calibrated airspeed in knots is usually abbreviated as KCAS, while indicated airspeed is abbreviated as KIAS. In some applications, notably British usage, the expression rectified airspeed is used instead of calibrated airspeed.Clancy, L. J. (1975) Aerodynamics, pp 31, 32. Pitman Publishing Limited, London. Practical applications of CAS CAS has two primary applications in aviation: * for navigation, CAS is traditionally calculated as one of the steps between indicated airspeed and true airspeed; * for aircraft control, CAS (and EAS) are the primary reference points, since they describe the dynamic pressure acting on aircraft surfaces regardless of density, altitude, wind, and other conditions. EAS is used as a reference by aircraft designers, but EAS cannot be displayed correctly at varying altitudes by a simple (single capsule) airspeed indicator. CAS is therefore a standard for calibrating the airspeed indicator such that CAS equals EAS at sea level pressure and approximates EAS at higher altitudes. With the widespread use of GPS and other advanced navigation systems in cockpits, the first application is rapidly decreasing in importance - pilots are able to read groundspeed (and often true airspeed) directly, without calculating calibrated airspeed as an intermediate step. The second application remains critical, however - for example, at the same weight, an aircraft will rotate and climb at approximately the same calibrated airspeed at any elevation, even though the true airspeed and groundspeed may differ significantly. These V speeds are usually given as IAS rather than CAS, so that a pilot can read them directly from the airspeed indicator. Calculation from impact pressure Since the airspeed indicator capsule responds to impact pressure,Some authors in the field of compressible flows use the term dynamic pressure or compressible dynamic pressure instead of impact pressure. CAS is defined as a function of impact pressure alone. Static pressure and temperature appear as fixed coefficients defined by convention as standard sea level values. It so happens that the speed of sound is a direct function of temperature, so instead of a standard temperature, we can define a standard speed of sound. For subsonic speeds, CAS is calculated as: CAS=a_{0}\\\\sqrt{5\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{q_c}{P_{0}}+1\\\\right)^\\\\frac{2}{7}-1\\\\right]} where: * q_c = impact pressure * P_{0} = standard pressure at sea level * {a_{0}} is the standard speed of sound at 15 ¬∞C For supersonic airspeeds, where a normal shock forms in front of the pitot probe, the Rayleigh formula applies: CAS=a_{0}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{q_c}{P_{0}}+1\\\\right)\\\\times\\\\left(7\\\\left(\\\\frac{CAS}{a_{0}}\\\\right)^2-1\\\\right)^{2.5} / \\\\left(6^{2.5} \\\\times 1.2^{3.5} \\\\right) \\\\right]^{(1/7)} The supersonic formula must be solved iteratively, by assuming an initial value for CAS equal to a_{0}. These formulae work in any units provided the appropriate values for P_{0} and a_{0} are selected. For example, P_{0} = 1013.25 hPa, a_{0} = . The ratio of specific heats for air is assumed to be 1.4. These formulae can then be used to calibrate an airspeed indicator when impact pressure (q_c) is measured using a water manometer or accurate pressure gauge. If using a water manometer to measure millimeters of water the reference pressure (P_{0}) may be entered as 10333 mm H_20. At higher altitudes CAS can be corrected for compressibility error to give equivalent airspeed (EAS). In practice compressibility error is negligible below about and .

Along with Duntocher and Hardgate, Faifley falls within West Dunbartonshire's Kilpatrick ward with a combined population of 12,719 in 2011.Kilpatrick Ward - Area Profile, West Dunbartonshire Council Faifley has in past undergone many changes with many of the older housing removed, re- built or renovated. Faifley has two schools each with a corresponding church; Edinbarnet Primary (Non-Denominational) with the White Church and St Joseph's Primary(Roman Catholic) with St Joseph's church. At the heart of the community until now, was \\"Boabs\\", a community now business centre, when this was community centre also contained the Faifley Branch Library until it was closed in March 2011 by West Dunbartonshire Council. Faifley Library reopened on 6 December 2013 after a decision by West Dunbartonshire Council earlier that year. The Faifley Library is located at the rear of Edinbarnet Campus, off Craigpark Street, G81 5BS. History =Early history= In the transfers of land from the ownership from the Earls of Lennox to the Monks of Paisley Abbey in 1227 the area now called Faifley, was called Fimbalach, possibly meaning \\"The White Pass\\". In 1587 it becomes Ferchlay and by 1594, Fachla. The name originally referred to the area around Cochno Road, north of Hardgate and between the West (or Loch Humphrey) Burn and East (or Cochno) Burn. These two burns unite at the Hardgate Mill to become the Duntocher Burn. Evidence of man's prehistoric settlement in the area was found at Auchnacraig in 1887 when the Reverend James Harvey discovered the Druid (or Cochno) Stone. This sandstone rock, some in diameter, has notable \\"cup and ring\\" carvings. Smaller rocks with cup and ring marks are still visible in that area.Auchnacraig, Canmore Another prehistoric relic, the remains of the Cairnhowat burial cairn, can be seen north of the Cochno and Jaw Lochs. The most valuable lands near Faifley were the estates of Cochno, Edinbarnet and Law. Prior to the Reformation they were, like many Kilpatrick properties, transferred from the ownership of Paisley Abbey to the Hamilton family. Andrew Hamilton, Governor of Dumbarton Castle and Provost of Glasgow, acquired Cochno in 1550 but lost it after siding with Mary, Queen of Scots at the Battle of Langside in 1568. By 1592 the Crown had restored the estates to the Hamiltons. The present house was built in 1757 with additions in 1842. The Hamiltons owned Cochno until 1900 when Claud Hamilton Hamilton died. The estate and farm are now managed by the University of Glasgow Veterinary School. Edinbarnet and Law were acquired by Andrew Stirling from Stephen Spreull in 1569. The Stirling family held Edinbarnet until the estate was sold to Walter Mackenzie, who replaced the 1644 house with a new mansion in 1882. This was damaged by fire a few years later and rebuilt. Sir Robert Mackenzie inherited the estate in 1905. After his death in 1945, the house and most of the estate were sold by his son Neil to local farmer William Laird. In 1988 the house was converted into a nursing home. =Churches= Members of the congregation of Old Kilpatrick Parish Church left in 1777 to form a Burgher Secession congregation, which built a new church in 1781 at Kilpatrick Craigs at the foot of Cochno Road. The Burgher Secession congregation split again in 1799, resulting in the formation of the \\"auld lichts\\" and \\"new lichts\\", but they reunited some time after 1860 to form the Craigs and Duntocher United Free Church, worshipping at the church built by the \\"new lichts\\" at Old Street in Duntocher in 1822. =Industry= Faifley's first industries were attracted to the area by the opportunity to harness the water-power provided by the Loch Humphrey Burn and the Cochno Burn. A waulk mill (mentioned in charters of 1643) and a dye works were in existence when William Dunn (1760‚Äì1849) purchased the Faifley Cotton Spinning Co in 1811. Dunn had four large cotton mills on the burn and introduced the first steam engines at Faifley by 1836, at which time he was employing 1,400 workers. The American Civil War resulted in a collapse of Britain's cotton trade with the US in the 1860s and led to the closure of all but one of the mills. Faifley Mill was eventually converted to a furniture factory by Glasgow manufacturer Solomon Levy Abrahams (b. Zajac from Bialystok) (understood to have been the first to introduce mechanisation to furniture making in Scotland)and became known as the \\"Jew's Mill\\". The tenement on Cochno Road at the \\"Conkrey Dam\\" was called Abrahams' Land, or \\"The Jew's Laun'\\". The manufacture of furniture was continued by J K Arthur & Co, managed by a Mr Strump. After the Second World War, the premises were occupied by Dairyority, a small company making and repairing dairy and refrigeration equipment. The last owners were the bakers MacKechnie's Rolls, employing 150 people until the bakery closed in 1991 and the old mill buildings were demolished to make way for housing. Other small industries existed in Faifley. James Marr's Faifley Spade Forge survived on the West Burn until the 1880s. This may have been a remnant of the Dalnotter Iron Works founded a century before at Milton Mill. The mill lade can be seen behind Hillcrest Avenue. There was also a pottery and another forge on the Cochno Burn. =Housing= View over Faifley looking west (2008) The Clydebank Extension Act of 1949 permitted the annexation of the Faifley area and Clydebank Town Council began work on a new housing scheme in 1953, at Auchinleck Farm to the east of the village. The Jamiesons moved their dairy herd to Dumfries and the farmhouse became part of the Doublet public house in 1963. The Council also began constructing houses nearer to Hardgate and the Scottish Special Housing Association built high-density flats and terraces on the higher ground. Many four-story properties were built using new techniques with poured concrete and eventually the housing scheme had a population of more than 9,000 people. By the time Faifley Primary School was built, there were three pupils for every seat.Neighbourhoods: Faifley The Clydebank Story (archive version, 2007) Edinbarnet Primary School Edinbarnet Junior Secondary and Primary schools were built to the north of the scheme and the Roman Catholic school, St Joseph's Primary, built on Faifley Road. The Church of Scotland closed the Duntocher East Church in Hardgate in 1956, having built a replacement (\\"The White Church\\") on Faifley Road. A Community / Leisure centre (since demolished) was built in 1970 with aid from a German organisation as a gesture of friendship and reconciliation after the Clydebank Blitz. =Recent Times= Andy Scott In 1958, a deputation from the Faifley Tenants' Association lobbied the Scottish Office in Edinburgh complaining of the poor housing conditions and disparity in rents between Council and SSHA houses. The area suffered from poor amenities, remoteness and high unemployment. A {Kilpatrick Ward} Faifley-Hardgate-Duntocher Initiative was set up to try to resolve some of the problems. Much of the housing stock had developed faults due to poor construction methods and there have been many repair and renewal programmes. Many SSHA houses have been replaced by lower- density housing, reducing the population to about 4,000. The fall in population resulted in the closure of Faifley Primary, which in 2004 became a Library and Community Centre.

He has appeared on over 400 records.Josh Freese Discography, Discogs.com. 2010. In December 2010, Freese began touring with Paramore on their South American tour. In fall 2016 he returned to playing full-time with Sting whom he toured and recorded with in 2005. Early life Josh Freese was born on December 25, 1972, in Orlando, Florida, U.S.A. His father, Stan Freese, conducted the Disney World (Florida) and Disneyland (California) band, and his mother was a classical pianist. Freese began playing the drums when he was 8 years old. He started playing professionally at the age of 12 (in a primarily Top 40 band at Disneyland). He played electronic drums in the teen- and-tween rock band named Polo, a Junior Star Search winner. Polo already had a drummer before joining the Magic Kingdom, band founder Jimmy Keegan, but they found room on stage for the son of Disneyland's Director of Bands, Stan Freese. Other bands on the same stage were limited to performing Top 40 hits, but such constraints did not apply to Polo. The band recorded and released an eponymous EP that received some airplay on KROQ, the premier alternative music station in the Los Angeles area. The young Freese's familial connections and corresponding exposure led to an endorsement deal with the Simmons electronic drum company. There is an old Simmons commercial (directed by Mitch Brisker), featuring Freese on the additional content section of the Vandals' Live at the House of Blues DVD. At the age of 16, he left high school and started touring and making records, first with Dweezil Zappa and then with the Vandals. He has worked with many respected artists in the last 25 years, as a first call session drummer, band member and sometimes as a temporary replacement. Freese's younger brother, Jason Freese, plays keyboards in Green Day and has also recorded and toured with the Goo Goo Dolls, Dr. Dre, Jewel, Lenny Kravitz, Liz Phair, Foxboro Hot Tubs, Joe Walsh, and Weezer. Solo work =Early solo releases= In 1998, Freese recorded a number of songs that he wrote and performed himself (including bass, guitar, keyboards and vocals). The result is the lo-fi, 6-song EP Destroy Earth As Soon As Possible, released under the name 'Princess' by T.O.N/Stone Lizard Records. In 2000, the songs \\"Caffeine and Vaseline\\" and \\"Rock N' Roll Chicken\\" were revived for the 12-song album The Notorious One Man Orgy, this time released under Freese's own name by Kung Fu Records. Guest appearances include Stone Gossard, Warren Fitzgerald, Michael Ward, Lyle Workman, and Freese's brother Jason. =Since 1972 (2009)= Josh released his second solo album, Since 1972, via his website on March 24, 2009. Since 1972 was distributed similarly to the value- added packages offered by Nine Inch Nails's recent releases. Freese's album was offered as a $7 digital download, and a $15 CD/DVD on his website. As a marketing stunt, the website offers unique incentive packages at prices up to $75,000. Publications covering the offer include SuicideGirls, The UK's The Guardian, NPR, and Boston Herald. Freese states on his purchase page for the album: \\"I'm not expecting to sell any of those ridiculously priced packages but I sure did get a lot of good press and attention to the fact that I'm putting out a record because of it! Mission accomplished.\\" Work history Freese started his drumming career in a Top 40 cover band at the Tomorrowland Terrace Stage at Disneyland from 1985 to 1988. Freese has since been a member of punk rock band the Vandals since 1989, and has played on all the band's albums since then, with the exception of 2000's Look What I Almost Stepped In..., on which current Avenged Sevenfold drummer Brooks Wackerman was deputised due to Freese's commitments with A Perfect Circle. In 2004, the Vandals released a live DVD as part of Kung Fu Records' The Show Must Go Off! series. The DVD is of particular interest to Josh Freese fans thanks to the inclusion of the Josh Freese-cam, a camera focused on Freese for the entire duration of the show, also including a picture-in-picture of Freese's kick drum pedal. Freese with the Vandals in 2011.Freese played on the Infectious Grooves album \\"Sarsippius' Ark and on the Suicidal Tendencies album The Art of Rebellion in 1992. He played on the Korean group Seo Taiji and Boys' 1994 and 1995 albums Seo Taiji and Boys III and Seo Taiji and Boys IV. He was a member of Guns N' Roses from 1997 to 1999, replacing Matt Sorum and signing a 2-year contract. He recorded the song \\"Oh My God\\" for the End of Days soundtrack and co-wrote the song \\"Chinese Democracy\\" with Axl Rose. Freese drummed on 30 tracks to potentially be included on Chinese Democracy, but his recordings were scrapped and re-recorded note-for-note by Bryan Mantia. He was credited with arrangements on four tracks on the final release of the album. He left the band in 2000 to launch A Perfect Circle with Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howerdel. In 1996, Freese joined a reformed Devo for a show at the Sundance Film Festival, replacing David Kendrick. Freese has become their primary drummer in concert and in the studio since. Freese has said that he learned to play drums thanks to Devo's 1980 album Freedom of Choice. Freese played drums on Devo's 2010 album Something for Everybody, and provided backing vocals on Devo's non-album holiday song, \\"Merry Something to You\\". In 1999, Freese drummed on Mike Ness' first solo album Cheating At Solitaire, but was replaced by Charlie Quintana when it came to live performances. In 2011, he drummed on Social Distortion's seventh studio album Hard Times And Nursery Rhymes. After the album's release, David Hidalgo Jr. became Social Distortion's current full-time drummer Freese was the session drummer on the 2003 album Fallen by Evanescence and on the Acroma album released on Universal Records. He has drummed for A Perfect Circle since their first album, and is considered one of the core members. As of 2006, the band is on hiatus. Since then, founder Billy Howerdel has started up a new band (Ashes Divide) with drums contributed by Freese. Freese took over from drummer Ron Welty for the recording of the Offspring's 2003 album Splinter after Welty's departure from the band. He is credited for playing drums on the album, but Atom Willard later took on the position as the band's full-time drummer. In July 2007, it was announced Atom Willard had left the band. He would be replaced by Pete Parada. In the meantime, Freese was called upon to record the new Offspring album, Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace. In January 2011, he mentioned on his website that he was working with the Offspring again on their next album Days Go By. Freese (center) alongside his Sublime with Rome bandmates. Freese participated in Sting's \\"Broken Music Tour\\" in April 2005 with guitarist Dominic Miller and guitarist Shane Fontayne. The tour kicked off April 1 in San Jose, California and ended on May 14 in New York. Josh also appeared with Sting during the record breaking 'Live 8' concert in London's Hyde Park on July 2, 2005. In fall of 2005 he recorded new material with Sting in Italy at the singer's Tuscany estate but plans for release have yet to be set. Freese contributed drum tracks for Lostprophets' third album, Liberation Transmission, recording all his parts in two days. Travis Barker was originally earmarked as the session drummer of choice for the album, but producer Bob Rock, who had worked with Freese before, wanted him instead. Freese has worked on and off with Paul Westerberg since 1992 and provided the drums on two Replacements tracks, that appear on their greatest-hits package, \\"Don't You Know Who I Think I Was\\". Freese toured with Nine Inch Nails on their 2005‚Äì06 With Teeth winter arena and summer amphitheater tours after the illness of drummer Jerome Dillon. He contributed live drum tracks to the songs \\"Hyperpower!\\" and \\"Capital G\\" on the Nine Inch Nails album Year zero, released in 2007. Freese continued touring with Nine Inch Nails throughout 2007 in support of Year Zero, mainly outside of the U.S. In 2008, he worked with Trent Reznor in the studio on The Slip and signed on for more extensive North American and overseas touring with the band through 2008 on their \\"Lights in the Sky\\" 2008 tour. He left the tour at the end of 2008 in order to spend more time with his family and long-time girlfriend, who was pregnant with the couple's third child at the time. Freese also completed drum tracks for the band Black Light Burns, which consists of Wes Borland (Limp Bizkit, Big Dumb Face, From First to Last), Danny Lohner (Nine Inch Nails) and Josh Eustis (Telefon Tel Aviv). He also played on Rebel Hiss which is the first single from Jubilee headed by ex-bandmate (and ex lead guitarist for Nine Inch Nails) Aaron North on guitar and vocals. He has co-written songs with Queens of the Stone Age, the Vandals, A Perfect Circle, Dwarves, Goon Moon, Devo and Sting. He played on drums for a small selection of Hollywood Undead songs on their debut album, Swan Songs. He also played some shows in early 1998 with the band 311 as a fill-in drummer for them on the Warped tour in Australia, Japan and Hawaii. Chad Sexton, 311's drummer had broken a hand just before a show in Australia early in the tour. Freese was already on the tour playing with the Vandals every day and played with both bands for the majority of the tour. Freese filled in for an injured Claude Coleman, Jr. on Ween's 2003 album Quebec. Freese performed the drums on Daughtry's debut album by the same title, Daughtry. Freese performed with Weezer in their support of Blink-182's 2009 tour, as Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson played guitar for 90% of Weezer's set. Freese continued to tour with Weezer in 2010 and 2011 as well as appearing live with Sting, the Vandals and Devo. Freese also played drums on Japanese Mega-star Ayumi Hamasaki's 2009 album NEXT LEVEL, on the track \\"identity\\". Freese can also be heard on the Weezer release Raditude and on Michael Bubl√©'s tracks \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\". On August 3, 2010, Josh Freese posted via Facebook \\"I'm happy to report that A Perfect Circle is waking up from its 6-year slumber...and we're going to be 'doing stuff' soon.\\" Freese toured in 2012 with Sublime with Rome after Bud Gaugh announced his departure from the band. In 2011, Freese became the touring drummer for Paramore on the South American leg of their Brand New Eyes World Tour after the band announced the departure of the Farro brothers (Zac and Josh). On October 2, 2012, Freese announced via his Twitter page: \\"After 13 years, I've decided to leave A Perfect Circle with no plans of returning.\\" He played drums with the Replacements in August and September 2013 as the Replacements played their first gigs in 22 years (Riot Fest 2013). Freese continued playing in the Replacements in their 2014 and 2015 shows. He appears on the 2014 Bruce Springsteen album High Hopes, playing drums on \\"This Is Your Sword\\". Personal life Freese lives in Southern California with his wife and their four children. Equipment In a 2007 Guitar Center interview, Freese stated: \\"My set up never gets that crazy or out of the ordinary I don't think. You can pretty much always count on starting off with the basic Ringo 4 piece set up and add from there. With the Vandals that's all I use. With Devo add a second rack tom. With NIN keep only 1 rack but have 2 floors and a 3rd floor off to the left of my hi-hat (with NIN the drums are all about 2 inches bigger than I normally would use... 14 rack. 24 kick, 18 and 20-inch floors... 16 off the side of my hihat). With A Perfect Circle 2 racks and 2 floors, 2nd snare off the left of my hihat... more cymbals with APC too. With Sting there are 3 racks but smaller sizes and only 1 floor. Never too many cymbals (except with APC I guess). In the studio my drums are usually something really basic a 4, 5, or 6 piece kit with lots of snare and cymbal choices.\\" Discography Solo discography *Destroy Earth As Soon As Possible (1998, as \\"Princess\\") *The Notorious One Man Orgy (2000) *Since 1972 (2009) *My New Friends (2011) References  External links  * * \\"Interview with Josh Freese\\" ‚Äì I'd Hit That (podcast, 2013) ‚Äì via Internet Archive Category:1972 births Category:20th-century American drummers Category:21st-century American drummers Category:A Perfect Circle members Category:American male drummers Category:American punk rock drummers Category:American rock drummers Category:American session musicians Category:Black Light Burns members Category:Devo members Category:Guns N' Roses members Category:Living people Category:Magnapop members Category:Musicians from Orlando, Florida Category:Nine Inch Nails members Category:Seether members Category:Social Distortion members Category:Songwriters from Florida Category:The Damning Well members Category:The Vandals members Category:Viva Death members ","title":"Josh Freese"},{"id":"1129465","text":"Basil Thompson (1937‚Äì2004) was a ballet dancer, master, and teacher.

First-person refers to the view where the players see the world from the eyes of their characters. Shooter refers to games which revolve primarily around wielding firearms and killing other entities in the game world, either non- player characters or other players. The development of the FPS graphic engines is characterized by a steady increase in technologies, with some breakthroughs. Attempts at defining distinct generations lead to arbitrary choices of what constitutes a highly modified version of an 'old engine' and what is a new engine. The classification is complicated as game engines blend old and new technologies. Features considered advanced in a new game one year, become the expected standard the next year. Games with a combination of both older and newer features are the norm. For example, Jurassic Park: Trespasser (1998) introduced physics to the FPS genre, which did not become common until around 2002. Red Faction (2001) featured a destructible environment, something still not common in engines years later. Timeline A diagram showing the history of FPS engines = 1970s and 1980s: Early FPS graphics engines = Game rendering for this early generation of FPS were already from the first- person perspective and with the need to shoot things, however they were mostly made up using Vector graphics. There are two possible claimants for the first FPS, Maze War and Spasim. Maze War was developed in 1973 and involved a single player making his way through a maze of corridors rendered using a fixed perspective. Multiplayer capabilities, where players attempted to shoot each other, were added later and were networked in 1974. Spasim was originally developed in 1974 and involved players moving through a wire-frame 3D universe. Spasim could be played by up to 32 players on the PLATO network. Developed in-house by Incentive Software, the Freescape engine is considered to be one of the first proprietary 3D engines to be used for computer games, although the engine was not used commercially outside of Incentive's own titles. The first game to use this engine was the puzzle game Driller in 1987. =Early 1990s: Wireframes to 2.5D worlds and textures= Games of this generation are often regarded as Doom clones. They were not capable of full 3D rendering, but used ray casting 2.5D techniques to draw the environment and sprites to draw enemies instead of 3D models. However these games began to use textures to render the environment instead of simple wire-frame models or solid colors. Hovertank 3D, from id Software, was the first to use this technique in 1990, but was still not using textures, a capability which was added shortly after on Catacomb 3D (1991), then with the Wolfenstein 3D engine which was later used for several other games. Catacomb 3D was also the first game to show the player's hand on-screen, furthering the implication of the player into the character's role. Wolfenstein 3D engine was still very primitive. It did not apply textures to the floor and ceiling, and the ray casting restricted walls to a fixed height, and levels were all on the same plane. Even though it was still not using true 3D, id Tech 1, first used in Doom (1993) and again from id Software, removed these limitations. It also first introduced the concept of binary space partitioning (BSP). Another breakthrough was the introduction of multiplayer abilities in the engine. However, because it was still using 2.5D, it was impossible to look up and down properly in Doom, and all Doom levels were actually two-dimensional. Due to the lack of a z-axis, the engine did not allow for room-over-room support. Doom's success spawned several games using the same engine or similar techniques, giving them the name Doom clones. The Build engine, used in Duke Nukem 3D (1996), later removed some of the limitations of id Tech 1, such as the Build engine being able to have support for room-over-room by stacking sectors on top of sectors, however the techniques used remained the same. =Mid 1990s: 3D models, beginnings of hardware acceleration= In the mid-1990s, game engines recreated true 3D worlds with arbitrary level geometry. Instead of sprites the engines used simply textured (single-pass texturing, no lighting details) polygonal objects. FromSoftware released King's Field, a full polygon free roaming first-person real-time action title for the Sony PlayStation in December 1994. Sega's 32X release Metal Head was a first-person shooter mecha simulation game that used fully texture-mapped, 3D polygonal graphics. A year prior, Exact released the Sharp X68000 computer game Geograph Seal, a fully 3D polygonal first-person shooter that employed platform game mechanics and had most of the action take place in free-roaming outdoor environments rather than the corridor labyrinths of Wolfenstein 3D. The following year, Exact released its successor for the PlayStation console, Jumping Flash!, which used the same game engine but adapted it to place more emphasis on the platforming rather than the shooting. The Jumping Flash! series continued to use the same engine.Geograph Seal (X68000), The Next Level Dark Forces, released in 1995 by LucasArts, has been regarded as one of the first \\"true 3-D\\" first-person shooter games. Its engine, the Jedi Engine, was one of the first engines to support an environment in three dimensions: areas can exist next to each other in all three planes, including on top of each other (such as stories in a building). Though most of the objects in Dark Forces are sprites, the game does include support for textured 3D-rendered objects. Another game regarded as one of the first true 3D first-person shooter is Parallax Software's 1994 shooter Descent. The Quake engine (Quake, 1996) used fewer animated sprites and used true 3D geometry and lighting, using elaborate techniques such as z-buffering to speed up the rendering. Quake was also the first true-3D game to use a special map design system to preprocess and pre-render the 3D environment: the 3D environment in which the game took place (referred for the first time as a Map) was simplified during the creation of the map to reduce the processing required when playing the game. Static lightmaps and 3D light sources were also added in the BSP files storing the levels, allowing for more realistic lighting. The first Graphics processing unitslike Voodoo, Voodoo 2, or Riva TNT, or later the more powerful DirectX 6.0 chipsets such as Voodoo3, RIVA TNT2 and Rage 128 appeared in the late 1990s, but many games still supported software rendering at that time. id Tech 2 (Quake II, 1997) was one of the first games to take advantage of hardware accelerated graphics (id Software later reworked Quake to add OpenGL support to the game). GoldSrc, the engine derived from the Quake engine by Valve for Half-Life (1998), added Direct3D support, and a skeletal framework to better render the NPCs, and also greatly improved the NPCs artificial intelligence (AI) compared to the Quake engine. =Late 1990s: Full 32-bit color, and GPUs become standard= This period saw the introduction of the first video cards with Transform, clipping, and lighting (T&L;). The first card with this innovative technology was the GeForce 256. This card was superior to what 3dfx had to offer at the time, namely Voodoo3, which only fell short because the lack of T&L.; Companies such as Matrox with their G400, and S3 with their Savage4 were forced to withdraw from the 3D gaming market during this time period. One year later, ATI released their Radeon 7200, a true competing graphics card line. While all games of this period supported 16-bit color, many were adopting 32-bit color (really 24-bit color with an 8-bit alpha channel) as well. Soon, many benchmark sites began touting 32-bit as a standard. The Unreal Engine, used in a large number of FPS games since its release, was an important milestone at the time. It used the Glide API, specifically developed for 3dfx GPUs, instead of OpenGL. Probably the biggest reason for its popularity was that the engine architecture and the inclusion of a scripting language made it easy to mod it. One other improvement of Unreal compared to the previous generation of engines was its networking technology, which greatly improved the scalability of the engine on multiplayer. id Tech 3, first used for Quake III Arena, improved from its predecessor by allowing to store much more complex and smoother animations. It also had improved lighting and shadowing and introduced shaders and curved surfaces. =Early 2000s: Increasing detail, outdoor environments, and rag- doll physics= New graphics hardware provided new capabilities, allowing new engines to add various new effects, such as particle effects or fog, as well as increase texture and polygon detail. Many games featured large outdoor environments, vehicles, and rag-doll physics. Average Video Hardware requirements: a GPU with hardware T&L; such as the DirectX 7.0 GeForce 2 or Radeon 7200 was typically required. The next-generation GeForce 3 or Radeon 8500 were recommended due to their more efficient architecture, though their DirectX 8.0 vertex and pixel shaders were of little use. A handful of games still supported DirectX 6.0 chipsets such as RIVA TNT2 and Rage 128, and software rendering (with an integrated Intel GMA), though this was apparent that even a powerful CPU could not compensate for the lack of hardware T&L.; Games engines originally developed for the PC platform, like the Unreal Engine 2.0, started to be adapted for sixth generation consoles like PlayStation 2 or GameCube, those now having the computer power to handle graphic-intensive video games. =Mid 2000s: Lighting and pixel shaders, physics= The new generation of graphics chips allowed pixel shader-based textures, bump mapping, and lighting and shadowing technologies to become common. Shader technologies included HLSL (for DirectX), GLSL (for OpenGL), or Cg. This resulted in the obsolescence of DirectX 7.0 graphics chips such as the widespread GeForce 2 and Radeon 7200, as well as DirectX 6.0 chipsets such as RIVA TNT2 and Rage 128, and integrated on-board graphics accelerators. Until this generation of games, a powerful CPU was able to somewhat compensate for an older video card. Average Video Hardware requirements: minimum was a GeForce 3 or Radeon 8500, strongly recommended was the GeForce FX, Radeon 9700 (or other cards with Pixel shader 2.x support). The Radeon 9700 demonstrated that anti-aliasing (AA) and/or anisotropic filtering (AF) could be fully usable options, even in the newest and most demanding titles at the time, and resulted in the widespread acceptance of AA and AF as standard features. AA and AF had been supported by many earlier graphics chips prior to this but carried a heavy performance hit and so most gamers opted not to enable these features. With these new technologies game engines featured seamlessly integrated indoor/outdoor environments, used shaders for more realistic animations (characters, water, weather effects, etc.), and generally increased realism. The fact that the GPU performed some of the tasks that were already done by the CPU, and more generally the increasing processing power available, allowed to add realistic physics effects to the games, for example with the inclusion of the Havok physics engine in most video games. Physics had been already added in a video game in 1998 with Jurassic Park: Trespasser, but limited hardware capabilities at the time, and the absence of a middleware like Havok to handle physics had made it a technical and commercial failure. id Tech 4, first used for Doom 3 (2004), used an entirely dynamic per-pixel lighting, whereas previously, 3D engines had relied primarily on pre- calculated per-vertex lighting or lightmaps and Gouraud shading. The Shadow volume approach used in Doom 3 permitted more realistic lighting and shadows, however this came at a price as it could not render soft shadows, and the engine was primarily good indoors. Later this was rectified to work with vast outdoor spaces, with the introduction of MegaTexture technology in the id Tech 4 engine. The same year, Valve released Half-Life 2, powered by their new Source engine. This new engine was notable in that, among other things, it had very realistic facial animations for NPCs, including what was described as an impressive lip-syncing technology. =Late 2000s: The approach to Photorealism= Further improvements in GPUs like Shader Model 3 and Shader Model 4, made possible by new graphic chipsets as GeForce 7 or Radeon X1xxx series, allowed for improvements in graphic effects. Developers of this era of 3D engines often tout their increasingly photorealistic quality. Around the same time, esports we're beginning to gain attention. These engines include realistic shader-based materials with predefined physics, environments with procedural and vertex shader-based objects (vegetation, debris, human-made objects such as books or tools), procedural animation, cinematographic effects (depth of field, motion blur, etc.), High dynamic range rendering, and unified lighting models with soft shadowing and volumetric lighting. However, most of engines capable of these effects are evolutions of engines from the previous generation, such as Unreal Engine 3, the Dunia Engine and CryEngine 2, id Tech 5 (which was used with Rage and makes use of the new Virtual Texturing technology). The first games using Unreal Engine 3 were released in November 2006, and the first game to use CryEngine 2 (Crysis) was released in 2007. =Early 2010s: Graphic technique mixes= Further improvements in GPUs like Shader Model 5, made possible by new graphic chipsets as GeForce 400 Series or Radeon HD 5000 series and later, allowed for improvements in graphic effects. such as Dynamic Displacement Mapping and Tessellation. As of 2010, two upcoming evolutions of major existing engines had been released: Unreal Engine 3 in DirectX 11 which powered Samaritan Demo (and which is used with Batman: Arkham City, Batman: Arkham Knight and more DX11 based UE3 games) and CryEngine 3, which powers Crysis 2 and Crysis 3. Few companies had discussed future plans for their engines; id Tech 6, the eventual successor to id Tech 5, was an exception. Preliminary information about this engine which was still in early phases of development tended to show that id Software was looking toward a direction where ray tracing and classic raster graphics would be mixed. However, according to John Carmack, the hardware capable of id Tech 6 did not yet exist. The first title using the engine, Doom, was released in mid 2016. In September 2015, Valve released the Source 2 in an update to Dota 2.

History There has been a manor house at Kingston since the late 14th century, replaced in the late 16th century with a manor house which is still in the grounds. The present mansion was built by George Pitt (1663-1735) of Stratfield Saye House, cousin of William Pitt the Elder, between 1717 and 1720 on the estate brought to him by his second wife Lora daughter of Audley Grey. The mansion was in red brick, but after derogatory comments from King George III, Pitt clad the house in Portland limestone. The building faces south, and has a projecting central section. The north facade is similar in design with the addition of a 20th- century porch. Much of the house is now used by Kingston Maurward College, though some of it is used for private functions. In 2016, the house was flooded after a pipe burst above the house's main hall. The consultants brought in to assess the damage discovered that the room had been redecorated and was designed to use white and stone to accent the mouldings. The discovery lead to a restoration to its original form. Grounds and gardens A statue of Excalibur, King Arthur's legendary sword, at Kingston Maurward The grounds of Kingston Maurward, which are used for the land-based college, are open to the public and include the farm areas and extensive gardens. Both the house and grounds are owned by Kingston Maurward College. Also in the grounds is Kingston Maurward Manor House, built in 1590, an earlier mansion which was narrowly saved from demolition when the estate was acquired. Following refurbishment it is a private residence. The gardens are Grade II* listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Overview It comes from the Spanish word socio which means business partner or buddy, and is a pun on the official government policy of socialismo (socialism). It is analogous to the blat of the Soviet Union or the term combina in Israel. It is a form of corruption in Cuba. The term is particularly associated with the black market economy, and perceived cronyism in Cuba's state controlled command economy. Socios can be black market operators who \\"facilitate\\" (steal) goods that are officially reserved for the state. They can also get someone a job or obtain paperwork. The system is used by anyone who needs to send an e-mail or print a resume but does not have a computer, or needs paint or cement but has no access to an Office Store or Home Improvement Store. Gary Marx, the Chicago Tribune's Havana correspondent, reports the system works this way: Cubans send out signals they need something, make telephone calls and visit neighbors and friends to find the right person who can get things in motion. Few people own cars and the buses, or camellos, are slow and overcrowded; many Cubans spend hours each day arranging rides to get to work, school or accomplish a task.Getting one's way on an isle of want; Could be a friend of a friend, a couple of bucks, maybe a bag of coffee by Gary Marx, Chicago Tribune, November 13, 2004; NEWS; ZONE CN; LETTER FROM HAVANA; Pg. 2 People often must reach out and secure what they need por fuera (\\"through the outside\\") or por la izquierda (\\"through the left\\"), slang terms that mean \\"outside the official system\\". The system has different levels and obligations. Friends, neighbors and relatives do favors for each other without expecting anything in return. But with lesser-known acquaintances, exchange is more normal for such things as shampoo, a piece of chicken, fruit, or cash. Sometimes the favors extend to hundreds of people. Employees of a state company in Pinar del R√≠o were given special treatment at a local hospital in exchange for paper, pens and other scarce materials and services. \\"Sociolismo\\" lets any person with control over some resource exchange access to the resource for some current or future personal material benefit. Complex networks of reciprocal obligations thus became an important part of the functioning of the Cuban economy. Daily life involves maintaining the personal relationships necessary to ensure access to necessary goods and services, through unofficial channels, or through official channels but by unofficial means. Though the term became prominent during the economic downturn known as the Special Period in Cuba, usage has continued into the mid-2000s.Cuba's Underground Economy Aspects of Cuban sociolismo were exported to the United States via Cuban immigrants, who relied on friends and relatives in their new country for help in finding jobs, since they were not able to verify their skills or employment in Cuba. This was particularly prevalent in the largest Cuban-American community, in Florida.New York Times abstract of Dan Williams article in the Miami Herald, September 1, 1980; Section 4; Page 1, Column 1 See also *Economy of Cuba *Rationing in Cuba *Informal economy *Blat (similar Phenomenon in Russia) *Guanxi (similar Phenomenon in China) *System D (a similar concept of informality from European French).

History The business was established when a cloth mill, known as Avon Mill, on the banks of the River Avon at Limpley Stoke, which had been producing timber but had later diversified into rubber goods, was acquired by Messrs E G Browne and J C Margetson in 1885. dry diving suit label Avon wellington boot markings By 1890 the business had transferred to premises in Melksham and was named The Avon India Rubber Company Limited. Products at this time included solid tyres, conveyor belts and components for railways. By 1900, pneumatic tyres for bicycles were being produced, and by 1906 the first car tyres were advertised. The company acquired the Sirdar Rubber Works at Greenland Mill in Bradford on Avon in 1915. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1933. It acquired the rival company of George Spencer Moulton in 1956, bringing with it Abbey Mills and Kingston Mills in Bradford on Avon, and a jointly owned plant in Paris.

In 1994 the Llanelli-based marine business Avon Inflatables was split-off and sold; it subsequently became a division of Zodiac Marine, France. In 1997 the Avon Tyres business was sold to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company of Findlay, Ohio in the United States, leaving the company to concentrate on its core businesses of automotive components, technical products and protective equipment. In March 2000, Avon moved its activities at a manufacturing and head office facility at Hampton Park West, south of Melksham. In June 2005, Avon purchased International Safety Instruments, Inc., based in Lawrenceville, Georgia, USA. Avon-ISI is a manufacturer of SCBA, APR, and thermal imaging systems for fire, law enforcement and industrial applications. In August 2006, the Avon Automotive division was sold to a US-based management team and became a separate entity called Avon Automotive Holdings Inc.; this was the largest buy-out in the company's history. The aerosol division was sold for ¬£1.75 million in March 2008 to Avon Group (an unrelated Bristol-based company), enabling Avon Rubber to concentrate on its core protective equipment, dairy and extrusions markets.

Career The band was named after The Amen Corner, a weekly disc spin at the Victoria Ballroom (later to become The Scene Club) in Cardiff, Wales, where every Sunday night Dr. Rock would play soul music from the United States. Initially they specialised in a blues and jazz-oriented style, but were steered by their record labels towards a more commercial sound. Their first singles and album appeared on Decca's subsidiary label, Deram ‚Äì see \\"Discography\\" below ‚Äì but they left at the end of 1968 to join Immediate, where they were instantly rewarded with a No. 1, \\"(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice\\" in early 1969, followed by another Top 5 entry with the Roy Wood composition, \\"Hello Susie\\". After recording a final studio album, Farewell to the Real Magnificent Seven, with a cover version of the Beatles' \\"Get Back\\" released as their swansong, they disbanded at the end of 1969. The band also appeared as themselves in the 1969 horror film, Scream and Scream Again, singing the film's eponymous theme song. Whilst saxophone player Allan Jones went on to form Judas Jump, guitarist and vocalist Andy Fairweather Low led Dennis Bryon (drums), Blue Weaver (organ), Clive Taylor (bass) and Neil Jones (guitar) into a new band, Fair Weather. The band scored a UK No. 6 hit with \\"Natural Sinner\\" in 1970 and recorded one album before disbanding after Weaver left to join The Strawbs a year later. Fairweather Low went on to a successful solo career in the 1970s, notably with the Top 10 hit \\"Wide Eyed and Legless\\" (1975); he became a regular player with Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Roger Waters. Weaver joined The Strawbs as Rick Wakeman's replacement and later after a successful 1974 tour with Mott the Hoople, went on to join the Bee Gees, where Dennis Bryon was now the drummer. Weaver also played keyboards for many artists as a session player and later Fairlight programmer. Amen Corner's Decca back catalogue has been re-issued as part of the \\"Collection\\" series; and their Immediate work, including their singles, live album and material recorded for an unreleased studio album, has been released on If Paradise Was Half as Nice: The Immediate Anthology.

At school he only learned Classical, but at home he taught himself to play Funk related music like Parliament, Funkadelic and The Gap Band on his digital keyboard. Interested in making music, he would create beats and record his own versions for fun. Banks would later record tapes with his friend, Oakland rapper MC Ant, and sell them at their high school out the trunk of their cars. With the lyrics handled by MC Ant and the production by Ant Banks, buzz over the tapes eventually reached the streets, resulting in popularity throughout the city. In 1987, Banks recorded the debut album by MC Ant titled The Great, which was later released in 1989 through Raw Dog Records. In 1989, he recorded the debut album Let It Be Known by East Bay rapper Spice 1, which was later released in 1991 through Triad Records. Along with the releases of Pooh-Man and Dangerous Dame, Banks managed to sell in the range of 100,000 to 300,000 units with all four albums, without a record label or promotion. This turned him into a prominent figure in the Bay Area hip-hop scene by the early '90s. He has produced songs for Too Short,url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Too_Short/Biography/ title=Too Short Biography publisher=Starpulse.com date=  accessdate=November 22 2011 E-40, Spice 1, Snoop Dogg and 3X Krazy to name a few. In 1993, he engaged in a beef with Oakland rapper Pooh-Man. In 1996, Banks appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, America Is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as \\"a masterpiece\\" by The Source magazine. In 1999 Banks started a group T.W.D.Y. (acronym for \\"The Whole Damn Yay\\"). Banks himself, Rappin' 4-Tay and Captain Save'm were the original members. Their debut album Derty Werk was released in 1999 and contained the single \\"Players Holiday\\", featuring Too Short, Mac Mall, Otis & Shug. The single received a lot of radio play. Also, Ant Banks settled his long time beef with Pooh-Man when they appeared together on the track, \\"Ride Wit Me\\". In 2000, T.W.D.Y. released their second and final album Lead the Way; Ant Banks and Captain Save'm remained while Dolla Will replaced Rappin' 4-Tay. He is also known as \\"The Big Badass\\" and released an album of the same name in 1994. His talent for producing \\"funky\\" bass lines are well known and have achieved cross-over appreciation in the techno niche. The album liner for Daft Punk's album Homework gives a note of appreciation to Ant Banks for inspiration.

The present house dates from the late 17th century but in 1730 was clad in a white Georgian stone facade. The house was restored in 1913, and at the same time the gardens were laid out. Location The house is on land which was granted to the Russell family (previously thought not ancestors of the Russell Dukes of Bedford),See Scott-Thomson, Gladys,F.R.H.S. Two Centuries of Family History, London, 1930 (being a study of the Bedford Russell early pedigree) by an early king, probably King John (1199‚Äì1216) at the end of his reign, or his son Henry III. Kingston Russell manor is now part of Long Bredy parish, but earlier appears to have had its own church. The main part of the manor adjoins Winterbourne Abbas to the east and Compton Valence to the north, whilst the house itself adjoins Long Bredy. It is situated in an area known for ancient tumuli and the Kingston Russell Stone Circle. The Poor Lot barrow group forms a boundary with Littlebredy and Winterbourne Abbas. Toponymy The Victoria County History of the County of Dorset (1908) notes that Little Bredy, of which Kingston Russell is a part, may have been the borough of Brydian in the Saxon period. It goes on to say that if Little Bredy is indeed the borough of Brydian then \\"It was ... important as guarding the one gap in the downs which connects south-east with south-west Dorset.\\" The Russell family Maurice Russell (1356-1416) of Dyrham and Kingston Russell and first wife Isabel Childrey. Rubbing from funerary brass at Dyrham Church. Note Russell armourials in small escutcheon in gable of canopy Kingston Russell takes the second part of its name from the Russell family who were granted the manor for their service to the King. The manor was held in-chief from the King by Grand Serjeanty, the particular service performed for the King was originally as Marshal of the Buttery, as the entry in the Book of Fees dated 1211 records for the Hundred of \\"Alvredesberge\\" (since dissolved), Dorset: The serjeanty changed during the minority of King Henry III to the counting of the King's chessman and storing them away after a game.The keeper of the royal chessmen function is mentioned in an inquisition in the 3rd year of the reign of Edward III (c. 1329) after the death of Nichola, the wife of Nicholas de Morteshorn who held the manor from Sir William Russell (d. 1310/11) for the term of her life. John Russell of Kingston Russell was a household knight of King Richard I from at the latest 1195Church, pp. 18/19 then also of his brother King John and then of his infant son King Henry III, of whose household he became steward.Church, S. D. The Household Knights of King John, Cambridge, 1999 In the capacity of Household Knight he acted as part of the backbone of the king's army, as a temporary castellan, sheriff, diplomatChurch, p. 36 and general trouble-shooter. He thus served as Constable of Sherborne Castle, and Governor of Corfe Castle, both in Dorset. He undertook an important diplomatic assignment in 1220 to recover Princess Joan, infant sister of Henry III, from the court of Hugh X of Lusignan to whom she had been betrothed and by whom then rejected. Russell died in 1224. He married Rose Bardolph, da. of Thomas Bardolph and widow of Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of the large barony of Berry Pomeroy in Devon, consisting of 32 knight's fees. The marriage to this widow of a tenant-in-chief was likely to have been a reward from the king for Russell's services, and brought Russell a life- interest in her large dower lands. John Russell was granted as a further royal mark of gratitude the marriage of one of the heiresses of James de Newmarch, feudal baron of North Cadbury, who had died in 1216 without male heir, leaving 2 infant heiresses, whose marriages became the property of the king by feudal custom. The wardship of the eldest daughter Isabelle was granted by King John to John Russell, who married her to his eldest surviving (3rd.) son Ralph, the marriage of the other daughter Hawise having been acquired by John de Bottrell/Bottreux. The Newmarch lands were thus split in half, one moiety consisting of nearly 17 knight's fees,Church, p. 138 in Gloucestershire (including Dyrham), Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire and Berkshire going to the Russells,Livery of Isabel's lands being granted to Ralph Russell in 8 Henry III (1224) per Burkes Armorials 1884, p.879, Russell. with the second half, including the caput of North Cadbury, being confirmed to Bottrell by Henry III in 1218, per the Close Rolls. Sir Ralph Russell continued to hold Kingston Russell from Henry III by Grand Serjeanty, viz \\"that he should present a cup of beer to our Sovereign Lord the King on the 4 principal feasts of the year\\"Burkes Armorials, 1884. p. 879, Russell. Sir Ralph Russell and Isabel's heir was Sir William Russell (1257‚Äì1311), Constable of Carisbrook Castle, Isle of Wight. He married Katherine de Aula, heiress of Yaverland, Isle of Wight (and possibly later Jane Peverell). On 12 July 1284 William was granted by King Edward I (1272-1307) a market and free warren as the following entry in the Charter Rolls records: William died before his son and heir Theobald (1301‚Äì1340) had reached his majority of 21, and the infant Theobald was granted in wardship to Ralph III de Gorges, 1st Baron Gorges (d.1224) of Knighton, Isle of Wight and Wraxall, Somerset. Gorges married off the young Theobald to his 2nd daughter Eleanor. Gorge's son, Ralph IV, 2nd. Baron Gorges, found himself without his own male heir, with only three sisters as heiresses to his ancient and noble line. He thus made his nephew Theobald II Russell his heir, apparently with the provision that he should change his name to Gorges, bear the ancient Gorges armorials and inherit the bulk of the Gorges lands, including Wraxall, Somerset, 6 miles west of Bristol. Theobald Russell \\"Gorges\\" thus established a new line of Gorges at Wraxall, where the family became well established (see Sir Ferdinando Gorges). The eldest son of Theobald and Eleanor was Ralph (1319‚Äì1375), the second son being Theobald, who duly adopted the name Gorges and inherited his mother's lands at Wraxall and Bradpole, Dorset. Ralph his elder brother had as his heir Sir Maurice Russell (c.1352-1416) of Dyrham, Gloucestershire. To the latter, whose funerary brass can be seen at Dyrham Church, descended Kingston Russell, the manor and hundred of Redhove (Redhone) and Beminster Forum (Beaminster) in the manor of Bradpole, as well as the manor of Dyrham, Gloucestershire and Horsington, Somerset. By his first wife Isabel Childrey he had two daughters who on the death of his son Thomas in 1432 from his second marriage to Joan Dauntsey, became his co-heiresses. Margaret Russell (d. 1466) the eldest daughter had married firstly her father's neighbour Sir Gilbert Denys of Siston and thus Kingston Russell and Dyrham passed to the Denys family. The Denyses appear never to have lived at Kingston Russell. Heritage of Dukes of Bedford Recent research by Ancestry.com shows that Sir Theobald Russell (b. 1301) in North Cadbury, Somerset, England, and died (1340) was a direct ancestor of John Russell the first Earl of Bedford. Sir Theobald married Eleanor de Gorges on 1318. They had six children, Ralph (b. 1319), William (b. 1321), Theobald (b. 1323), John (b. 1325) Richard (b. 1327) and Elizabeth (b. 1330). Eleanor de Gorges was born on 1302 in Wraxall, Somerset, England, and died 1332/1333 on the Isle of Wight, Hampshire, England. Sir Theobald Russell married Eleanor de la Tour (b. 1313 in Berwick, Dorset, England) in 1334. They had one child, William (b. 1335). William married NN. de Muschamp on 1362 in Kingston- Russell, Dorset. NN. de Muschamp the daughter and heiress of Muschamp was born in 1342 at Kingston Russell. They had one son Henry Russell born in 1363 at Kingston Russell. Henry Russell married NN. Godfrey in 1389 and their son John Russell (born in 1390) was the grandfather of a later John Russell, the first Earl of Bedford. Denys monumental brass, 1505, Olveston Church. The arms of Russell of Kingston Russell are blazoned at top right: On a chief three bezants Arms of Russell of Dyrham & Kingston Russell Modern times =Early modern period= At some point possibly around the 1640s, part of the manor, including the house, came into the possession of the Michel family, who partly rebuilt the seventeenth century Kingston Russell House as it still stands today at the end of a long driveway. The Michel family also owned Dewlish House in Dewlish, Dorset and removed there sometime during the 1760s when the house was then let. Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet, Nelson's flag captain, was born at Kingston Russell on 5 April 1769, his mother being the daughter of Thomas Masterman of this place. Victorian and Edwardian eras At some time before 1861 the Dukes of Bedford bought Kingston Russell for a second time, and when Lord John Russell (1792‚Äì1878) the prominent Liberal statesman, 3rd son of the 6th Duke of Bedford, was raised to the peerage as an earl on 30 July 1861, he chose the title Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, which title is still extant (the famous philosopher Bertrand Russell was the third earl of this title). In 1877, the famous American historian, John Lothrop Motley, author of 'The Rise of the Dutch Republic', died at Kingston Russell. By the turn of the twentieth century however, the house was in a dilapidated condition and the estate was sold in 1913 to George Gribble. He and his wife Norah Royds had previously renovated Henlow Grange. The new owners - with architect Philip Tilden, who later worked for Winston Churchill - demolished a stub wing from the older Tudor building, extended the Carolean/Georgian wing by the addition of two small three-storey wings at either end of the original two-storey structure, and laid out the gardens. Their son Julian Royds Gribble won the Victoria Cross in the First World War, but died in a prisoner of war camp in 1918; the village hall was constructed as a gift to the village, in memory of him. The Gribble family moved away in the 1920s. Present day Since then, the house has had a number of different owners. Since 1984 it has been owned by Dr H. H. J. Carter & Miss T. Silkstone, who are the longest continuous owner-occupiers of the house since the 1760s. The house is not open to the public, though it has welcomed visitors from bodies such as the Georgian Group. Chapel of St. James A small chapel dedicated to St. James once stood nearby. It is reputed to have been built by the Russells and was financed by them through tithes and the glebe in Pitcombe. The last rector of the chapel was Roger Bond who was appointed to it, along with Little Bredy in 1531. The inhabitants then used the church at Long Bredy for burials. After its closure it was leased variously. In 1565 it was granted to Edith Cole, widow and John and Joan Martin, her children for their lives. It was then granted to John, Henry and William Mintern for their lives from 1585, then in 1605 to Fenton, esq. captain of the guard, and 1607 to George Ward. The chapel of St James then came to the Mellers of Little Bredy who sold the tithes and part of the glebe to the Michels. By this time the chapel was in ruins and in John Hutchins's time only the walls remained. During the time of the Michels residence of the manor, according to Hutchins, it was inhabited by poor people. References Sources * Scott-Thomson, Gladys,F.R.H.S.

Operation From its head office in Traction House, Motherwell, Central Scottish had an operating area covering the whole of Lanarkshire, bounded by Glasgow to the west, Airdrie to the north, Strathaven to the south and Shotts to the east. Central was the largest operator in central Scotland and was responsible for local and interurban services in the towns of East Kilbride, Airdrie, Motherwell, Wishaw and Hamilton. Depots were also located in these towns. Central Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink work, mainly from Glasgow and central Scotland to other points in Scotland. History Scottish Motor Traction (SMT) was founded in Edinburgh in 1905, and expanded rapidly. After World War I, this expansion included the acquisition of bus companies operating in other parts of Scotland. In 1928 SMT was purchased by the London, Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) and the London & North Eastern Railway, and became the parent company for railway-owned bus operations in Scotland. Central SMT was a product of this series of acquisitions and mergers. In 1926 the Glasgow General Omnibus and Motor Services Ltd. was formed. This company, which traded as the 'Glasgow Omnibus Company' (GOC) developed a network of bus services radiating out from Glasgow into Lanarkshire, as well as an isolated group of services along the north bank of the River Clyde to western Dunbartonshire. In 1930, GOC was purchased by the LMS. In the same year, the LMS. also purchased two further major Lanarkshire bus firms, Stewart and McDonald of Carluke, and JW & R Torrance of Hamilton. Several smaller firms were subsequently purchased and absorbed by these companies. In 1932, control of the LMS' bus interests in Scotland was vested in the SMT Group. The three Lanarkshire firms were merged into one new company, named the Central SMT Company Ltd. At the same time, the SMT Group purchased the Lanarkshire Traction Company Ltd., of Motherwell. Lanarkshire Traction, which had originally been a tramway operator, became a subsidiary of Central SMT. The head office of both companies was the former Lanarkshire Traction premises at Traction House, Motherwell. Throughout the 1930s, Central purchased and absorbed numerous smaller companies, notable amongst which were Baillie Brothers of Dumbarton and Clydebank Motors of Clydebank. These two firms were acquired in 1936, which strengthened the company's position in western Dunbartonshire. Nationalisation of the railways in 1948 made the state the major shareholder in the SMT group of companies, and the group was itself fully nationalised in 1949. At that time, some of the group's smaller subsidiaries were wound up, including Lanarkshire Traction, which was fully absorbed by Central SMT. By this time, Central was firmly established as the dominant bus operator in Lanarkshire and western Dunbartonshire. This dominant position was furthered by the takeover of John Laurie and Company of Hamilton in 1961. During this period, Central was consistently the most profitable company in the Scottish Bus Group. From the late 1970s, the trading name of the company became 'Central Scottish'. In preparation for deregulation of the bus industry in 1986, and the eventual break up and privatisation of the group, the Scottish Bus Group restructured its subsidiary companies in 1985. As part of this, Central SMT was renamed Central Scottish Omnibuses. The Dunbartonshire and north Glasgow operations became part of a new company, Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses., but Central gained the former Eastern Scottish operations in the Monklands area of Lanarkshire. On deregulation Central, together with fellow SBG subsidiaries Clydeside Scottish and Kelvin Scottish, launched a revised network of services within the city of Glasgow in direct competition with the city operator, Strathclyde Buses. A high profile, high frequency cross city service, together with a number of minibus services were started, though Strathclyde Buses retaliated by extending their own network deep into Lanarkshire. Whereas Strathclyde Buses services into East Kilbride and beyond proved popular at Central's expense, Central's city services failed to gain popularity and often ran empty. In the face of growing competition, it was announced that Central Scottish would be merged with Kelvin Scottish in an attempt to make the larger company more attractive to potential buyers. However, the planned merger was deeply unpopular with Central's staff, as flexible rostering agreements, fully in place with Kelvin, had not yet been implemented at Central. This resulted in a disastrous strike in early 1989, and the company's network was paralysed for weeks on end. While Central's buses remained in their depots, Strathclyde Buses and a number of independent operators stepped in and took over much of the company's route network. By summer 1989, the dispute had ended, and in a vain attempt to win back customers, Central embarked on a major rebranding exercise. The Central Scottish trading name and the deep red and cream livery the vehicles wore gave way to a number of new local identities. Vehicles in Airdrie received a dark blue and grey colour scheme branded as Monklands Bus, East Kilbride vehicles gained a dark green and cream livery with EK Chieftain fleetnames, leaving vehicles in the remaining depots gaining a more vibrant red and cream livery, branded as Lanarkshire Bus. The Central Scottish identity was buried with the strike action, and the company was renamed Kelvin Central Buses in preparation for the merger. However, a significant retrenchment of the company's operations followed. In July 1989, the merger between the two companies was fully enacted, and Central Scottish ceased trading as an independent concern. Kelvin Central Buses was later privatised by sale to its employees, who later sold the firm to Strathclyde Buses, before it in turn was purchased by First Glasgow. However, many of the former Central routes have been surrendered to independent operators. The last remaining former Central garage, Airbles in Motherwell, closed in 2007. Depots and Works Central SMT and Central Scottish operated from the following depots: * Airbles depot, Motherwell (opened 1962, closed by First Glasgow 2007 when replaced by a new facility in Blantyre); * Burnbank depot, Hamilton (closed 1962, replaced by Airbles) * Carluke depot (closed in 1976) * Clarkston depot, Airdrie (ex Scottish Omnibuses in 1985, closed by First Glasgow); * Clydesdale depot, Hamilton (closed April 1988) * East Kilbride (original small depot replaced by a new depot in 1956, once SBG's most profitable depot, but closed by Kelvin Central Buses in December 1990); * Gavinburn depot, Old Kilpatrick (opened 1936 to replace various small outstations, passed to Kelvin Scottish 1985, closed by Kelvin Central Buses May 1996) * Harthill depot (closed in 1962 as part of a minor re-organisation of services between Central SMT and Scottish Omnibuses); * Muirkirk depot (a small outstation of Carluke, closed in the 1970s) * Traction House, Motherwell (replaced as depot by neighbouring Airbles in 1962, but retained as head office and central works. Closed by Kelvin Central Buses); * Wishaw (closed by Kelvin Central Buses December 1990) The Fleet At its formation in 1932, Central SMT inherited a varied collection of vehicles. However, Leyland quickly became the preferred supplier for new buses. Although there were also some Albions, new buses purchased in the 1930s mainly comprised Leyland Lion, Tiger and Titan models, including a number of secondhand Titans. During World War II, when Leylands were not available, the fleet received a rare (for Scotland) Bristol K, as well as the ubiquitous utility Guy Arabs and Daimler CWs. Between the end of the war and the early 1960s, Central overwhelmingly favoured double deckers. Some pre-war Leyland Tigers were rebodied as such in the late 1940s (notably including some 3-axle Tiger TS7T chassis which were rebuilt to 2-axle Titan TD4 specification). New Leyland Titans continued to be bought until 1960, but the first Bristol Lodekkas arrived in 1955 and soon became the preferred choice, the last new examples being delivered in 1967. Other double deckers bought in this period were a solitary AEC Regent in 1946, some Guy Arab IIIs in 1951-52, and Albion Lowlanders in 1962-63. The takeover of Laurie of Hamilton brought an assortment of Leyland Titans (including former London Transport RTLs), and a rebodied Guy Arab, but most notable were a pair of early Leyland Atlanteans. These were the first rear-engined double deckers to operate for the Scottish Bus Group. Central tried various types, of rear engined double deckers, but found that none were to their satisfaction, and double deckers declined as a proportion of the fleet. The Atlanteans were sold in 1969, and a prototype Bristol VRX, operated from 1966, was returned to the manufacturer when a batch of 20 Bristol VRTs arrived, also in 1969. The VRT was not popular in Scottish Bus Group fleets, and all were sold to the National Bus Company in exchange for late-model Lodekkas in the early 1970s. A batch of 35 Daimler Fleetlines was delivered in 1971, but these were exchanged for single deck Leyland Leopards from other SBG companies in 1975. However, Volvo Ailsa B55s (30 purchased in 1978-79) and Dennis Dominators (51 in 1978-83) eventually found favour. When Central inherited Scottish Omnibuses' Airdrie operations in 1985, the Fleetlines and Leyland Olympians based there were not wanted by Central and were retained by Eastern Scottish. However, the last double deckers purchased by Central were in fact 10 Leyland Olympians, delivered in 1986. Relatively few single deckers were purchased in the 1940s and 1950s. There were Leyland Tigers and Guy Arab IIIs in the late 1940s/early 1950s, followed by some Guy Arab UFs. The first Leyland Leopards first arrived in 1961, but a milestone was the delivery of the first batch of Leopard PSU3 models in 1964. With 53 seats, a standee Leopard had almost as many seats as an early-postwar double decker, and they quickly became the standard Central SMT bus. By 1983 some 400 Leopards had been purchased new, as well as a number of secondhand examples from within the SBG. After the Leopards, Central standardised on the Leyland Tiger, with 83 buses delivered between 1982 and 1987. There were also 45 Leyland Nationals in 1978-81 and 15 Dennis Dorchesters in 1983-84. Additional Leyland Nationals and some Seddon Pennine 7s were inherited with Airdrie depot. A small dedicated coach fleet was maintained intermittently. Between 1955 until 1978 Bedfords with Duple coachwork were bought (along with five Albion Vikings in 1966, which were quickly transferred to Highland Omnibuses). The last Bedfords were sold in the early '80s, and for a time there were no coaches. However, in 1984 a secondhand Leyland Tiger coach and a former Western SMT Seddon Pennine 7 which had been fitted with a wheelchair lift arrived, and five of the Dennis Dorchesters delivered that year were to coach specification. A second Leyland Tiger coach was inherited from Scottish Omnibuses' Airdrie fleet, and some of the Airdrie Seddons also had coach bodywork. Two Volvo B10Ms were acquired from Newton of Dingwall in 1985, and 10 new Tigers coaches were bought in 1986-87. A few minibuses were operated from the early 1970s onwards. These were successively Bedford VAS, Ford A-series and Leyland Cubs. In 1986-87, a fleet of 31 Dodge S56s were purchased for competitive services in the south of Glasgow. Even within the Scottish Bus Group, Central had a reputation for conservatism in its vehicle specifications. Examples of this included: * the specification of cutaway rear entrances on some of the underfloor-engined Guy Arab UFs, when front or central entrances were far more common for such buses; * the continued purchase of PD1 model Leyland Titans after most other operators had switched to the more advanced PD2, and later of PD2 models when other SBG subsidiaries had gone over to the larger PD3 model; * the early disposal of successive models of rear-engined double-deckers in the 1960s and 1970s; * continuing to specify manual synchromesh gearboxes on its Leyland Leopards until 1979, by which time automatic gearboxes were the norm across most of the UK bus industry.

The company operated until May 1989, when it was remerged with Western Scottish, the successor company to Western SMT. Operation From its head office in Paisley, Clydeside Scottish covered an operating area bounded by Largs in the south, the River Clyde to the north and the south side of Glasgow to the east. The company also operated services on the Isle of Bute. It was the largest operator in Inverclyde and Renfrewshire and had depots in Rothesay, Largs, Greenock, Johnstone, Inchinnan, Paisley and Thornliebank in the south of Glasgow. Its fleet numbered 334 buses when formed. Clydeside Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink services between Gourock, Glasgow Airport, Glasgow and onward to Edinburgh. History Clydeside Scottish was one of the shortest lived of the \\"new\\" Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, lasting shortly under four years as a stand-alone company. Clydeside was created in preparation for the deregulation of the British bus industry in 1986, and eventual privatisation of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group (SBG). A bright red and yellow livery was introduced for the fleet, and a fleet name displayed in a style different from the corporate SBG look.Jenkinson p.12 On deregulation, the company launched a network of services in the city of Glasgow, competing against the city operator Strathclyde Buses. A large number of two-person operated open- platform AEC Routemaster buses were purchased from London Transport for these services, which gave the company the advantage of giving change (as opposed to the exact fare the city operator demanded) without the buses having to linger at bus stops. The Routemasters operated on services into Paisley, Renfrew and Johnstone. Strathclyde Buses retaliated against the competition, however, by introducing routes beyond the city boundary and into Clydeside's operating territory.Jenkinson p.188-22 A number of innovative marketing initiatives were introduced including ticketing, advertising, staff motivation and production of a story book \\"Rodney The Routemaster comes to Town\\" aimed at children. While competing with the much larger Strathclyde Buses, Clydeside suffered an explosion of new operators in Paisley and in particular, Greenock. Clydeside found it increasingly difficult to compete against so many operators with much smaller operating costs. In May 1989 it was merged with Western Scottish. The Clydeside name was retained by Western as a trading name, but its red and yellow livery was replaced by Western black, white and red.Jenkinson p44 Successor companies The former Clydeside operations, with the exception of those on Bute, passed to a new company, Clydeside 2000 plc, on the privatisation of Western Scottish in October 1991. Clydeside's new management and employees took a 76% stake in the new company, with Luton & District purchasing the remainder. The company scaled down its Glasgow operations, and the depots at Largs, Thornliebank and Paisley closed in the following three years. Clydeside 2000 was taken over by British Bus in November 1994 (Luton & District had become part of British Bus a few months earlier); British Bus was subsequently acquired by the Cowie Group, later to become Arriva. Clydeside was renamed Arriva Scotland West, trading at the time as Arriva serving Scotland. Arriva expanded its Scottish operations with the purchase of McGill's Bus Service of Barrhead and Ashton Coaches of Greenock, although the Greenock operations of Arriva Scotland West were later demerged and sold to local management as McGill's Bus Services. In December 2011 it was announced that Arriva had agreed a deal to sell its remaining Scottish operations to McGill's. The sale was completed in March 2012.

Eastern Scottish was formed in June 1985 from the main part of Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., which had itself traded as 'Eastern Scottish' since the 1960s. Following privatisation in 1990 the company traded as 'SMT' reviving the original name of the company (Scottish Motor Traction). It operated until 1994, when it became part of GRT Bus Group plc. Operation From its head office on New Street, Edinburgh, Eastern Scottish had an operating area throughout the Lothians, in the east of Scotland, bounded by the Firth of Forth to the north and east, Fauldhouse in the west, and Gorebridge (Birkenside) in the south. Eastern operated urban, interurban and rural services in and around Bathgate, Livingston, Dalkeith and Musselburgh, and services within the city of Edinburgh. Depots were also located in these towns. Eastern was also active in the coaching business, operating day tours and private hires, as well as providing coaches for Scottish Citylink express from Edinburgh to Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness, London and many other locations throughout Scotland and England. History The Scottish Motor Traction Company Ltd. (trading as \\"SMT\\") was formed in 1905, and expanded quickly through a series of takeovers to become the principal bus operator in south east Scotland. By the 1930s SMT was also the parent company of the SMT Group, whose other subsidiaries operated buses elsewhere in Scotland. In 1949 the SMT Group's bus operations were nationalised by transfer to a new British Transport Commission subsidiary, Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., although the SMT name remained in use until the early 1960s in the east, and was retained even longer in the Western SMT and Central SMT operating units of the Scottish Bus Group. Subsequently, \\"Scottish Omnibuses\\", \\"Scottish\\", and then \\"Eastern Scottish\\" fleetnames were used. The SMT name remained in Edinburgh parlance long after the change of fleet name, and survived on an unrelated car dealership showroom on Lothian Road, Edinburgh. The original 1964 'Eastern Scottish' fleetname, pictured in 2009 on the off-side of preserved 1973 Leyland Leopard ZH537 (BSG 537L). The 'Z' in the fleetnumber indicated that the bus was a dual-purpose vehicle. With nationalisation some rationalisation of SMT Group operations took place. The SMT Company's isolated operations in the Dundee area did not pass to Scottish Omnibuses, but instead passed to sister company W. Alexander & Sons Ltd. In the Edinburgh area this history resulted in SMT/Eastern Scottish retaining the right to carry passengers within the city boundary (contrast Glasgow where only pickup outward and set- down inward were permitted). The cessation of tramway operation in Edinburgh (which at one time extended through Musselburgh to Port Seton) was accompanied by service reallocations, making Musselburgh exclusive to SMT/Eastern Scottish, and takeover of Gilmerton services by the corporation buses, albeit with competition from Eastern Scottish's Birkenside and some Rosewell services. In 1958 Lowland Motorways of Glasgow was taken over, with various local services in the east side of the city. Another acquisition in the west of Scottish Omnibuses' territory was Baxter's Bus Service of Airdrie in 1962, with local services in the Airdrie and Coatbridge areas. These purchases significantly increased the company's presence in the Lanarkshire and Glasgow area. The final significant takeover was that of Stark's Motor Service of Dunbar in 1964. Stark's had operated some of its services jointly with Scottish Omnibuses for some years, and a proportion of its fleet was already painted in SMT livery. Leyland Fleetline DD65 (OSG 65V), pictured when new at the foot of North Bridge, Edinburgh, in September 1979. It features the recently introduced 'saltire' logo on its near-side cream band. When the Baxter's business was acquired, adverse public reaction to the repainting of buses into Scottish Omnibuses livery led to a decision to retain the Baxter's identity and blue livery for buses based at Victoria depot and used on town services around Airdrie and Coatbridge. The Stark's livery, a lighter shade of green than that used by Scottish Omnibuses, was retained for buses at Dunbar and North Berwick. Both local identities disappeared in the late 1970s when the SBG's new corporate fleetname style was introduced (\\"Eastern SCOTTISH\\", with a saltire logo). SMT and Scottish Omnibuses had long been a major operator of long-distance coach services, usually in cooperation with English operators such as Grey-Green, Midland Red and Ribble, using the Eastern Scottish fleetname and green/cream livery. Dual-purpose coaches were prefixed Z and carried a 50/50 green/cream livery, and tour coaches were prefixed Y and carried a majority cream livery. A marketing feature was the operation of 2 and 3 day tours between London and Edinburgh, available as single or return journeys. This business was supported by a permanent sales office in London, operated by Eastern Scottish-uniformed staff. A unique black/yellow livery on Bristol REMH vehicles serving Edinburgh-London in the 1970s. Western SMT, with fleetname Western Scottish, paralleled this service from Glasgow, using identical vehicles in a black/white livery. From the mid-1970s Scottish Bus Group policy increasingly saw such services operated with a corporate SBG identity rather than the individual names and liveries of the subsidiary operating companies. Initially, SBG coaches used on express services to London received a special blue and white livery with \\"SCOTTISH\\" branding; in the early 1980s most other express services were branded \\"Scottish Citylink\\" with a two-tone blue and yellow livery. =Depots= Kelso, pictured in September 1985 shortly after being transferred to a new company, Lowland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. On the left is a Seddon Pennine VII (YSG 639W), formerly S639 and still in Eastern livery, while on the right is an unidentified ex-Western Scottish Leyland Leopard. Both buses are Alexander Y Types. Depot codes were introduced in the 1930s. At the time of nationalisation the principal depots were: *A Edinburgh (New Street) *B Bathgate (Whitburn Road) *C (formerly Dundee) *D Galashiels (Duke Street) *E Kelso (Roxburgh Street) *F Linlithgow (High Street) *G Dalkeith (High Street) *H Clarkston Depot, Airdrie (Connor Street) *I Broxburn (East Main Street) *J Berwick-upon-Tweed (Marygate) *K Peebles (Innerleithen Road) *L (formerly Carlisle) *W Musselburgh (Mall Avenue) In addition to these there were several sub-depots in the Borders area, including Biggar (North Back Street), Hawick (Dovecote Street), Jedburgh (Castle Gate), Melrose (Abbey Street) and Selkirk (Mill Street). Changes to depots over the years comprised: *1957: Hawick elevated to full depot status (code L) *1960: new Baillieston (Station Road) depot opened (code C), partly to operate services taken over from Lowland Motorways *1962: new engineering works and body shop opened at Marine Gardens (Seafield Road), Edinburgh *1962: Victoria Depot, Airdrie (Gartlea Road) taken over with Baxter's business (code V) *1963: Melrose sub-depot closed *1964: Dunbar (Countess Crescent) depot (code S) and North Berwick (Tantallon Road) sub-depot taken over with Stark's business; *1966: Dalkeith depot replaced by new combined depot/bus station at Eskbank Road (code G) *1971: Selkirk sub-depot closed *1979: Broxburn depot replaced by new combined depot/bus station at Livingston (Almondvale South) (code N) *1979: Airdrie Victoria depot closed =Deregulation= Volvo Ailsa B55 VV773 (CSG 773S), seen here in preservation at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum in 2013. This front-engined bus, delivered to Eastern in 1978, was part of a batch of 10 that was originally intended for Fife Scottish. In preparation for deregulation in 1986, and eventual privatisation, the Scottish Bus Group was reorganised in 1985. The Scottish Omnibuses operations from Berwick, Dunbar, Galashiels, Hawick, Jedburgh, Kelso, North Berwick and Peebles depots passed to a new company, Lowland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., whilst Airdrie (Clarkston) depot was passed to Central Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., Linlithgow depot passed to Midland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., and Baillieston depot was closed (its vehicles and operations being transferred briefly to the Stepps depot of Midland Scottish, pending further reorganisation to create Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses Ltd.). The licences for express coach services passed to the new Scottish Citylink Coaches Ltd., and Marine Works passed to another new SBG subsidiary company, SBG Engineering Ltd. The remnant of Scottish Omnibuses, comprising the core of the former company's territory in the Lothians area, with the depots at Bathgate, Dalkeith, Edinburgh, Livingston, Musselburgh and the sub-depot at Biggar (which closed in 1986), was renamed Eastern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. Eastern Scottish retained the traditional green and cream livery for its fleet. Upon deregulation, Eastern Scottish faced little to no competition outside Edinburgh, despite a highly urbanised operating area. Within Edinburgh, Eastern found itself sparring with the larger, dominant city operator, Lothian Regional Transport (LRT), for a larger share of the city traffic. In late 1986 Eastern introduced nine new routes within Edinburgh, some of which closely mirrored sections of existing LRT routes. These were numbered C1-C9, the minibuses carried the \\"City Sprinter\\" fleet branding. At the start of deregulation in October 1986, route C5 ran a 5 minute frequency between Clovenstone and Restalrig via the city centre, operating a hail and ride on some parts of the route. Some routes were operated by a fleet of 70 Dodge minibuses, whilst others used double deck buses, notably 25 secondhand ex- South Yorkshire Transport Volvo Ailsa B55s with Irish-built Van Hool-McArdle bodywork. Some of these routes only lasted for a short period. LRT retaliated by extending services beyond the city boundary and deeper into Eastern's operating area. Together with the loyalty of the passengers to the familiar \\"madder\\" coloured fleet of the \\"corporation\\" (as LRT was still sometimes known), LRT's competitive tactics ensured that Eastern made no significant inroads to the city market. Despite competition between the two operators, bitter \\"bus wars\\" that broke out in other cities and towns across Scotland were largely avoided, and Eastern did not persevere with loss-making operations, but settled for economy by reducing use of St. Andrew's Bus Station by running through Edinburgh city centre to destinations such as Charlotte Square, Haymarket, Clermiston and Silverknowes, and connecting traditional routes such as ones to Balerno and Wallyford end-to end to create new cross-city links which in some cases competed with those of LRT. =Privatisation= An unidentified Dodge S56 minibus on one of the post- deregulation company's City Sprinter services, pictured at Bruntsfield Place, Edinburgh in July 1988. Eastern Scottish was one of the most financially successful subsidiaries of the Scottish Bus Group, with an operating profit of ¬£1.07m in 1989. This was due in large part to initiatives such as the City Sprinter minibus scheme, which had quickly expanded into a considerable network of high-frequency routes. In September 1990 the company was sold to its management and employees for ¬£9.5m, making it the most expensive subsidiary in the sell-off. The company began trading as SMT once again, with a modern, stylised take on the traditional diamond logo. Some investment in new vehicles and the introduction of \\"quality corridors\\", branded as 'Diamond Service', followed. Competitive attack on city routes using double-deckers was unsuccessful against the economy of scale available to LRT, lack of route coverage to make season ticket purchases attractive, and customer loyalty. In October 1994 the GRT Group, which later became FirstGroup, bought the company for ¬£10.3m. In 1996, the company, now trading as First SMT, was broken up and merged into neighbouring FirstGroup subsidiaries Midland Bluebird Ltd (formerly Midland Scottish) and Lowland Omnibuses (formerly Lowland Scottish) which later merged to form First Edinburgh, trading simply as First. Eastern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd ceased trading as an independent concern. See also *List of bus operators of the United Kingdom External links *First Edinburgh website *Eastern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd.

History Stagecoach Fife can be traced back to 1909 and after buyout and mergers become part of Walter Alexander & Sons.Fifes Trams And Buses' by Allan Brotchie: In 1961 Walter Alexander & Sons was split into three separate companies with the Fife operations becoming Alexanders (Fife) with the colour red to be used as the main fleet colour. Scottish Bus Group was prepared for deregulation of the bus industry in 1986, and eventual privatisation, which resulted in Fife Scottish Omnibuses Ltd being created. Of the seven original SBG subsidiaries, Alexanders (Fife) was the only company to survive the reorganisation intact; it lost none of its operating area to any of the new companies formed and nor did it gain. The only impact of the shake-up was the legal name change. On its creation, the company kept the vibrant red and cream livery adopted by Alexander's Fife operations. The SBG corporate 'Fife Scottish' fleet name style was adopted, however, in an unusually large size, and larger areas of cream were the only visible differences. Some vehicles sported Best Bus In The Kingdom slogans as part of SBG's marketing drive, rather than Best Bus In Town or Best Bus Around; playing on Fife's proud history of once being a separate kingdom. With the arrival of deregulation came the arrival of competition. Fife had previously enjoyed being the sole operator throughout much of the region and its response to the new operators showed the company's intention to remain so. Despite the cities of Edinburgh and Dundee being on the edges of its operating area, Fife concentrated on protecting its home market rather than expanding into the cities to compete against the dominant operators there. Rennie's of Dunfermline were the first challengers to Fife in and around that town, but by far the largest and most sustained competition came from local coach firm Moffat & Williamson, who built up a substantial network of services throughout much of Fife, mirroring the larger operator's network. A \\"bus war\\" broke out across the region, and vehicles from both operators could be seen nose to tail on services such as that between Dundee and St Andrews. Fife's passenger base seemed loyal, however, and Rennies would soon withdraw from Dunfermline and Moffat & Williamson would scale back its operations, though retaining pockets of strong competition in the industrialised towns in the south of the region. Despite the competition, Fife remained the most profitable of the SBG subsidiaries and was seen by potential buyers as the 'jewel in the crown' of the state-owned bus group. In July 1991, Fife Scottish was purchased by Stagecoach for ¬£9.1m. The red and cream livery was replaced by the Stagecoach corporate look of red, blue and orange stripes on a white background. Stagecoach took a much more severe line with Moffat & Williamson, a strategy that drew criticism in the media for being predatory and uncompetitive. However, it was a strategy that worked. Moffat & Williamson would withdraw the majority of its competing services and Fife Scottish would once again become the sole operator in much of the kingdom, a position it enjoys today. Now part of Stagecoach East Scotland, the company now trades as 'Stagecoach in Fife'. During the 1980s, Fife Scottish provided coaches for Scottish Citylink, mainly from Fife to other destinations in Scotland. Since privatisation, however, Fife Scottish has built up its own substantial network of express services under the Stagecoach Express banner. Operation From its head office, initially in Kirkcaldy, Fife Scottish operated throughout the ancient kingdom of Fife and beyond to Dundee and Edinburgh. A network of express services also reach as far west as Glasgow. Stagecoach is the largest operator in the region and is responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in the towns of St Andrews, Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath, Glenrothes, Leven and Kirkcaldy. Stagecoach operate to two park and ride sites in Fife, one at Ferrytoll just off the A90 towards Edinburgh, and the newly opened Halbeath Park & Ride, located off the A92 at Halbeath, which opened in November 2013 and has departures for Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Fife, as well as the Forth Valley Royal Hospital. =Routes= Stagecoach Fife has four Flagship routes: * Services 19, 19A & 19B, running at a frequency of every 10 minutes from 7 am to 7 pm, every 20 minutes on Sundays and every 30 minutes during the evenings. The route runs from Rosyth to Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly & Ballingry. * Service 99 operates a 8-minute frequency during the day between St Andrews, Leuchars and Dundee. * 39/39A (via Thornton) which provide a 15-minute service between Kirkcaldy, Thornton & Glenrothes, serving the new entrance to the Victoria Hospital * 747: Edinburgh Airport to Ferrytoll and Halbeath Park and Rides. From 2006 service 747 was introduced, which brought a new link between Dunfermline, Inverkeithing & Ferrytoll Park & Ride to Edinburgh Airport, South Gyle & Riccarton, and it was originally branded as \\"Airdirect\\" but since January 2011 the service was called \\"Jet 747\\". In 2010, the company introduced a new service, Route X42, in partnership with Fife Council to help provide a direct link between Kirkcaldy and Ninewells Hospital, via Glenrothes, Ladybank, Cupar and Dundee City Centre. This service has been replaced by services X54 and X58 Current Depots * Aberhill (Methilhaven Road) * Dunfermline (St Leonards Road).

Highland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd was formed as a bus operating subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group in June 1985 from Highland Omnibuses Ltd, and operated until October 1995 when the company was split into two - Highland Bus & Coach and Highland Country Buses. The companies have since remerged and operate today as Highland Country Buses. It is now Stagecoach in the Highlands.  Background  From its head office in Seafield Road, Inverness, Highland Scottish operated over the massive geographical, but sparsely populated, area of the Highland region of north west Scotland. Highland Scottish was the largest operator in north west Scotland and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in and around the towns of Inverness, Aviemore, Nairn, Tain, Portree, Wick, Thurso and Fort William, with depots located in these towns. Services extended to Oban in the south, and Highland also operated coaches on long distance Scottish Citylink work, linking Inverness and the north west to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and points in England. Highland Scottish only operated services on the mainland. Services in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland were operated by local independent operators. On 16 May 2008 it was finally announced that the long anticipated purchase of Highland Country Buses (and Orkney Coaches Ltd) by Stagecoach Group had been finalised.  History  Highland Scottish can be traced back to 1952 when Highland Omnibuses was created when Highland Transport, Macrae & Dick and Alexanders Town Services in Inverness were joined together. In the reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group, in 1985, to prepare for deregulation and privatisation, the company was renamed Highland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. Unlike many of the original SBG subsidiaries, Highland's operating area remained largely unchanged. No additional territory was gained, but Oban was transferred to Midland Scottish. The red and grey livery used by Highland Omnibuses was retained for the fleet. Initially, upon deregulation, Highland continued to enjoy the monopoly position across much of its operating area. Competition started around Fort William with the arrival of a new company, Gaelic Bus, owned by Alexander MacConnacher, Brecklet, Ballachulish. However, it was the competition in the biggest town in the Highland Scottish network that was to prove controversial. Highland Scottish was the sole operator in Inverness and provided all bus services in and around the town. However, in May 1988, a group of ex-Highland drivers formed Inverness Traction Ltd, operating a fleet of leased minibuses and operating in parallel to Highland's Inverness network. Highland's response to the competition was fast and ferocious, cutting fare levels well below the competition and increasing traffic levels by 60%. Competition between the two operators was fierce and there was much ill will, with each operator accusing the other of unfair behaviour. Both companies suffered acute financial losses during the competition period, which ended when Inverness Traction went into receivership in April 1989. The services operated by Inverness Traction, and the minibus leases, were immediately taken up by an Aberdeen-based coach operator, Alexanders (North East) Ltd. However, the intense competition continued and Alexanders also fell into receivership in November 1989. After a brief interval, the assets and services of Inverness Traction were purchased by the Stagecoach Group. Highland, perhaps aware it could not sustain competition against a national operator with a reputation for swift and successful competition, scaled down the level of service against the new operator. Soon after, Stagecoach would purchase the Inverness and Tain operations of Highland Scottish and become the dominant operator of Inverness area services. In August 1991, Highland Scottish was sold to a consortium made up of Rapson's Coaches, a coach operator based near Inverness, and recently privatised Scottish Citylink, for ¬£800k. In March 1993, ownership of Highland Scottish passed wholly to Rapson's and a more modern deep red and cream livery, with a dark red wedge and yellow coachlines, was introduced for the fleet The golden eagle emblem, once used by Highland Omnibuses, was reintroduced in a larger size toward the rear of the vehicle and the company traded simply as Highland. However, in October 1995, the company was split in two, with Rapson's retaining the eastern services under Highland Bus & Coach Ltd, with the remainder passed to a new company, Highland Country Buses Ltd. Highland Scottish Omnibuses at that time ceased to exist as a whole concern. Highland Scottish remains as the trading name of Inverness bus station. On 16 May 2008, it was finally announced that the long anticipated purchase of Highland Country Buses (and Orkney Coaches Ltd) by Stagecoach Group had been finalised. Older people will remember when the principal bus operator in the Highlands was David MacBrayne Ltd of Glasgow and before World War 2, MacRae and Dick (recently taken over by the Park Motor Group) operated a Fort William to Inverness service with cream coloured buses and MacIntyres, a Fort William family also operated buses in the local area. Even earlier, Jack Shields ran a service between Kinlochleven and Fort William and Ballachulish. From June, 2018, the principal operator in the Fort William area will be Shiel Buses of Acharacle who presently operate services local in Fort William and to the Ardnamurchan peninsula. According to the Oban Times newspaper, Stagecoach will pull out of Lochaber (the Fort William area) at the end of June, 2018 when Shiel Buses takes full control.  Successor companies  Highland Country buses adopted a starkly different livery to the traditional red by going for a two-tone blue livery, with a large St Andrew's Cross in the centre of its 'Highland Country' logo. In January 1996 Highland Country Buses was bought by National Express for ¬£1.8m. Highland Bus & Coach, being the smaller of the two operators, continued to operate with the image its predecessor adopted. The two companies continued to exist under separate ownership until August 1998 when Rapson's bought Highland Country Buses back from National Express for ¬£4m - ¬£2.2m more than Rapson's originally sold the company for. Highland Country Buses is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Rapson's Coaches, and covers the operating area that Highland Scottish had on privatisation. The company has adopted a 'corporate look', sharing the two-tone blue with silver trim livery that Rapson's Coaches used, with the addition of the large golden eagle logo at the rear of the vehicle. While regular bus services trade as Highland Country, longer distance, express and private contract work operate under the Rapson's name. In March 2005, Rapson's completed its take over of the Orkney Islands bus market with the acquisition of four separate bus companies on the islands, including the largest, James D. Peace & Shalder Coaches. The Orcadian operation trades as Orkney Coaches and remains a separate subsidiary to Highland. All operations are now part of the Stagecoach Group.

It was formed in March 1985 from parts of Walter Alexander & Sons (Midland) Ltd and Central SMT, initially with six depots and a varied fleet of 381 vehicles. The company expanded its operations in Glasgow prior to bus deregulation in 1986. New services were introduced in competition with Strathclyde Buses, many using AEC Routemaster double-deckers operated by conductors. Kelvin suffered from vehicle maintenance problems, and on two occasions was forced to hire vehicles from other companies to ensure operation of all its routes. After Kelvin lost money in 1987, the depot at Milngavie was closed and many routes withdrawn. In July 1989 Kelvin was merged with Central Scottish to form Kelvin Central Buses. This company was sold to its employees on privatisation, before being taken over by Strathclyde Buses. It is now part of First Glasgow. Operation Operating from its head office in Bishopbriggs and depots in Old Kilpatrick, Milngavie, Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth, Stepps and Cumbernauld, Kelvin Scottish had an operating area bounded by Loch Lomond to the west, Cumbernauld to the east, the Campsie Fells to the north and the River Clyde to the south. Kelvin was the largest operator in Dunbartonshire and north east Glasgow, and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services. Its operating area had previously been served by Central SMT and Walter Alexander & Sons (Midland). History Kelvin was created by the Scottish Bus Group (SBG) as a limited company wholly owned by the group in March 1985 in preparation for bus deregulation the following year, and began operation three months later. It was the largest of the four new companies created by the SBG in 1985, with an initial fleet of 381 vehicles, of which almost 300 were sourced from the former Alexander (Midland) fleet.Jenkinson (1991), pp.8‚Äì13 In early 1986, maintenance problems saw a number of vehicles banned from use by vehicle examiners from the Ministry of Transport. The company was forced to hire eight vehicles from other companies to keep services running; they remained in the fleet for four weeks while the regular vehicles were repaired. Similar issues resurfaced in February 1987, when twelve vehicles were hired for three weeks.Jenkinson (1991) pp.27-28 Although deregulation itself took place in October 1986, Kelvin received permission to introduce its new routes from 31 August. A number of new services were started in competition with Strathclyde Buses, running from Glasgow to Clydebank, Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Springburn. Strathclyde responded by extending its services into Clydebank, Cumbernauld, Dumbarton, Kirkintilloch and Milngavie. In 1987 Kelvin made a reported loss of ¬£3 million, leading to the closure of the depot at Milngavie.vol. 126 col. 309-317 Hansard, 27 January 1988. Retrieved 1 February 2011. Many of the competing routes introduced in 1986 were withdrawn in July 1987, and 70 vehicles were taken out of service.Jenkinson (1991) p.30 Two years later both Kelvin and neighbouring Central were severely affected by a strike by 700 of the companies' drivers, caused by the dismissal of four shop stewards. In July 1989, it was announced that SBG was to be privatised. In an effort to make Kelvin Scottish more attractive on the approach to privatisation, Kelvin was merged with Central Scottish to form Kelvin Central Buses Ltd. Upon the merger, Kelvin Scottish ceased trading as a stand-alone subsidiary. Subsequent history Following the privatisation of Scottish Bus Group in 1991, Kelvin Central was sold to its employees. In 1994 it was taken over by Strathclyde Buses, which was itself bought out by FirstGroup two years later. Kelvin Central was renamed to First Glasgow (No.2) Ltd. in May 1998, with a red livery adopted. Its operations are now part of First Glasgow. Branding and promotions The company initially adopted a simple two-tone blue livery with a logo incorporating the Flag of Scotland and the words \\"Scottish\\" and \\"Kelvin\\"; a more striking livery consisting of two lighter shades of blue and yellow applied diagonally was introduced in September 1985. This was revised in early 1988 to yellow and light blue with a dark blue diagonal stripe.Jenkinson (1991) p.34 As a result of increased competition in Dunbartonshire following deregulation, Kelvin decided to introduce additional fleetnames to its vehicles to establish local identities. From April 1987 onwards Dumbarton BUS appeared on vehicles operating in Dumbarton and Loch Lomondside.Jenkinson (1991) p.28 In October Kirkie BUS was introduced onto Kirkintilloch-based vehicles and Cumbernauld's Buses onto vehicles stationed in that town.Jenkinson (1991) p.33 In 1988 a new fares scheme, the Glasgow Gold Card, was introduced, offering weekly travel on all SBG routes in the city. A Kelvin AEC Routemaster bus was painted in a gold livery to advertise the ticket, and remained in the livery until withdrawal by Kelvin Central in 1991.Jenkinson (1991) p.38-39 Fleet The fleet acquired by Kelvin at its formation was very mixed. Of the 381 vehicles initially used, 135 were double- deck. Nine types of vehicles were operated. The largest constituent was 153 Leyland Leopard single-deckers; the first new buses were six Leyland Tigers ordered by Central Scottish prior to the creation of Kelvin. A fleet of 40 AEC Routemaster buses were purchased from London Transport in 1986 to launch the new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles did not have to spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, which was one of the last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland. Although the original fleet did not include any minibuses, a large number of Mercedes-Benz vehicles were introduced from September 1986 on a high-frequency route in central and northern Glasgow; it did not prove profitable and was converted to full-size operation a year later, with many of the minibuses transferred to other SBG subsidiaries. Another unusual vehicle in the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered new in 1989.Jenkinson (1991) p.23-25 Six rare Leyland Lion double-deckers were ordered in 1988, but owing to a large cut in Kelvin's peak vehicle requirement they did not enter service with the company and were instead sent to Clydeside Scottish.

The company was formed in 1985 and operated under the identities Lowland Scottish, Lowland and First Lowland / First SMT, until 1999 when the company's operations were combined with the operations of Midland Bluebird in a new company, First Edinburgh Ltd. As of 26 March 2017 these operations were transferred to West Coast Motors (trading as Borders Buses).  Operation  Kelso, pictured in September 1985. From its head office in Galashiels, Lowland Scottish operated throughout the Scottish Borders and parts of Lothian in south east Scotland and across the border into Northumberland in north east England, bounded by Edinburgh to the north, Peebles to the west and Berwick-upon-Tweed in the east. Lowland Scottish operated from depots in the towns of Galashiels, Haddington, Berwick-upon- Tweed, Dunbar, Hawick, Jedburgh, Kelso, North Berwick and Peebles. Principal services linked these towns with Edinburgh and with each other, along with a limited number of urban services in the larger towns and other rural or schools services. The most important route in the Borders was Service 95, linking Edinburgh and Carlisle, branded as the Borders Rail Link bus service.  History  Ex-Eastern Scottish Seddon Pennine 7 609 (SSX 609V), pictured at St Andrew's Bus Station, Edinburgh. This bus operated on the company's East Lothian routes. Lowland Scottish Omnibuses Limited was created in 1985 as part of the reorganisation of the state owned Scottish Bus Group (SBG) in preparation for deregulation of the bus industry in 1986, and eventual privatisation. It inherited the south-eastern depots and operations of Scottish Omnibuses Limited (Eastern Scottish), in the Scottish Borders, eastern East Lothian and Berwick-upon-Tweed. The new company introduced a new livery similar to the green and cream Eastern Scottish colours, but using a brighter green and a more striking yellow. Upon formation, Lowland initially faced no significant competition, thanks largely to its sparsely populated operating area. Town services within Berwick-upon-Tweed continued to be shared with recently privatised Northumbria Motor Services, with Lowland and Northumbria having adjacent depot buildings fronting a shared bus station. This working relationship had been built up between the companies' predecessors, Scottish Omnibuses (SMT/Eastern Scottish) and United Automobile Services. Ex-Southern Vectis Bristol VRT 856 (NDL 656R) was purchased by Lowland in 1991. It is now preserved in the original post-privatisation \\"Lowland Omnibuses\\" livery at the Scottish Vintage Bus Museum. On deregulation, the relationship between Lowland and Northumbria in Berwick- upon-Tweed broke down, and fierce competition ensued between the two operators for several years. The 'bus war' eventually ended in the mid-1990s with Lowland pulling out of Berwick as part of an agreement between First and Cowie Group, by that time owners of Lowland and Northumbria respectively. Arriva, Cowie Group's successor, withdrew from Berwick ten years later, leaving the town routes to a local independent operator, Perryman's Buses. Lowland Scottish became the first of the SBG subsidiaries to be privatised when in August 1990 the company's management and employees bought the business for ¬£3.1m through their holding company Reiver Ventures Ltd., the word \\"Scottish\\" then dropped from the company's legal and trading names at that time. Lowland had been a profitable unit within the SBG thanks largely to the limited competition in its rural territory, though this operating area did not give much scope for expansion. The company therefore sought to develop its coach business and to expand its presence in the more populated Lothians area. In 1991 the bus and coach business of Ian Glass Coaches was acquired, with a depot in Haddington. The depot in Dunbar closed shortly afterwards, as the East Lothian area operations were concentrated on Haddington. Smaller takeovers were of Shanks ('Border Travel') of Galashiels in 1992 and Grieve's Taxis of Hawick in 1993. Diversification included the acquisition of a van hire firm, and development of the PSV/HGV driving school business inherited from Shanks. The company also acquired an interest in Lothian Transit of Newtongrange, a low-cost operator running tendered bus services in the Edinburgh area.  Demise  This Leyland Olympian (D901 CSH) was purchased new by Lowland Scottish in 1987, where it was allocated to North Berwick sub- depot and given the fleetnumber 901. It is pictured here in First Edinburgh 'Barbie' livery in 2005. In November 1994, GRT Group (which later became FirstGroup) bought Reiver Ventures for ¬£2.4m. GRT had purchased neighbouring Eastern Scottish (now trading as SMT once more) the previous month, and with its ownership of Midland Bluebird (the old Midland Scottish), GRT operated across a substantial part of central Scotland, from Oban in the west coast to the border with England. Reorganisation of the three companies quickly followed, breaking SMT in two and merging the parts with Midland and Lowland. As a result, Lowland inherited SMT's Dalkeith and Musselburgh depots in 1996. This changed the focus of the company from a rural operator serving the Borders to one dominated by suburban services around Edinburgh, and coincided with the start of a gradual retrenchment in the south which eventually resulted in the closure of all of the Borders depots except Galashiels. When the 'First' corporate style was introduced, the trading names First Lowland and First SMT were used, the latter being restricted to the former SMT operations around Edinburgh. A final round of reorganisation in 1999 saw Lowland Omnibuses absorbed into Midland Bluebird Ltd and a new company, First Edinburgh Ltd.

Alexander & Sons (Midland) Ltd, and operated until 1991 when it was renamed Midland Bluebird Ltd. Operation From its head office in Camelon (later Larbert), Midland Scottish was the largest bus operator in Stirling, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk districts and was responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in and around Stirling, the Trossachs, Alloa, Falkirk, and Linlithgow, as well as parts of Argyllshire. Services from these places extended into Glasgow, Edinburgh and Perth. The company also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink express work, mainly north west and central Scotland to other towns and cities in Scotland and England. History It predecessor company, W. Alexander & Sons Ltd. can be traced back to 1923, and had been split into three smaller companies in 1961. The largest of these, W. Alexander & Sons (Midland) Ltd. (trading as Midland, and subsequently Midland Scottish) had an operating territory extended from Glasgow and Bo'ness in the south to Oban and Pitlochry in the north. In 1970 the Oban depot and services had been transferred to Highland Omnibuses Ltd., but the operating area was still large and varied. In preparation for deregulation of the bus industry and eventual privatisation the Scottish Bus Group reorganised its subsidiaries in 1985 to create smaller operating units which more closely corresponded with local government boundaries and which reduced the number of jointly-operated services. To this end, the Alexander (Midland) depots at within Strathclyde Region (i.e. Cumbernauld, Kilsyth, Kirkintilloch, Milngavie and Stepps) were ceded to a new company Kelvin Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., whilst those in Tayside Region (i.e. Crieff, Perth and Pitlochry) passed to another new company Strathtay Scottish Omnibuses Ltd.. The company's central works adjacent to Larbert depot also passed to another new SBG subsidiary, SBG Engineering Ltd. The remainder of Alexander (Midland) was renamed Midland Scottish Omnibuses Ltd., and consisted of the Central Region depots at Alloa, Balfron, Bannockburn, Callander, Grangemouth and Larbert. To these were added the former Scottish Omnibuses depot at Linlithgow in West Lothian, so as to give Midland Scottish full responsibility for the hitherto jointly operated Edinburgh to Stirling / Falkirk services. Also transferred to Midland Scottish were the SBG's operations in Argyllshire from Oban (ex Highland Omnibuses but originally an Alexander depot), Ardrishaig (ex Western SMT but originally David MacBrayne) and Bridgend, Islay (also ex Western SMT). The traditional Alexander's azure blue and ivory livery was retained for the Midland Scottish fleet, and some coaches and dual-purpose vehicles continued to wear the bluebird logo that had long been used by Alexander's coaching operations. The Bluebird name was also revived as a marketing name for express services into Glasgow and Edinburgh and for the coach fleet. Compared to some other SBG subsidiaries, Midland Scottish's operations continued largely unchanged by deregulation. The company did not compete against city operators in Glasgow or Edinburgh which were on the outer extremities of its territory, and within the core Stirling and Falkirk area it faced only light competition from small independent firms. Its As a result, Midland was one of the most successful of the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, being the second most profitable after Fife Scottish. The Argyllshire operations were detached from the rest of the company but had been given to Midland Scottish in 1985 as it was the closest subsidiary with a partially rural operating area. They were considered too small to become a separate company in their own right, too far from Inverness to be managed by Highland Scottish, and too dissimilar to Kelvin Scottish's largely urban network around Glasgow. Nevertheless they were peripheral to Midland's operations and the company soon began to divest itself of them. The Islay operations were surrendered to a local independent, whilst the Ardrishaig depot was sold to West Coast Motors of Campbeltown in 1987. In 1988 SBG Engineering closed the Larbert works, and Midland Scottish took it over as their head office. In 1990, as the company prepared for privatisation, it began trading as Midland Bluebird. It became the second SBG subsidiary to be privatised when it was sold for ¬£8.5m in September 1990 to GRT Group, one of the predecessors of the FirstGroup. Shortly afterward, the company changed its legal name to Midland Bluebird Ltd. In 1992 Oban depot was sold to Oban and District, completing the withdrawal from Argyllshire. In September 1992 the company announced a smoking ban on all its services from 12 October, after a highly publicised public consultation found that 91% of respondents wished smoking to be banned on its services. The former operations of Midland Scottish are today part of First Edinburgh, trading simply as First, after being merged with neighbouring First subsidiaries SMT (Eastern Scottish) and Lowland.

It is a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group, after their purchase of the company from the Scottish Bus Group in 1991. The company holds a Royal Warrant from HM Queen Elizabeth II for bus and coach services, granted in 1996. Operation From its head office on Guild Street, Aberdeen, Stagecoach Bluebird covers an operating range stretching over Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray. It is the largest operator in the north east of Scotland and is responsible for urban, rural and interurban services in the towns of Alford, Ballater, Braemar, Buckie, Elgin, Forres, Fraserburgh, Fyvie, Macduff, Mintlaw, Peterhead and Stonehaven as well as city services in Aberdeen. Depots are also located in these towns. Bluebird also provide coaches for Scottish Citylink services, mainly from Aberdeen to Perth, Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh. History The company was formed as Northern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd in June 1985 from the northern operations of W. Alexander & Sons (Northern) Ltd. The southern operations in Arbroath, Montrose, Forfar and Dundee were ceded to a new company, Strathtay Scottish, now Stagecoach Strathtay. From its creation the company retained the traditional yellow and cream livery from its predecessor. On the approach to deregulation of the British bus industry in 1986, Northern had a working relationship with Aberdeen city operator Grampian Regional Transport, and operated some services together under the Grampian Scottish name. However, the co-operation would be short lived, and upon deregulation Northern Scottish launched a network of services throughout Aberdeen under the CityBus brand and adopting dual-door double deckers, non- standard for Northern but common with Grampian. A more striking livery was adopted for the operation incorporating large areas of blue. In response, Grampian would extend its operations outwith Aberdeen and into Northern's rural operating base. Outside Aberdeen, Northern saw little to no competition, thanks in part to its largely rural and remote territory. Toward privatisation the company resurrected the classic bluebird logo that was once used by Walter Alexander for its coaching operations. Midland Scottish, itself a fellow SBG subsidiary and once also part of the Alexander's company, had continued to use the same logo, and as it rebranded itself as Midland Bluebird, Northern Scottish began trading as Bluebird Northern. Some vehicles operated in the Elgin area were, however, branded as Moray Bluebird, whilst those operating in the Peterhead and Fraserburgh areas were branded Buchan Bluebird. Though its operations remained largely the same since its formation in 1985 (and earlier) and with little competition, Northern Scottish was not one of the most profitable of the Scottish Bus Group subsidiaries, largely due to the sparse population in its large operating area. However, the company was successfully privatised, being bought by Perth-based transport group Stagecoach for ¬£5.7m in March 1991. The yellow and cream livery was replaced with the Stagecoach corporate white with red, orange and blue stripes, and shortly after privatisation the legal company name was changed to Bluebird Buses Ltd.

It is a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group, which bought Strathtay Scottish Omnibuses Ltd from Traction Group in 2005. Strathtay Scottish was formed in 1985 as a subsidiary of the Scottish Transport Group, from parts of Walter Alexander & Sons (Midland) Ltd and Walter Alexander & Sons (Northern) Ltd. Stagecoach have retained the right to the operating name Strathtay Scottish; this is reflected in the legal lettering on the company's vehicles. Operation Since joining the Stagecoach Group, Stagecoach Strathtay now has an operating area bounded by Aberdeen in the north, Gauldry & Newport-on-Tay to the south and Perth to the west. Before joining Stagecoach, Strathtay operated only as far as Laurencekirk in the north; however, the Montrose depot has acquired some work from Bluebird's Stonehaven depot, including route 24 from Brechin to Stonehaven, route 103 from Laurencekirk to Aberdeen and a handful of School Contracts serving Mackie Academy in Stonehaven. Strathtay is the largest operator in Angus and operates urban, rural and interurban services in and around Dundee, Arbroath, Blairgowrie, Forfar and Montrose. Depots are located in Dundee, Arbroath and Blairgowrie. On its creation Strathtay was also the largest operator in Perth, Crieff and Pitlochry, but depots in those towns have closed in 1993 and operations were scaled back, ironically due to intensive 'Stagecoach' competition at the time. In 2010 Montrose depot closed due to contract losses. A depot exists in Forfar but is considered to be a sub depot of Arbroath. Strathtay also provide coaches for Scottish Citylink and Megabus express work, mainly from Dundee and Perth to other points in Scotland. Although Strathtay's Head Office at Dundee bus station has been closed, there still remains a Booking/Depot Office at that site. Head Office functions were amalgamated with Stagecoach East Scotland (which also covers Fife and Perth operating areas) at Guthrie House in Cowdenbeath. On 18 May 2009, the Cowdenbeath head office was relocated to Evans House, John Smith Business Park, Kirkcaldy. History A Strathtay Scottish Leyland Olympian at Arbroath in 2004, when the company was owned by Yorkshire Traction. Strathtay Scottish was a brand new company created through reorganisation of the Scottish Bus Group in preparation for deregulation of the bus industry in 1986, and eventual privatisation. It inherited the eastern operations of Alexanders (Midland) based in Perth, Crieff and Pitlochry, as well as the southern operations of Alexanders (Northern) in Dundee, Forfar, Arbroath,Blairgowrie and Montrose. A bright blue and orange livery was adopted for the fleet, which would be controlled from Dundee. The company would have a turbulent infancy, however, as Strathtay Scottish faced very heavy competition from local Perth-based firm, Stagecoach. Strathtay Scottish purchased a number of ex-London Transport AEC Routemaster buses to counter the competition, which also used a number of the same vehicle type on city services in Perth. A new Perth City Transport brand was created by Strathtay Scottish to compete with Stagecoach, using a mainly red livery with white. But as Stagecoach grew nationally it became financially stronger and had ready access to vehicles from the larger companies in England it had purchased. Strathtay's managing director, Neil Renilson, moved to Stagecoach in 1989. Strathtay Scottish could not sustain the level of intense competition that ensued, and in 1993 it closed its Perth depot. Crieff and Pitlochry also closed, and the company withdrew from the majority of services around these towns. Despite experiencing heavy and sustained competition on the lucrative city services in Perth, Strathtay Scottish managed to remain profitable on the run up to privatisation, and in June 1991 was sold to Barnsley-based Yorkshire Traction Ltd for ¬£1.9m. Now trading simply as Strathtay Buses, the new owners established and maintained a working relationship with Stagecoach around Perth, even jointly operating the trunk service between Dundee and Perth with the national operator, while the remainder of the operations remained largely unchanged from privatisation. On 14 December 2005, Strathtay Buses' parent company Traction Group was purchased by Stagecoach for ¬£26m. Strathtay is bordered to the north, east and south by Stagecoach subsidiaries, all part of Stagecoach East Scotland, which Strathtay has also joined. The Stagecoach corporate livery has been adopted for vehicles and initially, most displayed Strathtay - Part of the Stagecoach Group fleetnames, however almost all buses have now been re-branded with \\"Stagecoach Strathtay\\".

This successor company is now a part of Stagecoach West Scotland.  Operation  From its head office in Nursery Avenue, Kilmarnock, Western Scottish covered an operating area bounded by Ardrossan in the north, Glasgow to the east, the Firth of Clyde to the west and Carlisle to the south. Western was the largest operator in south west Scotland and was responsible for local bus services in the towns of Kilmarnock, Ayr, Cumnock, Girvan, Stranraer and Dumfries as well as rural services, interurban connections and cross-border journeys into north west England. Depots were located in those towns, as well as Annan, Ardrossan, Carlisle (shared with Cumberland Motor Services) and Whithorn. Vehicles were also 'outstationed' at Kirkcudbright, Lockerbie, Penpont and Sanquhar. The company would eventually establish bases in Brodick, Isle of Arran and Dunoon, Argyll also. Western Scottish also provided coaches for Scottish Citylink work, mainly from the south west of Scotland to Glasgow, Edinburgh, London and the south. Though the northern portion of the former Western SMT's operating area, covering Inverclyde, Renfrewshire and the Isle of Bute, was ceded to a new company, Clydeside Scottish, in June 1985 (in order to prepare the Scottish Bus Group for deregulation in 1986 and eventual privatisation), Clydeside Scottish was remerged with Western in May 1989. Depots at Largs, Greenock, Paisley, Johnstone, Inchinnan, Rothesay and Thornliebank on the south side of Glasgow were added on the merger of the two companies.  History  Though its predecessor company Western SMT had a much longer and more distinguished history, Western Scottish was a relatively short lived legal creation. The traditional, smart red and cream livery the vehicles wore gave way to a black, white and two-tone grey scheme shortly after the company was created. This livery was short lived, however, and a black, white and red scheme took over within a couple of years. Due to the length of time taken to repaint the fleet, for a number of years vehicles appeared in three distinct liveries. Western suffered from heavy competition after deregulation, particularly around Kilmarnock and Ayr, which, as the heavier populated areas of its operating area, provided the firm with the bulk of its income. Keenan of Ayr, Carrick Coaches, Shuttle Buses and various smaller operators appeared, challenging and weakening the dominant operator. In May 1989, Clydeside Scottish was remerged with Western, still under the legal name of Western Scottish Omnibuses Ltd. The aim of the merger was to strengthen the two weakened giants and thus make the company a more attractive proposition for potential buyers on the run up to privatisation. Clydeside Scottish had existed for less than five years, and Western's operating region now covered the same geographical area the former Western SMT did. Though the former Clydeside Scottish operation continued to trade simply as 'Clydeside', the vehicles were given the Western black, white and red livery. During this time, however, extremely heavy and sustained competition from a multitude of smaller operators in Greenock and Paisley continued to financially weaken the company. Western Scottish was purchased by its management and employee in October 1991 for ¬£1m, with an immediate onward sale of the Clydeside operations and their depots to their management and employees as Clydeside 2000 plc (with Luton & District taking a 24% stake). The depot at Largs was closed, and Rothesay depot remained with Western Scottish. The Ardrossan depot closed shortly afterward. The newly privatised Western Scottish was successful in securing all the tendered services on the Isle of Arran, putting the future of the small Brodick-based operator Arran Transport in jeopardy and drawing howls of protest and criticism from locals and the local media. However, Arran Transport managed to stay in business by competing against the larger operator on its home island, and also the neighbouring Isle of Bute. In its home town of Kilmarnock, Western faced increasing levels of competition, most notably from Clyde Coast Coaches Ltd of Ardrossan, and retaliated by offering a free service between Saltcoats and Largs, Clyde Coast's traditional route. In 1993, a small operation was established in Dunoon, when Western won one tendered local service. Two Dennis Dart vehicles were stationed there until two years later when further routes were won and a depot running around 15 buses was opened there. Stagecoach Group took over in July 1994 for ¬£6m, and the 'bus war' with Clyde Coast was soon ended. Trading as Stagecoach Western Scottish, the company adopted the corporate Stagecoach white with red, blue and orange stripes and began expanding. Arran Transport was purchased in October 1994, followed by the much larger A1 Service operation in January 1995 - adding some 80 vehicles and operations in north Ayrshire from a new depot in Ardrossan. Stagecoach responded fiercely to the competition in Western's operating area, and was banned by the Traffic Commissioner from operating on the Ayr to Dalmellington route due to predatory and uncompetitive action against competitor Carrick Coaches for a period of one year. For the period of this ban AA Buses, which would later be owned by Stagecoach, registered a new service for the one-year period, matching the service that Stagecoach Western was forced to withdraw. Stagecoach was also forced to withdraw from a co- operative service run from Ayr to Greenock with Clyde Coast, Clydeside and AA Buses. A new operator, Ashton Coaches, had successfully pioneered the 585 Coastliner service from Ayr to Greenock. As this partially competed (though not directly) with services provided by Clyde Coast, Clydeside, AA Buses and Stagecoach Western Scottish, these operators provided two vehicles each, branded 535 Coastlink and using a similar green and white livery, and operated to the same timetable as the competition. 1995 also saw the purchase of the bus operations of Clyde Coast, and in June 1997 the bus operations of Dodds of Troon and AA Buses of Ayr were purchased, together with the bus operations of Shuttle Buses, adding services around Kilwinning, Irvine and Troon to the Western operation. At that time, the head office was moved to Sandgate Bus Station in Ayr, and the company name changed to Western Buses Ltd in the process.

It is composed of highly trained elite soldiers of which all are regular servicemen within the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation and is an essential component of the Special Operations Task Force (SOTF). According to the Principles of Special Forces, the Republic's Special Forces thrive on their exceptional qualities and advanced skills, consisting of highly adaptive individuals who can operate independently, and its SOF soldiers cannot be mass-produced and must be managed carefully. Other than their Commando duties and specializations as cross-trained Signalers, Medics, Weapons Specialists, Demolitions Experts, Snipers and Boatmen, the Republic's Army Special Forces soldiers also specialize in operations such as direct action, counter- terrorism, hostage rescue and special reconnaissance, as well as special operations. It is also one of the few units in the Singapore Armed Forces to be trained in high-altitude military parachuting and combat diving. The SOF also trains with the Republic's domestic home agencies and renowned global elite special forces partners such as the United States Army's Special Forces, Delta Force, United States Navy's SEALs and Naval Special Warfare Development Group, French Marine Commandos, Australian Special Air Service regiment and New Zealand Special Air Service regiment. History A SOF exhibition booth displaying the unit's equipment at the 2005 Singapore National Day Parade celebrations at Marina South. On 27 September 1972, a flight engineer aboard Olympic Airlines Flight 472 accidentally activated a hijack alarm. The flight, which had 31 passengers and 11 crew members on board, took off from Sydney, Australia at 1030 hours SST and was heading towards Paya Lebar Airport in Singapore. The Australian authorities were not informed of the situation until four hours later. Following a flurry of conflicting reports, Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority warned Paya Lebar Airport to be prepared for a possible hijack. Flight 472 landed in Singapore at 1825 hours SST and was immediately surrounded by the police before the Singapore authorities could confirm that it was a false alarm. The incident highlighted the lack of special forces trained and equipped to deal with a hijack or hostage situation in Singapore. This led to the creation of the SOF in 1985 as a unit specially tasked with dealing with such situations. =Operation Thunderbolt (1991)= On 26 March 1991, Singapore Airlines Flight 117 was hijacked in flight by four men, who took all 129 people on board hostage. At Singapore Changi Airport, commandos from the SOF stormed the plane, killed the four hijackers and freed the hostages in under a minute.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/special-forces-storm- hijack-singapore-airlines-monk-fred-cheong-11279702 This also marked the SOF's first combat operation, with more following. Training The number of SOF soldiers and personnel is officially classified. Trained in a variety of skills such as jungle warfare, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, air assault and amphibious warfare, among other things, they also specialize in military freefall, combat diving and long-range land insertion, hence are operable in sea, air and on land. They are also cross-trained to operate various types of weapons and equipment. Each member is assigned to a specialist appointment in his team. It takes approximately four years for a recruit to complete his training and become a qualified member of the SOF. The recruitment process is open to all members of the Singapore Armed Forces, provided they pass a selection test. Upon passing the test and completing a year of basic training, trainees receive a red beret and become fully inducted into the SOF, in addition to becoming a member of the Commando Formation.

Many browsers offer some ways to remove or alter advertisements: either by targeting technologies that are used to deliver ads (such as embedded content delivered through browser plug-ins or via HTML5), targeting URLs that are the source of ads, or targeting behaviors characteristic to ads (such as the use of HTML5 autoplay of both audio and video). Reasons for blocking ads From the standpoint of an Internet user, there are various fundamental reasons why one would want to use ad-blocking, in addition to not being advertised to: * Protecting their privacy **Reduces the number of HTTP cookies * Protecting themselves from malvertising **Any intrusive actions from the ads, including but not limited to: drive-by downloads, invisible overlay click areas (such as a regular link that opens an unexpected external website), opening in a new tab, popups and auto-redirects. These often lead to scam sites (tech support and ‚Äúyou won a prize‚Äù). * Save bandwidth (and by extension, money) * Better user experience ** Some ads cover the text making it partly illegible, making the site unusable ** Less cluttered pages ** Faster page loading times ** Fewer distractions * Accessibility reasons ** Animations in some ads are distracting to the point of making the site unusable ** The motion in some ads is nauseating for some users * Save battery on mobile devices or laptops * Prevent undesirable websites from making ad revenue out of the user's visit Publishers and their representative trade bodies, on the other hand, argue that web ads provide revenue to website owners, which enable the website owners to create or otherwise purchase content for the website. Publishers claim that the prevalent use of ad blocking software and devices could adversely affect website owner revenue and thus, in turn, lower the availability of free content on websites. Benefits For users, the benefits of ad blocking software include quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions, lower resource waste (bandwidth, CPU, memory, etc.), and privacy benefits gained through the exclusion of the tracking and profiling systems of ad delivery platforms. Blocking ads can also save substantial amounts of electrical energy and lower users' power bills, and additional energy savings can also be expected at the grid level because fewer data packets need to be transmitted between the user's machine and the website server. =User experience= Ad blocking software may have other benefits to users' quality of life, as it decreases Internet users' exposure to advertising and marketing industries, which promote the purchase of numerous consumer products and services that are potentially harmful or unhealthy and on creating the urge to buy immediately. The average person sees more than 5000 advertisements daily, many of which are from online sources. Each ad promises viewers that their lives will be improved by purchasing the item that is being promoted (e.g., fast food, soft drinks, candy, expensive consumer electronics) or encourages users to get into debt or gamble. Additionally, if Internet users buy all of these items, the packaging and the containers (in the case of candy and soda pop) end up being disposed of, leading to negative environmental impacts of waste disposal. Advertisements are very carefully crafted to target weaknesses in human psychology; as such, a reduction in exposure to advertisements could be beneficial for users' quality of life. Unwanted advertising can also harm the advertisers themselves if users become annoyed by the ads. Irritated users might make a conscious effort to avoid the goods and services of firms which are using annoying \\"pop-up\\" ads which block the Web content the user is trying to view. For users not interested in making purchases, the blocking of ads can also save time. Any ad that appears on a website exerts a toll on the user's \\"attention budget\\", since each ad enters the user's field of view and must either be consciously ignored or closed, or dealt with in some other way. A user who is strongly focused on reading solely the content that they are seeking, likely has no desire to be diverted by advertisements that seek to sell unneeded or unwanted goods and services. In contrast, users who are actively seeking items to purchase, might appreciate advertising, in particular targeted ads. =Security= Another important aspect is improving security; online advertising subjects users to a higher risk of infecting their devices with computer viruses than surfing pornography websites. In a high-profile case, malware was distributed through advertisements provided to YouTube by a malicious customer of Google's Doubleclick. In August 2015, a 0-day exploit in the Firefox browser was discovered in an advertisement on a website. When Forbes required users to disable ad blocking before viewing their website, those users were immediately served with pop-under malware. The Australian Signals Directorate recommends individuals and organizations block advertisements to improve their information security posture and mitigate potential malvertising attacks and machine compromise. The information security firm Webroot also notes employing ad blockers provide effective countermeasures against malvertising campaigns for less technically-sophisticated computer users. =Monetary= Ad blocking can also save money for the user. If a user's personal time is worth one dollar per minute, and if unsolicited advertising adds an extra minute to the time that the user requires for reading the webpage (i.e. the user must manually identify the ads as ads, and then click to close them, or use other techniques to either deal with them, all of which tax the user's intellectual focus in some way), then the user has effectively lost one dollar of time in order to deal with ads that might generate a few fractional pennies of display-ad revenue for the website owner. The problem of lost time can rapidly spiral out of control if malware accompanies the ads. Ad blocking also reduces page load time and saves bandwidth for the users. Users who pay for total transferred bandwidth (\\"capped\\" or pay-for-usage connections) including most mobile users worldwide have a direct financial benefit from filtering an ad before it is loaded. Analysis of the 200 most popular news sites (as ranked by Alexa) in 2015 showed that Mozilla Firefox Tracking Protection lead to 39% reduction in data usage and 44% median reduction in page load time. According to research performed by The New York Times, ad blockers reduced data consumption and sped up load time by more than half on 50 news sites, including their own. Journalists concluded that \\"visiting the home page of Boston.com (the site with most ad data in the study) every day for a month would cost the equivalent of about $9.50 in data usage just for the ads\\". Streaming audio and video, even if they are not presented to the user interface, can rapidly consume gigabytes of transfer especially on a faster 4G connection. Even fixed connections are often subject to usage limits, especially the faster connections (100Mbit/s and up) which can quickly saturate a network if filled by streaming media. It is a known problem with most web browsers, including Firefox, that restoring sessions often plays multiple embedded ads at once. However, this annoyance can easily be averted simply by setting the web browser to clear all cookies and browsing-history information each time the browser software is closed. Another preventive option is to use a script blocker, which enables the user to disable all scripts and then to selectively re-enable certain scripts as desired, in order to determine the role of each script. The user thus can very quickly learn which scripts are truly necessary (from the standpoint of webpage functionality) and consequently which sources of scripts are undesirable, and this insight is helpful in visiting other websites in general. Thus by precisely controlling which scripts are run in each webpage viewed, the user retains full control over what happens on his/her computer CPU and computer screen. Popularity Use of mobile and desktop ad blocking software designed to remove traditional advertising grew by 41% worldwide and by 48% in the U.S. between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015. As of Q2 2015, 45 million Americans were using ad blockers. In a survey research study released Q2 2016, MetaFacts reported 72 million Americans, 12.8 million adults in the UK, and 13.2 million adults in France were using ad blockers on their PCs, smartphones, or tablet computers. In March 2016, the Internet Advertising Bureau reported that UK adblocking was already at 22% among people over 18 years old. Methods One method of filtering is simply to block (or prevent autoplay of) Flash animation or image loading or Microsoft Windows audio and video files. This can be done in most browsers easily and also improves security and privacy. This crude technological method is refined by numerous browser extensions. Every web browser handles this task differently, but, in general, one alters the options, preferences or application extensions to filter specific media types. An additional add-on is usually required to differentiate between ads and non- ads using the same technology, or between wanted and unwanted ads or behaviors. The more advanced ad-blocking filter software allows fine-grained control of advertisements through features such as blacklists, whitelists, and regular expression filters. Certain security features also have the effect of disabling some ads. Some antivirus software can act as an ad blocker. Filtering by intermediaries such as ISP providers or national governments is increasingly common. =Browser integration= As of 2015, many web browsers block unsolicited pop-up ads automatically. Current versions of Konqueror and Microsoft Edge also include content filtering support. Content filtering can be added to Firefox, Chromium-based browsers, Opera, Safari, and other browsers with extensions such as AdBlock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin, and a number of sources provide regularly updated filter lists. Adblock Plus (provided by the German software house Eyeo GmbH) is included in the freeware browser Maxthon from the People's Republic of China by default. Another method for filtering advertisements uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules to hide specific HTML and XHTML elements. At the beginning of 2018, Google confirmed that the built-in ad blocker for the Chrome/Chromium browsers would go live on 15 February: this ad blocker only blocks certain ads as specified by the Better Ads Standard (defined by the Coalition for Better Ads, in which Google itself is a board member). This built-in ad blocking mechanism is disputed because it could unfairly benefit Google's advertising itself. In 2019, both Apple and Google began to make changes to their web browsers' extension systems which encourage the use of declarative content blocking using pre- determined filters processed by the web browser, rather than filters processed at runtime by the extension. Both vendors have imposed limits on the number of entries that may be included in these lists, which have led to (especially in the case of Chrome) allegations that these changes are being made to inhibit the effectiveness of ad blockers. =External programs= A number of external software applications offer ad filtering as a primary or additional feature. A traditional solution is to customize an HTTP proxy (or web proxy) to filter content. These programs work by caching and filtering content before it is displayed in a user's browser. This provides an opportunity to remove not only ads but also content that may be offensive, inappropriate, or even malicious (Drive-by download). Popular proxy software which blocks content effectively include Netnanny, Privoxy, Squid, and some content-control software. The main advantage of the method is freedom from implementation limitations (browser, working techniques) and centralization of control (the proxy can be used by many users). Proxies are very good at filtering ads, but they have several limitations compared to browser-based solutions. For proxies, it is difficult to filter Transport Layer Security (SSL) (\`https://\`) traffic and full webpage context is not available to the filter. As well, proxies find it difficult to filter JavaScript-generated ad content. =Hosts file and DNS manipulation= Most operating systems, even those which are aware of the Domain Name System (DNS), still offer backward compatibility with a locally administered list of foreign hosts. This configuration, for historical reasons, is stored in a flat text file that by default contains very few hostnames and their associated IP addresses. Editing this hosts file is simple and effective because most DNS clients will read the local hosts file before querying a remote DNS server. Storing black-hole entries in the hosts file prevents the browser from accessing an ad server by manipulating the name resolution of the ad server to a local or nonexistent IP address (\`127.0.0.1\` or \`0.0.0.0\` are typically used for IPv4 addresses). While simple to implement, these methods can be circumvented by advertisers, either by hard-coding, the IP address of the server that hosts the ads (this, in its turn, can be worked around by changing the local routing table by using for example iptables or other blocking firewalls), or by loading the advertisements from the same server that serves the main content; blocking name resolution of this server would also block the useful content of the site. Using a DNS sinkhole by manipulating the hosts file exploits the fact that most operating systems store a file with IP address, domain name pairs which is consulted by most browsers before using a DNS server to look up a domain name. By assigning the loopback address to each known ad server, the user directs traffic intended to reach each ad server to the local machine or to a virtual black hole of /dev/null or bit bucket. =DNS filtering= Advertising can be blocked by using a DNS server which is configured to block access to domains or hostnames which are known to serve ads by spoofing the address. Users can choose to use an already modified DNS server or set up a dedicated device running adequate software such as a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole themselves. Manipulating DNS is a widely employed method to manipulate what the end user sees from the Internet but can also be deployed locally for personal purposes. China runs its own root DNS and the EU has considered the same. Google has required their Google Public DNS be used for some applications on its Android devices. Accordingly, DNS addresses / domains used for advertising may be extremely vulnerable to a broad form of ad substitution whereby a domain that serves ads is entirely swapped out with one serving more local ads to some subset of users. This is especially likely in countries, notably Russia, India and China, where advertisers often refuse to pay for clicks or page views. DNS-level blocking of domains for non-commercial reasons is already common in China. =Recursive Local VPN= On Android, apps can run a local VPN connection with its own host filtering ability and DNS address without requiring root access. This approach allows adblocking app to download adblocking host files and use them to filter out ad networks throughout the device. Blokada, DNS66, AdGuard are few of the popular apps which accomplish adblocking without root permission. The adblocking is only active when the local VPN is turned on, and it completely stops when the VPN connection is disconnected. The convenience makes it easy to access content blocked by anti-adblock scripts. This approach optimizes battery usage, reduces internet slowdown caused by using external DNS or VPN adblocking and needs overall less configuration. =Hardware devices= Devices such as AdTrap use hardware to block Internet advertising. Based on reviews of AdTrap, this device uses a Linux Kernel running a version of PrivProxy to block ads from video streaming, music streaming, and any web browser. Another such solution is provided for network-level ad blocking for telcos by Israeli startup Shine. =By external parties and internet providers= Internet providers, especially mobile operators, frequently offer proxies designed to reduce network traffic. Even when not targeted specifically at ad filtering, these proxy-based arrangements will block many types of advertisements that are too large or bandwidth-consuming, or that are otherwise deemed unsuited for the specific internet connection or target device. Many internet operators block some form of advertisements while at the same time injecting their own ads promoting their services and specials. Economic consequences for online business Some content providers have argued that widespread ad blocking results in decreased revenue to a website sustained by advertisements and e-commerce-based businesses, where this blocking can be detected. Some have argued that since advertisers are ultimately paying for ads to increase their own revenues, eliminating ad blocking would only dilute the value per impression and drive down the price of advertising, arguing that like click fraud, impressions served to users who use ad blockers are of little to no value to advertisers. Consequently, they argue, eliminating ad blocking would not increase overall ad revenue to content providers in the long run. Business models Tools that help block ads have to work on different business models to stay in operation: * Free and open source: Several tools work under a FOSS model, powered by community contributions and donations. Eg. uBlock Origin * Whitelisting: Companies have resorted to maintaining a whitelist against a share of the ad revenue to allow \\"acceptable ads\\". This Business model has faced a lot of criticism. Eg. AdBlock Plus * Subscription/Upfront: Some companies in this field have started a subscription or upfront payment model for the tools. Eg. Wipr * Freemium: Other companies offer some level of service for free while charge for additional features. Eg. AdGuard Response from publishers =Countermeasures= Some websites have taken countermeasures against ad blocking software, such as attempting to detect the presence of ad blockers and informing users of their views, or outright preventing users from accessing the content unless they disable the ad blocking software, whitelist the website, or buy an \\"ad-removal pass\\". There have been several arguments supporting and opposing the assertion that blocking ads is wrong. The back-and-forth elevation of technologies used for ad-blocking and countering ad-blocking have been equated to an \\"ad blocking war\\" or \\"arms race\\" between all parties. It has been suggested that in the European Union, the practice of websites scanning for ad blocking software may run afoul of the E-Privacy Directive. This claim was further validated by IAB Europe's guidelines released in June 2016 stating that there indeed may be a legal issue in ad blocker detection. While some anti-blocking stakeholders have tried to refute this it seems safe to assume that Publishers should follow the guidelines provided by the main Publisher lobby IAB. The joint effort announced by IAB Sweden prior to IAB Europe's guideline on the matter never materialized, and would have most likely been found against European anti-competition laws if it did. In August 2017, a vendor of such counter- measures issued a demand under section 1201 of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to demand the removal of a domain name associated with their service from an ad-blocking filter list. The vendor argued that the domain constituted a component of a technological protection measure designed to protect a copyrighted work, and thus made it a violation of anti-circumvention law to frustrate access to it. =Alternatives= As of 2015, advertisers and marketers look to involve their brands directly into the entertainment with native advertising and product placement (also known as brand integration or embedded marketing). An example of product placement would be for a soft drink manufacturer to pay a reality TV show producer to have the show's cast and host appear onscreen holding cans of the soft drink. Another common product placement is for an automotive manufacturer to give free cars to the producers of a TV show, in return for the show's producer depicting characters using these vehicles during the show. Some digital publications turned to their customers for help as a form of tip jar. For example, the Guardian is asking its readers for donations to help offset falling advertising revenue. According to the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, the newspaper gets about the same amount of money from membership and paying readers as it does from advertising. The newspaper considered preventing readers from accessing its content if usage of ad-blocking software becomes widespread, but so far it keeps the content accessible for readers who employ ad-blockers. A new service called Scroll, launched in January 2020, worked with several leading website publishers to create a subscription model for ad-free browsing across all supported websites. Users would pay Scroll directly, and portions of the subscription fees are dolled out to the websites based on proportional view count.

It succeeded the MIPS/IRIX-based Origin 3000 servers. Columbia supercomputer was based on Altix products alt=Big data center History The line was first announced on January 7, 2003, with the Altix 3000 series, based on Intel Itanium 2 processors and SGI's NUMAlink processor interconnect. At product introduction, the system supported up to 64 processors running Linux as a single system image and shipped with a Linux distribution called SGI Advanced Linux Environment, which was compatible with Red Hat Advanced Server. By August 2003, many SGI Altix customers were running Linux on 128- and even 256-processor SGI Altix systems.SGI aims high with Altix machine - CNET News SGI officially announced 256-processor support within a single system image of Linux on March 10, 2004 using a 2.4-based Linux kernel. The SGI Advanced Linux Environment was eventually dropped after support using a standard, unmodified SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) distribution for SGI Altix was provided with SLES 8 and SLES 9. Later, SGI Altix 512-processor systems were officially supported using an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 9 SP1. Besides full support of SGI Altix on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, a standard and unmodified Red Hat Enterprise Linux was also fully supported starting with SGI Altix 3700 Bx2 with RHEL 4Certification - Altix 3700 Bx2 and RHEL 5Certification - Altix 3700 bx2 with system processor limits defined by Red Hat for those releases. On November 14, 2005, SGI introduced the Altix 4000 series based on the Itanium 2.Silicon Graphics, Inc. (14 November 2005). SGI Launches New Flagship Altix 4000 Platform. (Press release). The Altix 3000 and 4000 are distributed shared memory multiprocessors. SGI later officially supported 1024-processor systems on an unmodified, standard Linux distribution with the launch of SLES 10 in July 2006. SGI Altix 4700 was also officially supported by Red Hat with RHEL 4Certification - Altix 4700 and RHEL 5Certification - Altix 4700 -- maximum processor limits were as defined by Red Hat for its RHEL releases. The Altix brand was used for systems based on multi-core Intel Xeon processors. These include the Altix XE rackmount servers, Altix ICE blade servers and Altix UV supercomputers. NASA's Columbia supercomputer, installed in 2004 and decommissioned in 2013, was a 10240-microprocessor cluster of twenty Altix 3000 systems, each with 512 microprocessors, interconnected with InfiniBand.  Altix 3000  The Altix 3000 was the first generation of Altix systems. It was succeeded by the Altix 4000 in 2004, and the last model was discontinued on December 31, 2006. = Altix 330 = The Altix 330 is an entry-level server. Unlike the high-end models, the Altix 330 is not \\"brick\\" based, but is instead based on 1U-high compute modules mounted in a rack and connected with NUMAlink. A single system may contain 1 to 16 Itanium 2 processors and 2 to 128 GB of memory. The Altix 1330 is a cluster of Altix 330 systems. The systems are networked with Gigabit Ethernet or 4X InfiniBand. = Altix 350 = The Altix 350 is a mid-range model that supports up to 32 Itanium 2 processors. Introduced in 2005, it runs Linux, rather than SGI's own Unix variant, IRIX. The Altix 350 is scalable from one to thirty-two 64-bit Intel Itanium processors. It features DDR SDRAM and PCI-X expansion ports, and can support SCSI or SATA internal hard drives. Designed as a rack-mount server, the Altix 350 is 2U, meaning it occupies two slots vertically in a standard server rack. The Altix 1350 is a cluster of Altix 350 systems. , the Altix 350 was superseded by the Altix 450 (based on the Itanium 2) and the Altix XE (based on the Xeon). = Altix 3300 = The Altix 3300 is a mid-range model supporting 4 to 12 processors and 2 to 48 GB of memory. It is packaged in a short (17U) rack. = Altix 3700 = The Altix 3700 is a high-end model supporting 16 to 512 processors and 8 GB to 2 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (39U) rack(s). A variant of the Altix 3000 with graphics capability is known as the Prism. The 3700 is based on the third generation NUMAflex distributed shared memory architecture and it uses the NUMAlink 4 interconnection fabric. The Altix 3000 supports a single system image of 64 processors. If there are more than 64 processors in a system, then the system must be partitioned. The basic building block is called a C-brick, which contains two nodes in a 4U high rackmount unit. Each node contains two Intel Itanium 2 processors that connect to the Super-Bedrock application- specific integrated circuit through a single front-side bus. The Super-Bedrock is a crossbar switch for the processors, the local RAM, the network interface and the I/O interface. The two Super-Bedrock ASICs in each brick are connected internally by a single 6.4 GB/s NUMAlink 4 channel. A processor node also contains 16 DIMM slots that accept standard DDR DIMMs with capacities of 4 to 16 GB. = Altix 3700 Bx2 = The Altix 3700 Bx2 is a high-end model supporting 16 to 2,048 Itanium 2 processors and 12 GB to 24 TB of memory. It requires one or multiple tall (40U) rack(s).  Altix 4000  SGI Altix 4700 machines in the H√∂chstleistungsrechner Bayern II The Altix 4000 is Silicon Graphics' next Itanium-based product line. It has two models, the Altix 450, a mid-range server, and the Altix 4700, a high-end server. An Altix 4700 system contains up to 2048 dual-core Itanium 2 and Itanium (\\"Montvale\\" revision) microprocessor sockets, connected by the NUMAlink 4 interconnect in a fat tree network topology.SGI Altix 4700: Configurations The microprocessors are accompanied by up to 128 TB of memory (192TB with single microprocessor socket blades and 16GB DIMMs). Each node is contained within a blade that plugs into an enclosure, the individual rack unit (IRU). The IRU is a 10U enclosure that contains the necessary components to support the blades such as the power supplies, two router boards (one for every five blades) and a L1 controller. Each IRU can support ten single-wide blades or two double-wide blades and eight single-width blades. The IRUs are mounted in 42U-high rack, and each rack supports up to four IRUs. Two types of node, processor and memory, are contained within a blade. Compute blades contain a processor node and consist of two PAC611 sockets for Itanium 2 and Itanium microprocessors, a Super-Hub (SHub) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) (chipset) and eight dual in-line memory module (DIMM) slots for memory. The number of microprocessor sockets in a compute blade is one or two. One-processor socket configurations provide more bandwidth as only one microprocessor socket is using the front side bus and local memory. Two-processor socket configurations do not support hyperthreading. Memory blades are used to expand the amount of memory without increasing the number of processors. They contain a SHub ASIC and 12 DIMM slots. Both compute and memory blades support 1, 2 4, 8, and 16 GB DIMMs. SGI support does not support any installations with 16GB DIMMs. Multiple servers can be combined on the same Numalink fabric up to the theoretical maximum of 8,192 nodes (16,384 OS CPUs).  Altix XE  The Altix XE servers use Intel Xeon x86-64-architecture processors. Models include: * The Altix XE210 server supports up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, 1 x PCIe x8 (low profile) and 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height) PCI slots, and Three SATA/SAS drive bays. * The Altix XE240 server supports up to two Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series, 32GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory, two PCI slots configuration options (option 1: 2 x PCIe x4 (low profile), 2 x PCIe x4 (full height), 1 x PCEe x8 (full height); or option 2: 2 x PCIe x4 (low profile), 3 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height), 1 x PCI-X 133 MHz (full height), and Five SATA/SAS drive bays. * The Altix XE250 server * The Altix XE270 server is a 2U configuration with Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, with a choice of up to 18 DDR3 DIMMs (2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x8 gen 2 (low profile), 1 x PCIe x4 gen 1 (low profile), 2 x PCI-x 133/100 (low profile) PCI slots, Eight SATA or SAS drive bays with optional hardware RAID (0, 1, 5, 6, 10), * The Altix XE310 server was introduced January 8, 2007 and contains two nodes per XE310, up to four Dual or Quad-Core Intel Xeon processors, 5100 Series or 5300 series (two per node), 64GB DDR2 667 MHz FBDIMM memory (32GB per node), 2 x PCIe x8 (1 per node) PCI slots, and Four SATA/SAS drive bays (two per node). * The Altix XE320 server * The Altix XE340 server contains 2 compute nodes within a 1U configuration, Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, Choice of up to 12 DDR3 DIMMs per node (2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x16 (1 per node) - low profile PCI slot, and Four SATA drive bays (2 per node) with optional SAS and hardware RAID 0, 1. * The Altix XE500 server is a 3U configuration with Intel Xeon processor 5500 series, with a choice of up to 18 DDR3 DIMMs (2GB, 4GB, or 8GB DIMMs), 2 x PCIe x16 gen2 (full height) and 4 x PCIe x8 gen2 (full height) PCI slots, and Eight SATA or SAS drives with optional hardware RAID (0, 1, 5, 6, 10). * The Altix XE1200 cluster * The Altix XE1300 cluster All Altix XE systems support Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Microsoft Windows. VMware support was added across the Altix XE product line.  Altix ICE  The Altix ICE blade platform is an Intel Xeon-based system featuring diskless compute blades and a Hierarchical Management Framework (HMF) for scalability, performance, and resiliency. While the earlier Itanium-based Altix systems run a single-system image (SSI) Linux kernel on 1024 processors or more using a standard SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) distribution, the Altix ICE's clustering capabilities use standard SLES or Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions and scale to over 51,200 cores on NASA's Pleiades supercomputer. The Altix ICE 8200LX blade enclosure features two 4x DDR IB switch blade and one high-performing plane, while the Altix ICE 8200EX features four 4x DDR IB switch blades, and two high-performing planes.

H. Keane (born Peggy Doris Hawkins, September 15, 1927) is an American artist known for her paintings of subjects with big eyes. She mainly paints women, children, or animals in oil or mixed media. The work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates, and cups. It has been critically acclaimed. The artwork was originally attributed to Keane's husband, Walter Keane. After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after a court \\"paint-off\\" in Hawaii. A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane's work followed the release of Tim Burton's 2014 biopic Big Eyes. She maintains a gallery in San Francisco which boasts \\"the largest collection of Margaret Keane's art in the entire world.\\" In light of the great gulf between her work's popularity and its critical lampooning, she has been called the \\"Wayne Newton of the art world.\\" Early life Peggy Doris Hawkins was born September 15, 1927 in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, her eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them. Keane started drawing as a child, and at age 10 she took classes at the Watkins Institute in Nashville. Keane painted her first oil painting of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, when she was 10 years old and gave the drawing to her grandmother. Keane lost the painting in a poker game when she was 12. She was well known at the local church for her sketches of angels with big eyes and floppy wings. At age 18 she attended the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year. She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits. Early on, Margaret began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic and oil-based paints, with the subject of her artwork limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses). Career =Career with Walter Keane= Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. As Walter Keane told the story when he was at the height of his popularity, he saw her sitting alone at a \\"well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes. At the time Walter was also married, worked as a real estate salesman and painted on the side. He would later tell reporters, however, that he had given up his \\"highly successful real estate career\\" in 1947. Margaret found him \\"suave, gregarious and charming.\\" The two married in 1955 in Honolulu. Margaret has said that he began selling her characteristic \\"big eyes\\" paintings immediately, but unknown to her, claimed it was his own work. The principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a comedy club in San Francisco. When she discovered his deception, she remained silent. She later explained her behavior: \\"I was afraid of him because he [threatened] to have me done in if I said anything.\\" But Margaret even publicly acknowledged him as the artist, while later claiming it was \\"tortuous\\" for her. She rationalized the situation on the ground that \\"[a]t least they were being shown.\\" In 1957 Walter began exhibiting the \\"big eyes\\" paintings as his own. In February the work was shown on a wall of the Bank of America in Sausalito. He took nine paintings to New Orleans, which he claims to have sold during Mardi Gras. That summer Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another in a small East Side gallery for the same month. Walter began developing a mythology about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began promotions of \\"The Painting Keanes.\\" In the 1960s, Keane became one of the most popular and commercially successful artists of the time. Andy Warhol said \\"I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it.\\" On the other hand, when one of the exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, announced that it would exhibit Keane's Tomorrow Forever, a painting of a countless number of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground where they lined up on a staircase, the New York Times art critic expressed outrage, calling it \\"[t]he most grotesque announcement yet from the New York World's Fair.\\" He described Keane as a painter celebrated \\"for grinding out formula pictures of wide-eyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work. [The painting] contains about 100 children and hence is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane.\\" Robert Moses, stung by the resulting criticism, prevented the painting from being displayed at the Fair. During this time her artwork was sold under the name of her husband, Walter Keane, who claimed credit for her paintings. At the height of the artworks' popularity, she was painting non-stop for 16 hours a day. =Career after Walter Keane= In 1970, Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Keane revealed the truth, a \\"paint-out\\" between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco's Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up. In 1986, she sued both Walter and USA Today in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict Keane said \\"I really feel that justice has triumphed. It's been worth it, even if I don't see any of that four million dollars.\\" A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damage award. Keane says she doesn't care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings. The artworks Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation, became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. \\"The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul,\\" Keane explains.\\"My Life as a Famous Artist,\\" Awake!, July 8, 1975 Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having \\"tears of joy\\" or \\"tears of happiness.\\" She described her subjects thus: \\"These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God's will is done.\\" Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits. In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector and director of the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie. Keane's art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation. Keane's big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls. Style Keane's paintings are recognizable by the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects. Keane says she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature \\"Keane eyes\\" when she started painting portraits of children. \\"Children do have big eyes. When I'm doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger,\\" Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more. Keane attributes Amedeo Modigliani's work as a major influence on the way she has painted women since 1959. Other artists who influenced her in use of color, dimension and composition include Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt and Picasso. Despite her claims to fine art, she has never been a critical success; instead she remained \\"known for her sticky-sweet paintings of doe-eyed waifs that became the middlebrow rage in the late 1950s and 1960s, then kitschy collectibles of high-ironic style decades later.\\" Personal life Keane's first husband was Frank Richard Ulbrich, and they had a daughter together. In 1955, she married Walter Keane. In 1964, she left Walter and divorced him a year later, causing her relocation from San Francisco to Hawaii. In Hawaii, Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970.\\"Big Eyes and All: The Unofficial Biography of Margaret Keane,\\" page 27 She credits McGuire for helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter. Keane lived in Hawaii for more than 25 years before returning to California in 1991. She currently resides in Napa County, California, with her daughter Jane and son-in-law Don Swigert. In 2017 at the age of 90, Keane began hospice care. She is a Jehovah's Witness. Media portrayal * In 1973, Woody Allen's comedy Sleeper features people of the future, who consider Keane to be one of the greatest artists in history, although the people in the future depicted in the film attribute the paintings to Walter, not Margaret. * In the 1977 Steven Spielberg drama Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a Big Eyes print hangs over the Neary's piano. * In 1998, cartoon series The Powerpuff Girls by animator Craig McCracken debuts, featuring leads based on Keane's \\"waifs\\" and a character (specifically the leads' teacher) named \\"Ms. Keane\\". * In 1999, Matthew Sweet's album In Reverse features one of Keane's oil paintings on its cover. * In the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter are the main focus of the film. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz. The film was directed by Tim Burton.‚ÄúThe big-eyed children: the extraordinary story of an epic art fraud‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Guardian,\\" October 26, 2014, Retrieved 2014-10-28. Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams' and Waltz's characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.

Like many software houses established in the 1980s, their primary market was the 8-bit range of computers such as the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Commodore 16 and Commodore 64. The company was acquired by French video game publisher Infogrames in 1999, and was renamed Infogrames Studios in 2000. Infogrames Studios closed down in 2003.  History  The company, originally a computer store called Just Micro, was established as a software house in 1984 with the name Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd by Ian Stewart & Kevin Norburn. Gremlin's early success was based on games such as Wanted: Monty Mole for the ZX Spectrum and Thing on a Spring for the Commodore 64. In 1994, it was renamed as Gremlin Interactive, now concentrating on the 16-bit, PC and console market. Gremlin enjoyed major success with the Zool and Premier Manager series in the early 1990s, and then with Actua Soccer, the first football game in full 3D; other successful games included the Lotus racing series; a futuristic racing game, Motorhead; a stunt car racing game, Fatal Racing (1995); and the 1998 flight simulator Hardwar. Following EA's success with the EA Sports brand, Gremlin also released their own sports videogame series, adding Golf, Tennis and Ice Hockey to their Actua Sports series. During this time, they used a motif from the Siegfried Funeral March from G√∂tterd√§mmerung as introductory music. The company was floated on the stock market to raise funds. In 1997, Gremlin acquired Imagitec Design and DMA Design (creators of Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings).

History The company was first established as Milbarn Productions on March 7, 1963 and later as Merv Griffin Productions on March 5, 1964. Griffin's first production under the Milbarn name was Word for Word. Griffin's second game show was Jeopardy! as Griffin's first production under the MGP name on March 30, 1964. In May 1965, his talk show The Merv Griffin Show returned to television. Griffin also created the game show Shopper's Bazaar, which changed its name to Wheel of Fortune on January 6, 1975 after Jeopardy! was canceled on January 3, 1975. Griffin revived Jeopardy! as The All-New Jeopardy! on October 2, 1978, though it was proven to be unsuccessful. Merv Griffin Productions also owned the post-production studio Trans-American Video (TAV) that was founded on June 29, 1981.Google Books ‚Äì Lights, Camera, Computers! InfoWorld, June 20, 1983 In 1982, the company joined forces with King World (now CBS Television Distribution) to syndicate a nightly version of Wheel of Fortune. The company also had the rights to syndicate The Merv Griffin Show until 1986 when Columbia Pictures Television distributed the final episodes. KW also distributed the first two pilots of Jeopardy! in 1983 and January 9, 1984. In 1984, Griffin expanded his company as Merv Griffin Enterprises and during the same year, Jeopardy! also returned to television on September 10. On May 5, 1986, Griffin sold the company to The Coca-Cola Company (then-owner of Columbia Pictures Industries) for $250 million during his semi-retirement. TAV however, was not included in the deal. The company later became part of Columbia Pictures Entertainment on December 21, 1987 , and was sold to Sony Corporation along with CPE's other companies on November 8, 1989. Merv Griffin Enterprises was folded into Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television) on June 4, 1994.

He was known to European-Americans as the Half-King, a title also used to describe several other historically important Native American leaders. His name has been spelled in a variety of ways. Early life Little is known of Tanacharison's early life. He may have been born into the Catawba tribe about 1700 near what is now Buffalo, New York. As a child, he was taken captive by the French and later adopted into the Seneca tribe, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. He would later claim that the French boiled and ate his father. His early years were spent on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie in what is now western New York state. Becoming a leader Tanacharison first appears in historical records in 1747, living in Logstown (near present Ambridge, Pennsylvania), a multi-ethnic village about 20 miles (30 kilometers) downstream from the forks of the Ohio River. Those Iroquois who had migrated to the Ohio Country were generally known as 'Mingos,' and Tanacharison emerged as a Mingo leader at this time. He also represented the Six Nations at the 1752 Treaty of Logstown, where he was referred to as \\"Thonariss, called by the English the half King\\". At this treaty, he spoke on behalf of the Six Nations' Grand Council, but also made clear that the Council's ratification was required, in accordance with the Iroquois system of government. According to the traditional interpretation, the Grand Council had named Tanacharison as leader or \\"half-king\\" (a sort of viceroy) to conduct diplomacy with other tribes, and to act as spokesman to the British on their behalf. However, some modern historians have doubted this interpretation, asserting that Tanacharison was merely a village leader, whose actual authority extended no further than his own village. In this view, the title \\"half king\\" was probably a British invention, and his \\"subsequent lofty historical role as a Six Nations 'regent' or 'viceroy' in the Ohio Country was the product of later generations of scholars.\\" French and Indian War In 1753, the French began the military occupation of the Ohio Country, driving out British traders and constructing a series of forts. British colonies, however, also claimed the Ohio Country. Robert Dinwiddie, the lieutenant governor of Virginia, sent a young George Washington to travel to the French outposts and demand that the French vacate the Ohio Country. On his journey, Washington's party stopped at Logstown to ask Tanacharison to accompany them as a guide and as a \\"spokesman\\" for the Ohio Indians. Tanacharison agreed to return the symbolic wampum he had received from French captain Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire. Joncaire's first reaction, on learning of this double cross, was to mutter of Tanacharison, \\"He is more English than the English.\\" But Joncaire masked his anger and insisted that Tanacharison join him in a series of toasts. By the time the keg was empty, Tanacharison was too drunk to hand back the wampum. Tanacharison travelled with Washington to meet with the French commander of Fort Le Boeuf in what is now Waterford, Pennsylvania. The French refused to vacate, however, and to Washington's great consternation, they tried to court Tanacharison as an ally. Although fond of their brandy, he remained a strong francophobe. Tanacharison had requested that the British construct a \\"strong house\\" at the Forks of the Ohio and early in 1754 he placed the first log of an Ohio Company stockade there, railing against the French when they captured it. He was camped at Half King's Rock on May 27, 1754 when he learned of a nearby French encampment and sent word urging an attack to Washington at the Great Meadows, about five miles (8 km) east of Chestnut Ridge in what is now Fayette County, Pennsylvania (near Uniontown). Washington immediately ordered 40 men to join Tanacharison and at sunset followed with a second group, seven of whom got lost in heavy rain that night. It was dawn on May 28th before Washington reached the Half King's Rock. After a hurried war council, the English and Tanacharison's eight or nine warriors set off to surround and attack the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen , who quickly surrendered. The French commander, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, was among the wounded. In one of several disputed and contradictory accounts, it is claimed that Tancharison uttered the French words, \\"Tu n'es pas encore mort, mon p√®re!\\" (Thou art not yet dead, my father), then sank his tomahawk in Jumonville's skull, washed his hands with the brains, \\"and scalped him,\\" but not before eating a portion of Jumonville's brain. Only one of the wounded French soldiers was not killed and scalped among a total of ten dead, 21 captured, and one missing, a man named Monceau who had wandered off to relieve himself that morning. Monceau witnessed the French surrender before walking barefoot to the Monongahela River and paddling down it to report to Contrecoeur, commanding at Fort Duquesne. Tanacharison sent a messenger to Contrecoeur the following day with news that the British had shot Jumonville and, but for the Indians, would have killed all the French. A third (and more accurate) account of the Jumonville Glen encounter was told to Jumonville's half-brother, Captain Louis Coulon de Villiers, by a deserter at the mouth of Redstone Creek during his expedition to avenge his brother's murder. Washington was without Indian allies at the battle of Fort Necessity on July 3, 1754, his hastily erected stockade at the Great Meadows. Tanacharison scornfully called it \\"that little thing upon the meadow\\" and complained that Washington would not listen to advice, and that Washington treated the Indians like slaves. He and another Seneca leader, Queen Aliquippa, had taken their people to Wills Creek. Outnumbered and with supplies running low, Washington surrendered the fort, later blaming Captains George Croghan and Andrew Montour for \\"involving the country in great calamity\\". Relationship with Croghan Tanacharison had a long relationship with George Croghan, a fur trader, interpreter, and diplomat among the Native Americans who had been appointed a member of the Iroquois' Onondaga Council. Tanacharison had been \\"one of the sachems who had confirmed Croghan in his land grant of 1749,\\" 200,000 acres minus about two square miles at the Forks of the Ohio for a British fort. Thomas Penn and Pennsylvania planned to build a stone fort, but Croghan realized that his deeds would be invalid if in Pennsylvania, and had Andrew Montour testify before the Assembly in 1751 that the Indians did not want the fort and that it had all been Croghan's idea, scuttling the project. In 1752, Croghan was on the Indian council that granted Virginia's Ohio Company permission to build the fort. Tanacharison's introduction of Croghan to the Virginia commissioners suggests that Croghan organized and led the 1748 Ohio Indian Confederation, which appointed Croghan as the colony's representative in negotiations, and that Pennsylvania recognized as independent of the Six Nations: > Brethren, it is a great while since our brother, the Buck (meaning Mr. > George Croghan)has been doing business between us, & our brother of > Pennsylvania, but we understand he does not intend to do any more, so I now > inform you that he is approv'd of by our Council at Onondago, for we sent to > them to let them know how he has helped us in our councils here and to let > you & him know that he is one of our people and shall help us still & be one > of our council, I deliver him this string of wampum. The Ohio Company fort was surrendered to the French by Croghan's half-brother, Edward Ward, and commanded by his business partner, William Trent. The role of Croghan (who was Pittsburgh's president judge for Virginia and chairman of Pittsburgh's Committee of Safety after Pontiac's Rebellion) remains uncertain, since Croghan was later declared a traitor by General Edward Hand and exiled from the frontier. Last days Shortly after the battle of Jumonville Glen, Tanacharison moved his people and the old queen Aliquippa east to Croghan's Aughwick plantation in the Aughwick Valley near present Shirleysburg, Pennsylvania. There Tanacharison became seriously ill and was taken to the farm of John Harris at Paxtang, Pennsylvania (near present-day Harrisburg, Pennsylvania). He would take no active part in the remainder of the war and died of pneumonia on October 4, 1754. Aliquippa died on December 23, 1754.

These records can be shared across different health care settings. Records are shared through network-connected, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges. EHRs may include a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics like age and weight, and billing information. A decade ago, electronic health records (EHRs) were touted as key to increasing of quality care. Today, providers are using data from patient records to improve quality outcomes through their care management programs. Combining multiple types of clinical data from the system's health records has helped clinicians identify and stratify chronically ill patients. EHR can improve quality care by using the data and analytics to prevent hospitalizations among high-risk patients. EHR systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient across time. It eliminates the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical records and assists in ensuring data is accurate and legible. It can reduce risk of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely up to date, and decreases risk of lost paperwork. Due to the digital information being searchable and in a single file, EMRs (electronic medical records) are more effective when extracting medical data for the examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient. Population-based studies of medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs. Terminology The terms EHR, electronic patient record (EPR) and EMR have often been used interchangeably, although differences between the models are now being defined. The electronic health record (EHR) is a more longitudinal collection of the electronic health information of individual patients or populations. The EMR, in contrast, is the patient record created by providers for specific encounters in hospitals and ambulatory environments, and which can serve as a data source for an EHR. In contrast, a personal health record (PHR) is an electronic application for recording personal medical data that the individual patient controls and may make available to health providers. Comparison with paper-based records While there is still a considerable amount of debate around the superiority of electronic health records over paper records, the research literature paints a more realistic picture of the benefits and downsides. The increased transparency, portability, and accessibility acquired by the adoption of electronic medical records may increase the ease with which they can be accessed by healthcare professionals, but also can increase the amount of stolen information by unauthorized persons or unscrupulous users versus paper medical records, as acknowledged by the increased security requirements for electronic medical records included in the Health Information and Accessibility Act and by large-scale breaches in confidential records reported by EMR users.\\"Griffin Hospital reports of dozens of patient medical records breaches\\", CtPost.com, 29 March 2010Kate Ramunni; \\"UCLA hospital scandal grows\\" Los Angeles Times, 5 August 2008 Concerns about security contribute to the resistance shown to their adoption. Handwritten paper medical records may be poorly legible, which can contribute to medical errors. Pre-printed forms, standardization of abbreviations and standards for penmanship were encouraged to improve the reliability of paper medical records. Electronic records may help with the standardization of forms, terminology and data input. Digitization of forms facilitates the collection of data for epidemiology and clinical studies.\\"Health Information Exchanges and Your EMR Selection Process\\", New England Journal of Medicine, 25 January 2011 However, standardization may create challenges for local practice. Overall, those with EMRs, that have automated notes and records, order entry, and clinical decision support had fewer complications, lower mortality rates, and lower costs. EMRs can be continuously updated (within certain legal limitations ‚Äì see below). If the ability to exchange records between different EMR systems were perfected (\\"interoperability\\"Adapted from the IEEE definition of interoperability, and legal definitions used by the FCC (47 CFR 51.3), in statutes regarding copyright protection (17 USC 1201), and e-government services (44 USC 3601)), it would facilitate the coordination of health care delivery in non-affiliated health care facilities. In addition, data from an electronic system can be used anonymously for statistical reporting in matters such as quality improvement, resource management, and public health communicable disease surveillance. However, it is difficult to remove data from its context. Emergency medical services (pre-hospital care) Ambulance services in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom have introduced the use of EMR systems.EMR in Ambulances, \\"Emergency Medical Paramedic\\", 5 May 2011. Retrieved 4 June 2011.Porter A, Badshah A, Black S, Fitzpatrick D, Harris-Mayes R, Islam S, Jones M, Kingston M, LaFlamme-Williams Y, Mason S, McNee K, Morgan H, Morrison Z, Mountain P, Potts H, Rees N, Shaw D, Siriwardena N, Snooks H, Spaight R, Williams V (2020). Electronic health records in ambulances: the ERA multiple-methods study. Health Services and Delivery Research, 8(10). EMS Encounters in the United States are recorded using various platforms and vendors in compliance with the NEMSIS (National EMS Information System) standard. The benefits of electronic records in ambulances include: patient data sharing, injury/illness prevention, better training for paramedics, review of clinical standards, better research options for pre-hospital care and design of future treatment options, data based outcome improvement, and clinical decision support.Ambulance Victoria Annual Report , \\"Ambulance Victoria\\", 4 October 2009.

Technical features * Digital formatting enables information to be used and shared over secure networks * Track care (e.g. prescriptions) and outcomes (e.g. blood pressure) * Trigger warnings and reminders * Send and receive orders, reports, and results * Decrease billing processing time and create more accurate billing system Health Information Exchange * Technical and social framework that enables information to move electronically between organizations Using an EMR to read and write a patient's record is not only possible through a workstation but, depending on the type of system and health care settings, may also be possible through mobile devices that are handwriting capable, tablets and smartphones. Electronic Medical Records may include access to Personal Health Records (PHR) which makes individual notes from an EMR readily visible and accessible for consumers. Some EMR systems automatically monitor clinical events, by analyzing patient data from an electronic health record to predict, detect and potentially prevent adverse events. This can include discharge/transfer orders, pharmacy orders, radiology results, laboratory results and any other data from ancillary services or provider notes. This type of event monitoring has been implemented using the Louisiana Public health information exchange linking statewide public health with electronic medical records. This system alerted medical providers when a patient with HIV/AIDS had not received care in over twelve months. This system greatly reduced the number of missed critical opportunities. Philosophical views of the EHR Within a meta-narrative systematic review of research in the field, there exist a number of different philosophical approaches to the EHR. The health information systems literature has seen the EHR as a container holding information about the patient, and a tool for aggregating clinical data for secondary uses (billing, audit etc.). However, other research traditions see the EHR as a contextualised artifact within a socio-technical system. For example, actor-network theory would see the EHR as an actant in a network, while research in computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) sees the EHR as a tool supporting particular work. Several possible advantages to EHRs over paper records have been proposed, but there is debate about the degree to which these are achieved in practice. Implementation, end user and patient considerations =Quality= Several studies call into question whether EHRs improve the quality of care.Electronic health records not a panacea One 2011 study in diabetes care, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found evidence that practices with EHR provided better quality care. EMRs may eventually help improve care coordination. An article in a trade journal suggests that since anyone using an EMR can view the patient's full chart, it cuts down on guessing histories, seeing multiple specialists, smooths transitions between care settings, and may allow better care in emergency situations. EHRs may also improve prevention by providing doctors and patients better access to test results, identifying missing patient information, and offering evidence-based recommendations for preventive services. =Costs= The steep price of EHR and provider uncertainty regarding the value they will derive from adoption in the form of return on investment has a significant influence on EHR adoption. In a project initiated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information (ONC), surveyors found that hospital administrators and physicians who had adopted EHR noted that any gains in efficiency were offset by reduced productivity as the technology was implemented, as well as the need to increase information technology staff to maintain the system. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office concluded that the cost savings may occur only in large integrated institutions like Kaiser Permanente, and not in small physician offices. They challenged the Rand Corporation's estimates of savings. \\"Office-based physicians in particular may see no benefit if they purchase such a product‚Äîand may even suffer financial harm. Even though the use of health IT could generate cost savings for the health system at large that might offset the EHR's cost, many physicians might not be able to reduce their office expenses or increase their revenue sufficiently to pay for it. For example, the use of health IT could reduce the number of duplicated diagnostic tests. However, that improvement in efficiency would be unlikely to increase the income of many physicians.\\"Evidence on the costs and benefits of health information technology. Congressional Budget Office, May 2008. One CEO of an EHR company has argued if a physician performs tests in the office, it might reduce his or her income. Doubts have been raised about cost saving from EHRs by researchers at Harvard University, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and others.Information Technology: Not a Cure for the High Cost of Health Care. Knowledge@Wharton, June 10, 2009.Abraham Verghese. The Myth of Prevention. The Wall Street Journal, June 20, 2009. = Time = The implementation of EMR can potentially decrease identification time of patients upon hospital admission. A research from the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that since the adoption of EMR a relative decrease in time by 65% has been recorded (from 130 to 46 hours). =Software quality and usability deficiencies= The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, a very large U.S. healthcare IT industry trade group, observed in 2009 that EHR adoption rates \\"have been slower than expected in the United States, especially in comparison to other industry sectors and other developed countries. A key reason, aside from initial costs and lost productivity during EMR implementation, is lack of efficiency and usability of EMRs currently available.\\"Defining and Testing EMR Usability. Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, June 2009. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Department of Commerce studied usability in 2011 and lists a number of specific issues that have been reported by health care workers.NISTIR 7804: Technical Evaluation, Testing and Validation of the Usability of Electronic Health Records, p. 9‚Äì10. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Sept. 2011. The U.S. military's EHR, AHLTA, was reported to have significant usability issues. Furthermore, studies such as the one conducted in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, also showed that although the implementation of electronic medical records systems has been a great assistance to general practitioners there is still much room for revision in the overall framework and the amount of training provided. It was observed that the efforts to improve EHR usability should be placed in the context of physician-patient communication. However, physicians are embracing mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets at a rapid pace. According to a 2012 survey by Physicians Practice, 62.6 percent of respondents (1,369 physicians, practice managers, and other healthcare providers) say they use mobile devices in the performance of their job. Mobile devices are increasingly able to sync up with electronic health record systems thus allowing physicians to access patient records from remote locations. Most devices are extensions of desk-top EHR systems, using a variety of software to communicate and access files remotely. The advantages of instant access to patient records at any time and any place are clear, but bring a host of security concerns. As mobile systems become more prevalent, practices will need comprehensive policies that govern security measures and patient privacy regulations.\\"EHRs Go Mobile\\" Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, July/August 2012. = Hardware and workflow considerations = When a health facility has documented their workflow and chosen their software solution they must then consider the hardware and supporting device infrastructure for the end users. Staff and patients will need to engage with various devices throughout a patient's stay and charting workflow. Computers, laptops, all-in-one computers, tablets, mouse, keyboards and monitors are all hardware devices that may be utilized. Other considerations will include supporting work surfaces and equipment, wall desks or articulating arms for end users to work on. Another important factor is how all these devices will be physically secured and how they will be charged that staff can always utilize the devices for EHR charting when needed. The success of eHealth interventions is largely dependent on the ability of the adopter to fully understand workflow and anticipate potential clinical processes prior to implementations. Failure to do so can create costly and time-consuming interruptions to service delivery. =Unintended consequences= Per empirical research in social informatics, information and communications technology (ICT) use can lead to both intended and unintended consequences.Kling, Rosenbaum, Sawyer, Indiana University.

Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences. , 1997. A 2008 Sentinel Event Alert from the U.S. Joint Commission, the organization that accredits American hospitals to provide healthcare services, states that \\"As health information technology (HIT) and 'converging technologies'‚Äîthe interrelationship between medical devices and HIT‚Äîare increasingly adopted by health care organizations, users must be mindful of the safety risks and preventable adverse events that these implementations can create or perpetuate. Technology-related adverse events can be associated with all components of a comprehensive technology system and may involve errors of either commission or omission. These unintended adverse events typically stem from human-machine interfaces or organization/system design.\\" The Joint Commission cites as an example the United States Pharmacopeia MEDMARX databaseMEDMARX Adverse Drug Event Reporting database where of 176,409 medication error records for 2006, approximately 25 percent (43,372) involved some aspect of computer technology as at least one cause of the error. The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK reports specific examples of potential and actual EHR-caused unintended consequences in their 2009 document on the management of clinical risk relating to the deployment and use of health software.Health informatics ‚Äì Guidance on the management of clinical risk relating to the deployment and use of health software (formerly ISO/TR 29322:2008(E)). DSCN18/2009, Examples of potential harm presented by health software, Annex A, p. 38 . In a February 2010 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) memorandum, FDA notes EHR unintended consequences include EHR-related medical errors due to (1) errors of commission (EOC), (2) errors of omission or transmission (EOT), (3) errors in data analysis (EDA), and (4) incompatibility between multi-vendor software applications or systems (ISMA) and cites examples. In the memo FDA also notes the \\"absence of mandatory reporting enforcement of H-IT safety issues limits the numbers of medical device reports (MDRs) and impedes a more comprehensive understanding of the actual problems and implications.\\"FDA memo.

Memo obtained and released by Fred Schulte and Emma Schwartz at the Huffington Post Investigative Fund, now part of the Center for Public Integrity, in a 3 August 2010 article FDA, Obama digital medical records team at odds over safety oversight , memo itself A 2010 Board Position Paper by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) contains recommendations on EHR-related patient safety, transparency, ethics education for purchasers and users, adoption of best practices, and re-examination of regulation of electronic health applications. Beyond concrete issues such as conflicts of interest and privacy concerns, questions have been raised about the ways in which the physician- patient relationship would be affected by an electronic intermediary.Rowe JC. Doctors Go Digital. The New Atlantis (2011). During the implementation phase, cognitive workload for healthcare professionals may be significantly increased as they become familiar with a new system. EHRs are almost invariably detrimental to physician productivity, whether the data is entered during the encounter or at some time thereafter. While it is possible for an EHR to increase physician productivity by providing a fast and intuitive interface for viewing and understanding patient clinical data, while minimizing the amount of clinically irrelevant questions, this is almost never the case. The other way to mitigate the detriment to physician productivity is to hire scribes to work alongside medical practitioners, which is almost never financially viable. As a result, many have conducted studies like the one discussed in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association \\"The Extent And Importance of Unintended Consequences Related To Computerized Provider Order Entry\\", which seeks to understand the degree and significance of unplanned adverse consequences related to computerized physician order entry and understand how to interpret adverse events and understand the importance of its management for the overall success of computer physician order entry. Governance, privacy and legal issues =Privacy concerns= In the United States, Great Britain, and Germany, the concept of a national centralized server model of healthcare data has been poorly received. Issues of privacy and security in such a model have been of concern. In the European Union (EU), a new directly binding instrument, a regulation of the European Parliament and of the council, was passed in 2016 to go into effect in 2018 to protect the processing of personal data, including that for purposes of health care, the General Data Protection Regulation. Threats to health care information can be categorized under three headings: * Human threats, such as employees or hackers * Natural and environmental threats, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and fires. * Technology failures, such as a system crashing These threats can either be internal, external, intentional and unintentional. Therefore, one will find health information systems professionals having these particular threats in mind when discussing ways to protect the health information of patients. It has been found that there is a lack of security awareness among health care professionals in countries such as Spain. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has developed a framework to mitigate the harm of these threats that is comprehensive but not so specific as to limit the options of healthcare professionals who may have access to different technology. Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was given Royal Assent in Canada on 13 April 2000 to establish rules on the use, disclosure and collection of personal information. The personal information includes both non-digital and electronic form. In 2002, PIPEDA extended to the health sector in Stage 2 of the law's implementation. There are four provinces where this law does not apply because its privacy law was considered similar to PIPEDA: Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom led to radical changes. NHS Digital and NHSX made changes, said to be only for the duration of the crisis, to the information sharing system GP Connect across England, meaning that patient records are shared across primary care. Only patients who have specifically opted out are excluded. =Legal issues= Liability Legal liability in all aspects of healthcare was an increasing problem in the 1990s and 2000s. The surge in the per capita number of attorneys in the USA and changes in the tort system caused an increase in the cost of every aspect of healthcare, and healthcare technology was no exception. Failure or damages caused during installation or utilization of an EHR system has been feared as a threat in lawsuits. Similarly, it's important to recognize that the implementation of electronic health records carries with it significant legal risks. This liability concern was of special concern for small EHR system makers. Some smaller companies may be forced to abandon markets based on the regional liability climate. Larger EHR providers (or government-sponsored providers of EHRs) are better able to withstand legal assaults. While there is no argument that electronic documentation of patient visits and data brings improved patient care, there is increasing concern that such documentation could open physicians to an increased incidence of malpractice suits. Disabling physician alerts, selecting from dropdown menus, and the use of templates can encourage physicians to skip a complete review of past patient history and medications, and thus miss important data. Another potential problem is electronic time stamps. Many physicians are unaware that EHR systems produce an electronic time stamp every time the patient record is updated. If a malpractice claim goes to court, through the process of discovery, the prosecution can request a detailed record of all entries made in a patient's electronic record. Waiting to chart patient notes until the end of the day and making addendums to records well after the patient visit can be problematic, in that this practice could result in less than accurate patient data or indicate possible intent to illegally alter the patient's record.\\"Can Technology Get You Sued?\\" Shelly K. Schwartz, Physicians Practice, March 2012. In some communities, hospitals attempt to standardize EHR systems by providing discounted versions of the hospital's software to local healthcare providers. A challenge to this practice has been raised as being a violation of Stark rules that prohibit hospitals from preferentially assisting community healthcare providers. In 2006, however, exceptions to the Stark rule were enacted to allow hospitals to furnish software and training to community providers, mostly removing this legal obstacle. Legal interoperability In cross-border use cases of EHR implementations, the additional issue of legal interoperability arises. Different countries may have diverging legal requirements for the content or usage of electronic health records, which can require radical changes to the technical makeup of the EHR implementation in question. (especially when fundamental legal incompatibilities are involved) Exploring these issues is therefore often necessary when implementing cross- border EHR solutions. Contribution under UN administration and accredited organizations The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) administration intentionally does not contribute to an internationally standardized view of medical records nor to personal health records. However, WHO contributes to minimum requirements definition for developing countries. The United Nations accredited standardisation body International Organization for Standardization (ISO) however has settled thorough word for standards in the scope of the HL7 platform for health care informatics. Respective standards are available with ISO/HL7 10781:2009 Electronic Health Record- System Functional Model, Release 1.1 and subsequent set of detailing standards. Medical data breach The majority of the countries in Europe have made a strategy for the development and implementation of the Electronic Health Record Systems. This would mean greater access to health records by numerous stakeholders, even from countries with lower levels of privacy protection. The forthcoming implementation of the Cross Border Health Directive and the EU Commission's plans to centralize all health records are of prime concern to the EU public who believe that the health care organizations and governments cannot be trusted to manage their data electronically and expose them to more threats. The idea of a centralized electronic health record system was poorly received by the public who are wary that governments may use of the system beyond its intended purpose. There is also the risk for privacy breaches that could allow sensitive health care information to fall into the wrong hands. Some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information. These safeguards add protection for records that are shared electronically and give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications. =Breach notification= The purpose of a personal data breach notification is to protect individuals so that they can take all the necessary actions to limit the undesirable effects of the breach and to motivate the organization to improve the security of the infrastructure to protect the confidentiality of the data. The US law requires the entities to inform the individuals in the event of breach while the EU Directive currently requires breach notification only when the breach is likely to adversely affect the privacy of the individual. Personal health data is valuable to individuals and is therefore difficult to make an assessment whether the breach will cause reputational or financial harm or cause adverse effects on one's privacy. The Breach notification law in the EU provides better privacy safeguards with fewer exemptions, unlike the US law which exempts unintentional acquisition, access, or use of protected health information and inadvertent disclosure under a good faith belief. Technical issues =Standards= * ASC X12 (EDI) ‚Äì transaction protocols used for transmitting patient data.

Common Data Model (in health data context) Common Data Model (CDM) is a specification that describes how data from multiple sources (e.g., multiple EHR systems) can be combined. Many CDMs use a relational model (e.g., the OMOP CDM). A relational CDM defines names of tables and table columns and restricts what values are valid. * Sentinel Common Data Model: Initially started as Mini-Sentinel in 2008.

Since 2015, by Health Care System Research Network. Customization Each healthcare environment functions differently, often in significant ways. It is difficult to create a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" EHR system. Many first generation EHRs were designed to fit the needs of primary care physicians, leaving certain specialties significantly less satisfied with their EHR system. An ideal EHR system will have record standardization but interfaces that can be customized to each provider environment. Modularity in an EHR system facilitates this. Many EHR companies employ vendors to provide customization. This customization can often be done so that a physician's input interface closely mimics previously utilized paper forms. At the same time they reported negative effects in communication, increased overtime, and missing records when a non-customized EMR system was utilized. Customizing the software when it is released yields the highest benefits because it is adapted for the users and tailored to workflows specific to the institution. Customization can have its disadvantages. There is, of course, higher costs involved to implementation of a customized system initially. More time must be spent by both the implementation team and the healthcare provider to understand the workflow needs. Development and maintenance of these interfaces and customizations can also lead to higher software implementation and maintenance costs.The Digital Office, September 2007, vol 2, no.9. HIMSS =Long-term preservation and storage of records= An important consideration in the process of developing electronic health records is to plan for the long-term preservation and storage of these records. The field will need to come to consensus on the length of time to store EHRs, methods to ensure the future accessibility and compatibility of archived data with yet-to-be developed retrieval systems, and how to ensure the physical and virtual security of the archives. Additionally, considerations about long-term storage of electronic health records are complicated by the possibility that the records might one day be used longitudinally and integrated across sites of care. Records have the potential to be created, used, edited, and viewed by multiple independent entities. These entities include, but are not limited to, primary care physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, and patients. Mandl et al. have noted that \\"choices about the structure and ownership of these records will have profound impact on the accessibility and privacy of patient information.\\" The required length of storage of an individual electronic health record will depend on national and state regulations, which are subject to change over time. Ruotsalainen and Manning have found that the typical preservation time of patient data varies between 20 and 100 years. In one example of how an EHR archive might function, their research \\"describes a co- operative trusted notary archive (TNA) which receives health data from different EHR-systems, stores data together with associated meta-information for long periods and distributes EHR-data objects. TNA can store objects in XML-format and prove the integrity of stored data with the help of event records, timestamps and archive e-signatures.\\" In addition to the TNA archive described by Ruotsalainen and Manning, other combinations of EHR systems and archive systems are possible. Again, overall requirements for the design and security of the system and its archive will vary and must function under ethical and legal principles specific to the time and place. While it is currently unknown precisely how long EHRs will be preserved, it is certain that length of time will exceed the average shelf-life of paper records. The evolution of technology is such that the programs and systems used to input information will likely not be available to a user who desires to examine archived data. One proposed solution to the challenge of long-term accessibility and usability of data by future systems is to standardize information fields in a time-invariant way, such as with XML language. Olhede and Peterson report that \\"the basic XML-format has undergone preliminary testing in Europe by a Spri project and been found suitable for EU purposes. Spri has advised the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish National Archive to issue directives concerning the use of XML as the archive-format for EHCR (Electronic Health Care Record) information.\\" =Synchronization of records= When care is provided at two different facilities, it may be difficult to update records at both locations in a co- ordinated fashion. Two models have been used to satisfy this problem: a centralized data server solution, and a peer-to-peer file synchronization program (as has been developed for other peer-to-peer networks). Synchronization programs for distributed storage models, however, are only useful once record standardization has occurred. Merging of already existing public healthcare databases is a common software challenge. The ability of electronic health record systems to provide this function is a key benefit and can improve healthcare delivery. eHealth and teleradiology The sharing of patient information between health care organizations and IT systems is changing from a \\"point to point\\" model to a \\"many to many\\" one. The European Commission is supporting moves to facilitate cross-border interoperability of e-health systems and to remove potential legal hurdles, as in the project www.epsos.eu/. To allow for global shared workflow, studies will be locked when they are being read and then unlocked and updated once reading is complete. Radiologists will be able to serve multiple health care facilities and read and report across large geographical areas, thus balancing workloads. The biggest challenges will relate to interoperability and legal clarity. In some countries it is almost forbidden to practice teleradiology. The variety of languages spoken is a problem and multilingual reporting templates for all anatomical regions are not yet available. However, the market for e-health and teleradiology is evolving more rapidly than any laws or regulations.Pohjonen H. Images can now cross borders, but what about the legislation? Diagnostic Imaging Europe. June/July 2010;26(4):16.  Russia  In 2011, Moscow's government launched a major project known as UMIAS as part of its electronic healthcare initiative. UMIAS - the Unified Medical Information and Analytical System - connects more than 660 clinics and over 23,600 medical practitioners in Moscow. UMIAS covers 9.5 million patients, contains more than 359 million patient records and supports more than 500,000 different transactions daily. Approximately 700,000 Muscovites use remote links to make appointments every week.https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/22776073/ European Union: Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare The European Commission wants to boost the digital economy by enabling all Europeans to have access to online medical records anywhere in Europe by 2020. With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020. However, the concept of a centralised supranational central server raises concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern. Cross-border and Interoperable electronic health record systems make confidential data more easily and rapidly accessible to a wider audience and increase the risk that personal data concerning health could be accidentally exposed or easily distributed to unauthorised parties by enabling greater access to a compilation of the personal data concerning health, from different sources, and throughout a lifetime. In veterinary medicine In UK veterinary practice, the replacement of paper recording systems with electronic methods of storing animal patient information escalated from the 1980s and the majority of clinics now use electronic medical records. In a sample of 129 veterinary practices, 89% used a Practice Management System (PMS) for data recording.Gill, M. (2007) Attitudes to clinical audit in veterinary practice, Royal Veterinary College elective project, unpublished work There are more than ten PMS providers currently in the UK. Collecting data directly from PMSs for epidemiological analysis abolishes the need for veterinarians to manually submit individual reports per animal visit and therefore increases the reporting rate. Veterinary electronic medical record data are being used to investigate antimicrobial efficacy; risk factors for canine cancer; and inherited diseases in dogs and cats, in the small animal disease surveillance project 'VetCOMPASS' (Veterinary Companion Animal Surveillance System) at the Royal Veterinary College, London, in collaboration with the University of Sydney (the VetCOMPASS project was formerly known as VEctAR). Turing test A letter published in Communications of the ACM describes the concept of generating synthetic patient population and proposes a variation of Turing test to assess the difference between synthetic and real patients. The letter states: \\"In the EHR context, though a human physician can readily distinguish between synthetically generated and real live human patients, could a machine be given the intelligence to make such a determination on its own?\\" and further the letter states: \\"Before synthetic patient identities become a public health problem, the legitimate EHR market might benefit from applying Turing Test-like techniques to ensure greater data reliability and diagnostic value. Any new techniques must thus consider patients' heterogeneity and are likely to have greater complexity than the Allen eighth-grade-science-test is able to grade.\\"  See also  * Electronic health records in the United States * Electronic health records in England * Clinical documentation improvement * European Institute for Health Records (EuroRec) * Health informatics * Health information management * Health information technology ** Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act * Hospital information system * List of open-source health software * Medical imaging * Medical privacy * Medical record * Personal health record * Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record, the Australian government's shared electronic health summary system * Picture archiving and communication system * Radiological information system  References   External links  * Can Electronic Health Record Systems Transform Health Care? * Open-Source EHR Systems for Ambulatory Care: A Market Assessment (California HealthCare Foundation, January 2008) * US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) * US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), National Resource Center for Health Information Technology * Security Aspects in Electronic Personal Health Record: Data Access and Preservation ‚Äì a briefing paper at Digital Preservation Europe ","title":"Electronic health record"},{"id":"1129642","text":"Small v. United States, 544 U.S. 385 (2005),. was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 922(g)(1)., which makes it illegal to possess a gun for individuals previously \\"convicted in any court\\" of crimes for which they could have been sentenced to more than one year in prison. The Court ruled, in a five to three decision, that \\"any court\\" does not include those in foreign countries. This decision resolved a circuit split on the issue, and reversed the lower ruling of the Third Circuit that the law did apply to foreign convictions. Background In December 1992, Gary Sherwood Small was arrested for an apparent (and disputed) attempt to recover a water heater from Naha Airport in Okinawa, Japan. According to Japanese authorities, the water heater contained several pistols, a rifle, and ammunition. Small was convicted on 17 April 1994 by a Japanese court for violating the Japanese Act Controlling the Possession of Firearms and Swords, the Gunpowder Control Act, and the Customs Act, all of which were felonies (that is, offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year). Small was sentenced to five years in a Japanese prison, but was paroled in November 1996. His parole ended on 26 May 1998. On 2 June 1998, shortly after his Japanese parole ended, Small purchased a handgun from the Delmont Sport Shop, a firearms dealer in the community where he resided. During the purchase process, Small filled out a form required by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). One of the questions on the form was \\"Have you ever been convicted in any court of a crime for which the judge could have imprisoned you for more than one year, even if the judge actually gave you a shorter sentence?\\" Small answered \\"no\\" to this question. In 2000, during a routine check of gun purchases from firearms dealers, the ATF discovered that Small, who had served a prison sentence in Japan, had purchased a handgun in Pennsylvania. When they searched his apartment they found another gun and ammunition. According to the government, because Small had been convicted in Japan in 1994, when he purchased the handgun at the Delmont Sport Shop he violated Title 18 United States Code ¬ß 922(g)(1), which makes it unlawful: :(g) . . . for any person ::(1) who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year: . . . :to possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm. Prior legal history =District Court= On 30 August 2000, a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted Small on four counts: * one count of making a false statement to a federally licensed firearms dealer; * one count of possession of ammunition by a convicted felon; and * two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Upon his indictment, Small filed to have the case dismissed, arguing that foreign convictions should not count as a predicate offense under Section 922 because the statement \\"any court\\" within the statute was meant for U.S. convictions only. The district court denied the motion. Small also argued that his Japanese offense should not count because he did not receive certain basic civil rights protections during his trial in Japan. Small requested that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing so that he could testify about the fairness of his conviction in Japan. The government responded that there was no need for an evidentiary hearing because Section 922 addresses the fact of a prior conviction, not the fairness of it. On 16 January 2002, the district court denied the motion because the Japanese Constitution protects similar rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. (Small argued that, while the same rights are protected in theory, in practice they are abused, citing several specific instances of incidents that would be considered violations of rights protected under the Fourth Amendment and Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.) On 14 March 2002, Small conditionally pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, for which he was sentenced to eight months in jail and three years of supervised release. However, he remains free on bail pending the outcome of his appeals. =Court of Appeals= Small appealed the district court's opinion to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The appeals court upheld the district court's ruling in a relatively short opinion, stating that the district court properly determined the fairness of the Japanese court's proceedings as well as the opinion that \\"any court\\" applies to both foreign and domestic courts. The appeals court did not acknowledge in its opinion a split among circuit courts. In the past 18 years, there have been four other cases on the same question. In the 1980s, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits held that foreign convictions could serve as predicate offenses under Section 922. More recently, the Tenth and Second Circuits have ruled that the term \\"any court\\" refers only to U.S. courts. Following the opinion, Small filed for an en banc hearing of the case, which was denied. Supreme Court On 17 November 2003, Small filed a Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. The government did not oppose, citing an interest in \\"being able to apply a uniform national rule in regulating or giving advice to persons with foreign convictions who seek to become licensed firearm importers, manufacturers, or dealers, or who seek to possess firearms.\\" On 29 March 2004, the Court granted Certiorari, agreeing to hear the case. Oral arguments were presented on 3 November 2004. The Supreme court ruled on April 26, 2005, in favor of Small, in a decision written by Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Souter and Ginsburg. Justice Thomas, joined by Justices Scalia and Kennedy dissented. The majority opinion emphasised anomalies resulting from a reading of \\"any court\\" to include foreign courts. The dissent insisted on a literal interpretation of the word \\"any\\" and argued that applying the law to foreign convictions was not irrational enough to rebut the usual meaning of the word \\"any\\". Possible ancillary effects One interesting aspect of this case is the potential to affect a minor section of the USA PATRIOT Act. As the government notes in its response to the request for Certiorari: :Finally, Congress's recent enactment of other legislation that predicates criminal liability on convictions entered \\"in any court\\" suggests that definitive guidance by this Court would be of value at this time.

Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story \\"Blacksword\\" to Galaxy in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it \\"embarrassingly amateur\\". Offutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the \\"Thieves World\\" series edited by Robert Lynn Asprin and Lynn Abbey, which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as Shadowspawn (and, later, Chance). His \\"Iron Lords\\" series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by Robert E. Howard. There was a series on Howard's best known character, Conan, and another one on the less known Cormac mac Art‚Äîan Irish Viking active in King Arthur's time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself. As \\"John Cleve\\", Offutt also wrote the 19-book erotic science fiction series \\"Spaceways\\", over half of which were collaborations. As an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled Swords Against Darkness, which included the first professional sale by Charles de Lint. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA). Career in erotica Offutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, \\"Anonymous,\\" Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P. N. Dedeaux,https://www.amazon.com/P.-N.-Dedeaux/e/B001K8LFD2/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1458793230&sr;=8-2 John Denis, Jeff Douglas, Farrah Fawkes, Baxter Giles, Alan Marshall, Jeff Morehead, J. (John) X. Williams, Turk Winter, and Jeff Woodson. The first was Bondage Babes, published under the name Alan Marshall by Greenleaf in 1968; the first appearance of his principal pen name, John Cleve, was on Slave of the Sudan in 1969. According to his son Chris Offutt he came to regard Cleve as more a separate persona than a pen name, and his other aliases as Cleve's pen names, not his own. As \\"Cleve\\" he published more than 130 works of erotica before the market for erotica dried up about 1985; afterwards, turning to self-publishing, he issued 260 more as Turk Winter (an early \\"Cleve\\" pen name) over the next twenty-five years. Thirty more remained unpublished at the time of his death. So prolific was Offutt in this area that in summing up his writing career his son Chris wrote that he \\"came to understand that my father had passed as a science-fiction writer while actually pursuing a 50-year career as a pornographer.\\" Bibliography =Thieves' World= * \\"Shadowspawn\\" (1979) in Thieves' World * \\"Shadow's Pawn\\" (1980) * \\"The Vivisectionist\\" (1981) * \\"Godson\\" (1982) * \\"Rebels Aren't Born in Palaces\\" (1984) * \\"The Veiled Lady, or A Look at the Normal Folk\\" (1985) * with Jodie Offutt, \\"Spellmaster\\" (1986) * \\"Homecoming\\" (1987) * Shadowspawn (1987) * \\"Night Work\\" (1989) * The Shadow of Sorcery (1993) * \\"Role Model\\" (2002) * \\"Dark of the Moon\\" (2004) =War of the Gods on Earth= * The Iron Lords (1979) * Shadows Out of Hell (1980) * The Lady of the Snowmist (1983) =War of the Wizards= * Demon in the Mirror (1977, with Richard K.

Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, The University of Memphis. His father, Issak Cohn, was a successful merchant and manufacturer. At the age of 10 Ferdinand suffered hearing impairment (for an unknown reason). Starting at age 16 he studied botany under Heinrich Goppert at the University of Breslau. Due to Cohn's Jewish background he was prevented from taking the final degree examinations at Breslau.Ferdinand Cohn Facts. Biography.yourdictionary.com (2014-06-20). Retrieved on 2014-06-29. He then moved to the University of Berlin. At age 19 in 1847 he received a degree in botany at Berlin. He remained studying botany for another couple of years in Berlin, where he came in contact with many of the top scientists of his time. In 1849 he returned to the University of Breslau and he remained at that university for the rest of his career as a teacher and researcher. On his initial return to Breslau in his early twenties, his father had bought for him a large and expensive microscope made by Simon Pl√∂ssl. This microscope, which the University of Breslau and most universities did not have, was Ferdinand Cohn's main research tool in the 1850s. In the 1850s he studied the growth and division of plant cells. In 1855 he produced papers on the sexuality of Sphaeroplea annulina and later Volvox globator. In the 1860s he studied plant physiology in several different aspects. From 1870 onward he mostly studied bacteria. He established the use of sterile culture mediums and rediscovered the botanical garden of Lorenz Scholz von Rosenau in Breslau. He published over 150 research reports during his lifetime. The University of Breslau became an innovative center for plant physiology and microbiology while he was there. Cohn was the first to classify algae as plants, and to define what distinguishes them from green plants. His classification of bacteria into four groups based on shape (sphericals, short rods, threads, and spirals) is still in use today. Among other things Cohn is remembered for being the first to show that Bacillus can change from a vegetative state to an endospore state when subjected to an environment deleterious to the vegetative state. In 1885 he received the Leeuwenhoek Medal.

In November 1929 the plenum of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued a decree on sending 25,000 workers with sufficient organizational and political experience to the rural areas to work in kolkhozy and in Machine and Tractor Stations (MTS). The decree found a broad response among the workers of the country, though they often had to fight resistance from their factories, which needed them to fill production quotas. In her history of the movement, Lynne Viola writes: > The recruitment drive illustrated the sometimes contradictory nature of the > first five-year plan revolution, which aimed for the maximum in economic > modernization while at the same time insisting that modernization occur > within the parameters of the social and political guidelines of the > proletarian dictatorship.

Lynne Viola, The Best Sons of the Fatherland: > Workers in the Vanguard of Soviet Collectivization (Oxford University Press > US, 1989: ), p. 53. As a result, 27,519 people were selected from all over the USSR and sent to work in the kolkhozy. Analysis of the social structure of 23,409 twenty-five- thousanders who had personal files reveals: * Males - 92.3%, females - 7.7% * Members of the CPSU - 69.9% * Members of the Komsomol - 8.6% * Members of the Metal Workers Union - approx. 16,000 * Individuals with no party affiliation - 21.5% * Up to 5 years of work experience - 13% * 5 to 12 years of work experience - 39% * More than 12 years of work experience - 48% In order to prepare the twenty-five-thousanders for work in the rural areas, the Soviets organized special courses. Some volunteers were sent to sovkhozy for two or three months as interns. Most of the twenty-five-thousanders were sent directly to kolkhozy in the principal cereal regions of the country, such as Ukraine, North Caucasus, Lower and Middle Volga, the Black Earth Region and others. The twenty-five-thousanders took part in establishing new kolkhozy and in strengthening the weak ones, conducting political, educational and cultural work among the inhabitants of the rural areas. They assisted kolkhozy in organizing stock, strengthening work-discipline and establishing \\"correct\\" product-distribution. Some of the twenty-five-thousanders were elected board members and chairmen of kolkhozy. However, the twenty-five-thousanders encountered fierce resistance from the so-called kulaks, who opposed the socialist re-organization of agriculture. Soviet literature treated the phenomenon of the twenty-five-thousanders extensively. Mikhail Sholokhov wrote one of the most famous books on this subject: Virgin Soil Upturned (, 1932 and 1960).

A paper plane, paper aeroplane (UK), paper airplane (US), paper glider, paper dart or dart is a toy aircraft, usually a glider made out of folded paper or paperboard. History The origin of folded paper gliders is generally considered to be of Ancient China, although there is equal evidence that the refinement and development of folded gliders took place in equal measure in Japan. Certainly, manufacture of paper on a widespread scale took place in China 500 BCE, and origami and paper folding became popular within a century of this period, approximately 460-390 BCE. It is impossible to ascertain where and in what form the first paper aircraft were constructed, or even the first paper plane's form. For over a thousand years after this, paper aircraft were the dominant man-made heavier- than-air craft whose principles could be readily appreciated, though thanks to their high drag coefficients, not of an exceptional performance when gliding over long distances. The pioneers of powered flight have all studied paper model aircraft in order to design larger machines. Leonardo wrote of the building of a model plane out of parchment, and of testing some of his early ornithopter, an aircraft that flies by flapping wings, and parachute designs using paper models. Thereafter, Sir George Cayley explored the performance of paper gliders in the late 19th century. Other pioneers, such as Cl√©ment Ader, Prof. Charles Langley, and Alberto Santos-Dumont often tested ideas with paper as well as balsa models to confirm (in scale) their theories before putting them into practice. With time, many other designers have improved and developed the paper model, while using it as a fundamentally useful tool in aircraft design. One of the earliest known applied (as in compound structures and many other aerodynamic refinements) modern paper plane was in 1909. The construction of a paper airplane, by Ludwig Prandtl at the 1924 banquet of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, was dismissed as an artless exercise by Theodore von K√°rm√°n:Theodore von K√°rm√°n with Lee Edson (1967) The Wind and Beyond, page 38, Little, Brown and Company :Prandtl was also somewhat impulsive. I recall that on one occasion at a rather dignified dinner meeting following a conference in Delft, Holland, my sister, who sat next to him at the table, asked him a question on the mechanics of flight. He started to explain; in the course of it he picked up a paper menu and fashioned a small model airplane, without thinking where he was. It landed on the shirtfront of the French Minister of Education, much to the embarrassment of my sister and others at the banquet. In 1930 Jack Northrop (co-founder of Lockheed Corporation) used paper planes as test models for larger aircraft. In Germany, during the Great Depression, designers at Heinkel and Junkers used paper models in order to establish basic performance and structural forms in important projects, such as the Heinkel 111 and Junkers 88 tactical bomber programmes. In recent times, paper model aircraft have gained great sophistication, and very high flight performance far removed from their origami origins, yet even origami aircraft have gained many new and exciting designs over the years, and gained much in terms of flight performance. There have been many design improvements, including velocity, lift, propulsion, style and fashion, over subsequent years. Advanced paper gliders =Developments= Paper gliders have experienced three forms of development in the period 1930‚Äì1988: * High flight performance * Scale modeling * Use of CAD software Ongoing development of folded/origami gliders over the same period has seen similar sophistication, including the addition of the following construction refinements * Increased fold-count, sometimes of an intricate nature * Explicit kirigami (cutting of paper) as a component of design * Requirements for additional ballast to ensure flight performance =Technological introductions= Technology responsible for the proliferation of advanced paper plane construction: * Inexpensive CAD software for 2D part design * Widespread manufacture, and inexpensive nature of acetal air-annealed glues, e.g. Bostick Clear-bond. * Inexpensive ink and laser computer printers, for accurate aircraft part reproduction * The advent of the Internet, and widespread information sharing =Material considerations= Compared to balsa wood, another material commonly used to fabricate model planes, paper's density is higher; consequentially, conventional origami paper gliders (see above) suffer from higher drag, as well as imperfectly aerodynamic wing chords. However, unlike balsa gliders, paper gliders have a far higher strength-to-thickness ratio ‚Äì a sheet of office-quality 80 g/sq m photocopier/laser printer paper, for example, has approximate in-scale strength of aircraft-grade aluminium sheet metal, while card stock approximates the properties of steel at the scale of paper model aircraft. =Directions in advanced paper aircraft design= Unmodified origami paper aircraft have very poor glide ratios, often not better than 7.5:1 depending on construction and materials. Modification of origami paper gliders can lead to marked improvements in flight performance, at the cost of weight and often with the inclusion of aerodynamic and/or structural compromises. Often, increases in wing loading can encourage breakdown of laminar flow over a wing with a hybrid of origami and glued and taped construction. Professors Ninomiya and Mathews (see sections below) developed more directed design strategies in the late 1960s and the 1980s. Previously, paper model aircraft had been designed without an emphasis on performance in flight. By using aerodynamic design, and fluid dynamics, both professors were able to design models that exceeded previous flight performance criteria by a very wide margin. Ranges of flight increased from the typical 10+ meters to 85+ meters, depending on energy input into the gliders on launch. At present, the work of the two professors remains the last serious research work on improving the flight performance of paper model gliders. Collaborative work by enthusiasts through online forums and personal websites are mostly developments of these original glider types. In the field of scale model design, there are at present many possibilities for advanced design. Profile gliders encounter a limitation for improvement of flight performance based on their wing types, which are typically curved-plate aerofoils. In addition, fuselages are either balsa- paper or paper laminates, prone to warping or breakage over a very short time. Improvement in performance is possible through modelling three-dimensional fuselages which encourage laminar flow, and in internally braced wings which can then have high-lift aerofoil profiles, such as the Clark Y or NACA 4 or 6 series, for high lift. =White Wings= In Japan in the late 1960s, Professor Yasuaki Ninomiya designed an advanced type of paper aircraft, which were published in two books, Jet Age Jamboree (1966) and Airborne All-Stars (1967). Designs from these books were later sold as the 'White Wings' Series of paper glider packs from the 1970s to the present day. White Wings are a stark departure from conventional paper aircraft, in that their fuselages and wings are paper templates cut and glued together. They were designed with the aid of low-speed aerodynamic engineering design principles. Construction of the models is of Kent paper, a grade of cartridge paper sold in Japan. The early models were explicitly hand drawn, but by the 1980s these had their parts drafted with the use of CAD software. Seen below is the N-424 glider from Jet Age Jamboree (1966) The glider fuselage is constructed from several laminations of paper glued together. The wings are of two laminations, and the tailplane and tailfin of a single lamination. N-424 Paper Plane Prof. Ninomiya's designs also included, for the first time in any paper model, working propellers driven by airflow, in particular for his profile scale models of the Cessna Skymaster and Piaggio P.136 of 1967. Noteworthy as well was the careful design of gliders so that they could fly without ballast ‚Äì his F-4 Phantom II model is able to be flown immediately without recourse to paperclips etc. The high performance gliders have fuselages that are kept rigid by the use of a balsa fuselage profile bonded to the paper components. The paper used is quite heavy, approximately twice the weight of standard drawing cartridge paper, but lighter than lightweight cardboard. Original White Wings were entirely paper, requiring patience and skill. Later however, balsa-wood fuselages were used, and White Wings were sold \\"pre-cut\\", making construction easier. The aerofoil used is a G√∂ttingen 801 (curved plate), and a pattern is supplied as a cutout part of each kit. =Paper Pilot= History In 1984, Professor E.H. Mathews, lecturer in Thermodynamics at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa published his first compendium of high-performance model aircraft. This book was Paper Pilot (Struik, 1984). This book was very successful, leading to additional volumes, Paper Pilot 2 (1988), Paper Pilot 3 (1991), 12 Planes for the Paper Pilot (1993) and Ju-52, a stand-alone book featuring a scale model. Unpublished models include an Airbus A320 scale model much like the Ju-52, seen on the Tekkies youth program in 1996. The books featured patterns of parts printed on lightweight cardstock, to give the aircraft good flight penetration performance for long distance flight. Design and development Public interest in the gliders, and their publishing success, allowed some of the development to be broadcast on South African television during 1988 on the first book's release, and again 1993, to coincide with a national paper aeroplane competition tied to Paper Pilot 3's release. Aerodynamic design of the gliders was achieved making use of an optimised small wind tunnel - the flat-glider Britten Norman Trislander was filmed in this facility, with weight balances being used to demonstrate the optimisation of flight. The design of parts of the gliders was achieved using Autodesk AutoCAD R12, then the most advanced version of this CAD software, and one of the first publicly available paper model aeroplanes designed using this technology. Construction of the gliders closely parallels that used in the White Wings series of gliders of Dr. Ninomiya for flat gliders. Later gliders with three-dimensional fuselages use a lightweight construction optimised for flight performance. Innovations include functional wheeled undercarriage which does not contribute to the drag budget while permitting good landings. Performance Paper pilot gliders make use a curved-plate aerofoil shape for best performance. Their design, like the White Wings gliders, is very sensitive to trim, and in fact have the capacity to make indoor flights in confined spaces under average conditions. Most in initial editions are equipped with catapult hook patterns, and demonstrate an ability to fly the length of a Rugby pitch when so launched. Later editions and gliders were equipped with a Bungee hook, the construction of which was included in Paper Pilot 3 and 12 Planes for the Paper Pilot. The Bungee system publish parallels, at a smaller scale, the practice used in radio controlled and full-size sailplane launches, at a fraction of the cost and complexity. To date, this is the only known example of such a launch system applied to a paper model aeroplane type published in book form. Flight performance on bungee is very good - one glider in particular, a scale model U-2 (in the last book of the series) had demonstrated flight performance in excess of 120 meters, on bungee hook launch. Papercopter A unique development of Prof. Mathews is the Papercopter, a model helicopter whose 'wing' is a trimmable annular ring which, using rotational aerodynamics to provide good forward flight performance without need for a tail rotor. A model helicopter 'body' is suspended beneath the ring, and uses airflow to stabilise itself in the direction of flight, much like a weather vane. The papercopter design permits flights of approximately 10‚Äì14 meters on average. =Paper helicopters (autogyros)= The world's first known published paper autogyro (engineless helicopter) by Richard K Neu appeared in \\"The Great International Paper Airplane Book\\" published in 1967. Its wings fly in a circle around a central ballast shaft as it descends vertically. This basic design has been published several times and is widely known. The world's first known published forward-gliding paper autogyro with forward-pointing body lifted by spinning blades was built by James Zongker. It appears on page 53 of \\"The Paper Airplane Book: The Official Book of the Second Great International Paper Airplane Contest\\" published in 1985 by Science Magazine. Its twin contra- rotating blades automatically spin on paper axles upon launch to provide lift. As noted above (see entry, Paper Pilot), E.H. Mathews developed a flight- stable paper model helicopter. This has a ring wing, and flaps for adjusting for flight for stability, positioned on the inboard edge of the ring. While not an autogyro per se, this paper model aircraft class falls within the general design of a paper model helicopter, and does possess a rotational flight element producing lift during forward flight. Papercopters, as Professor Mathews labeled them, are unique among paper model rotorcraft in having a range and velocity far in excess of all other classes, able to fly quite quickly, and with a range of between 10‚Äì15 m. The longest flight time is 27.9 seconds. =World records= There are multiple goals for a flight: * Distance (javelin throwing). * Time (javelin throwing straight up with subsequent metamorphosis into a sailplane). * Aerobatic (looping). * Stable flight to understand flight mechanics of a good plane. For every goal there is a typical plane and sometimes a world record. There have been many attempts over the years to break the barriers of throwing a paper plane for the longest time aloft. Ken Blackburn held this Guinness World Record for 13 years (1983‚Äì1996) and had regained the record on October 1998 by keeping his paper plane aloft for 27.6 seconds (indoors). This was confirmed by Guinness officials and a CNN report. The paper plane that Blackburn used in this record breaking attempt was a \\"glider\\". , Takuo Toda holds the world record for the longest time in air (27.9 seconds). The distance record () was set by Joe Ayoob, with a plane constructed by John Collins, in February 2012. 300px Aerodynamics =General aerodynamics= Paper aircraft are a class of model plane, and so do not experience aerodynamic forces differently from other types of flying model. However, their construction material produces a number of dissimilar effects on flight performance in comparison with aircraft built from different materials. In general, there are four aerodynamic forces that act on the paper aircraft while it is in flight: *Thrust, which keeps the plane moving forward; *Aerodynamic lift, acting on horizontal surface areas that lifts the plane upward; *Gravity, which counteracts lift and pulls the plane downward; and *Air drag, which counteracts thrust and reduces the plane's forward speed. Altogether, the aerodynamic forces co-interact, creating turbulence that amplifies small changes in the surface of the paper aircraft. Modifications can be made to most paper airplanes by bending, curving or making small cuts in the trailing edges of wings and in the airplane's tail, if it has one. The most common adjustments, modelled after glider aircraft, are ailerons, elevators, and rudders. Critical Re The Reynolds number range of the paper model aircraft is reasonably wide: *2,000‚Äì12,000 for Origami aircraft *4,000‚Äì16,900 for Compound Origami (involving adhesives and aerodynamic refinements) *9,000‚Äì39,000 for Profile Performance (White Wings, Paper Pilot, et al.) *19,200‚Äì56,000 for Scale Performance (White Wings, Paper Pilot, et al.) *22,000‚Äì93,000 for Scale Models (complex structures) These ranges are indicative. As noted above the mass: density ratio of paper prevents performance from reaching those of Balsa models in terms of expressions of power to weight, but for models with wingspans of between 250 mm and 1,200 mm, the Critical Re is very similar to balsa model gliders of similar dimensions. Paper models typically have a wing aspect ratio that is very high (model sailplanes) or very low (the classic paper dart), and therefore are in almost all cases flying at velocities far below their wing planform and aerofoil Critical Re, where flow would break down from laminar to turbulent. Most origami paper darts tend to be flying within turbulent air in any case, and as such, are important to research into turbulent flow as are low-Re lifting surfaces found in nature such as leaves of trees and plants as well as the wings of insects. High performance profile and scale models do approach their wing section's critical Re in flight, which is a noteworthy achievement in terms of paper model design. Performance is derived of the fact that wings of these gliders are in fact performing as well as it is possible for them to perform, given their material limitations. Experiments in different material finishes in recent years have revealed some interesting relationships in Re and paper models. Performance of origami and compound origami structures improves markedly with the introduction of smooth paper, though this is also aided by the paper's higher mass and consequently better penetration. More marginal performance and scale types generally do not benefit from heavier, shinier surfaces. Performance profile-fuselage types do experience somewhat improved performance if shiny, slippery paper is used in construction, but although there is a velocity improvement, this is offset very often by a poorer l/d ratio. Scale types have experience negative performance at the addition of heavy shiny papers in their construction. Aerofoils Wing profile sections in models vary, depending on type: *Origami : G√∂ttingen flat-plate, or Jedelsky-form for folded leading edges. *Compound Origami: Identical with origami, though often with sealed edges ‚Äì 45% improvement in Cd. *Profile Performance: G√∂ttingen curved-plate, with profile similar to G√∂ttingen 801. *Scale Performance: G√∂ttingen 801 or any other wing aerofoil *Scale Models: This varies on model type (see below) Camber of profiles varies, too. In general, the lower the Re, the greater the camber. Origami types will have 'ludicrous' or very high cambers in comparison with more marginally performing scale types, whose escalating masses demand higher flying speeds and so lower induced drag from high camber, though this will vary depending on type being modelled. In the case of scale performance and scale models, the modellers intent will define the type of aerofoil section chosen. WWI biplanes, if designed for flight performance, will often have curved-plate aerofoils, as these produce a highly cambered surfaces and Coefficient of Lift (Cl) for low gliding airspeeds. WWII monoplanes will often have very scale-like sections, though with increased trailing edge droop to improve camber in comparison with scale counterparts. Similarly, size, airspeed and mass will have very big impacts on choice of aerofoil, though this is a universal consideration in model plane design, no matter the material. Origami Flying Wings The former Guinness world record holder Tim Richardson disagrees with the decision to put a 'tail' on the paper plane. His explanation of paper plane aerodynamics on his website mentions that the tail is not needed. He uses the real-life B-2 Spirit flying wing bomber as an example, stating that the weights along the wing should be put forward in order to stabilize the plane. (Note: paper planes do not need a tail primarily because they typically have a large, thin fuselage, which acts to prevent yaw, and wings along the entire length, which prevents pitch.) Independently, Edmond Hui invented a Stealth Bomber-like paper plane called the Paperang in 1977, based on hang glider aerodynamics. Uniquely, it has properly controlled airfoil sections, high-aspect-ratio wings, and a construction method designed to allow the builder to vary every aspect of its shape. It was the subject of a book, \\"Amazing Paper Airplanes\\" in 1987, and a number of newspaper articles in 1992. It is ineligible for most paper plane competitions due to the use of a staple, but it has extremely high gliding performance exceeding glide ratios of 12 to 1 with good stability. In 1975, origami artist Michael LaFosse designed a pure origami (one sheet; no cutting, glue or staples...) flying wing, which he named the \\"Art Deco Wing\\".Though its aerodynamic form mimics some hang glider and supersonic airfoils, its invention evolved from exploring the beauty of folded paper first. Its glide ratio and stability are on a par with many of the best paper wing constructions that use glue, tape or staples. This design was first published in 1984 in the book \\"Wings and Things\\", by Stephen Weiss, St. Martin's Press. Although it is a common view that light paper planes go farther than heavy ones, this is considered to be untrue by Blackburn. Blackburn's record-breaking 20-year-old paper plane was based on his belief that the best planes had short wings and are \\"heavy\\" at the point of the launch phase in which the thrower throws the paper plane into the air, and at the same time longer wings and a \\"lighter\\" weight would allow the paper plane to have better flight times but this cannot be thrown hard with much pressure into the air as a \\"heavy\\" weighted launch phase. According to Blackburn, \\"For maximum height and for a good transition to gliding flight, the throw must be within 10 degrees of vertical\\" ‚Äî which shows that a speed of at least is the amount needed to throw the paper plane successfully. After the folding there are still gaps between different layers of folded paper (tearoff edge). These and the kinks transversal to the airflow may have a detrimental effect on aerodynamics, especially on the upper side of the wing. In some models the surfaces are not aligned to the direction of flow acting as airbrakes. Typically the center of mass is at 1/81 and the center of area is at 1/2 of the plane lengths. Two methods exist to shift the center of mass to the front. One rolls up the leading edge which then stays unswept. The other uses a swept wing or axial folding to produce something like a fuselage extending out of leading edge of the wing. Other designs An example of an asymmetrical custom paper airplane, which exhibits large torque due to unbalanced forces on the wings. The flight path assumes a somewhat parabolic shape, before descending in a rapid counter-clockwise spiral, as viewed from behind. It is possible to create freestyle versions of paper aircraft, which often exhibit an unusual flight path compared to more traditional paper darts, jets and gliders. Another propulsion technique, creating high launch velocities, involves the use of elastic bands for \\"catapults\\". Walkalong gliding involves the continuous propulsion of paper airplane designs (such as the tumblewing, follow foil and paper airplane surfer) by soaring flight on the edge of a sheet of cardboard. Space flight There may one day be a paper plane launched from space. A prototype passed a durability test in a wind tunnel in March 2008, and Japan's space agency JAXA considered a launch from the International Space Station. However, the plane developers, Takuo Toda (see World Records above) and fellow enthusiast Shinji Suzuki, an aeronautical engineer and professor at Tokyo University, postponed the attempt after acknowledging it would be all but impossible to track them during the planes' week-long journey to Earth, assuming any of them survived the searing descent. The developers were hoping that China or Russia will back further efforts on the project.\\"Paper plane enthusiast sets flight record\\" by Justin McCurry in Tokyo, guardian.co.uk, 27 December 2009 16.03 GMT. Retrieved 2009-12-31. In February 2011, 200 planes were launched from a net underneath a weather balloon twenty-three miles above Germany. The planes were designed to maintain stable flight even in gusts up to 100 mph. The planes were equipped with memory chips from which data can be uploaded. The planes were found in other places in Europe, North America and even Australia.

Background Previously in the Northeast Caucasus, there had, since recordable history, been a large array of states. Caucasian Albania had existed in Southern Dagestan, for most of its history being a vassal under the direct rule of the Parthians and later the Sasanid Persians, but eventually, the majority converted to Islam following the Muslim conquest of Persia, as their overlords did. Traveling Arabs proved to be instrumental in this, and after they left, they relinquished the new Muslim states of Lezghia (centered in the Islamic learning center of Derbent), Lakia (centered in another, rival city of Islamic learning, Kumukh) and their less important neighbors. In these areas (Southern and Southeast Dagestan), where interethnic conflict was often present, Islam served a unifying role, and it was often the clerical establishment which mediated disputes. Islam was far less well- ingrained, but still highly important in Chechnya. This region had always lain far outside the influence of Caucasian Albania and fiercely fought off the Arab invaders.Jaimoukha, Amjad. The Chechens: A Handbook. Page 32 The Georgian chronicles noted the existence of a Dzurdzuketia (Dzurdzuks, the Georgian name for the Vainakhs, the ancestors of Chechens and Ingush), which appears to have been absorbed into Alania at times, constituting an important part of the latter. Sarir was the strongest. Sarir at times adopted Christianity as the nominal, but not in reality, official religion. It was reduced at various times to a puppet state of Alania, Khazaria, or Sarmatia. In this area, kingdoms arose and fell or were subjugated frequently, and the Dido were reduced to their current state. In Chechnya, Islam was considerably less ingrained than in the Imamate's other claims. Islam only began to make inroads in the 16th century in Chechnya, and even then was not highly important, with the indigenous Vainakh religion still holding strong. It was only at the point of the threat of Russian conquest that people began to turn en masse, to Islam as a way to mobilize a coordinated resistance to Russian encroachment. Islam was spread to the Chechens this way mainly through the work of Sheikh Mansur. Nonetheless, as Shamil and his predecessors discovered, the actual commitment of the Chechens to Islam was disappointingly small. Paganism remained in practice until the early 19th century. However, although Islam was indeed extremely important in parts of the Caucasus, and was also a unifying force for resistance to Russia, political Islam was challenged by many different groups. Islam in Central and Northern Dagestan and Chechnya was overwhelmingly Naqshbandi at this time.King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus. p69 However, Naqshbandiism, which was highly mystical in nature, had internal divisions over whether it should be political or whether, indeed, political Sufism tainted the religion's purity.King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus. Page 69 The drive to establish sharia law, in particular, was opposed on many fronts. First of all, the indigenous Caucasian states run by Avars, Kumyks, Lezgins, Laks and others (particularly the widow ruler Pakhu Bike, Queen of the Khanate of Avaria) opposed it as it seemed to take legitimacy away from their own positions.King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus. Pages 64-73 Sharia also clashed with adat, the indigenous law system that many, especially peoples such as the Chechens, viewed as superior to sharia. For these reasons, and other more subtle ones, in most areas the Imamate claimed as its domain, it was, in fact, simply viewed as the lesser evil to Russia. Establishment Parts of the Muslim population started to radicalize due to rapacious Russian activity and taxation and were calling for a Gazawat (Holy War) and the enforcement of Sharia. Two radical imams, Imam Ghazi Muhammad and Imam Shamil, attempted to initiate the Gazawat they called for by trying to seize the capital of Khunzakh from the khan of Pakkou-Bekkhe in 1827. The attack failed and so, disheartened, the imams bided their time, waiting for the various Muslim tribes to agree with one another. In 1828, the two attacked again, this time in Northern Dagestan, and with success. The Russians, who at the time ruled over Northern Dagestan, were used to fighting on the open battlefields of Europe inlined formation instead of the thick woods of the Caucasus and so were very unprepared for the guerrilla tactics of the two imams, resulting in a victory for Ghazi and Shamil. However, this action would start the Caucasian War , a war between the Imamate and Russia that would eventually lead to the capture of all the Caucasus by the Russian Empire. Here the Imamate was formed, with Ghazi self-appointed as its first leader. The supreme government body of the Imamate, the State Council (Dƒ´vƒÅn) was formed which consisted of Sufi Muslim scholars and students as well as Shamil's military lieutenants, his Naibs. For military details see Murid War. Expansion During the war the Imamate would see support from other Muslim tribes, eventually amalgamating with Chechnya, parts of Ingushetia and the rest of Dagestan during the Imamship of Imam Shamil. The western tribes, the Adyghes would fall under the control of the Imamate during Shamil's rule as well, but a problem arose in the form of the Kabardins and Ossetians that sat in between Shamil's east and west tribes, so these tribes were run mainly by Shamil's naibs who had traveled to the west instead of the Dƒ´vƒÅn itself. Politics The Imamate's first leader was Imam Ghazi Muhammad, who ruled from 1828 until 1832 when he was succeeded by Gamzat-bek four years later. When he was murdered in 1834, by a band which included Hadji Murad, Shamil became the third imam. The Imamate reached its peak under Shamil's rule, spanning all of the Muslim Northern Caucasus. The Imamate was a highly militaristic country, having been at war since its establishment. Its politics were always concerned with the furthering of Islam or the Caucasian War. As such, the only people that ever sat on its council were Muslim scholars or military naibs. The war and the surrender of the Imamate The war with Russia had several great victories early on, but at the time Russia hadn't really committed to the war seriously. With their great victory over Napoleon's Grand Army, the Russian people saw little concern in the petty Asiatic resistance occurring on their southern border. However, the Caucasians did reach a point where they pushed the Russians back hard enough to warrant a full-scale attack. In 1832, Shamil and Ghazi launched a failed attack on Vladikavkaz, which was at the time a Russian military fort mockingly named \\"Ruler of The Caucasus\\". The Russians countered, launching an assault on what was as close to capital as the Imamate had, Gimry. This resulted in the seizure of the town by the Russians and the death of Ghazi Muhammad. Shamil himself was the only man to escape the battle, after which he went into hiding to evade the Russians. Everyone assumed him to be dead. In the absence of Shamil, an imam by the name of Gamzat-bek ruled. Gamzat-bek was an imam who had played a vital role in securing the Avar Khans for the Imamate, and had since been a naib to Shamil and Ghazi. Shamil returned a year later, only to have Gamzat-bek assassinated by the same Avar Khanates he had defeated. With no one else to take the position, Shamil became the 3rd leader of the Imamate. Shamil would turn out to be the greatest of the Imams by far and would rule for 27 years. He would conquer the Western Muslim tribes, and transform a group of small bickering villages into a united country. However, he would also see great casualties to his people too, particularly in the Siege of Akhoulgo where he would personally lose around 4500 of his own people. But he would continue to rule until 1859 when the Emperor of Russia would offer Shamil a peaceful surrender, he would even be a guest of the royal palace. Shamil agreed, and The Caucasian Imamate was no more. However, fighting did not immediately cease. =The fate of Imam Shamil= As Charles King notes, > Whereas previous enemies of the empire had been imprisoned, killed or > exiled, Shamil became a national celebrity [in Russia]. After his surrender, > he settled into a comfortable retirement in Kaluga, southeast of > Moscow.King, Charles. The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus. Page > 91. In 1859, Shamil wrote to one of his sons: \\"By the will of the Almighty, the Absolute Governor, I have fallen into the hands of unbelievers... the Great Emperor... has settled me here... in a tall, spacious house with carpets and all the necessities.\\" Pis'mo Shamilia Mukhammadanu, NOvember 24, 1859, in Omarov, ed. 100 pisem Shamilia Fourth Imamate After the Russian Revolution of 1917, an attempt to reestablish the Imamate with the help of Turkey, during March‚ÄìApril 1918, was made by the son of one of Shamil's naibs, Najmuddin Hotso. This name stems from the Dagestani settlement of Gotso (when he was awarded nobility by Tsar). He was pronounced the fourth Imam of the North Caucasus and deposed the Soviet power, but was soon defeated by the Soviets. Hotso only had support in Dagestan, and there he carried on his fight (in Chechnya, meanwhile, North Caucasian nationalists of various creeds similarly went into guerrilla war against the Russians). Both were finally quelled in 1925.Dunlop. Russia Confronts Chechnya: Roots of a Separatist Conflict.

Martins Heron and the neighbouring suburb The Warren are after a Parliamentary Boundary review in the Bracknell constituency ‚Äì until 2010 they were in the Windsor Constituency. It is in Harmans Water ward, which also includes parts of Bullbrook, and The Parks. The name does not in fact have anything to do with the avian heron but stems from the obsolete word hern, meaning nook or corner of land. The area is bordered by Bracknell to the west and large wooded areas, notably Swinley Woods on the east and Lily Hill Park to the north. History Charles Church housing estate at Martins Heron The area lies within the former parkland and grounds of a mansion, Martins Herne (or Heron), built around 1750 but demolished in the early 1980s, which was associated with minor nobility for much of its life, including the 18th-century British general, William Gordon. The house made way for a small estate of mainly large detached houses built by Charles Church Developments. Amenities Tesco supermarket, Martins Heron, Bracknell in 2006 Tesco Martins Heron was opened in the 1980s and was extended in 2008, drastically increasing its size and drawing new customers to the area. However this had been an issue that had been addressed by the local residents many times, and it had taken years for Tesco to receive planning permission to go ahead with the build. The new store was finished in May 2008. Next to Tesco, sits the Martins Heron and The Warren Community Hall. This is a small local hall, which has also been refurbished. It had an extension built at the start of the new millennium, and now contains the main hall, as well as the annexe hall, cloakrooms and a small waiting area. It is mostly used by the local nursery school, as well as the Martins Heron School of Dance, which holds classes most evenings during term time. Transport Martins Heron railway station Martins Heron railway station serves commuters travelling to London Waterloo and Reading, Berkshire. The railway station is small but is manned during the morning and is equipped with CCTV. The station is situated right next to a Tesco supermarket, and indeed was built by the supermarket chain, as a precondition of the supermarket being built. In popular culture Martins Heron is well known locally as being the site of Harry Potter's uncle and aunt's house. The filmed version of the first of JK Rowling's famous stories, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was filmed partly on location. The external scenes with the actor Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter at his house were shot on location at a house in Picket Post Close, Martins Heron. However, according to the documentary Creating the World of Harry Potter, logistics made this location impractical as a long-term filming location, so a portion of the street was recreated on the backlot of Leavesden Film Studios. Martins Heron Tesco was also used for filming. Until 2009 it was one of the very few Tesco supermarkets in the country that was not open on Sunday, owing to concerns from local residents. It also had restricted opening hours on weekdays. It has therefore been used as a filming location for many of the Tesco television adverts featuring Prunella Scales and Jane Horrocks among others.

(The USN and USMC use ‚ÄúL‚Äù to designate Amphibious vessels, also called ‚ÄúL class.‚Äù) The United States Army, Canadian Army and British Army used several LVT models during World War II, and referred to those vehicles as ‚ÄúLanding Vehicle, Tracked.‚Äù Originally intended solely as cargo carriers for ship to shore operations, they evolved into assault troop and fire support vehicles. The types were known as amphtrack, \\"amtrak\\", \\"amtrac\\", etc. (portmanteaus of \\"amphibious tractor\\"), and \\"alligator\\" or \\"gator.‚Äù  Development  = The Alligator= The LVT had its origins in a civilian rescue vehicle called the Alligator. Developed by Donald Roebling in 1935, the Alligator was intended to operate in swampy areas, inaccessible to both traditional cars and boats. Two years later, Roebling built a redesigned vehicle with improved water speed. The United States Marine Corps, which had been developing amphibious warfare doctrine based on the ideas of Lt. Col Earl Hancock \\"Pete\\" Ellis and others, became interested in the machine after learning about it through an article in Life magazine and convinced Roebling to design a more seaworthy model for military use. Both the US Navy and Roebling resisted the idea of a military design, the US Navy because it felt conventional landing craft could do the job, and Roebling because he wished his invention to be used only for peaceful purposes. Roebling was persuaded after war broke out in Europe, and completed a militarized prototype by May 1940. The Bureau of Ships requested a second prototype with a more powerful engine, and the USMC tested the design in November 1940. Impressed by the second prototype, the Bureau of Ships placed a contract for production of 100 units of a model using all-steel construction, for a more rugged and easily produced design, and the first LVT-1 was delivered in July 1941. Another 200 units were ordered even before the first production units were delivered. After more improvements to meet requirements of the Navy, made difficult by Roebling's lack of blueprints for the initial designs, the vehicle was adopted as \\"Landing Vehicle Tracked\\" or LVT. =The LVT-1 design= The contract to build the first 200 LVTs was awarded to the Food Machinery Corporation (FMC), a manufacturer of insecticide spray pumps and other farm equipment, which built some parts for the Alligators. The initial 200 LVTs were built at FMC's Dunedin, Florida factory, where most of the improvement work had been done as well. The first production LVT rolled out of the plant in July, 1941. Later, wartime LVT production was expanded by FMC and the Navy to four factories, including the initial facility in Dunedin; the new facilities were located in Lakeland, Florida, Riverside, California, and San Jose, California. The LVT-1 could carry 18 fully equipped men or of cargo.The complete guide to tanks and armoured fighting vehicles, p. 314, , Originally intended to carry replenishment from ships to shore, they lacked armor protection and their tracks and suspension were unreliable when used on hard terrain. However, the Marines soon recognized the potential of the LVT as an assault vehicle. A battalion of LVTs was ready for 1st Marine Division by 16 February 1942. The LVTs saw their first operational use in Guadalcanal, where they were used exclusively for landing supplies. About 128 LVTs were available for the landings. = LVT-2 Buffalo and other developments= As early as January 1940, Roebling had prepared preliminary sketches of an LVT with a gun turret to provide fire support to the landing waves. The concept languished until June 1941, when USMC recommended development of an LVT armed with a 37mm gun and three machine guns and armored against 0.50 (12.7mm) machine gun fire. Development was slow and ultimately involved a complete redesign of the LVT, the LVT-2 Buffalo. Armored versions were introduced as well as fire support versions, dubbed Amtanks, which were fitted with turrets from Stuart series light tanks (LVT(A)-1) and Howitzer Motor Carriage M8s (LVT(A)-4). Among other upgrades were a new powerpack (engine and cooling accessories), also borrowed from the Stuarts, and a rubber \\"torsilastic\\" suspension which improved performance on land. After Borg-Warner evaluated the LVT-1, Borg-Warner and FMC began work on new designs. FMC was assisted by faculty from Caltech and the University of California and developed the designs that became the LVT-2 and the LVT(A)-1. Interest in the LVT was enough that the Secretary of the Navy formed the Continued Board for the Development of the Landing Vehicle Tracked on 30 October 1943. Production continued throughout the war, resulting in 18,616 LVTs delivered. 23 US Army and 11 USMC battalions were equipped by 1945 with LVTs. British and Australian armies also used LVTs in combat during World War II. In the late 1940s, a series of prototypes were built and tested, but none reached production stage due to lack of funding. Realizing that acquisition of new vehicles was unlikely, the Marines modernized some of the LVT-3s and LVT(A)-5s and kept them in service until the late 1950s. Combat history = Guadalcanal= USMC LVT-1s were mainly used for logistical support at Guadalcanal. LVT-1 proved in this campaign its tactical capabilities, versatility and potential for amphibious operations. USS President Hayes (AP-39) is seen in the background. As LVT-1s were unarmed, the Marines decided to arm them using any available machine gun. Each one was armed with three .30-caliber machine guns (sometimes water-cooled models) and a .50-caliber machine gun. Organization of LVTs of the Amphibian Tractor Battalions for the assault: * Company \\"A\\" of 1st Battalion with thirty LVT-1 was assigned to the 5th Marines which was to land on Guadalcanal. * A platoon of LVT-1s would go ashore on Tulagi assigned to 2nd Marine Battalion. * Company \\"B\\" was assigned to the 1st Marine Regiment. * The remainder of the 1st Battalion remained with the 1st Division's support group. * Company \\"A\\" of the 2nd Battalion was assigned to 2nd Marine Regiment, the landing force reserve. =Tarawa= In the amphibious assault on Tarawa in late 1943, the LVTs were first used for amphibious assault in order to negotiate the barrier reef and arrive to the most heavily defended beaches the Americans ever met in the Pacific. This was also the first use of the LVT-2 Water Buffalo in combat. 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion LVTs took part in the first, second, and third waves of landings and carried the continuous supply of ammunition, reinforcements, and ferrying back of the wounded. Of 125 vehicles used (50 new LVT-2s and 75 LVT-1s), only 35 remained operational by the end of the first day, continuing to ferry men and supplies across the coral reef and through the shallows to the beach. Type 95 light tank on Tarawa. The 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion had only about 79 LVT-1s and 50 LVT-2s (directly shipped from San Diego) available for the assault. Most of the troops had to disembark from LCVP \\"Higgins boats\\" and wade across the reef chest-deep or higher water while under heavy enemy fire. American casualties were very heavy and many who made to the beach alive had lost their rifles and other essential gear. = Developments in the Pacific= After Tarawa, many changes were made. The USMC recommended that a battalion of armored LVTs, two companies of DUKWs and two battalions of cargo LVTs be assigned to each division in future amphibious operations. The number of LVTs by battalion was increased to 300; before Tarawa it was 100. Due to mechanical reliability problems after every landing, the Marines replaced all LVTs used in operations. As a result of Tarawa experience, standardized armor kits were provided for the LVTs to be used in contested landings. Other improvements were made in the damage repair area, machine gun shields, and in the LVT design to increase crew and LVT survivability. The gun-armed \\"amtank\\" LVT(A)-1 and LVT(A)-4 were developed to provide fire support. Armed with a 75mm howitzer, the latter was introduced in 1944 just before the Marianas campaign and was especially effective in this role as it was capable of destroying Japanese fortifications as it came ashore. Its howitzer complemented the 75mm gun of the Sherman tanks used by the Marines. However, the LVT(A)-4 had an open-topped turret which left the crew vulnerable to artillery and infantry attack, especially to the latter, as it lacked any sort of machine gun armament. The lack of machine gun armament was eventually rectified, though the open-topped turret remained in order to save weight. Although usually used in a direct role during landings only (once inland the \\"amtanks\\" were assigned to artillery formations to augment their firepower), in the Marianas campaign \\"amtanks\\" were employed inland, much like regular tanks. = Bougainville = In November 1943, US Marines landed on the island of Bougainville. 29 LVTs were landed on the first day, with a total of 124 LVTs operating with the Marines during the landing. = Marshall Islands= In the campaign for the Marshall Islands, the full range of the LVT models became available, including armed Amtrac LVTs based on the proven LVT-2 with a tank gun turret. This provided close-in firepower as the cargo LVTs neared the beach. The combination of armoured cargo LVT-2 and the armed LVT(A)-1 together helped to capture the Marshalls far ahead of schedule. = Saipan= Saipan saw the massive use of the LVTs by the USMC with six battalions of cargo LVT, including the new ramped LVT-4, and two battalions of armored Amtracs, employing the new LVT(A)-4 with a 75 mm howitzer. =Tinian= LVT-2 doodlebug in testing on Saipan At Tinian a field variant of the LVT-2 was created by the Seabees of the 3rd Battalion 18th Marines and 3rd Battalion 20th Marines.Seabees and doodlebugs at Tinian, This date in Seabee History July 24 1944, Seabee Museum website, Port Hueneme, CA V Amphibious Corps chose beaches abutted by coral embankments up to 15 feet. The Japanese thought the embankments made the beaches unsuitable for a landing. The CB engineers constructed detachable ramps mounted on LVTs to make such an assault possible. Salvaging iron beams from the damaged sugar factory on Saipan they fabricated 10 assault vehicles. The General Harry Schmidt was skeptical and ordered a vehicle go up and down a ramp 100 times before approving their use in combat. The Tinian assault was a success. The defenders were quickly overwhelmed compromising the remainder of the defenses. The Seabees named their LVTs \\"doodlebugs\\". =Peleliu= From the Peleliu campaign on, a number of LVTs were fitted with a flamethrower for use against fortifications. The LVT was usually flanked by a pair of gun tanks for protection. A number of LVTs were converted to armored ambulances carrying a doctor and three corpsmen. LVTs were also employed as guide boats for tanks unloading onto submerged reefs. =Leyte= The largest use of LVTs was in the Leyte landing in October 1944, with nine US Army amtrac and two amtank battalions deployed by US Army 6th Army. These US Army LVTs were later used in other Philippine islands landings.The 788th Amphibian Tractor Battalion 54 LVT(4) tracked amphibious assault vehicles of the 672nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion as part of the raiding force on 23 February 1945 forged across Laguna de Bay and crashed the gates during the liberation of Los Ba√±os Internment Camp. They ferried the weakened liberated civilians back behind the lines during the contested withdrawal. =Iwo Jima= The LVT-4 played a crucial role both as the assault vehicle to carry troops and as the chief logistical vehicle in the first days of Battle of Iwo Jima. Ashore, the LVTs were used to rescue wheeled vehicles that could not navigate Iwo Jima's soft volcanic ash and steep terraces. In addition, American troops used the LVTs to transport casualties from the front lines to evacuation sites on the beaches. The 75 mm howitzer on the LVT-4 provided important fire support as the Marines slowly advanced across the island. =Okinawa= This was the largest landing in the Central Pacific drive. The new LVT-3, a redesign of internal arrangements, was used successfully through the long Okinawa campaign. Over 1000 LVTs took part in the Battle of Okinawa. =Europe= In Europe, LVTs were mainly used for landings and river crossing operations as well as assaults in swampy zones. By the end of 1943, 200 LVT-1s had been delivered to the British Army for training in preparation for future operations in Europe. The U.S., British, and Canadian armies used the Buffalo in the Battle of the Scheldt (1944), during the Operation Plunder crossing of the Rhine, along the Po River in Italy, across the river Elbe, and in a number of other river crossing operations. Buffalo amphibians during the invasion of Walcheren Island, November 1944. LVTs were used in the Normandy landings, but their use by the United States was limited as the US Army doctrine in Europe viewed the Sherman DD as the answer to assault on heavily defended beaches. LVT-2s were used to help unload supplies after the landings on Utah Beach from the cargo ships off the coast to the beach and through the nearby swamps. For the Rhine crossing, the British 21st Army Group had some 600 Buffalos available, most of them used to transport the assault infantry. As mud was expected to hamper the Sherman DD tanks, some LVTs were armed with a 20 mm cannon and two machine guns to give fire support until bridges could be constructed across the river. The \\"Specials\\" were assigned to the 79th Armoured Division (which operated all specialist assault vehicles), that also provided Buffalos fitted with \\"Bobbin\\" carpets to create temporary roadways over the mud. The US Army used LVT-2s and LVT-4s in Europe in small numbers in 1944-45 for river crossing operations. LVT-2s and LVT-4s were used by US troops on the Roer River crossing in 1945. US Army LVT-4's were also used by 752nd Tank Battalion to ferry 88th Infantry Division troops across the Po River in Italy in April 1945. Five LVT-4s were supplied through Lend-Lease to the Soviet Red Army, which used them when assaulting the well-defended west banks of the Oder and Danube rivers. =North Africa= The first operational use of the LVT in North Africa was in November 1942. A small number of LVT-1s were used during the landings on the coast of North Africa during Operation Torch. Four LVT-1s and two bulldozers were assigned to each shore party engineer company. Their tasks were towing vehicles and boat salvage operations. LVT-1s proved useful in getting stranded landing craft afloat, but they also experienced many mechanical failures. =South East Asia= Some of the reconnaissance units of the British Fourteenth Army in Burma operated LVT-1s. Although originally planned to fight against the Japanese on the Burmese coast at the end of 1943, this part of the operations plan was cancelled and no LVT-1s were used in combat. In 1945, the Royal Marines Amphibious support unit was created. Its LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s supported Royal Marines landings in Burma and Malaya. =Post-World War II= Some LVT-3s, LVT-3Cs, and modified LVT(A)-5s saw action in the Korean War. The French Army used the U.S.-supplied LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s in the Indochina War and in the Suez Crisis. LVTs embarking Royal Marine commandos leave Fort Marion (LSD-22) for the beach at Sorye Dong, North Korea, on 7 April 1951. During the Korean War, LVT(3)Cs and LVT(A)s were used for the landing in Incheon and subsequent Han River crossing to re-take Seoul. It was also used in the evacuation of Hungnam Harbour when Chinese forces attacked. The LVT(3)C was used by USMC in Korea as both an amphibious vehicle, and in the role of an armored personnel carrier while on land. Nationalist China (ROC) forces used some US-provided LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s during China's civil war against communist Chinese troops. Many were captured by communist Chinese forces, with at least several dozen refitted with a Soviet ZiS-2 57 mm anti-tank gun in place of the original US 75 mm howitzer-gun following their successful capture of mainland China from the Chinese Nationalists in 1949. French armored units developed the use of amphibious tracked vehicles in Indochina: The amphibious C model of the M29 Weasel (armed either with Chaterrault M1924/29, Bren or Browning M1919 machine guns and with 57mm M18A1 recoilless guns), LVT-4s (equipped with two M2 and two M1919 machine guns, and sometimes equipped with 40mm Bofors guns or 57 mm recoilless guns) and LVT(A)-4 (with 75 mm howitzer) were used to great effect by 1er R√©giment Etrangers de Cavalerie. In 1950, the French Army received a number of LVT-4s and LVT(A)-4s from the US to supplement M29Cs. In September 1951, the first French mixed unit (1er Groupement Autonome) was created, consisting of two squadrons of Weasels (33 each), three squadrons of LVT-4 (11 each) and one fire support platoon of 6 LVT(A)-4. Later a second group was created in Tonkin when more LVTs were received. Both these groups participated in Mekong and Red River delta operations and in landing operations on Vietnam shores. The also deployed a platoon of LVTs. LVTs were known as \\"alligators\\" in French armed forces. During the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, 40 and 42 Commando of the Royal Marines made a landing in Port Said using their available LVTs, supported by a number of Centurion tanks from the Royal Tank Regiment. The French Navy assigned 13 LVT-4s to the Force H, to be used by the 1√®re compagnie du 1er R.E.P. and 3eme Marine Commando during their assault on Port Fuad.  Other operators At the end of the war, the oldest LVT versions were disposed as surplus and sold to other countries. Only LVT-3 and LVT(A)-5s remained in operational use in US armed forces. A couple of LVT-3s were assigned in 1943 to Arctic Expedition, after being modified to operate in cold environment.  Modern descendants  In the 1950s, LVTs still in service were replaced by the LVTP-5 family of vehicles, which in turn were followed by the LVT-7 family, eventually redesignated AAV. The AAV is manufactured by BAE Systems Land and Armaments, which was the first company to produce the LVT (as FMC). In 1958, the US Navy tested the largest LVT ever produced, the LVT(U)X2 Goliath produced by Pacific Car and Foundry. The Goliath was large enough to transport any load the conventional LCU could carry, including a 60-ton main battle tank, from a landing dock ship to shore and across beach barriers. Only one Goliath was built and it never became operational. \\"Goliath Goes Anywhere\\" , March 1959, Popular Mechanics \\"US Amphibious Ships and Aircraft\\" , by Norman Friedman, 2002 Currently, many of the world's militaries employ more modern versions of the amtrack. One of the latest is the now cancelled United States Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, that was slated to begin replacing the AAV in 2015 but was cancelled in 2011 after going significantly over budget.  Variants  The US Army used a different naming system from the Navy. Instead of using the usual Army system of Model or M-numbers, they referred to the LVTs by Mark number using Roman numerals rather than Arabic numerals. Hence the LVT-4 was the \\"Mark IV\\" (which was not the same as the \\"M4\\"). LVT-1 =LVT-1 (1941)= The first military model. Traveling at a respectable in the water and on land, it could deliver 24 fully equipped assault troops to the beach and supply supporting fire from two .30 M1919 Browning machine guns though it was only intended for delivering supplies inland until wheeled vehicles could be brought ashore. It was powered by a six-cylinder petrol engine, mounted in a housing in the rear cargo hold. The LVT-1 was propelled on both land and water by tracks which were fitted with Roebling patented oblique shoes that gave good grip on land as well as good drive in the water. Apart of the forward driver's compartment, the bulk of the unarmoured steel hull was given over to a payload cargo hold which was divided into several watertight compartments. 1,225 LVT-1s were built between 1941 and 1943, 485 were transferred to US Army and 200 to British Army. LVT-1 had a maximum speed of on land or in water; and a range of on land or in water. No armor or weapons were included in its design as its role was cargo transport from ship to shore. Many vehicles were refitted prior to the Tarawa landing to hold two Browning heavy machine guns forward, with the .30 guns aft. The vehicle was not armored and its thin steel hull offered virtually no protection, although prior to Tarawa some vehicles received of armor plating to the cab. Tracks performed well on sand, but not on tough surfaces. The rigid suspension threw tracks and roller bearings corroded in salt water. Proper maintenance of the new machine was often an issue, as few Marines were trained to work on it, and early models suffered frequent breakdowns. As LVT-1 vehicles experienced many breakdowns they were gradually phased out of operational use before 1945. = LVT-2 Water Buffalo, British designation Buffalo II (1942)= LVT-2 Water Buffalo with Marines bound for the beaches of Tinian Island, 1944 This was an improved version of LVT-1. It featured a new powertrain (To save time and to simplify production it was the same as that in the M3A1 light tank) and torsilastic suspension. The aluminium track grousers were bolted on, making changes much easier since they wore out quickly on land and even more so on coral. Hard terrain performance was much better compared to the LVT-1. 2,962 units were produced for the US Navy, who then proceeded to transfer 1,507 to the US Army and 100 to the British Army. With a maximum speed of on Land (or on water) and an operational range of miles on land (or on water) the LVT-2 could carry a payload of . LVT-2s participated in more campaigns that any other LVT variant, including Tarawa, Roi-Namur, Cape Gloucester, Northern Kwajalein, Saipan, Guam, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and in some parts of Europe, such as the Rhine crossing of Operation Plunder. =LVT(A)-1 (1942)= LVT(A)-1 The first infantry support LVT. With the first experience of Pacific amphibious operations it was clear heavier firepower than the usual .50 in guns was needed. Based on the LVT-2, A standing for armored, this fire support version had a hull plated with of armor. It was fitted with a turret nearly identical to that of the Light Tank M3, with a 37 mm Gun M6 in an M44 mount, and also carried two rear-mounted machine guns, 509 units were produced. The vehicle's hull was covered in 6-12mm of armor plate, and the vehicle was powered by a air-cooled petrol engine. Despite the limitations imposed by the turret, it could still carry a limited payload of of cargo and had a quite respectable speed of on land and in water, and an operational range of on land or in water. These vehicles were intended to provide fire support to the assaulting Marines in the early stages of establishing a beachhead. It was common, however, for the LVT(A)s to commence firing whilst still in the water, which, considering the amount of naval gunfire that usually accompanied a landing, may have been a waste of ammunition. At Roi- Namur, the 24th Marines had support of LVT(A)-1s, but they could not close up enough to effectively support the troops from the beaches. Other LVT(A)-1s supported the 22nd Marines landing at Engebi. By mid-1944, all LVT(A)-1s had been replaced by much more capable 75mm gun armed LVT(A)-4s. =LVT(A)-2 Water Buffalo (1943)= This was an armored version of the LVT-2 following the US Army request for an armored variant of the LVT-2 cargo Amtrac. Service in the South Pacific soon indicated more protection was needed. This version had the driver's cab protected by of armor plate, and the rest of the hull with armor plate. By 1944, shields were added to protect the front gunners. Surprisingly the additional of armor, added to the weight of the unarmored LVT-2, had no impact on performance and only caused the craft to draw an additional of water when afloat. Capacity 18 troops. 450 units produced. =LVT-4 Water Buffalo, British designation Buffalo IV (1943)= FMC modified an LVT-2 in August 1943 by moving the engine forward and adding a large ramp door in the rear, allowing troops to exit from the rear of the vehicle. Capacity went from 16 troops in the LVT-2 to 30, making earlier LVTs largely obsolete. This innovation also greatly facilitated the loading and unloading of cargo. Some vehicles received armor kits. It was by far the most numerous version of the LVT, with 8,348 units delivered; the US Army received 6,083, and the British Army 500. Many of the British LVT-4 were armed with a 20 mm Polsten cannon and 2 √ó .30 in (7.62 mm) Browning machine guns. Since no major changes were made to the engine and transmission of the LVT-2, the LVT-4 was completed much quicker than the LVT-3, with the first machines going into action at Saipan in June 1944. =Sea Serpent= The Sea Serpent was designed by the 79th Armoured Division for use by the British in the Far East. Its armament was two \\"Wasp\\" flamethrowers and a machine gun. These would have been used by the \\"flame battery\\" of the 34th Amphibian Support Regiment, Royal Marines in any assault on the Japanese mainland but the war ended before they were used.Fletcher, The Universal Tank 1993 HMSO 0 11 290534 X pp 109-110 =LVT(A)-3= Armored version of the LVT-4, never approved for production. =LVT-3 Bushmaster (1944)= LVT-3 Developed by the Borg Warner Corporation as their Model B in April 1943. To allow for rear loading, the engines were moved to the sponsons and a ramp installed in the rear, and slightly wider to provide room for a Jeep to be carried in the cargo hold. Some received armor kits. First used in combat in Okinawa in April 1945. 2,962 units produced, with many remaining in US service until 1955 when they were finally superseded by the LVTP-5. Powered by the same twin Cadillac V-8 petrol engines and transmission of the M5 light tank, it could carry a payload of 9,000 lbs or 30 fully armed soldiers. It performed with efficiency and greater reliability, as more maintenance time was generally available than during the hectic days of World War II. The LVT(3)C remained standard with the Marine Corps until the introduction of the first major post‚Äîwar design, the LVT(P)5, in 1953. Overall weight of the craft was , and its maximum speed was on land or on water, with an operational range of on land or on water. =LVT(A)-4 (1944)= The 37 mm gun of the LVT(A)-1 was inadequate for fire support version so the turret of the 75 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage M8armed with a 75 mm howitzerwas used to produce the LVT (A)-4. In some cases, the 75 mm was replaced with the Canadian Ronson flamethrower. A single .50 cal machine gun was installed on the ring mount above the turret rear. In the late production vehicles, the heavy machine gun was replaced with two M1919A4 .30 MGs on pintle mounts and one more in the bow mount. 1,890 units produced, and 1,307 were transferred to US Army and 50 to British Army. The Chinese PLA captured several from Nationalist forces during the Civil War and placed them in service, eventually modifying some by replacing the 75 mm howitzer with the 37 mm M6 tank gun and others with the ZiS-2 57 mm anti-tank gun, complete with shield, the conversion also necessitating the removal of the original mantlet. =LVT(A)-5 (1945)= LVT(A)-4 with a powered turret and a gyrostabilizer for the howitzer. Some were upgraded in the late 1940s by changing the armor configuration. 269 units produced. LVT-3C =LVT-3C (1949)= Modified LVT-3. An armored roof was fitted and the bow was extended to improve buoyancy. Armament included a .30 MG in a turret and a .30 bow MG in ball mount. 1,200 LVT-3s were converted. =Amphibian, tracked, 4-ton General Service (1944/45)= A British vehicle based on the LVT-4 and known as the Neptune. Only a handful of the 2,000 ordered were completed. The Sealion was a recovery version, and the Turtle a workshop version.

However, the pan-Asian influence on Hawaiian cuisine, and its roots in the Japanese bento, make the plate lunch unique to Hawaii. Standard plate lunches consist of two scoops of white rice, macaroni salad, and an entr√©e. A plate lunch with more than one entr√©e is often called a mixed plate.  Origins  Although the exact origin of the Hawaiian plate lunch is disputed, according to Professor Jon Okamura of the University of Hawai ªi, the plate lunch likely grew out of the Japanese bento, because \\"bentos were take away kinds of eating and certainly the plate lunch continues that tradition\\". Its appearance in Hawaii in recognizable form goes back to the 1880s when plantation workers were in high demand by the fruit and sugar companies on the islands. Laborers were brought to Hawaii from around the world, including from China, Japan, Portugal, and the Philippines. Kaui Philpotts, former food editor of the Honolulu Advertiser, notes that the laborers \\"didn‚Äôt eat sandwiches or things like that; it was leftover rice and a lot of things like canned meat or teriyaki or cold meat or maybe scrambled eggs or pickles, and almost no salad or vegetable.\\" Later on, macaroni salad was added to the plates, as it seemed to bridge national tastes and also mixed well with gravy-covered slabs of meat. Some locations also include the traditional Korean side dish kimchi. As the days of the plantations came to an end, plate lunches began to be served on-site by lunch wagons to construction workers and day laborers. Later, local hole-in-the-wall restaurants and other stand-alone plate lunch restaurants began popping up, then plate lunch franchises. Eventually these made their way to the U.S. mainland such as the L&L; Drive-Inn chain in California in 1999. L&L; founder Eddie Flores rebranded it \\"L&L; Hawaiian Barbecue\\", explaining that \\"When we went to the mainland, the name 'Hawaiian' is a draw, because everyone just fantasized, everyone wants to come to Hawaii.\\"  Popular entr√©es  Overwhelmingly, popular plate lunch entr√©es reflect Asian influence. Of Japanese origin is chicken katsu, fried boneless chicken breaded with Japanese bread crumbs, and beef teriyaki (\\"teri beef\\"). A common side-dish with plate lunches is fried noodles, often chow mein, chow fun or saimin noodles. Entr√©es of Hawaiian origin include kƒÅlua pua ªa (roast pork) and laulau (pork or other meat or fish wrapped in a taro leaf). Some side dishes are lomi-lomi salmon (salmon salad) and haupia (a coconut dessert). Korean entr√©es include kalbi and meat jun. Some side dishes are taegu, a dish made of shredded codfish, and kongnamul muchim, a dish made of seasoned soybean sprouts. Other Asian ethnic contributions include the Okinawan shoyu pork (Okinawan: rafute), Chinese- influenced char siu pork, and Filipino chicken adobo and longanisa. Western European dishes include lingui√ßa, a traditional Portuguese sausage. A notably American element is the hamburger steak, a ground beef patty smothered with brown gravy served atop rice; adding a sunny side up egg makes it a Loco Moco.

It is situated in the northern dock system in Bootle. The dock is connected to Seaforth Dock to the north and what remains of Hornby Dock to the south. Part of Liverpool Freeport, Gladstone Dock is operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. History The dock is named after Robert Gladstone, a merchant from Liverpool and second cousin of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. Designed in the first decade of the twentieth century, construction was eventually completed in 1927 and consisted of of quays and extensive warehouse space. The graving dock was completed in 1913, before the rest of the dock became operational. At long and wide it was designed to take the largest trans-Atlantic steamers. The graving dock has since been converted into a wet dock (Gladstone Number Three Branch Dock). Gladstone Dock lock entrance is one of the two remaining operational river entrances in the northern dock system. Measuring long, wide and deep; was wider, longer and deeper than the Panama Canal locks at the time of opening. The Panama Canal and Gladstone locks could accommodate a maximum size of container ship of 4,500-5,000 twenty-foot- equivalent units (TEUs). The lock provided maritime access to the container terminal of the adjacent Royal Seaforth Dock, which opened in 1972.https://www.peelports.com/media/1234/lpf7-pec-pack-20141.pdf However in 2016 the Panama Canal locks will were enlarged to a size larger than the Gladstone locks: long, wide and deep, accommodating vessels with capacities of up to 14,000 TEUs, depending on the vessel design. Rather than enlarge the Gladstone locks to match the size of the Panama locks, the Port of Liverpool built an in-river berth, in the tidal river, serving a new container terminal called Liverpool2. Container ships unable to enter the Gladstone lock will need to use the adjacent in-river berthing at Liverpool2. Liverpool2 solved the problem of the disruption of enlarging the Gladstone locks, and also giving container handling expansion.http://www.joc.com/port-news/panama-canal- news/panama-canal-locks-officially-open-june-26_20160324.html Simultaneously the NY-NJ port in the USA deepened its access channel and raised the Bayonne Bridge to accommodate the large vessels transiting the Panama Canal. The expansions at Liverpool and New York means larger ships can operate between the two ports.https://www.joc.com/port-news/us-ports/port-new-york-and-new- jersey/ny-nj-port-completes-50-foot-channel-project_20160902.html At the outbreak of the First World War, the liner RMS Aquitania was undergoing repairs in Gladstone Graving Dock. As a result, she was converted in situ for war service. During the Second World War, ASW ships, Atlantic convoy escorts and minesweepers were based in the dock. In 1942 the National Fire Service opened a fire station on Fort Road having a berth for some of its fireboats adjoining the NW Wall of the Dock, this remained open until 1946. On 25 January 1953, the liner RMS Empress of Canada caught fire and capsized in Gladstone Number One Branch Dock. She was refloated the following year and towed to Gladstone Graving Dock to be made watertight, in preparation for being scrapped in Italy. Transatlantic passenger services continued to use the dock until all such services from Liverpool were discontinued in 1971. The main line Gladstone Dock railway station closed to passengers on 7 July 1924 while the Liverpool Overhead Railway station Gladstone Dock (LOR) closed in 1956. A new biomass terminal was built at the docks opening in 2015 with a second phase completed in 2016. Up to 10 trains per day will transport the biomass to power stations.https://www.peelports.com/capabilities/our- investments/liverpool-biomass-terminal Current use As part of Liverpool Freeport, Gladstone Dock's principal uses are: importing coal for the adjacent Hornby Dock coal processing facility, importing biomass from North America at the biomass terminal and exporting scrap metal to the Far East. Gladstone Dock is also used by P&O; Ferries for their regular passenger and freight services from Liverpool to Dublin.https://www.peelports.com/capabilities/our- investments/liverpool-biomass-terminal References Further reading  External links * Port of Liverpool * Category:Liverpool docks ","title":"Gladstone Dock"},{"id":"1129765","text":"The Ugelstad Laboratory was founded at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in January 2002 to commemorate the late Professor John Ugelstad.

It is crossed briefly by the M4 motorway, which along with the Great Western Main Line and all other roads covers of the parish and 'greenspace' which includes cultivated fields covers the most part - this covered (in January 2005) . White Waltham Airfield is in the parish. Extent In the south, the parish includes the hamlets of Paley Street and Littlefield Green. White Waltham village is clustered and sits in the mid-west of the parish. To the northeast is Woodlands Park, on the edge of Maidenhead, and the Maidenhead Business Park. In the northeast corner of the parish is Woolley Green and in the northwest, most of Littlewick Green. History The area was made up of a few manors, many of which evolved into country houses, for example Waltham Place, with its organic farm and gardens which are open to the public. The Church of England parish church of St Mary dates from Norman times, but has many thirteenth century and Victorian features. Frequent disputes as to the boundary between White Waltham and Bray occurred at intervals since 1286 and Thomas Hearne, historian, gives an account of the beating of the boundaries in his own life-time, mentioning all the place-names and commenting on 'the insolence of the parishioners of Bray in transgressing their bounds.' Sir Constantine Henry Phipps, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was buried at St. Mary in 1723. Thomas Hearne was born at Littlefield Green in 1678. Acquiring the patronage of the local lord of the manor, Francis Cherry, he rose to become assistant-keeper of the Bodleian Library in Oxford and the author of many important works. White Waltham School was established in 1828 and has been developed and expanded since, providing primary education for pupils between the ages of 5 and 11 and has legal academy status. The area had approximately half of the population in the late Victorian period but was overall significantly poorer in terms of real property.

A Roman Catholic, he founded the Christian Liberation Movement in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the Cuban Communist Party. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award. On 22 July 2012, he died in a car crash under controversial circumstances. The Cuban government stated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree, while Pay√°'s children and one of the car's passengers asserted that the car had been deliberately run off of the road. Early life Oswaldo Pay√° was born on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and attended a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Pay√° was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, he was sentenced to three years of hard labor on Isla de Pinos when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service. While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Se√±ora de Dolores, that received permission from the Bishop of Havana to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring for the sick. After his release, Pay√° enrolled in the University of Havana as a physics major, but was expelled when authorities discovered him to be a practicing Christian; he then attended night school and switched his major to telecommunications. Pay√° later became an engineer and worked at a state surgical-equipment company. He was offered an opportunity to leave Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, but chose to remain in Cuba and work for change. He married Ofelia Acevedo in 1986 in a Catholic wedding. The pair had three children: Oswaldo Jos√©, Rosa Mar√≠a, and Reinaldo Isa√≠as. Career =Varela Project= In 1987, Pay√° founded the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), which called for nonviolent civil disobedience against the rule of the Cuban Communist Party. The group advocates for civil liberties and freedom for political prisoners. He also began a magazine for Catholics titled People of God (Pueblo de Dios), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure. Pay√° attempted to run for the National Assembly of People's Power (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand. In the late 1990s, Pay√° and other MCL activists began collecting signatures for the Varela Project, a petition drive that would become his best-known program. Named in honor of F√©lix Varela, a Catholic priest who had participated in Cuba's independence struggle with Spain, the Project took advantage of a clause in the Cuban Constitution requiring a national referendum to be held if 11,000 signatures are gathered. In May 2002, Pay√° presented NAPP with 11,020 signatures calling for a referendum on safeguarding freedom of speech and assembly, allowing private business ownership, and ending one-party rule. On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures. Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on Cuban television, bringing Pay√°'s efforts to the attention of a wide Cuban audience. Cuban President Fidel Castro described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government. According to the Los Angeles Times, the petition drive was \\"the biggest nonviolent campaign to change the system the elder Castro established after the 1959 Cuban revolution\\", giving Pay√° an international reputation as a leading dissident. An expert described it as \\"the only initiative of its time that enlisted citizen participation on a large scale\\". Fellow dissident Rene Gomez Manzano, on the other hand, was critical of the Project, stating that appeals to the Communist-Party- controlled NAPP were futile; similarly, other Cuban exiles criticized the initiative for what they considered its implicit acceptance of the legitimacy of the Castro regime and its constitution. Later that year, Pay√°'s efforts were recognized by the European Parliament, which awarded him its Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, although he was nearly denied an exit visa to attend the awards ceremony. In the months that followed, Pay√° met with Pope John Paul II, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, and Mexican President Vicente Fox to discuss the cause of Cuban democratic reform. The Varela Project progress was blocked when the government launched its own petition drive to declare the socialist state \\"irrevocable\\". During the 2003 crackdown popularly known as the Black Spring, MCL members comprised around 40 of the 75 defendants, though Pay√° himself was not arrested. =Later activism= During Castro's illness, which culminated in his 2008 resignation, Pay√° continued to criticize the Cuban government as it transferred power to Castro's brother Ra√∫l. He called on Raul Castro to allow multiparty elections and free all political prisoners, and delivered a petition asking that the Cuban people be granted freedom of travel. In the years before Pay√°'s death, his influence was said to be waning, and attention shifted to younger activists such as blogger Yoani Sanchez. In 2010, WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department cables from Jonathan D. Farrar, head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, describing Pay√° and other older dissidents as \\"hopelessly out of touch\\", writing, \\"They have little contact with younger Cubans and, to the extent they have a message that is getting out, it does not appeal to that segment of society.\\" However, many of the younger generation of dissidents cited him as a role model and expressed grief at his death. Political views =Opposition to United States groups and policy= Pay√° refused to accept U.S. aid and also opposed the U.S. Cuban embargo. In a 2000 editorial for the Miami Herald, he stated that \\"Lifting the embargo won't solve the problems of the Cuban people. Maintaining it is no solution, either\\". He called on the U.S. to immediately lift the embargo on food and medicine. He also maintained his distance from Cuban political groups based in the U.S. In particular, he refused to support their stated goal of land reacquisition upon the return of exiles to Cuba: :\\"It is not a neoliberal programme. For this, we are under attack by the powerful groups in Miami. When people say what is going to happen in Cuba after Fidel, we say ‚Äì hold on, there are 11 million people in Cuba, not only Fidel Castro.\\" =Opposition to government cooperation= In 2005, he also feuded with democracy activist Marta Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification for a further crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions he was allowed to travel abroad, Pay√° reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: \\"I have been told that I am going to be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away.\\" Death Spanish politicians Rosa D√≠ez and Esperanza Aguirre at a tribute event for Pay√°. Pay√° died in a car crash on 22 July 2012 at the age of 60. The incident occurred at 1:50 p.m. near Bayamo in eastern Granma province, according to a statement released by the Cuban government's International Press Center. The chairman of the MCL's youth league, Harold Cepero, also died in the crash. Swedish politician and chairman of the Young Christian Democrats Aron Modig and Spanish politician √Ångel Carromero Barrios were present, but survived with minor injuries. All four were taken to Professor Carlos Manuel Clinical Surgery Hospital in Bayamo, though Pay√° was dead on arrival. The car was driven by Carromero, well known in his country through his numerous but minor violations of traffic laws. In late February 2014, the High Court of Spain upheld the decision of Judge Eloy Velasco, taken in September 2013, not to accept the complaint filed by the family of Oswaldo Pay√° against two senior Cuban military officers for the death of Pay√°. Carromero went on trial in Cuba, where he was convicted of non-planned murder. At a press conference arranged by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating that he had been drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the car had been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash. Pay√°'s daughter Rosa Mar√≠a stated that her father died after the rental car in which he was traveling was rammed several times by another car. Pay√°'s son Oswaldo added that his father had received numerous death threats and stated that the accident's survivors had reported that the car had been deliberately driven off the road. The official statement by the Cuban government stated that the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree. The MCL stated that \\"the circumstances of these deaths have not been cleared up and are open to hypothesis\\" and demanded a \\"transparent\\" inquiry into the accident. On 27 July, the Cuban Interior Ministry forwarded an official report to foreign press, blaming driver error and quoting Carromero as saying that the car had skidded off the road due to poor road conditions and bad weather. Pay√°'s widow rejected the report, stating that the crash was not an accident and that a government report could not be trusted. U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement praising Pay√° as \\"a tireless champion for greater civic and human rights in Cuba\\". U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called for an independent investigation into the crash, imploring the international community to \\"demand that the facts concerning Paya's death be accurately determined and that the surviving witnesses be protected\\". The European Union issued a statement recognizing Pay√°'s dedication \\"to the cause of democracy and human rights in Cuba\\". Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights, stated that \\"This is tragic for the family and the human rights and pro-democracy movement in Cuba ... Pay√° was considered the most notable political leader of the Cuban opposition.\\" Ladies in White president Berta Soler described the death as \\"a terrible blow\\". Pay√°'s funeral was held on 24 July 2012. Dissident groups reported that dozens of activists were arrested on their way to the funeral, including F√©lix Navarro Rodr√≠guez and Guillermo Fari√±as. A scuffle also broke out between activists and state security agents at the funeral itself. Amnesty International and the U.S. criticized the arrests, with the White House describing them as \\"a stark demonstration of the climate of repression in Cuba.\\" The dissidents arrested in Pay√°'s funerals were freed the following day. Oswaldo Pay√°'s daughter Rosa Maria has continued his activism for democratic reforms in Cuba.

Originally assigned to Rockmart, its city of license is now Aragon, west- northwest of Atlanta, and east of Rockmart. The broadcast licensee is Woman's World Broadcasting and operated by Rome Radio Partners, LLC. From June 23, 2014 to September 24, 2018, it was operated by Cox Media Group via a local marketing agreement (LMA). The station's supposed main studio is located on John Davenport Drive in Rome, Georgia. On June 9, 2014, Women's World Broadcasting announced it would turn over operation of country music \\"South 107\\" to Cox Media Group via an LMA. On June 22 of that year, WTSH ended its country format after over 25 years and began stunting with a liner redirecting listeners to WSRM FM as \\"South 93.5\\". On June 23, Cox Media Group started to assume control of 107.1 via LMA. Upon Cox taking over at midnight, 107.1 then flipped to alternative rock as X107.1, similar to the then-recently launched \\"X107.3\\" in Orlando, Florida. The first song on X107.1 was Fever by The Black Keys. Despite mostly covering outside of the Atlanta metro area (even with the \\"translator\\" station's coverage included), it identifies itself entirely as an Atlanta station during on-air promos. The station ID includeed all three stations at the top of each hour: \\"WTSH-FM Aragon, W296BB Jonesboro, WSB-FM HD3 Atlanta\\". Just over a year later, on June 29, 2015, WTSH went back to their heritage country format, simulcasting WNGC as 106.1/107.1 Your Georgia Country. The change comes as X107.1 failed to gain any traction up against WRDA/WRDG generating only a 0.5 share in the May 2015 Nielsen Audio ratings.X107.1 Atlanta Gives Way To Country On September 24, 2018, WTSH-FM (as a result of the LMA with Cox Media Group ending) switched from a simulcast with country-formatted WNGC to a simulcast with regional Mexican-formatted WLKQ-FM in Buford, branded as \\"La Raza 102.3/107.1\\".Your Georgia Country Gives Way to La Raza in Atlanta Radioinsight - September 24, 2018 The LMA and the \\"translator\\" station allowed Cox to circumvent restrictions on the excessive concentration of media ownership in the Atlanta media market. Since the \\"translator\\" station is not attributable under the FCC rules, and the main station's official service contour does not overlap Cox's WSRV FM 97.1 to the northeast or that of Cox's WALR-FM 104.1 to the southwest, it allows Cox to exceed the cap through technicalities and loopholes. Locally, Cox also owns WSB AM 750 and its simulcast on WSBB-FM 95.5, as well as WSB-FM 98.5, WSB-TV 39 (2.1 and 2.2), and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Broadcast translators and station move WTSH-FM currently broadcasts with 100,000 watts from west-central Bartow County near Kingston, Georgia. In early May 2012, it applied to move to the WCCV FM 91.7 tower on Mullinax Mountain between Euharlee and Wax, Georgia, due west of Cartersville and southeast of Rome. This application was later dropped, and another filed in later July 2013 was for another location further southwest near Taylorsville, north-northwest of Rockmart. (Relative to metro Atlanta, this is two counties due west of Acworth.) , this application was still pending. WTSH's owner also purchased broadcast translator W296BB, also on 107.1, but licensed to serve Jonesboro, and previously rebroadcasting WMVV FM 90.7 within its own coverage area (with no terrain obstructions that would make such a translator necessary). It is now assigned to retransmit WSB-FM 98.5, indicating that HD3 digital subchannel now simulcasts WTSH, providing a legal fiction for circumventing the FCC rules which prohibit a translator or booster of a commercial radio station from reaching outside the main station's legal broadcast range. A construction permit issued for W296BB allowed it to move to the WSB-TV 39 (DTV 2.1 & 2.2) TV tower over Freedom Parkway just east of downtown Atlanta, increasing it from 13 to the maximum 250 watts, and using a directional antenna with a major null toward the northwest so as to reduce RF interference to WTSH. It went on- air in February 2014, making it at least the second station to be taken from Clayton county to retransmit another commercial station with an already-good signal in the area (the other being W275BK FM 102.9 from Riverdale). The two stations are synchronized as a single-frequency network, the same way a booster station would be. This means that the stations transmit the same audio at exactly the same time, intended to make for a nearly seamless transition for listeners. The main indication is static, most often occurring around southeastern Cobb county, near the Chattahoochee River and the northwestern part of the Perimeter (I-285 around Atlanta). This is due to the two stations being around the same signal strength in this area, and the numerous hills, which causes the relative levels of the two to rapidly oscillate back and forth (picket-fencing) when travelling at freeway speeds. Slower speeds or stationary listening may actually be more difficult, as the listener is stuck in small pockets of poor reception for longer periods. The zone of RF interference moves hourly and daily based on weather and overnight temperature inversions, which affect radio propagation, especially over the longer distance from the main station. The two stations may also have their actual carrier waves synchronized via GPS for further stability, and to avoid phase cancellation, but as a matter of physics it is impossible to avoid the switching caused by FM's capture effect. In 2003, an application was made for another translator station in Rome on 98.7 by Broadcast Investment Associates. This station, which took the FCC a decade to approve, received a construction permit in December 2013, after a reapplication four months prior. Given broadcast callsign W254CF, it also listed WTSH-FM as its primary station, and still shows a location with the city limits just northwest of downtown Rome along Martha Berry Highway (U.S. 27 and Georgia 1). Previously illegal to retransmit a non-FM station, W254CF is now directly assigned to simulcast WRGA AM 1470, another Rome Radio Partners property. WTSH previously had translator W269CC FM 101.7 in Adairsville, which now rebroadcasts WJTH AM 900 in Calhoun, both in upper northwest Georgia.

Personal and Political Life Bijan Jazani was born to Hossien Jazani (ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ≤ŸÜ€å) and Alamtaj Kalantari Nazari (ÿπÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ¨ ⁄©ŸÑÿßŸÜÿ™ÿ±€å ŸÜÿ∏ÿ±€å). His parents' family, separately, began participating in the Tudeh party during a period of political freedom that started from the exile of Reza Shah until the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh. The children of these two families became attracted to and then joined the Tudeh youth party. Their activities in the party grew and later gained important responsibilities. His father, who was a military officer, joined the Tudeh party in 1945. His mother, Alamtaj Kalantari was a member of the Women's Tudeh party. In 1947, when Bijan Jazani was 9 years old, his father joined the Democratic Azerbaijan group and in the same year with the fall of Pishevari his father left for the Soviet Union and remained there until 1967. It was for this reason that Alamtaj Kalantari took Bijan Jazani and his sisters to her parents' home. This period had a major impact in the future political life of Jazani. He lived in a household whose members had a professional role in the Tudeh party. During this time his mother expanded her activities in the women's Tudeh party and Jazani alongside his uncle, who was 2 years older than he was, joined the Tudeh Youth Organization in 1948, at the age of 10. After the Tudeh party became illegal on February 4, 1949, Jazani continued participation in the youth party. He was then chosen as the messenger of the youth organization because of his young age and his family background. But the hidden activities of the Tudeh party and the affiliated organizations did not last long and from 1951, the activities slowly became semi-transparent. In addition to this, the leaders of the Tudeh and the youth organization created the \\"Iranians in favor of Peace\\", \\"National Organization in the Struggle against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Corporation\\", \\"Democratic Youth Organizations\\", and the \\"Student Organization of Tehran\\". Jazani began his activities in the \\"Student Organization of Tehran\\" in 1951‚Äì1952 and was initially responsible for a small group. In 1953 he became semi-responsible for this organization. He was also active in the circulation and sale of student newspapers and began a gym in 1951, which helped students and developed into a place for recruiting members into the youth organization. These activities continued‚Äîexcept in a short two-month period with the death of his sister Manijeh (ŸÖŸÜ€å⁄òŸá)‚Äîuntil the Coup d'√®tat of August 19, 1953 (Ÿ¢Ÿ® ŸÖÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ Ÿ°Ÿ£Ÿ£Ÿ¢). Jazani was arrested in December 1953 because of his political activities, but gave the name Hossien Mahmoodi (ÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖŸàÿØ€å) to the court and after 3 months in prison at a military court, was released under bond. He continued his political activities but was arrested in May 1954 at an organization gathering‚Äîdisguised under a wedding ceremony‚Äîand again gave a false name and was released under bond. In the fall of the same year, he was summoned in relation with the incident of December 1953 and served a 6-month prison term. After release from prison he focused on family while keeping true to his political views. He wasn't allowed back to high school so he joined the art school of Kamal-ol-Molk. He created the Persepolis Advertising Company (⁄©ÿßŸÜŸàŸÜ ÿß⁄ØŸá€å Ÿæÿ±ÿ≥ŸæŸàŸÑ€åÿ≥) with the help of a friend. The company advertised in the form of paintings for local merchants. Jazani drew the paintings and the business side was left to his friend. The success of the company led to the creation of the Nabl Film Institution (ŸÖŸàÿ≥ÿ≥Ÿá ŸÜÿ®ŸÑ€å ŸÅ€åŸÑŸÖ) in the late 1950s. The company developed TV advertising in Iran and gave financial stability to Jazani. In 1959, with his company making enough money, he went back to his studies and received his diploma. The following year he signed up for the philosophy program at the University of Tehran. At this time, after eight years of close friendship with his childhood friend and member of the youth organization, Mihan Ghoreishy (ŸÖ€åŸáŸÜ ŸÇÿ±€åÿ¥€å), he married her on October 13, 1960. The result of the marriage were two sons, Babak (ÿ®ÿßÿ®⁄©) and Mazyar‚Äîalias Maximilien (ŸÖÿßÿ≤€åÿßÿ±). From the years 1956 until 1959, Jazani had no political activities. His wife in this matter wrote: in these years \\"We had no thoughts of a political future, we relied on our love and in the advancement of our studies. We spent most of our free time reading and at the theaters\\". In 1959, he returned to politics and created a magazine named Nedaye Khalgh (ŸÜÿØÿß€å ÿÆŸÑŸÇ) with the goal of uniting the politic groups against the coup d'√®tat regime. In the winter of 1959, because of the tight political climate the circulation of the magazine was halted. Activity in an open Political Climate When Jazani entered the University of Tehran, the country was facing political and economical problems that led to a retreat for the Shah. These problems were caused by the inabilities of the Shah's economic policies and the extreme military expenses begun after the Coup d'√®tat in 1953. In the spring of 1960 due to mounting debt and inflation the government of Iran requested immediate financial assistance from the World Bank and the government of the United States. The World Bank demanded the Iranian government to fix budget problems, reduce salaries, and balance certain economical plans in order to receive 35 million dollars of assistance. The administration of John F. Kennedy also demanded political and economical reform in the Shah's government for 85 million dollar assistance. Economical problems and external pressure to perform the reforms, led to instability of the regime. The Shah in order to deal with this problem announced the elections of the 20th majlis would be free to all organizations. Although this promise did not come to reality, it showed the retreat of the regime and the opening of a political climate in Iran. The leaders of the Iranian National Front (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸáŸá ŸÖŸÑ€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ) officially announced the existence of the second national front movement and began their activities. Jazani and his followers slowly moved from the Tudeh party to the student and national front organizations because of their interest in the guerilla movement in Latin America. Jazani began participating in the student movement at the University of Tehran. The following three reasons are what made him a leader in the student movement: 1\\\\. His organizational and leadership experience in street protests that he had gained in the years 1953‚Äì1956. These skills would assist him in student protests. 2\\\\. Jazani made quick decisions that he would stand by even though he always put time in understanding the situation but only enough to not slow down the movement. 3\\\\. Because of an extensive connection he always had good information and because of his superior experience compared to the people around him, he was always calm. Payam Daneshjoo (ŸÜÿ¥ÿ±€åŸá Ÿæ€åÿßŸÖ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ÿ¨Ÿà) In early fall of 1963 Jebhe Melli Daneshjoo (ÿ≥ÿßÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ÿ¨Ÿà€åÿßŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ®ŸáŸá ŸÖŸÑ€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ), which after the resistance in Baharestan Ave., had lost hope to the politics of \\"patience and hope\\"; with the help of officials and leaders of the National Front (Iran) (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸáŸá ŸÖŸÑ€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ) selected a new leader for this movement. This led to the creation of the third national movement in the year 1965 and the publication Payam Daneshjoo (ŸÜÿ¥ÿ±€åŸá Ÿæ€åÿßŸÖ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ÿ¨Ÿà) in the fall of 1963‚Äîoriginally published under Jebhe Melli Daneshjoo. Jazani had a major role in this process; Payam Daneshjoo reflected a united movement in the political struggle for students in Iran. Up to March 1964, Hassan Habiby was editor and responsible for collecting information, articles, and news; while Jazani was in charge of the publication process. In the spring of 1964 a committee was selected to run the publication made up of all factions of the student movement. Hooshang Keshavarz Sadr, Matin Daftari, Majeed Ahsan, and Mansoor Soroush were part of this committee. Jazani was in charge of publication and Behzad Nabavi (ÿ®Ÿáÿ≤ÿßÿØ ŸÜÿ®Ÿà€å) was responsible for circulation. The preliminary work related to the print was done by Jazani at his home. The printing was done on a hand made copy machine that was not only labor-intensive, it also demanded a safe environment from the authorities. Jazani had rented a hidden house for this purpose and in all stages of the process from financial to print had a major role. By the spring of 1965, roughly 500 copies were published where a number of them were spread by Bahmanpour Shareaty to officials of different universities in the Tehran province and others circulated by Matin Daftari and Dariush Forouhar in non-university related locations. In this period almost all of the process, from writing articles up to publication was done by leftist student movements (Jazani's group, Tudeh (ÿ™ŸàÿØŸá), loyalists of Maleki, and loyalists of Shoaeeyan). Jazani wrote several articles explaining the ideology of his movement in the publication. The activities of the third national movement had increasingly worried SAVAK (ÿ≥ÿßŸàÿß⁄©). On May 22, 1965, Savak arrested Mostafa Mallad and Bahmanpour Shareaty. In the afternoon of that same day they arrested Jazani and a number of organizers of the student movement such as Majeed Ahsan, Shireen Sour Esrafeel, Manoochehr Taghavee.... These arrests signaled the end of a political freedom in Iran under the Shah's regime, resulting in the end of the third national movement in 1965. It seems that SAVAK was unaware of the role of Jazani in the publication of Payam Daneshjoo since the arrest was on charges related to participation in circulation of the publication. The main reason for this mistake by SAVAK was Jazani's concealed presence in the publication. After his arrest some of his friends such as Iraj Vahedeepour in order to show that Jazani had no role in the publication, continued the publication for a couple issues after his arrest. Even so, Jazani and other student activists remained in prison until February 1966 where the court ruled a 9-month sentence but was immediately released given that he had already served his time in prison. After prison, Jazani continued his studies and in 1966 graduated with a doctorate degree in philosophy from the University of Tehran. Guerilla Movement Jazani, after release from prison with all his power began the development and organization of his movement. In spring of 1966, Hassan Zia-Zarifi was added to group and with his recommendation united the organization with the Razm Avaran organization. Razm Avaran was organized by Abbass Sourky in 1959 and its members in the years before 1953 were members of the Tudeh party and until February 15, 1960, when for promotion and circulation of the party in universities were arrested supported the ideologies of the Tudeh party. But in 1964, when Sourky again organized Razm Avaran, not only did he not want to associate with the Tudeh party but supported the ideology of the Communist Party of China. The recommendation of Hassan Zia-Zarifi, due to the characteristics of Sourky such as inexperience, crowded work, and his past affiliations that led to him being arrested, caused the central authority of the group to be uninterested with this prospect. But, due to internal problems such as impatience of members of the long process of development, which showed when Keyoumars Ezadi left the group, led to the decision to negotiations between the two groups. Even though in the negotiations between Jazani, Zarifi, and Saeed Kalantari Nazari by Sourky and Zarar Zahedian there were major uncertainty to Sourky had been developed by Jazani; the prospect of adding 120 ready members and a large number of explosives and artillery finally led to the merger of the Razm Avaran group with the Jazani group in fall 1966. There were major problems with this merger. The 120 ready members did not take the organization seriously and were spread from the central group. From the members of Razm Avaran only Sourky and Zahedian met the regulations that would allow members to join the military wing and the central authority. The others became part of the reserve units of the group. One of these members was Naser Aghayan who from 1963 participated with the SAVAK and gave details of Razm Avaran's plan and members. After the merger between the two groups, Aghayan gave reports of the activities of Jazani's group to SAVAK. Ideology of Jazani's Group Jazani in respect to the group's views writes: \\"The experience of group members in Marxist-Leninist activities previous to joining the group led to it being known as followers of the Marxist-Leninist ideology without any discussion\\". But they were different from other organizations of their time such as Tudeh, Jebheh Engelabi, etc. in this ideology. What was important for Jazani and his followers was to have an independent understanding of Marxism-Leninism without influence from China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, their key goal and what shaped their views was to do what benefited the people of Iran. For example, their position on the Soviet Union, which called itself the leader of the world communist movement, was based on this viewpoint. They began with the idea that the foreign policy of a country is a result of the social values of its regime. This policy reflects the benefits of the leadership level (consisting of a class system) and reflects the ideology of the ruling class. Therefore, a socialist government must be loyal to the goals of Marxist-Leninist and international pluralism. In this setting, they came up to the following conclusion in regard to the relationship of the Soviet Union and Iran: \\"In our opinion the policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Iran opposes the growth and revolutionary struggle Asian countries against Imperialism and is in conflict with the chief idea of international pluralism and socialist diplomacy.\\" It was in this vision that Jazani explained in the relationship of the group and the Soviet Union: \\"The group had many reasons to not be happy with the idea of Soviet Union being the leader of the world revolutionary movements. The Soviet Unions policies in Iran in the past twenty years and the few years of bad relationship between the Soviet Union and the Tudeh party were known to the members of the group.\\" It was because of this that Jazani came to the conclusion when seeing the relationship of the Soviet Union and Tudeh and Eastern Europe at the end of the decade of 1950 that: \\"... if the left movement wins the struggle in Iran, it must be aware of the Soviet Union's wanting of power. Failing to do so will lead to Iran becoming another satellite of the Soviets.\\" Jazani said that if the power of the leftist movement falls in the hands of the Soviets, before anything else it will get rid of us. He believed that geographically Iran is too close to the Soviet Union to ignorantly come close to it without understanding the harms involved. In the evaluation of other organizations in Iran, Jazani before discussing the organizations ideology, it would study its role in the benefit of the people of Iran. For example, in response to the blunders of the Tudeh party, which he once was a member, he gave the following conclusion: # Inability to understand the objective of internationalism and formation of mistaken relationships with the Soviet government and the Soviet Communist Party from the beginning to the end. # Being unaware of Iran's society, history, and not paying attention to the struggle against imperialism that caused the Tudeh party to lag behind from other nationalistic freedom movements. # Positioning itself against Mohammed Mossadegh (Persian: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÖÿµÿØŸÇ) and the National Front (Iran) (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸáŸá ŸÖŸÑ€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ) # Weakness and second guessing in the Coup d'√®tat of August 19, 1953 (Ÿ¢Ÿ® ŸÖÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ Ÿ°Ÿ£Ÿ£Ÿ¢) that resulted in the strategic loss of the Tudeh party and the labor movement # The continuation of the weakness of the rest of the Tudeh party inside and outside of the country resulting in the disunity the labor movement There is not much information regarding Jazani and his group's early views towards the Iranian community. The earliest information regarding Jazani is in 1963 where he announced that the ruthlessness of the Shah is from feudalism and the efforts that have been taken to fix this issue did not have any positive impact. Therefore, the revolutionary forces of Iran are the farmers whose responsibility is to begin a war from the village's that would result in a popular revolution. But in the fall of 1966, Jazani and the members of the group changed this viewpoint, which was reflected in an article titled \\"The Iranian anti-tyrannical movement, freedom fighters, and the communists' duty in the current situation.\\" They came to the conclusion that after the Coup d'√®tat of August 19, 1953 (Ÿ¢Ÿ® ŸÖÿ±ÿØÿßÿØ) capitalism in Iran grew and began to shape the policy of the government. Its members, who were mostly pro-American, began to have a bigger and wider role in the government of Iran. Since feudalism was a hurdle in the growth of capitalism in Iran they began to demand land, political, and social reform. This was in parallel with the requests of reform in Iran by America, but the Shah and the ruling government, who were protected by England, stood against these reforms. Jazani saw the failed Coup d'√®tat of General Gharani as a step by America to break the stance of the Shah and also the reemergence of efforts by the National Front (Iran) (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸáŸá ŸÖŸÑ€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ) that was the result of the instability of political and economic situation in Iran, resulted in forcing Amini-Arsanjani on the Shah. But Amini not only with the protection of America wanted economic, government, and social reforms; he wanted to create reforms in Iranian politics. Therefore, the Shah saw the continuation of the Amini-Arsanjani government as a hurdle in his efforts for full dictatorship and replaced them by himself and put the torch of reform in his own hands. The Shah put these reforms in place to show his unequivocal powers and at the same time by killing his political opponents the Shah increased those powers. Although political reform did not come to fruit but land reform had a damaging effect on feudalism. Land reforms impacted positively the shape of power in villages and rural areas and the political powers of the land owners decreased significantly. Jazani used this to come to the conclusion that the since the continuation of the regime is \\"dictatorship\\" therefore the ideology of the revolution in its most urgent political goal results in the overthrow of monarchy and its most needed revolutionary political goal is summed up with the slogan of \\"Establishment of a Republic and Democratic Government\\". Because of this, even though Jazani never stroked out nonviolent struggle, but in the current circumstance came to the conclusion that open political activity is inconceivable. The government has left no possibility for this kind of activity; therefore the only method of struggle is guerrilla warfare. In the selection of this tactic Jazani and the members of the group were effected by the guerrilla warfare of South America and Vietnam and the works of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, and R√©gis Debray were their main teachers. It was only Jazani and Zia-Zarifi that worked on the ideology of the group. The reaction towards secret activities and book reading resulted in the unimportance of theory in the group. Some of the members of the group were disgusted of any kind of research and made joke of it. From early 1957, the group acted to address this problem but its effects on the group remained. The change of the stance of the group resulted in the decrease of the importance of struggle in the mountains and between the villagers and increase in the importance of the struggle in the cities and the group prepared its activities according to that. But this change of tactics led to problems in the center of the group. Manoochehr Kallantari that he does not believe in the ideology of the group and Shahrzad believed that the group could not make it work. Even though after discussions they changed their positions and accepted the decision of the center of the group but in reality they were sidelined from the group's activities. Kallantari was sent to London and Shahrzad was transferred to the reserve force and in October 1967 because of disagreement with the method of stealing from the bank, after the ruling from the center of the group he was let off from the organization. Arrest and Prison Life In early 1968, the activities of the organization had reached a stalemate mainly due to lack of funds. The group decided to gain the required money from robbing banks. Their first attempt at this was to be on January 12, 1968, but three days prior to that date Aghayan notified the SAVAK of the group's plans. This led to the arrest of Jazani and Sourky and hiding of other members of the organization. The arrest of Shahrzad, whose location was notified to the Savak by Aghayan, led to the arrests of Izadi, Rashidi, Ahsan, Farokh Negahdar and others. In addition five other members of the group (Zarifi, Jaleel Afshar, Choopan Zadeh, Saeed Kalantari Nazari, and Keyanzad) were arrested by the SAVAK with the assistance of Abbas-Ali Shahryari and his organization. Even though the key members of the organization had been arrested, the group was not completely destroyed. Safaii Farahani and Safari Ashtiani left Iran and joined Palestinian organization Fatah. After returning to Iran Farahani and Safari organized the Siahkal (ÿ≥ŸäÿßŸá⁄©ŸÑ) uprising on February 8, 1971. Shortly after that the remaining members of the group including Hamid Ashraf and Masoud Ahmadzadeh reorganized and renamed it to Iranian People's Fadaee Guerrillas (⁄Üÿ±ŸäŸÉ ŸÅÿØÿßŸäŸäÿßŸÜ ÿÆŸÑŸÇ ÿßŸäÿ±ÿßŸÜ). In February 1969, Jazani's group was indicted under military court. Jazani was sentenced to prison for life for participation in an organization against the monarchy and carrying an illegal weapon, which was later reduced to 15 years. The sentences for other members varied, ranging from 2 to 10 years. The group's members were located at Gasr prison until spring of 1969, when Saeed Kalantari Nazari, Sourky, Sarmady, and Choopan Zadeh attempted to escape from prison. This led to the relocation of the majority of the group members to rural areas. Jazani was sent to Qom with ordinary prisoners. Because of the respect of the prison guards towards Jazani, he was allowed to spend most of his time in the prison library studying and painting. In this period, Jazani with the assistance of his wife gets in contact with the unknown members of the group and guides them in an ideological sense. In the summer of 1970 he writes \\"What a revolutionary must know\\" and signs it in the name of Safaii Farahani to help Safaii strengthen his position in the group. When Siahkal occurred, through interrogation of the participants by SAVAK, they find out about the relationship of Jazani and the group. In March 1971, SAVAK brings Jazani to Tehran. From that time on, Jazani remains in Tehran and was located in between other political prisoners. In Tehran, he increases his activities in prison. Jazani had the opinion that prison is a piece of the activity outside and therefore must reflect the policies of the group. In this thought, he introduced three things to active political participants in prison: first, standing strong and holding ones place; second, contact with outside; and third development of an organization inside prison. Jazani lived his life in prison based on this. With the help of his wife and other prisoners he developed contact with the Iranian People's Fadaee Guerrillas outside of prison and created a leftist movement inside prison. This responsibility of this movement was to organize resistance, manage activities, and teaching a political and ideological to leftist prisoners and recruitment for Iranian People's Fadaee Guerrillas. The activity of Jazani caused problems from two sides in prison. The officials of SAVAK who thought of Jazani as a major problem in prison attempted to stop him from his activities. On the other side, leftist prisoners who disagreed with Jazani acted in various ways against Jazani's activities. SAVAK also created problems between these leftist factions. The majority of those against Jazani, were the followers of Masoud Ahmadzadeh and Amir Parviz Pooyan, two of the founders of Iranian People's Fadaee Guerrillas. Although these two individuals were killed in 1972, their teachings were the official teachings of the movement up to 1976. Jazani thought these two individuals teachings were distractive and his book \\"Armed struggle in Iran: The road to mobilization of the masses\\" was written in response to a book written by Ahmadzadeh \\"Armed struggle, both tactic and strategy\\". Even though Jazani did not mention Parviz Pooyan or Ahmadzadeh in his book; when discussing and offering his thoughts he disapproves those offered by these two individuals. Even though there were major differences between the teachings of Jazani and Ahmadzadeh. There were two focal items that were discussed between these two schools of thoughts. These were that the revolutionary situation of the country and the method of struggle. The ones that disagreed with Jazani and approved Ahmadzadeh were under the belief that the country is in a revolutionary status and situations for a revolution exists. Therefore, a guerrilla fighter must fight with artillery to make the people aware of the revolutionary status of the country. A smaller motor, military uprising will turn a larger motor, the population; and the larger population will support the military uprising and bring down the Shah's government. In Ahmadzadeh's opinion, not believing the revolutionary situation shows a sense of individualism, which in the opinion of the leftist movement is that of a traitor. Jazani would explain that a revolutionary status does not exist in the country and in addition to that a revolution does not result from armed struggle rather it comes about as a development of a political, social, economical, and ideological process. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a revolution by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this without talking about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani writes \\"When we hear that revolution begins with a military uprising, we have to say that the believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we want is a specific one.\\" The second major problem was the method of struggle. Ahmadzadeh believed that the only means of battle is a military one and had a strategic role in their fight. Jazani believed in the current situation one should not limit their means to one method but we should prepare the people in a political sense from all sides. With this effort one can fight against injustice and dictatorship for a better life for all people. This will first fix the problem with communication between people and second the social injustices develop a populous sense against the Shah in Iran and the world, and a dictator regime would fall. Even though Jazani attempted to resolve issues through dialogue and unite the various leftist factions, his opponents dismantled the leftist movement in prison to decrease Jazani's influence. Even so, Jazani remained active to the end of his life when he was murdered alongside 8 other prisoners on April 19, 1975, by Savak. Bahman Naderipour, a SAVAK agent and closely involved with the executions, described that day's events: > We took the prisoners to the high hills above Evin. They were blind-folded > and their hands were tied. We got them off the minibus and had them sit on > the ground. Then, Attarpour told them that, just as your friends have killed > our comrades, we have decided to execute you‚Äîthe brain behind those > executions. Jazani and the others began protesting. I do not know whether it > was Attarpour or Colonel Vaziri who first pulled out a machine gun and > started shooting them. I do not remember whether I was the 4th or 5th person > to whom they gave the machine gun. I had never done that before. At the end, > Sa'di Jalil Esfahani [another SAVAK agent, known as Babak] shot them in > their heads [to make sure that they were dead].Mirror Images: Tehran's > Fundamentalists and the Exiled Secular Fundamentalists There are suggestions of that Naderipour might have been subjected to torture after being detained by the revolutionary government, therefore the details of his narrative, which was obtained under duress, is questionable by all standards. The circumstance of Bijan Jazani's death will remain a mystery. The only truth that remains is that he was killed by execution shortly before finishing his sentence. All of Jazani's books were written in prison from 1970 to 1974. They discussed the establishment of the independent leftist movement in the two decades of the 1960s and '70s. Jazani is buried in the 33rd block of Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.

In the 1970s, he concentrated on photography, returning to paint in the 1980s, when he produced abstract works created by chance through chemical reactions between paint and other products. In the last 20 years of his life, he produced paintings focused on historical events and perceptions of them.

His family escaped from the Communist regime in East Germany in 1953, traveling first to West Berlin and then to West Germany Rhineland. Upon his arrival in West Germany, in Willich near Krefeld, Polke began to spend time in galleries and museums and worked as an apprentice in a stained glass factory in D√ºsseldorf between 1959 and 1960, before entering the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf (Arts Academy) at age twenty. From 1961 to 1967 he studied at the D√ºsseldorf Arts Academy under Karl Otto G√∂tz, Gerhard Hoehme and deeply influenced by his teacher Joseph Beuys. He began his creative output during a time of enormous social, cultural, and artistic changes in Germany and elsewhere. During the 1960s, D√ºsseldorf, in particular, was a prosperous, commercial city and an important centre of artistic activity. In the early 1970s Polke lived at the Gaspelhof, an artists' commune. From 1977 to 1991, he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Hamburg. His students included, among others, Georg Herold. He settled in Cologne in 1978, where he continued to live and work until his death in June 2010 after a long battle with cancer..

This title also referred to the realist style of art known as \\"Socialist Realism\\", then the official art doctrine of the Soviet Union and its satellites (from one which he had fled with his family), but it also commented upon the consumer-driven art \\"doctrine\\" of western capitalism. He also participated in \\"Demonstrative Ausstellung\\", a store-front exhibition in D√ºsseldorf with Manfred Kuttner, Lueg, and Richter. Essentially a self-taught photographer, Polke spent the next three years painting, experimenting with filmmaking and performance art. =Photography= In 1966‚Äì68, during his most conceptual period, Polke used a Rollei camera to capture ephemeral arrangements of objects in his home and studio.Raphael Rubinstein (27 August 2011), Sigmar Polke Art in America Magazine. In 1968, the year after he left the art academy, Polke published these images as a portfolio of 14 photographs of small sculptures he had made from odds and ends‚Äîbuttons, balloons, a glove. From 1968 to 1971, he completed several films and took thousands of photographs, most of which he could not afford to print. During the 1970s, Polke slowed his art production in favor of travel to Afghanistan, Brazil, France, Pakistan, and the U.S., where he shot photographs (using a handheld 35mm Leica camera)Sigmar Polke: Photographs, 1968‚Äì1972, February 20 ‚Äì May 20, 2007 Getty Center, Los Angeles. and film footage that he would incorporate in his subsequent works during the 1980s. In 1973 he visited the U.S. with artist James Lee Byars in search of the \\"other\\" America; the fruit of that journey was a series of manipulated images of homeless alcoholics living on New York's Bowery.Kristine McKenna (3 December 1995), Sigmar Polke's Layered Look : The photographs of the influential German are hard to pin down‚Äîas is the artist himself Los Angeles Times. He produced an additional series of photographic suites based on his journeys to Paris (1971), Afghanistan and Pakistan (1974) and S√£o Paulo (1975), often treating the original image as raw material to be manipulated in the dark room, or in the artist's studio. Beginning with his 1971 Paris photographs printed using chemical staining to create works full of strange presencesSigmar Polke Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sidney. while under the influence of LSD, Polke exploited the photographic process as a means to alter \\"reality.\\"Sigmar Polke, Quetta, Pakistan (1974) Christie's Contemporary Art Evening Sale, 16 November 1999, New York. He combined both negatives and positives with images that had both vertical and horizontal orientations. The resulting collage-like compositions take advantage of under- and overexposure and negative and positive printing to create enigmatic narratives. With the negative in his enlarger, the artist developed large sheets selectively, pouring on photographic solutions and repeatedly creasing and folding the wet paper.Sigmar Polke, Untitled (1975) Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Completed in 1995 in collaboration with his later wife Augustina von Nagel, a suite of 35 prints entitled \\"Aachener Strasse\\" combine street photography with images from Polke's paintings, developed using techniques of multiple exposures and multiple negatives. =Painting= Pop Art from Polke, Propellerfrau (1969) Polke's early work has often been characterised as European Pop art for its depiction of everyday subject matter‚Äîsausages, bread and potatoes‚Äîcombined with images from the mass media. His \\"Rasterbilder\\" from that period are works that exploit the raster-dot technique of printing as a way as of subverting and bringing into question the apparent truth, validity and purpose of the media images that his paintings appropriate.Sigmar Polke, Strand (1966) Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale, 8 February 2007, London. He imitated the dotted effect of commercial newsprint by painstakingly painting each dot with the rubber at the end of a pencil.Sigmar Polke: History of Everything, October 2, 2003 ‚Äì January 4, 2004 Tate Modern, London. In works such as Carl Andre in Delft (1968), the Propellerfrau (1969) or, later, Protective Custody (1978) Polke used a canvas made of furnishing fabric, thus elevating it to the status of a visual motif.Sigmar Polke: The Three Lies of Painting, 7 June ‚Äì 12 October 1997 Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle Bonn. His creative output during this time of enormous social, cultural, and artistic changes in Germany and elsewhere, demonstrate most vividly his imagination, sardonic wit, and subversive approach in his drawings, watercolors, and gouaches produced during the 1960s and 1970s. Embedded in these images are incisive and parodic commentaries on consumer society, the postwar political scene in Germany, and classic artistic conventions.Sigmar Polke: Works on Paper 1963‚Äì1974, MOMA; ISBN . Returning to painting in the 1980s, he maintained his interest in alchemical properties. In 1980, he began exploring Australia and Southeast Asia, working with materials like arsenic, meteor dust, smoke, uranium rays, lavender, cinnabar and a purple pigment from the mucous excreted by snails.Carol Vogel (18 July 2013), MoMA's Polke Moment New York Times. He began to make large, gestural paintings which combined figurative and abstract imagery. During the 1980s he experimented with materials and chemicals, mixing together traditional pigments with solvents, varnishes, toxins and resins to produce spontaneous chemical reactions. These experiments produced elaborate abstract paintings which reflect on the concepts of originality and authorship which underpin the Modernist tradition and, in particular, the mystique of American Abstract Expressionism.Sigmar Polke Guggenheim Collection. A complicated \\"narrative\\" is often implicit in the multi-layered picture, giving the effect of witnessing the projection of a hallucination or dream through a series of veils. Polke often soaked the fabric for his paintings in resin to make it transparent. He also painted the coloured shapes on the back, so they show through as shadowy forms. By pouring colour substances on a laid out canvass and directing the process only to a restricted degree through swaying the picture's surface, Polke surrenders the task of pictorial invention to the colours themselves.Sigmar Polke: Painting as a Game without Limits Goethe-Institut. In 1994, he produced The Three Lies of Painting, where a landscape containing a mountain and a tree is intercut with abstract devices before succumbing to the intrusive presence of a large, vertical strip of printed fabric. It is festooned with multicoloured hands, suggesting once again that Polke wants to emphasise the artist's own manipulative.Sigmar Polke The Times. In the mid-1990s Polke began to work on a new series called Druckfehler, or ‚ÄòPrinting Mistakes‚Äô, inspired by printing errors found in newspapers. Fascinated by the relationship between the random mistake and the original image, Polke would enlarge and manipulate the distorted newsprint. He then paints the image onto a polyester surface with the aid of a projector, and coats it in layers of resin. Buried within this elaborate surface are sheets of gold mesh, creating yet another filter through which the image must be read.Sigmar Polke: History of Everything, October 2, 2003 ‚Äì January 4, 2004 Tate Modern, London. In a few cases, Polke \\"manufactured\\" these so-called mistakes; the elongated figures in Aus 'Lernen neu zu Lernen' (From 'Learning to Learn Anew') (1998) are the result of his having dragged a picture through a photocopier. In 2002, Polke developed a new technique of ‚Äòmachine painting‚Äô. These are his first completely mechanically-produced paintings and are made by tinting and altering images on a computer and then photographically transferring them onto large sheets of fabric. Up until this point Polke had rejected mechanical processes, preferring to explore the visual effects of mechanical technology by hand.Sigmar Polke: History of Everything, October 2, 2003 ‚Äì January 4, 2004 Tate Modern, London. From 2007, Polke continued to develop and refine his \\"Lens Paintings\\" series. The conceptual framework of the Lens Paintings is grounded in theories set forth by monk Johann Zahn in a 1685 book on a \\"teledioptric artificial eye\\", a forerunner of the telephoto lens. Polke's painted \\"lens\\" generates a variety of distortions, mutations and spatial illusions when seen from different viewpoints. =Films= When asked to participate in Konrad Fischer's museum exhibition \\"Konzeption/Conception\\" (1969) at Museum Morsbroich, Polke suggested he make a film in which he scratches himself and uses a pendulum. The resulting film Der ganze K√∂rper f√ºhlt sich leicht und m√∂chte fliegen (The Whole Body Feels Light and Wants to Fly) (1969), made in collaboration with Christof Kohlh√∂fer, is a 35-minute piece in which, Polke scratches himself and uses a pendulum. He also reads from the esoteric 19th-century grimoires The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses (almost inaudibly as he keeps giggling all the time) and poses as the letter X, with parallel lines of white string connecting the legs of his trousers with the arms of his shirt.J√∂rg Heiser, Cosmic Rays Frieze, Issue 110, October 2007. =Commissioned works= For the reopening of the Reichstag in Berlin in 1999, Polke created a series of large, three-dimensional lightboxes. Lighted from behind, images seen through the grooved surfaces of these lightboxes change as the viewer moves past them. Drawing on his early glass-painting training, Polke realized a series of stained-glass windows for the Grossm√ºnster cathedral in Zurich between 2006 and 2009. Exhibitions Polke had his first one-person show at Galerie Ren√© Block, West Berlin, in 1966, and in 1970 he had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Michael Werner. His first solo exhibition in New York, of paintings made at least a decade earlier, was at the Holly Solomon Gallery in SoHo in 1982. Following a 1987 show at the Milwaukee Art Museum grouping Warhol, Beuys and Polke, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago mounted a solo show for Polke in 1991. Polke exhibited at three documenta and several Venice Biennial exhibitions. By the latter years of his life, Polke's artistic achievements were being recognised in large-scale exhibitions around the world, with solo shows at Tate Modern in 2003‚Äì2004, Tokyo's Ueno Royal Museum in 2005 and the Getty Center in Los Angeles in 2007.Obituary: Sigmar Polke The Daily Telegraph. In 2007, the \\"Museum Moderner Kunst\\" (MUMOK) held an exhibition of Polke's work entitled \\"Sigmar Polke: Retrospektive\\". Also in 2007, Axial Age (2005‚Äì2007), a monumental cycle of paintings, was shown for the first time at the 2007 Venice Biennale, with the wish explicitly expressed by the artist that the work should remain on display in Venice.Sigmar Polke ‚Äì In praise of doubt Palazzo Grassi, Venice. Polke is scheduled to have a retrospective \\"Alibis: Sigmar Polke 1963‚Äì2010\\" shown at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, from 19 April to 3 August 2014, then travels to Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom and Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany. Legacy Through his numerous high-profile exhibitions, Polke exerted an international influence, affecting somewhat younger artists such as his compatriots Martin Kippenberger and Albert Oehlen, Lara Schnitger (Dutch-American artist), the Americans Richard Prince, Julian Schnabel and David Salle, and the Swiss duo Fischli & Weiss.Roberta Smith (6 November 1987), Sigmar Polke's Witty Disappearing Act New York Times.Christopher Masters (14 June 2010), Sigmar Polke obituary The Guardian. The artist John Baldessari described Polke as an \\"artist‚Äôs artist\\".Carol Vogel (27 May 2007), The Alchemist‚Äôs Moment: The Reclusive Mr. Polke New York Times.

The airport, which opened July 11, 1983, serves mostly general aviation and includes facilities for aircraft maintenance, flight training, parking, and air traffic control training. Boundary Bay is Canada's fifth busiest airport by total aircraft movements, and the country's busiest general aviation airport. It is the location of the former Canadian Forces Station Ladner. In December 2004, Boundary Bay Airport was acquired by Alpha Aviation. In April 2008, Alpha Aviation established a fixed-base operation (FBO) and Alpha Executive Air began operating regularly scheduled flights twice daily between Boundary Bay Airport and Victoria International Airport on Vancouver Island, as well as charter service using turbine pressurized aircraft. Many smaller airlines use Boundary Bay Airport's maintenance facilities. As of 2010, Alpha Executive Air ceased operations but Boundary Bay Air Services - Vancouver FBO is open serving business, corporate, and general aviation customers. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers are available on call to handle entry for general aviation aircraft carrying no more than 15 passengers. History Control tower at Boundary Bay. The airfield was originally built in 1941 as Canadian Forces Station Ladner to train military pilots in anticipation of the Second World War. The base closed in 1979. Following the closure of Canadian Forces Station Ladner, the site was used by the community of Ladner for picnics, public fairs and auto racing. When it became apparent that Vancouver International Airport could no longer sustain general aviation and commercial traffic, Transport Canada proposed reactivating Boundary Bay for general aviation. The airport underwent restoration, and on July 11, 1983 two of the three runways were reopened as Boundary Bay Airport. The other runway and some ramp space was made available for driver training and other events. Alpha Aviation acquired the Boundary Bay Airport and assumed management on December 1, 2004, under a lease currently held by the Corporation of Delta. Shortly thereafter, under the terms of the lease, driver training, auto-X and drag racing were removed from the airport, allowing Alpha Aviation to focus on runway, facility and land-use improvements. Investment by Alpha Aviation and a grant from the British Columbia government enabled an extension of runway 07/25, improving usability of the runway for corporate jets. The upgrades mean that Boundary Bay Airport may now be included as a prime alternative landing destination to Vancouver International Airport (YVR). A new maintenance hangar at the airport is now complete, and the old maintenance hangar has been declared a Heritage site. Space is available on a lease basis in the Heritage hangar for aircraft storage. In January 2008, Boundary Bay Airport's largest tenant, Heli-One, a division of CHC Helicopter moved into new facilities at Boundary Bay Airport. A building was constructed to provide repair and maintenance services. Other maintenance facilities include Canada West Avionics, Halcyon Aviation, R & Z Avionics and Safari Express Aircraft Maintenance.Airport Services In February 2010, Alpha Aviation opened the new terminal just off taxiway \\"C\\". This new facility offers facilities for general aviation and private aircraft, with services run by Alpha Aviation. The new facility will allow Boundary Bay Airport to accommodate regional airlines.

The Allied invasion fleet embarking the expeditionary forces left Pearl Harbor on 5 June 1944, the day before Operation Overlord in Europe was launched. The U.S. 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and the Army's 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, defeated the 43rd Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito. The loss of Saipan, with the deaths of at least 29,000 troops and heavy civilian casualties, precipitated the resignation of Prime Minister of Japan Hideki T≈çj≈ç and left the Japanese archipelago within the range of United States Army Air Forces B-29 bombers. Background In the campaigns of 1943 and the first half of 1944, the Allies had captured the Solomon Islands, the Gilbert Islands, the Marshall Islands and the Papuan Peninsula of New Guinea. This left the Japanese holding the Philippines, the Caroline Islands, the Palau Islands, and the Mariana Islands. It had always been the intention of the American planners to bypass the Carolines and Palauan islands and to seize the Marianas and Taiwan. From these latter bases, communications between the Japanese archipelago and Japanese forces to the south and west could be cut. From the Marianas, Japan would be well within the range of an air offensive relying on the new Boeing B-29 Superfortress long-range bomber with its operational radius of . While not part of the original American plan, Douglas MacArthur, commander of the Southwest Pacific Area command, obtained authorization to advance through New Guinea and Morotai toward the Philippines. This allowed MacArthur to keep his personal pledge to liberate the Philippines, made in his \\"I shall return\\" speech, and also allowed the active use of the large forces built up in the southwest Pacific theatre. The Japanese, expecting an attack somewhere on their perimeter, thought an attack on the Caroline Islands most likely. To reinforce and supply their garrisons, they needed naval and air superiority, so Operation A-Go, a major carrier attack, was prepared for June 1944.

Battle of Saipan - US Navy docked GAG03 Japanese cannon at Saipan, after battle Japanese beach defense The bombardment of Saipan began on 13 June 1944. 15 battleships were involved, and 165,000 shells were fired. Seven modern fast battleships delivered 2,400 shells, but to avoid potential minefields, fire was from a distance of or more, and crews were inexperienced in shore bombardment. The following day the eight older battleships and eleven cruisers under Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf replaced the fast battleships but were lacking in time and ammunition. The landings began at 07:00 on 15 June 1944. More than 300 LVTs landed 8,000 Marines on the west coast of Saipan by about 09:00. Eleven fire support ships covered the Marine landings. The naval force consisted of the battleships and , the cruisers and , the destroyers , , , , , , and . Careful artillery preparation ‚Äî placing flags in the lagoon to indicate the range ‚Äî allowed the Japanese to destroy about 20 amphibious tanks, and they strategically placed barbed wire, artillery, machine gun emplacements, and trenches to maximize the American casualties. However, by nightfall, the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions had a beachhead about wide and deep. The Japanese counter-attacked at night but were repulsed with heavy losses. On 16 June, units of the U.S. Army's 27th Infantry Division landed and advanced on the airfield at √Ös Lito. Again the Japanese counter-attacked at night. On 18 June, Saito abandoned the airfield. The invasion surprised the Japanese high command, which had been expecting an attack further south. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), saw an opportunity to use the A-Go force to attack the U.S. Navy forces around Saipan. On 15 June, he gave the order to attack. But the resulting battle of the Philippine Sea was a disaster for the IJN, which lost three aircraft carriers and hundreds of planes. The garrisons of the Marianas would have no hope of resupply or reinforcement. Without resupply, the battle on Saipan was hopeless for the defenders, but the Japanese were determined to fight to the last man. Saito organized his troops into a line anchored on Mount Tapotchau in the defensible mountainous terrain of central Saipan. The nicknames given by the Americans to the features of the battle ‚Äî \\"Hell's Pocket\\", \\"Purple Heart Ridge\\" and \\"Death Valley\\" ‚Äî indicate the severity of the fighting. The Japanese used many caves in the volcanic landscape to delay the attackers, by hiding during the day and making sorties at night. The Americans gradually developed tactics for clearing the caves by using flamethrower teams supported by artillery and machine guns. The operation was marred by inter-service controversy when Marine General Holland Smith, unsatisfied with the performance of the 27th Division, relieved its commander, Army Major General Ralph C. Smith. However, General Holland Smith had not inspected the terrain over which the 27th was to advance. Essentially, it was a valley surrounded by hills and cliffs under Japanese control. The 27th took heavy casualties and eventually, under a plan developed by General Ralph Smith and implemented after his relief, had one battalion hold the area while two other battalions successfully flanked the Japanese.Harold Goldberg, D-Day in the Pacific: The Battle of Saipan, Indiana University Press, 2007. pp. 160‚Äì164. By 6 July, the Japanese had nowhere to retreat. Saito made plans for a final suicidal banzai charge. On the fate of the remaining civilians on the island, Saito said, \\"There is no longer any distinction between civilians and troops. It would be better for them to join in the attack with bamboo spears than be captured.\\" At dawn of the 7 July, with a group of 12 men carrying a great red flag in the lead, the remaining able-bodied troops ‚Äî about 4,000 men ‚Äî charged forward in the final attack. Amazingly, behind them came the wounded, with bandaged heads, crutches, and barely armed. The Japanese surged over the American front lines, engaging both Army and Marine units. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 105th Infantry Regiment were almost destroyed, losing well over 650 killed and wounded. However, the fierce resistance of these two battalions, as well as that of Headquarters Company, 105th Infantry, and of supply elements of 3rd Battalion, 10th Marine Artillery Regiment, resulted in over 4,300 Japanese killed and 2,000 dead US soldiers. For their actions during the 15-hour Japanese attack, three men of the 105th Infantry Regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor: Lt. Col. William O'Brien, Cpt. Ben L. Salomon, Pvt. Thomas A. Baker, all posthumously. The attack on 7 July would be the largest Japanese Banzai charge in the Pacific War.Harold Goldberg, D-Day in the Pacific: The Battle of Saipan, Indiana University Press, 2007. pp. 167‚Äì194. By 16:15 on 9 July, Admiral Turner announced that Saipan was officially secured.John Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936‚Äì1945, Random House, 1970, p. 516 Saito, along with commanders Hirakushi and Igeta, committed suicide in a cave. Vice-admiral Chuichi Nagumo, the naval commander who led the Japanese carriers at Pearl Harbor, also committed suicide in the closing stages of the battle. He had been in command of the Japanese naval air forces stationed on the island. In the end, almost the entire garrison of troops on the island ‚Äî at least 29,000 ‚Äî died. For the Americans, the victory was the most costly to date in the Pacific War: out of 71,000 who landed, 2,949 were killed and 10,464 wounded.Battle of Saipan ‚Äì The Final Curtain, David MooreJohn Toland, ibid, p. 519.

He was serving with \\"I\\" Company, 24th Marine Regiment, when he was hit by shrapnel in the buttocks by Japanese mortar fire during the assault on Mount Tapochau. He was awarded the Purple Heart and was given a medical discharge with the rank of private first class in 1945.Zec, Donald. Marvin: The Story of Lee Marvin. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1980, , pp. 36‚Äì39. pillbox on Saipan Gen. Smith and V Amphibious Corps anticipated that taking Saipan would be difficult and they wanted to have a mechanized flame throwing capability. Research, development, and procurement made that a long-term prospect. So VAC purchased 30 Canadian Ronson flame throwers and requested that the Army's Chemical Warfare Service in Hawaii install them in M3 Stuart's. Seabees with the CWS had 24 ready for the battle. Further resistance While the battle officially ended on July 9, Japanese resistance still persisted with Captain Sakae ≈åba and 46 other soldiers who survived with him during the last banzai charge.Jones (1986)Japan's renegade hero gives Saipan new hope After the battle, Oba and his soldiers led many civilians throughout the jungle of the island to escape capture by the Americans, while also conducting guerrilla-style attacks on pursuing forces. The Americans tried numerous times to hunt them down but failed due to their speed and stealth. In September 1944, the Marines began conducting patrols in the island's interior, searching for survivors who were raiding their camp for supplies. Although some of the soldiers wanted to fight, Captain ≈åba asserted that their primary concerns were to protect the civilians and to stay alive to continue the war. At one point, the Japanese soldiers and civilians were almost captured by the Americans as they hid in a clearing and ledges of a mountain, some were less than 20 feet (6.1 m) above the heads of the Marines, but the Americans failed to see them. Oba's holdout lasted for over a year (approximately 16 months) before finally surrendering on December 1, 1945, three months after the official surrender of Japan. Oba was so successful in his resistance that the Marines nicknamed him the \\"Fox\\", and once even caused the reassignment of a commander. Civilian casualties Being a former Spanish and then German territory, Saipan became a Mandate of Japan by order of the League of Nations after World War I, and thus a large number of Japanese civilians lived there by World War II ‚Äî at least 25,000. The U.S. erected a civilian prisoner encampment on 23 June 1944 that soon had more than 1,000 inmates. Electric lights at the camp were conspicuously left on overnight to attract other civilians with the promise of three warm meals and no risk of being shot in combat accidentally. The weapons used and the tactics of close quarter fighting resulted in high civilian casualties. Civilian shelters were located virtually everywhere on the island, with very little difference from military bunkers noticeable to attacking Marines. The standard method of clearing suspected bunkers was the use of high-explosive and/or high-explosives augmented with petroleum (e.g., gelignite, napalm, diesel fuel). Consequently, there were high civilian casualties.When Soldiers Kill Civilians: The Battle for Saipan, 1944 More than 1,000 Japanese civilians committed suicide in the last days of the battle to take the offered privileged place in the afterlife, some jumping from places later named \\"Suicide Cliff\\" and \\"Banzai Cliff\\". These would become part of the National Historic Landmark District as Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; & Marpi Point, Saipan Island, designated in 1985. Today the sites are a memorial and Japanese people visit to console the victims' souls. American military awards ;Robert H. McCard Robert H. McCard On 16 June 1944, Gunnery Sergeant Robert H. McCard, a U.S. Marine, killed sixteen enemies while sacrificing himself to ensure the safety of his tank crew. McCard was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. The , a Gearing-class destroyer, was named in his honor. ;Harold G. Epperson On 25 June 1944, PFC Harold G. Epperson, part of the 2nd Marine Division, threw himself on a grenade to contain the blast from killing members of his squad. For his bravery and sacrifice, PFC Epperson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Epperson's Medal of Honor was presented to his mother in a ceremony on Wednesday, 4 July 1945 in Tiger Stadium, Massillon, Ohio. The , a Gearing-class destroyer, was named in his honor. ;William O'Brien When the 1st Battalion, 105th Infantry Regiment came under attack from a much larger enemy force on 7 July, Lieutenant Colonel William O'Brien refused to leave the front lines even after being wounded, and continued to lead his men until being overrun and killed. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on 9 May 1945, for his actions throughout the battle for Saipan. The U.S. Army ship USAT Col. William J. O'Brien, which served in the Pacific Ocean at the end of World War II, was named in his honor. ;Thomas A. Baker On 7 July, Private Thomas A. Baker and his comrades from the 1st Battalion, 105th Infantry Regiment, came under attack by a large Japanese force. Although seriously wounded early in the attack, he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight in the close-range battle until running out of ammunition. When a comrade was wounded while trying to carry him to safety, Baker insisted that he be left behind. At his request, his comrades left him propped against a tree and gave him a pistol, which had eight bullets remaining. When American forces retook the position, they found the pistol, now empty, and eight dead Japanese soldiers around Baker's body. Baker was posthumously promoted to sergeant and, on 9 May 1945, awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions throughout the battle for Saipan. He was buried at Gerald B. H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville, New York. ;Ben L. Salomon On 7 July 1944, Army Captain Ben L. Salomon, the battalion dentist of 2nd Battalion, 105th Infantry Regiment, 27th Infantry Division aided the evacuation of wounded soldiers. After defending his unarmed patients from four Japanese soldiers, he manned a machine gun post and effectively repelled numerous enemy forces to enable the evacuation of wounded personnel. When his body was recovered after the battle, 98 dead Japanese soldiers were found in front of his position. For gallantry in battle, Captain Ben L. Salomon was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in May 2002. Salomon was the third Jewish service member to be awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II. ;Guy Gabaldon Isely Field, filled with B-29 bombers, mid-1945 PFC Guy Gabaldon, of Headquarters and Service Company, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, was a Mexican-American from Los Angeles. He is officially credited with capturing more than 1,000 Japanese prisoners during the battle. PFC Gabaldon, who was raised by Japanese-Americans, used a combination of street Japanese and guile to convince soldiers and civilians alike that U.S. troops were not barbarians, and that they would be well treated upon surrender. For his outstanding bravery, which earned him the nickname, \\"The Pied Piper of Saipan,\\" Gabaldon received a Silver Star, which was upgraded to the Navy Cross. During the war, his commanders had requested that he receive the Medal of Honor for his actions; however, his initial award was the Silver Star. In 1998, efforts were re-initiated to secure the Medal of Honor for PFC Gabaldon. The effort was ongoing in 2006. Aftermath Although major fighting had officially ceased on 9 July, pockets of Japanese resistance continued. In September 1944, U.S. Marines began patrols into the island interior in order to bring in civilians and soldiers still holding out in the jungles. A group led by Captain Sakae Oba managed to evade capture for more than 512 days until surrendering to American forces on 1 December 1945, three months after the official surrender of Japan. In February 2011, a film about Oba, Oba: The Last Samurai, was released in Japan. With the capture of Saipan, the American military was now only away from the home islands of Japan. The victory would prove to be one of the most important strategic moments during the war in the Pacific Theater, as the Japanese archipelago was now within striking distance of United States' B-29 bombers.Philip A. Crowl, Campaign in the Marianas, vol 9., United States Army in World War II, The War in the Pacific From this point on, Saipan would become the launch point for retaking other islands in the Mariana chain and the invasion of the Philippines in October 1944. Four months after capture, more than 100 B-29s from Saipan's Isely Field were regularly attacking the Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese mainland. In response, Japanese aircraft attacked Saipan and Tinian on several occasions between November 1944 and January 1945. The U.S. capture of Iwo Jima (19 February ‚Äì 26 March 1945) ended further Japanese air attacks. The loss of Saipan was a heavy blow to both the military and civilian administration of Prime Minister of Japan Hideki T≈çj≈ç. According to one Japanese admiral: \\"Our war was lost with the loss of Saipan.\\" U.S. Marine Corps General Holland Smith said: \\"It was the decisive battle of the Pacific offensive [...] it opened the way to the Japanese home islands.\\"Henry I. Shaw, Jr., Bernard C. Nalty, and Edwin T. Turnbladh, Central Pacific Drive, vol. 3, History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II Shortly after Saipan was taken, a meeting at the Imperial General Headquarters was convened where it was decided that a symbolic change of leadership should be made: T≈çj≈ç would step aside and Emperor Hirohito would have less involvement in day-to-day military affairs, even though he was defined as both head of state and the Generalissimo of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces according to the Meiji Constitution of 1889. The general staff believed it was now time to distance the Imperial House of Japan from blame as the tide of war turned against the Japanese. Although T≈çj≈ç agreed to resign, Hirohito blocked his resignation because he considered T≈çj≈ç to be Japan's strongest war leader. But after T≈çj≈ç failed to shuffle his Cabinet due to excessive internal hostility, he conceded defeat. On 18 July, T≈çj≈ç again submitted his resignation, this time unequivocally. His entire cabinet resigned with him.Hoffman, p. 260. Former IJA General Kuniaki Koiso became Prime Minister on 22 July. However, due to the legacy of Saipan, Koiso was nothing more than a titular Prime Minister, and was prevented by the Imperial General Headquarters from participating in any military decisions. Saipan also saw a change in the way Japanese war reporting was presented on the home front. Initially, as the battle started, Japanese accounts concentrated on the fighting spirit of the IJA and the heavy casualties it was inflicting on American forces. However, any reader familiar with Saipan's geography would have known from the chronology of engagements that the U.S. forces were relentlessly advancing northwards. No further mention of Saipan was made following the final battle on 7 July, which was not initially reported to the public.Edwin P. Hoyt, Japan's War, pp. 348‚Äì9 However, after T≈çj≈ç's resignation on 18 July, an accurate, almost day-by-day, account of the defeat on Saipan was published jointly by the Army and Navy. It mentioned the near total loss of all Japanese soldiers and civilians on the island and the use of \\"human bullets\\". The reports had a devastating effect on Japanese opinion; mass suicides were now seen as defeat, not evidence of an \\"Imperial Way\\".Edwin P. Hoyt, Japan's War, p 352 This was the first time Japanese forces had accurately been depicted in a battle since Midway, which had been proclaimed a victory. Memorial Suicide Cliff and Banzai Cliff, along with a number of surviving isolated Japanese fortifications, are recognized as historic sites on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The cliffs are also part of the National Historic Landmark District Landing Beaches; Aslito/Isley Field; & Marpi Point, Saipan Island, which also includes the American landing beaches, the B-29 runways of Isley Field, and the surviving Japanese infrastructure of the Aslito and Marpi Point airfields. The American Memorial Park on Saipan commemorates the U.S. and Mariana veterans of the Mariana Islands campaign.

To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the attack surface. Vulnerability management is the cyclical practice that varies in theory but contains common processes which include: discover all assets, prioritize assets, assess or perform a complete vulnerability scan, report on results, remediate vulnerabilities, verify remediation - repeat. This practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems. A security risk is often incorrectly classified as a vulnerability. The use of vulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion. The risk is the potential of a significant impact resulting from the exploit of a vulnerability. Then there are vulnerabilities without risk: for example when the affected asset has no value. A vulnerability with one or more known instances of working and fully implemented attacks is classified as an exploitable vulnerability‚Äîa vulnerability for which an exploit exists. The window of vulnerability is the time from when the security hole was introduced or manifested in deployed software, to when access was removed, a security fix was available/deployed, or the attacker was disabled‚Äîsee zero-day attack. Security bug (security defect) is a narrower concept. There are vulnerabilities that are not related to software: hardware, site, personnel vulnerabilities are examples of vulnerabilities that are not software security bugs. Constructs in programming languages that are difficult to use properly can manifest large numbers of vulnerabilities. Definitions ISO 27005 defines vulnerability as: :A weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats, where an asset is anything that has value to the organization, its business operations and their continuity, including information resources that support the organization's missionBritish Standard Institute, Information technology -- Security techniques -- Management of information and communications technology security -- Part 1: Concepts and models for information and communications technology security management BS ISO/IEC 13335-1-2004 IETF RFC 4949 vulnerability as:Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 4949 Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 :A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, or operation and management that could be exploited to violate the system's security policy The Committee on National Security Systems of United States of America defined vulnerability in CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 National Information Assurance Glossary: :Vulnerability‚ÄîWeakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. Many NIST publications define vulnerability in IT context in different publications: FISMApedia term provide a list. Between them SP 800-30,NIST SP 800-30 Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems give a broader one: :A flaw or weakness in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy. ENISA defines vulnerability in as: :The existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can lead to an unexpected, undesirable event [G.11] compromising the security of the computer system, network, application, or protocol involved.(ITSEC) The Open Group defines vulnerability inTechnical Standard Risk Taxonomy Document Number: C081 Published by The Open Group, January 2009. as :The probability that threat capability exceeds the ability to resist the threat. Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) defines vulnerability as:\\"An Introduction to Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR)\\", Risk Management Insight LLC, November 2006 ; :The probability that an asset will be unable to resist the actions of a threat agent According FAIR vulnerability is related to Control Strength, i.e. the strength of a control as compared to a standard measure of force and the threat Capabilities, i.e. the probable level of force that a threat agent is capable of applying against an asset. ISACA defines vulnerability in Risk It framework as: :A weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control Data and Computer Security: Dictionary of standards concepts and terms, authors Dennis Longley and Michael Shain, Stockton Press, , defines vulnerability as: :1) In computer security, a weakness in automated systems security procedures, administrative controls, Internet controls, etc., that could be exploited by a threat to gain unauthorized access to information or to disrupt critical processing. 2) In computer security, a weakness in the physical layout, organization, procedures, personnel, management, administration, hardware or software that may be exploited to cause harm to the ADP system or activity. 3) In computer security, any weakness or flaw existing in a system. The attack or harmful event, or the opportunity available to a threat agent to mount that attack. Matt Bishop and Dave BaileyMatt Bishop and Dave Bailey. A Critical Analysis of Vulnerability Taxonomies. Technical Report CSE-96-11, Department of Computer Science at the University of California at Davis, September 1996 give the following definition of computer vulnerability: :A computer system is composed of states describing the current configuration of the entities that make up the computer system. The system computes through the application of state transitions that change the state of the system. All states reachable from a given initial state using a set of state transitions fall into the class of authorized or unauthorized, as defined by a security policy. In this paper, the definitions of these classes and transitions is considered axiomatic. A vulnerable state is an authorized state from which an unauthorized state can be reached using authorized state transitions. A compromised state is the state so reached. An attack is a sequence of authorized state transitions which end in a compromised state. By definition, an attack begins in a vulnerable state. A vulnerability is a characterization of a vulnerable state which distinguishes it from all non-vulnerable states. If generic, the vulnerability may characterize many vulnerable states; if specific, it may characterize only one... National Information Assurance Training and Education Center defines vulnerability:Schou, Corey (1996). Handbook of INFOSEC Terms, Version 2.0. CD-ROM (Idaho State University & Information Systems Security Organization)NIATEC Glossary :A weakness in automated system security procedures, administrative controls, internal controls, and so forth, that could be exploited by a threat to gain unauthorized access to information or disrupt critical processing. 2. A weakness in system security procedures, hardware design, internal controls, etc. , which could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information. 3. A weakness in the physical layout, organization, procedures, personnel, management, administration, hardware, or software that may be exploited to cause harm to the ADP system or activity. The presence of a vulnerability does not in itself cause harm; a vulnerability is merely a condition or set of conditions that may allow the ADP system or activity to be harmed by an attack. 4. An assertion primarily concerning entities of the internal environment (assets); we say that an asset (or class of assets) is vulnerable (in some way, possibly involving an agent or collection of agents); we write: V(i,e) where: e may be an empty set. 5. Susceptibility to various threats. 6. A set of properties of a specific internal entity that, in union with a set of properties of a specific external entity, implies a risk. 7. The characteristics of a system which cause it to suffer a definite degradation (incapability to perform the designated mission) as a result of having been subjected to a certain level of effects in an unnatural (manmade) hostile environment. Vulnerability and risk factor models A resource (either physical or logical) may have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat actor. The result can potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources (not necessarily the vulnerable one) belonging to an organization and/or other parties involved (customers, suppliers). The so-called CIA triad is a cornerstone of Information Security. An attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation, compromising integrity or availability. A \\"passive attack\\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources, compromising confidentiality. OWASP: relationship between threat agent and business impact OWASP (see figure) depicts the same phenomenon in slightly different terms: a threat agent through an attack vector exploits a weakness (vulnerability) of the system and the related security controls, causing a technical impact on an IT resource (asset) connected to a business impact. The overall picture represents the risk factors of the risk scenario.ISACA THE RISK IT FRAMEWORK (registration required) Information security management system A set of policies concerned with the information security management system (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to Risk management principles, the countermeasures to ensure a security strategy is set up following the rules and regulations applicable to a given organization. These countermeasures are also called Security controls, but when applied to the transmission of information, they are called security services. Classification Vulnerabilities are classified according to the asset class they are related to:ISO/IEC, \\"Information technology -- Security techniques-Information security risk management\\" ISO/IEC FIDIS 27005:2008 * hardware ** susceptibility to humidity or dust ** susceptibility to unprotected storage ** age-based wear that causes failure ** over-heating * software ** insufficient testing ** insecure coding ** lack of audit trail ** design flaw * network ** unprotected communication lines (e.g. lack of cryptography) ** insecure network architecture * personnel ** inadequate recruiting process ** inadequate security awareness ** insider threat * physical site ** area subject to natural disasters (e.g. flood, earthquake) ** interruption to power source * organizational ** lack of regular audits ** lack of continuity plans ** lack of security Causes *Complexity: Large, complex systems increase the probability of flaws and unintended access points. *Familiarity: Using common, well-known code, software, operating systems, and/or hardware increases the probability an attacker has or can find the knowledge and tools to exploit the flaw. *Connectivity: More physical connections, privileges, ports, protocols, and services and time each of those are accessible increase vulnerability. *Password management flaws: The computer user uses weak passwords that could be discovered by brute force. The computer user stores the password on the computer where a program can access it. Users re-use passwords between many programs and websites. *Fundamental operating system design flaws: The operating system designer chooses to enforce suboptimal policies on user/program management. For example, operating systems with policies such as default permit grant every program and every user full access to the entire computer. This operating system flaw allows viruses and malware to execute commands on behalf of the administrator. *Internet Website Browsing: Some internet websites may contain harmful Spyware or Adware that can be installed automatically on the computer systems. After visiting those websites, the computer systems become infected and personal information will be collected and passed on to third party individuals. *Software bugs: The programmer leaves an exploitable bug in a software program. The software bug may allow an attacker to misuse an application. *Unchecked user input: The program assumes that all user input is safe. Programs that do not check user input can allow unintended direct execution of commands or SQL statements (known as Buffer overflows, SQL injection or other non-validated inputs). *Not learning from past mistakes:Ross Anderson. Why Cryptosystems Fail. Technical report, University Computer Laboratory, Cam- bridge, January 1994.Neil Schlager. When Technology Fails: Significant Technological Disasters, Accidents, and Failures of the Twentieth Century. Gale Research Inc., 1994. for example most vulnerabilities discovered in IPv4 protocol software were discovered in the new IPv6 implementations.Hacking: The Art of Exploitation Second Edition The research has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human: so humans should be considered in their different roles as asset, threat, information resources. Social engineering is an increasing security concern. Vulnerability consequences The impact of a security breach can be very high. The fact that IT managers, or upper management, can (easily) know that IT systems and applications have vulnerabilities and do not perform any action to manage the IT risk is seen as a misconduct in most legislations. Privacy law forces managers to act to reduce the impact or likelihood of that security risk. Information technology security audit is a way to let other independent people certify that the IT environment is managed properly and lessen the responsibilities, at least having demonstrated the good faith. Penetration test is a form of verification of the weakness and countermeasures adopted by an organization: a White hat hacker tries to attack an organization's information technology assets, to find out how easy or difficult it is to compromise the IT security. The proper way to professionally manage the IT risk is to adopt an Information Security Management System, such as ISO/IEC 27002 or Risk IT and follow them, according to the security strategy set forth by the upper management. One of the key concept of information security is the principle of defence in depth, i.e. to set up a multilayer defense system that can: * prevent the exploit * detect and intercept the attack * find out the threat agents and prosecute them Intrusion detection system is an example of a class of systems used to detect attacks. Physical security is a set of measures to physically protect an information asset: if somebody can get physical access to the information asset, it is widely accepted that an attacker can access any information on it or make the resource unavailable to its legitimate users. Some sets of criteria to be satisfied by a computer, its operating system and applications in order to meet a good security level have been developed: ITSEC and Common criteria are two examples. Vulnerability disclosure Coordinated disclosure (some refer to it as 'responsible disclosure' but that is considered a biased term by others) of vulnerabilities is a topic of great debate. As reported by The Tech Herald in August 2010, \\"Google, Microsoft, TippingPoint, and Rapid7 have issued guidelines and statements addressing how they will deal with disclosure going forward.\\" The other method is typically called Full disclosure which is when all the details of a vulnerability is publicized, sometimes with the intent to put pressure on the software author to publish a fix more quickly. In January 2014 when Google revealed a Microsoft vulnerability before Microsoft released a patch to fix it, a Microsoft representative called for coordinated practices among software companies in revealing disclosures. =Vulnerability inventory= Mitre Corporation maintains an incomplete list of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in a system called Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. This information is immediately shared with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where each vulnerability is given a risk score using Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) scheme, and Common Weakness Enumeration. OWASP maintains a list of vulnerability classes with the aim of educating system designers and programmers, therefore reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being written unintentionally into the software. Vulnerability disclosure date The time of disclosure of a vulnerability is defined differently in the security community and industry. It is most commonly referred to as \\"a kind of public disclosure of security information by a certain party\\". Usually, vulnerability information is discussed on a mailing list or published on a security web site and results in a security advisory afterward. The time of disclosure is the first date a security vulnerability is described on a channel where the disclosed information on the vulnerability has to fulfill the following requirement: * The information is freely available to the public * The vulnerability information is published by a trusted and independent channel/source * The vulnerability has undergone analysis by experts such that risk rating information is included upon disclosure ;Identifying and removing vulnerabilities Many software tools exist that can aid in the discovery (and sometimes removal) of vulnerabilities in a computer system. Though these tools can provide an auditor with a good overview of possible vulnerabilities present, they can not replace human judgment. Relying solely on scanners will yield false positives and a limited-scope view of the problems present in the system. Vulnerabilities have been found in every major operating system including Windows, macOS, various forms of Unix and Linux, OpenVMS, and others. The only way to reduce the chance of a vulnerability being used against a system is through constant vigilance, including careful system maintenance (e.g. applying software patches), best practices in deployment (e.g. the use of firewalls and access controls) and auditing (both during development and throughout the deployment lifecycle). Examples of Where Vulnerabilities Manifest Vulnerabilities are related to and can manifest in: * physical environment of the system * the personnel (i.e. employees, management) * administration procedures and security policy * business operation and service delivery * hardware including peripheral devices Most laptops vulnerable to attack via peripheral devices. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190225192119.htm Source: University of Cambridge] Exploiting Network Printers. Institute for IT- Security, Ruhr University Bochum * software (i.e. on premises or in cloud) * connectivity (i.e. communication equipment and facilities) It is evident that a pure technical approach cannot always protect physical assets: one should have administrative procedure to let maintenance personnel to enter the facilities and people with adequate knowledge of the procedures, motivated to follow it with proper care. However, technical protections do not necessarily stop Social engineering (security) attacks. Examples of vulnerabilities: * an attacker finds and uses a buffer overflow weakness to install malware to then exfiltrate sensitive data; * an attacker convinces a user to open an email message with attached malware; * a flood damages one's computer systems installed at ground floor. =Software vulnerabilities= Common types of software flaws that lead to vulnerabilities include: *Memory safety violations, such as: **Buffer overflows and over-reads **Dangling pointers *Input validation errors, such as: **Code injection **Cross-site scripting in web applications **Directory traversal **E-mail injection **Format string attacks **HTTP header injection **HTTP response splitting **SQL injection *Privilege-confusion bugs, such as: **Clickjacking **Cross-site request forgery in web applications **FTP bounce attack *Privilege escalation *Race conditions, such as: **Symlink races **Time-of-check-to-time-of-use bugs *Side-channel attack **Timing attack *User interface failures, such as: **Blaming the Victim prompting a user to make a security decision without giving the user enough information to answer it **Race Conditions **Warning fatigue or user conditioning. Some set of coding guidelines have been developed and a large number of static code analysers has been used to verify that the code follows the guidelines.

Early life Dower was born in Ilkley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire in September 1900. His father was a Methodist lay preacher and was a director of a steel firm in Leeds. Dower was educated at a local school in Ilkley and he then studied for a degree in architecture at St John's College in Cambridge. The national parks In 1929, Dower married Pauline Trevelyan, whose father was Charles Trevelyan; this introduced him into a campaign to protect the wild areas of Britain. Dower prepared a report in the late 1930s, but it was put to one side when the Second World War broke out and he was called up as a Royal Engineer. During his time in the army, Dower contracted virulent tuberculosis and was invalided out of military service. Whilst convalescing at his home in Kirkby Malham, he was asked to compile a report again into the national parks. As he was too ill to drive, pauline took them around the country so he could make notes, even being detained by the Home Guard in Cornwall. Dower's report was completed in 1943, but it was not published until 1945.

Based on the Marvel Comics character Daredevil, the film stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights for justice in the courtroom and on the streets of New York as the masked vigilante Daredevil. Jennifer Garner plays his love interest Elektra Natchios; Colin Farrell plays the merciless assassin Bullseye; David Keith plays Jack \\"The Devil\\" Murdock, a washed up fighter and Matt's father; and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Wilson Fisk, also known as the crime lord Kingpin. The film began development in 1997 at 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures, before New Regency acquired the rights in 2000. Johnson shot the film primarily in Downtown Los Angeles despite the Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan setting of the film and comics. Rhythm and Hues Studios were hired to handle the film's CGI. Graeme Revell composed the Daredevil score, which was released on CD in March 2003, whereas the various artists' soundtrack album, Daredevil: The Album, was released in February. Daredevil was released on February 14, 2003. It received generally mixed reviews from critics with many praising the action sequences, acting performances, soundtrack, storyline, visual style and stunts, while others criticized Affleck's performance and its perceived lack of ambition. Nevertheless, the film became the second-biggest February release to that time and grossed over $179 million against production budget of $78 million. A spin-off film, Elektra, was released in 2005 to critical and commercial failure. In 2004, an R-rated director's cut of Daredevil was released, reincorporating approximately 30 minutes of the film, and received significantly more acclaim from critics than the theatrical version. A sequel was planned, but because of Elektras failure, it was canceled. A new TV adaptation of the same title by Netflix and Marvel Television followed, premiering in 2015. Plot Matt Murdock is a blind lawyer who lives in New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where he runs a firm with best friend Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson. Matt was blinded by a toxic waste spill as a child. The accident enhanced Matt's other senses and gave him sonar to \\"see\\" via sonic vibrations. Matt's father, boxer Jack \\"The Devil\\" Murdock, was killed after refusing to turn in a fixed fight for the mobster who had employed him earlier. After his father's death, Matt promised to stop all crime that controlled Hell's Kitchen as the vigilante crime-fighter \\"Daredevil\\". Matt meets Elektra Natchios, daughter of Nikolas Natchios, a businessman who has dealings with Wilson Fisk, a rich executive who is also the criminal leader known as the Kingpin, the same mobster who employed Matt's father. When Nikolas tries to end his relationship with Fisk, the mobster hires the Irish hitman Bullseye, who has preternatural aim, to kill him. Daredevil tries to stop Bullseye, but Bullseye ultimately succeeds in killing Nikolas and framing Matt's alter-ego in the process. Elektra vows to exact revenge, while reporter Ben Urich discovers his secret identity. Believing Matt to have done good things for Hell's Kitchen, Urich tells Matt that Bullseye is going after Elektra next. Daredevil tracks Bullseye, but is attacked by Elektra, who plans to use her own training in martial arts to avenge her father's death. She defeats and injures Daredevil; when she manages to remove his mask, she discovers Matt's secret identity and innocence. Forced to fight Bullseye alone, Elektra is overpowered and killed by the hitman. A wounded Daredevil makes his way to a church, where he is looked after by his confidant, Father Everett, who knows his secret identity. After recovering slightly, Daredevil fights Bullseye, who had followed him to the church. Bullseye discovers that loud noise is Daredevil's weakness and prepares to kill him with a spiked piece of wood after incapacitating him. Matt blocks the attack and hears an FBI sniper stationed on the neighboring building preparing to fire. As the bullet is fired, Daredevil moves out of the bullet's path and pulls Bullseye's hands into it. When Bullseye pleads for mercy, Matt throws him from the church's steeple. Bullseye lands on the hood of Urich's car, severely injured but alive. Upon discovering that Fisk is the Kingpin and Bullseye's employer, Daredevil makes his way to Fisk's office. There, Daredevil and Fisk begin a fierce fight; Fisk proves to be a surprisingly powerful combatant due to his size and brute strength, and he dominates Daredevil for most of the fight. Lying on the floor, Matt questions Fisk as to why he killed the people Murdock loved, including Jack Murdock years before: Fisk replies it was just business, for he had worked under Fallon at the time he killed Jack, and Elektra was \\"in the wrong family at the wrong time\\". Angered, Daredevil regains his strength and breaks Fisk's legs, but refrains from killing him, instead allowing him to be arrested by the police, who have discovered his criminal connections. Before being taken away, Fisk‚Äîwho had also discovered Matt's secret identity after overpowering him‚Äîswears revenge on Daredevil, who points out that Fisk cannot reveal Matt's secret identity because the humiliation of having been beaten by a blind man will cause him to be perceived as weak by other prison inmates. Having gained closure over his father's murder, Matt returns to his day-to-day routine as Daredevil, and meets Urich one last time, in which Urich assures him he will not publish his article expos√© of Matt's true identity. In a mid-credits scene, Bullseye, having been moved to a prison hospital and severely bandaged after his confrontation with Matt, is shown to still have his perfect aim after he impales a fly with a syringe needle and says \\"Bullseye.\\" Cast * Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock / Daredevil: An attorney-at-law who was blinded as a youth in an accident with bio-waste that drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a \\"sonar-sense\\", which allowed him to perceive his surroundings, and makes a silent promise with his father to \\"stick up for the long shots\\". His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that \\"comic-strip stuff isn't really my cup of tea, really.\\" Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. He claimed that he and Ben \\"loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time.\\" Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it \\"serendipity in action\\" that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the Guardian Devil series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a child, and explained why he took the role by saying \\"Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me.\\" Additionally, he said, \\"I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up.\\" ** Scott Terra as Young Matt Murdock: As a youth, he has trouble with local bullies and a close bond with his father. This changes in different ways after the accident. Terra was officially announced as a part of the cast in March 2002. * Jennifer Garner as Elektra Natchios: The daughter of billionaire Nikolas Natchios and the love interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed the murder of her mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Pen√©lope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, M√≠a Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, \\"I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model.\\" Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, \\"[T]he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [that] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything.\\" * Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk / Kingpin: By appearance, he is an overweight corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk, but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime, under the moniker of Kingpin. Kingpin is the murderer of Matt's father, and the man responsible for the hiring of Bullseye, with intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series. He spoke on the fan's loyalty to the source material by saying \\"they watch movies to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.' But I want them to get past that and just see the movie for what it is and see me for what I am‚Äîan actor.\\" * Colin Farrell as Bullseye: An assassin with perfect accuracy and deep-rooted pride of it who is hired by Kingpin to kill Nikolas and Elektra Natchios, but when Daredevil gets involved and causes him to miss his target, he makes it his own personal vendetta to take Daredevil down. Farrell was attached to the role in December 2001. Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film, and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. Farrell had to read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye \\"because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing [...] he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it's not exactly a character you can do method acting for ... you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips.\\" * Jon Favreau as Franklin \\"Foggy\\" Nelson: Matt Murdock's legal partner and best friend, he is also used as a form of comic relief. Favreau joined the cast in February 2002. Favreau would later go on to direct the Marvel-produced Iron Man and its sequel, Iron Man 2 while also appearing as Happy Hogan. * Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich: An investigative journalist whose articles notably relate to Daredevil, and the Kingpin. During the film, he goes on to uncover a lot of information about the two. Pantoliano was cast in March 2002. Urich works for the New York Post, rather than the Daily Bugle as in the comics, because the film rights to the Bugle were held by Sony Pictures at that time. * David Keith as Jack Murdock: Father of Matt Murdock and a boxer, he is murdered by the Kingpin when he does not take a fall for a fight. Keith was officially announced as a part of the cast in March 2002. * Leland Orser as Wesley Owen Welch: The number two of Wilson Fisk, but he does not like to be involved in the activities of the Kingpin. Orser previously co-starred with Jon Favreau in 1998 in Very Bad Things. * Lennie Loftin as Detective Nick Manolis: A NYPD cop who considers Daredevil an urban legend. Loftin would later appear as a minor villain in Logan. * Erick Avari as Nikolas Natchios: The father of Elektra, who is murdered by Bullseye on behalf of the Kingpin. * Ellen Pompeo as Karen Page: The secretary at Matt Murdock and Franklin Nelson's law firm. * Derrick O'Connor as Father Everett: A priest of Matt Murdock's local church, where he sometimes goes to find solace. Stan Lee, Frank Miller, and Kevin Smith, each notable for their work on the Daredevil comics, also have cameo roles throughout the film with the latter playing a forensics assistant named \\"Jack Kirby\\". Paul Ben-Victor portrays Jose Quesada, a criminal Daredevil hunts who is named after Joe Quesada. Mark Margolis has an uncredited role as Fallon, a mobster who once employed Fisk as a hitman. Claudine Farrell, Colin Farrell's sister and personal assistant on the film, has an uncredited vocal cameo as Heather Glenn on Matt Murdock's answering machine and cameos in the pub scene. Josie DiVincenzo portrays Josie, a character from the comics who is the owner of Josie's Bar, a regular hangout in Hell's Kitchen. The director's cut version also features Coolio as Dante Jackson and features Jude Ciccolella in a sub- plot removed from the theatrical version. Tanoai Reed appears uncredited as a thug in Josie's Bar. Production =Development= In 1997, 20th Century Fox optioned the rights from Marvel Enterprises, and Chris Columbus was chosen to direct the film. In 1998, Marvel was facing bankruptcy. During this time 20th Century Fox allowed the option to expire, so Disney, who later went to purchase Marvel's rights to all of its property in 2012, began negotiations in order to acquire the rights. In 1999, the negotiations failed to work out so Marvel set the project up with Columbia Pictures. During this time, Chris Columbus and Carlo Carlei co-wrote a script together, before Mark Steven Johnson got signed to write the screenplay. By 2000, Sony decided to cancel the project, as the two companies reportedly could not come to an agreement over Internet rights. New Regency entered negotiations with a more satisfying offer, attaining the character rights from Marvel in 2000 to produce the film, with 20th Century Fox handling the distribution. Mark Steven Johnson was rehired and his script was turned in during 2001, which was praised by Ain't It Cool News' Harry Knowles. Prior to shooting, producer Gary Foster said that in comparison to other comic book-based films before it, this film would be \\"more character-driven ... darker ... edgier,\\" while Marvel Studios executive Kevin Feige felt the script was one of the strongest comic scripts Marvel had received. =Filming= Fox wanted to start filming in Canada in order to save money. This plan was contended by Johnson, and the film's cinematographer, Ericson Core, after they found a preferred area for shooting around downtown Los Angeles' Arcade Building. Core noted that the appeal came from the \\"beautiful, old brick buildings and great rooftops,\\" which they felt was perfect for a depiction of Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, in comparison to the studio's choice where the filming would be done in Montreal or Vancouver. Due to their insistence, coupled with Ben Affleck's disinterest in filming in Canada (after having filmed there for his previous film, The Sum of All Fears) they were able to change the studio's mind. Guardian Devil graphic novel, and the film. Several scenes were taken shot-for-shot of comic books. When the look of the film was being decided, Mark Steven Johnson opted to use direct scenes from the Daredevil comics. Joe Quesada's artistic take in Guardian Devil (Daredevil vol. 2, #1‚Äì#8) was an influence on the film, with Johnson noting that they would \\"literally take out a scene from the comic book that Joe did [...] Here's Daredevil on the cross, you know, it's that scene from 'Guardian Devil'. You just shoot that.\\" Throughout the film, Ben Affleck had to wear \\"cataract milky-blue\\" contacts, which would effectively make him blind. This was considered great by Johnson, as it would aid his performance. The sound plays an integral part in the film, as the superhero relies on it in order to form his 'sonar sense'. Post-production sound was done by supervising sound editor John Larsen and sound designer Steve Boeddeker and is heard taking place immediately after Matt's optic nerve is seen mutating. The mutating of the nerve was done by Rhythm and Hues Studios, who also worked on the sonar-sense which became referred to as the \\"shadow world\\". Shadow world was made using just CGI except in a scene where Elektra and Matt Murdock are in the rain, which was done using CGI over film. =Music= The score to Daredevil was written by Graeme Revell, and released on March 4, 2003. He was attracted to the focus of \\"human-ness\\" on Daredevil, torn emotionally and physically by his superhero status. Avi Arad asked Revell to concentrate more on the emotions of Daredevil and Elektra, while Mark Steven Johnson wanted to stay clear from any gothic and action movie clich√©s. Revell tried to avoid too much individual motifs but some characters would have an identifiable sound, like Bullseye would have guitar undertones, while Kingpin would have bass beats. Guitarist Mike Einziger of Incubus collaborated with Revell for any additional rock elements. Revell thoroughly enjoyed working with Johnson, describing the director as \\"positive\\" and \\"responsive\\" when it came to experimenting (as opposed to feeling \\"locked in a box of preconceptions\\") which he felt lead to \\"cool stuff\\". Var√®se Sarabande put together the score record. \\"Bring Me to Life\\" by Evanescence featuring Paul McCoy, won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards. The song was nominated in the category for Best Rock Song at the same event but lost to \\"Seven Nation Army\\" by The White Stripes. \\"Bring Me to Life\\" won an award for Choice Music Rock Track at the Teen Choice Awards in 2004. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards the band was nominated in the category for Best New Artist for \\"Bring Me to Life\\". The song was nominated at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Song. At the 14th annual Billboard Music Awards, it won the award for Soundtrack Single of the Year. The song ranked number 69 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. Release =Marketing= Aside from expected TV commercials during such TV hits as Friends and Law & Order, as well as one in the second quarter of Super Bowl XXXVII, there was also a tie- in with Kraft, an in-store promotion at Wal-Mart, a marketing campaign with Hamilton Watch Company, who designed the watch Matt wears in the film, and a weeklong Daredevil segment on Entertainment Tonight. As part of an online form of marketing, a viral e-mail drive was started, where participants would be entered in a contest where they could win prizes such as Daredevil T-shirts, Game Boy Advance games, and cufflinks. To enter the drawing, the user had to book tickets for the film online, then pass an e-mail on to someone else. The idea was to encourage online ticket booking, which at the time was seen as a growing trend. The Game Boy Advance Daredevil game was released on February 14, 2003, and was created by Encore, a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation. The soundtrack to the film, Daredevil: The Album, was released in February 2003. =Censorship= Due to the film's violent scenes, the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia banned Daredevil in that country. 20th Century Fox unsuccessfully appealed to Malaysia's censorship board to change its decision, hoping to release the film in Malaysia on February 27, 2003. The deputy prime minister told the press films were banned if containing what the board felt was \\"excessive violence and sexual material or elements which can create chaos in the community\\". =Box office= The film opened theatrically on February 14, 2003, on 3,471 screens in North America and took first place in its opening weekend, grossing $45,033,454. At the time, it became the second-biggest February release, behind Hannibal. By the second weekend the film saw a 55.1% decline in takings but managed to maintain the number one spot, beating new release Old School by $639,093. By the third weekend, Daredevil saw a further 38.5% drop in sales, and so fell to third place at the box office. The film grossed over $102 million in North America, and over $76 million in the rest of the world, totalling the film's worldwide takings at just over $179 million, grossing over double its budget of $78 million. Avi Arad addressed the top spot success by saying \\"we are five for five with record-breaking box office successes [with Blade, X-Men, Blade II then Spider-Man] and have two more Marvel releases slated for this summer [which are X2: X-Men United and Hulk]. It's a testament to the broad appeal of these characters before mainstream audiences outside of the core comic fans. These super heroes have been successful within the Marvel pantheon for decades; it only makes sense that their translations to the big screen are just as fruitful.\\" Reception The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 44% of critics gave the film positive feedback, based on 229 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"While Ben Affleck fits the role and the story is sporadically interesting, Daredevil is ultimately a dull, brooding origin story that fails to bring anything new to the genre.\\" On the website Metacritic the film has an average score of 42 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars and called the film good, despite noting the almost-typical superhero background. Of the actors, he stated that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner were suitable for their roles, while Michael Clarke Duncan's presence alone was menacing. He said, \\"I am getting a little worn out describing the origin stories and powers of superheroes [...] Some of their movies, like this one, are better than others.\\" The Houston Chronicles Bruce Westbrook considered it \\"the best Marvel movie to date, it's as well-written and character-driven as some of today's Oscar contenders, and its story doesn't stall with hollow flamboyance.\\" The Austin Chronicles Kimberly Jones praised the film, the actors, and felt that though an unproven director, \\"Johnson has just signed his meal ticket with this marriage of big brains, big brawn, and‚Äìmost happily‚Äìbig heart.\\" Empire's Kim Newman gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and felt people \\"will like the characters more than the film,\\" before adding that there are enough strong moments to guarantee a good viewing. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw stated that the film had \\"unconvincing touches\\" but was more enjoyable than Spider-Man and as dark as Tim Burton's Batman. BBC film critic Nev Pierce believed the film had spectacular set-pieces, but felt there was no strong narrative arc to keep the viewer interested. The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern considered the film to be neither original nor great but felt it maintained \\"many grace notes and interesting oddities.\\" The Globe and Mails Rick Groen said the film was \\"not woeful, not wonderful, merely watchable.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea thought the film brought a variance of humor and violence, but felt it didn't work as well as it could have. James Berardinelli felt it was merely a satisfactory superhero film. TV Guides Frank Lovece said Daredevil \\"makes clear that superhero films are the next evolutionary generation of action movies: Now that Schwarzenegger-styled heroes have upped the action ante as far as the human body can go and remain even marginally believable, it's up to superheroes ... to take it further.\\" He also felt it was \\"a movie for grown- ups, not kids.\\" Negative reviews included that of The New York Times Elvis Mitchell, who said the film was \\"second-rate and ordinary,\\" while Variety's Todd McCarthy considered it \\"a pretender in the realm of bona-fide superheroes.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \\"C-\\", criticizing the story as \\"sloppy\\" and \\"slipshod\\", saying, \\"Daredevil is the sort of half-assed, visually-lackadaisical potboiler that makes you rue the day that comic-book franchises ever took over Hollywood.\\" Time Outs Trevor Johnston praised Ben Affleck, feeling he \\"persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing,\\" but also felt writer/director Johnson's construction fails all involved in the film. Slates David Edelstein wrote that the film was derivative of Batman, but concluded by saying \\"that's not so bad: The movie looks best when it looks like other, better movies.\\" The Chicago Tribunes Michael Wilmington thought the film grabs the attention, but felt it does not reward it. The New York Posts Lou Lumenick panned the film, describing it as a \\"mind-numbing, would-be comic-book franchise, which often seems as blind as its hero‚Äînot to mention deaf and dumb.\\" Character co-creator Stan Lee himself said, \\"[T]hey just wrote the whole thing wrong. They made him too tragic.\\" Ben Affleck won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his work in the movie, his third after Gigli and Paycheck. Affleck himself disliked the film, and said that it inspired him to take on the role of Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. \\"That's the movie I want to do. I want to be a part of that [Batman v Superman]. Part of it was I wanted for once to get one of these movies and do it right‚Äîto do a good version. I hate Daredevil so much.\\" =Director's cut= A director's cut of the film was announced for a spring 2004 DVD release. This version contained new additions like previously unseen footage and a removed subplot, and was to be a bit darker with an R rating. The film, released in 2.35:1 widescreen format, was released with DTS and Dolby Digital sound. The new version of the film has newly recorded commentary to accompany it, featuring Mark Steven Johnson and Avi Arad. A \\"Making of Director's Cut\\" featurette also accompanied the film. The release date of the DVD was later pushed back to November 30, 2004. On September 30, 2008, the director's cut was released on Blu-ray. The DVD release of the director's cut removed the bonus material included on the theatrical cut's DVD release, but that content was restored for the Blu-ray release (although the Blu-ray release only contains the director's cut). One of the biggest changes to the film was the addition of a subplot involving a drug addict played by Coolio. While this subplot was missing from the theatrical version of the film, it is present in the novelization by Greg Cox, published in 2003. Producer Kevin Feige commented on this version of the film, believing \\"the people who had other opinions [of Daredevil] will be won over by this new version.\\" Reviewers like Empire's Danny Graydon seemed to reaffirm this opinion by considering this version a \\"considerable improvement on the original version,\\" notably preferring the more violent undertones, a lesser focus on the romance, and the equal focus of Daredevil and his lawyer alias Matt Murdock and the subplot involving Coolio. Some critics continued to feel Affleck was unsuitable as Daredevil and that Duncan portrayed the Kingpin in an over-the-top manner. IGN's Jeff Otto and Andy Patrizio also deemed this version an improvement over the original. They felt this version was more loyal to the Frank Miller feel of the Daredevil world, with more focus on themes such as Murdock's struggle with his Catholic upbringing. On the whole they felt the film would be far more pleasing to fans, and overall better than the theatrical release. Future =Cancelled sequel= During 2004, Ben Affleck shot a cameo role for the spin-off film, Elektra, at the request of Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner. In October 2004, Affleck stated he would only return in the lead role if Fox would renegotiate to tell the darker stories of Daredevil, and showed interest in a Kevin Smith graphic novel which included Mysterio, as well as the Born Again storyline. In November 2006, Affleck stated that he would never reprise the role, having felt \\"by playing a superhero in Daredevil, I have inoculated myself from ever playing another superhero ... Wearing a costume was a source of humiliation for me and something I wouldn't want to do again soon.\\" Despite this, Affleck would later sign on to portray the DC superhero, Batman, in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In July 2006, Michael Clarke Duncan showed interest in returning for the role of the Kingpin, but stated that he would not be willing to gain weight as he felt \\"comfortable\\" being down to 270 pounds. He jokingly showed willingness to change his mind if he was offered $20 million. Duncan suggested that the character is portrayed to have been training a lot in jail in order to become faster in combat against Daredevil, also working as a way to fit his weight loss into the story. Duncan would later go on to reprise his role as the Kingpin in an episode of the animated series: Spider-Man: The New Animated Series. Duncan died on September 3, 2012. =Marvel Cinematic Universe= Feige had stated on potential future Daredevil films, \\"there are many more stories to be told with old Hornhead and we'd love to tell them someday.\\" Avi Arad has also said that a sequel will begin development once the rights go from 20th Century Fox to Marvel Studios. Director Mark Steven Johnson showed interest in returning to direct with the Born Again storyline, as well as suggesting Mr. Fear as a possible villain. In July 2008, Jason Statham expressed interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future. Statham requested \\"just give me the chance, I would love to be Daredevil.\\" Frank Miller commented in agreement, \\"I think he should be Daredevil too.\\" In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said \\"a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about.\\" Rothman added that \\"what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision.\\" By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. Later, it was announced that in the event that a sequel or reboot didn‚Äôt start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, but Carnahan said that his pitch, Daredevil as a hard-boiled '70s-style thriller, had gone up in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.

Sheikh Khalifa succeeded his father, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, as Emir of Abu Dhabi on 2 November 2004 and became the President of the UAE the next day. As Crown Prince, he had already de facto carried out some aspects of the presidency since the late 1990s while his father was facing health problems. In January 2014, Khalifa suffered a stroke but was in a stable condition. He has since assumed a lower profile in state affairs, but retained presidential powers. His half brother Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan now carries out public affairs of the state and day-to-day decision-making of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.  Biography  = Early life = Khalifa was born on 7 September 1948 at Qasr Al-Muwaiji, Al Ain, in Abu Dhabi (then part of the Trucial States), the eldest son of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Emir of Abu Dhabi, and Hassa bint Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. He is a graduate of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. = 1966‚Äì1971 = When his father, Zayed, became Emir of Abu Dhabi in 1966, Khalifa was appointed the Ruler's Representative (the mayor) in the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi and Head of the Courts Department in Al Ain. Zayed was the Ruler's Representative in the Eastern Region before he became the Emir of Abu Dhabi. A few months later the position was handed to Tahnoun bin Mohammed Al Nahyan. On 1 February 1969, Khalifa was nominated the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and on the next day he was appointed Head of the Abu Dhabi Department of Defense. In that post, he oversaw the build up of the Abu Dhabi Defense Force, which after 1971 became the core of the UAE Armed Forces. = Independence in 1971 = Following the establishment of the UAE in 1971, Khalifa assumed several positions in Abu Dhabi: Prime Minister, head of the Abu Dhabi Cabinet (under his father), Minister of Defense, and Minister of Finance. After the reconstruction of the Cabinet of the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi Cabinet was replaced by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, and Khalifa became the 2nd Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates (23 December 1973) and the Chairman of the Executive Council of Abu Dhabi (20 January 1974), under his father. In May 1976, he became deputy commander of the UAE Armed Forces, under the President. He also became the head of the Supreme Petroleum Council in the late 1980s, and continues in this position today, which grants him wide powers in energy matters. He was also the chairman of the Environmental Research and Wildlife Development Agency.  Presidency (2004‚Äìpresent)  Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan with President of Russia Vladimir Putin on 10 September 2007. He succeeded to the posts of Emir of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 3 November 2004, replacing his father Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who had died the day before. He had been acting president since his father became ill prior to his passing. On 1 December 2005, the President announced that half of the members of the Federal National Council (FNC), an assembly that advises the president, would be indirectly elected. However, half of the council's members would still need to be appointed by the leaders of the emirates. The elections were set to take place in December 2006. Khalifa and U.S. President George W. Bush at Abu Dhabi International Airport, 13 January 2008 In 2010, Khalifa was described in a WikiLeaks cable signed by then U.S. ambassador Richard G. Olson as a \\"distant and uncharismatic personage.\\" On 4 January 2010, the world's tallest man-made structure, originally known as Burj Dubai, was renamed the Burj Khalifa in his honor. In March 2011, Khalifa sent the United Arab Emirates Air Force to support the military intervention in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi, alongside forces from NATO, Qatar, Sweden and Jordan. Khalifa pledged the full support of the UAE to the Bahraini regime in the face of pro-democracy uprising in 2011. Later that year Khalifa was ranked as the world's fourth-wealthiest monarch, with a fortune estimated to be worth $15 billion. In 2013, he commissioned Azzam, the longest motor yacht ever built at 590 ft (180 m) long, with costs between $400‚Äì600 million. In Fall 2011, the Emirates initiated a program to promote \\"allegiance\\" to Khalifa and other Emirati leaders. The program continues, and encourages not only Emirati nationals, but residents from any nationality to register their \\"appreciation, recognition, and loyalty\\" to the Emirs. In January 2014, Khalifa suffered a stroke and was reported to have been in a stable condition after undergoing an operation.  Investments and foreign aid  Seychellois government records show that since 1995 Khalifa has spent $2 million buying up more than 66 acres of land on the Seychelles' main island of Mah√©, where his palace is being built. The Seychelles' government has received large aid packages from the UAE, most notably a $130 million injection that was used in social service and military aid, which funded patrol boats for the Seychelles' antipiracy efforts. In 2008, the UAE came to the indebted Seychelles government's aid, with a $30 million injection. Khalifa paid $500,000 for the 29.8-acre site of his palace in 2005, according to the sales document. A Seychelles planning authority initially rejected the palace's building plans, a decision overturned by President James Michel's cabinet. A month after the start of construction of the palace, the national utility company warned that the site's plans posed threats to the water supply. Joel Morgan, the Seychelles' minister of the environment, said the government did not tender the land because it wanted it to go to Khalifa. Morgan said \\"the letter of the law\\" might not have been followed in the land sale. In February 2010, the sewage system set up by Ascon, the company building the palace, for the site's construction workers overflowed, sending rivers of waste through the region, which are home to more than 8000 residents. Local government agencies and officials from Khalifa's office responded quickly to the problem, sending in technical experts and engineers. Government officials concluded that Ascon ignored health and building codes for their workers, and fined the company $81,000. Ascon blamed the incident on \\"unpredicted weather conditions\\". Khalifa's presidential office offered to pay $15 million to replace the water-piping system for the mountainside., and Seychelles' government representatives and residents say Ascon has offered to pay roughly $8,000 to each of the 360 households that were affected by the pollution. In April 2016, Khalifa was named in the Panama Papers by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists; he reportedly owns luxury properties in London worth more than $1.7 billion via shell companies that Mossack Fonseca set up and administers for him in the British Virgin Islands.

According to her 11th-century biography (Vita Gudilae), written by a monk of the abbey of Hautmont between 1048 and 1051, she was the daughter of a duke of Lotharingia called Witger and Amalberga of Maubeuge. She died between 680 and 714. Her name is connected to several places: *Moorsel (where she lived) *Brussels (where a chapter in her honour was founded in 1047) *Eibingen (where the relic of her skull is conserved). In Brabant she is usually called Goedele or Goule; (, later ', , ).  Life  The mother of Gudula, Saint Amalberga, embraced the religious life in the abbey of Maubeuge. She received the veil from the hands of St. Aubert, Bishop of Cambrai (d. about 668). Gudula had two sisters, St. Pharaildis and St. Reineldis, and one brother, Saint Emebertus.Van der Essen, L√©on. \\"St. Gudula.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 May 2018 Gudula was educated in the abbey of Nivelles by her godmother, Gertrude of Nivelles. When Gertrude died, she moved back to her home at Moorsel, spending her time in good works and religious devotion. She frequently visited the church of Moorsel, situated about two miles from her parents' house. Gudula died and was buried at Hamme (Flemish Brabant). Later her relics were removed to the church of St. Salvator in Moorsel, where the body was interred behind the altar. During the reign of Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine (977‚Äì992), the body of the saint was transferred to the chapel of Saint Gaugericus at Brussels. Lambert II, Count of Leuven, (d. 1054) founded a chapter in 1047 in honour of Saint Gudula. Bishop Gerardus I of Cambrai (d. 1051) led the translation of her relics to the church of Saint Michael in Brussels. The church later became the famous St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral. On 6 June 1579 the collegiate church was pillaged and wrecked by the Protestant Geuzen (Beggars), and the relics of the saint disinterred and scattered.  Veneration  Statue of Saint Gudula at St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral * Along with St. Michael, Gudula is a patron saint of Brussels.Cathedrale St. Michel *The feast of Saint Gudula is generally celebrated on 8 January (the day she died according her hagiography). However, in the diocese of Ghent (where Moorsel is situated) her feast is held on 19 January. *Charlemagne made donations to the convent of Moorsel in her honour. *The flower called tremella deliquescens, which bears fruit in the beginning of January, is known as Sinte Goedele's lampken (St. Gudula's lantern). *The woodcarvers who produced statues of the saints born in the Holy Roman Empire, often depicted St. Gudula with a taper in her hand, but this originates probably out of confusion with the Paris Saint Geneveva tradition. *The skull of St. Gudula is conserved in the Catholic Church of St. Hildegard in Eibingen, Germany. =Iconography= *Gudula is often pictured holding a lantern. She is depicted on a seal of the Church of St. Gudula of 1446 holding in her right hand a candle, and in her left a lamp, which a demon tries to extinguish. This refers to the legend that the saint went to church before cock-crow. The demon, wishing to stray her off the right way, extinguished the candle, but the saint obtained from God that her lantern should be rekindled.Fernando Lanzi, Fernando and Gioia, \\"Gudula of Brussels, Virgin\\", Saints and Their Symbols, Liturgical Press, 2004, p. 127 See also * Saint Gudula, patron saint archive References Sources * = Primary sources = * Vita prima sanctae Gudilae auctore anonymo on the Latin Wikisource * Vita ampliata sanctae Gudilae auctore Huberto on the Latin Wikisource * Bollandus J., Henschenius G., De S.

Biography Little is known about Aliquippa's early life. Her date of birth has been estimated anywhere from the early 1670s to the early 18th century. By the 1740s, she was the leader of a band of Mingo Seneca living along the three rivers (the Ohio River, the Allegheny River, and the Monongahela River) near what is now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By 1753, she and her band were living at the junction of the Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers near the present day of McKeesport, Pennsylvania. George Washington wrote of his visit to Aliquippa in December 1753 stating: > As we intended to take horse here [at Frazer's Cabin on the mouth of Turtle > Creek], and it required some time to find them, I went up about three miles > to the mouth of the Youghiogheny to visit Queen Aliquippa, who had expressed > great concern that we passed her in going to [ Fort Le Boeuf ]. I made her a > present of a match-coat and a bottle of rum, which latter was thought much > the better present of the two. Queen Aliquippa was a key ally of the British leading up to the French and Indian War. Aliquippa, her son Kanuksusy, and warriors from her band of Mingo Seneca traveled to Fort Necessity to assist George Washington, but did not take an active part in the Battle of the Great Meadows on July 3‚Äì4, 1754. After the British defeat at the Battle of the Great Meadows and the evacuation of Fort Necessity, Aliquippa moved her band to the Aughwick Valley of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania for safety. She died there on December 23, 1754. Legacy The city of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania was named in her honor by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. However, she herself had no connection to the land upon which the city was built. She is mentioned by Tom Hanks's character in one of the last scenes of Charlie Wilson's War, when discussing matters with Gust Avrakotos in a reference to his hometown of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. Chronological notes An engraving depicting the evening council of George Washington at Fort Necessity. In 1752, Conrad Weiser reported visiting Queen Aliquippa, at \\"Aliquippa's Town\\" located on the Ohio at the mouth of Chartiers Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River near McKees Rocks and Pittsburgh. In January, 1754, George Washington, was sent by Virginia's Lt. Governor Dinwiddie to ask the French to leave the Ohio region, and he met with Iroquois leaders at Logstown, whilst there Washington failed to pay his respects to Queen Aliquippa. Washington arrived at the Great Meadows (Fort Necessity) 24 May 1754 A Virginia regiment arrived at the Great Meadows with the Half King on 9 June 1754. Battle of Fort Necessity occurred 3 July 1754. On the 4th of July, Washington surrendered to the French and accepted defeat. The British troops left Fort Necessity for Wills Creek on the morning of July 4, from there they marched back to Virginia. To understand the events of the day, a hearing conducted by Virginia's Lt. Governor Dinwiddie was held. On August 27, 1754, a deposition was filed by a Captain John B. W. Shaw that stated the Native Americans, including Queen Aliquippa, loyal to the British were going to \\"Jemmy Arther\\" for protection. \\"Jemmy Arther\\" was Aughwick or George Croghan's settlement, just north of the modern-day Shirleysburg. In a letter dated 16 August 1754, Croghan wrote to the governor of the province of Pennsylvania that the Half King and his fellow Mingo Seneca people had been staying with him at Aughwick since Washington's defeat (Hazard 1897, 140-141). Conrad Weiser visited Croghan's homestead at Aughwick on September 3, 1754 to investigate the situation and reported to Governor Hamilton. In Wiser's report to the Governor he reported to the Governor that; \\" ... he had encountered about twenty cabins about Croghan's house, and in them at least 200 Indians, men, women and children ...\\" (Hazard 1878, 149). On December 23, 1754, Queen Aliquippa died at Aughwick (Fort Shirley). Croghan's blunt journal entry records her death, \\"Alequeapy, ye old quine is dead.\\". Alliquippa, a Delaware village, was on the farm of William Hartley, Esq., on the east bank of the Raystown branch, near Mt. Dallas and the historic village of Bloody Run (Everett, Pennsylvania). Tradition says the village, a gap and a hill were all named after Queen Alliquippa, who lived there in her youth, and these names are so given on a map of the Province of 1770. A letter written from Alliquippa village on June 17, 1775, at the time some of the Provincial troops were there says:\\"The Queen Alliquippa, upon the surrender of the unfinished fort at the Forks of the Ohio by Ensign Ward had returned to this place.\\" From the expression 'had returned' it is fair to infer that she formerly lived there and was subsequently buried there.

This syndrome can be classed as one of various hereditary intestinal polyposis syndromes and one of various hamartomatous polyposis syndromes. It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births. Signs and symptoms The risks associated with this syndrome include a strong tendency of developing cancer in a number of parts of the body. While the hamartomatous polyps themselves only have a small malignant potential (< 3% per OHCM), patients with the syndrome have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the liver, lungs, breast, ovaries, uterus, testes and other organs. Specifically, it is associated with an increased risk of sex-cord stromal tumor with annular tubules in the ovaries. The average age of first diagnosis is 23, but the lesions can be identified at birth by an astute pediatrician or family physician. Prior to puberty, the mucocutaneous lesions can be found on the palms and soles. Often the first presentation is a bowel obstruction from an intussusception which is a common cause of mortality; an intussusception is a telescoping of one loop of bowel into another segment. Pathophysiology =Genetics= In 1998, a gene was found to be associated with the mutation. On chromosome 19, the gene known as STK11 (LKB1) is a possible tumor suppressor gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that anyone who has PJS has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their offspring. Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome is rare and studies typically include only a small number of patients. Even in those few studies that do contain a large number of patients, the quality of the evidence is limited due to pooling patients from many centers, selection bias (only patients with health problems coming from treatment are included), and historical bias (the patients reported are from a time before advances in the diagnosis of treatment of Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome were made). Probably due to this limited evidence base, cancer risk estimates for Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome vary from study to study. There is an estimated 18‚Äì21% risk of ovarian cancer, 9% risk of endometrial cancer, and 10% risk of cervical cancer, specifically adenoma malignum. Diagnosis The main criteria for clinical diagnosis are: * Family history * Mucocutaneous lesions causing patches of hyperpigmentation in the mouth and on the hands and feet. The oral pigmentations are the first on the body to appear, and thus play an important part in early diagnosis. Intraorally, they are most frequently seen on the gingiva, hard palate and inside of the cheek. The mucosa of the lower lip is almost invariably involved as well. * Hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. These are benign polyps with an extraordinarily low potential for malignancy. Having 2 of the 3 listed clinical criteria indicates a positive diagnosis. The oral findings are consistent with other conditions, such as Addison's disease and McCune‚ÄìAlbright syndrome, and these should be included in the differential diagnosis. 90‚Äì100% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of PJS have a mutation in the STK11/LKB1 gene. Molecular genetic testing for this mutation is available clinically. Management Resection of the polyps is required only if serious bleeding or intussusception occurs. Enterotomy is performed for removing large, single nodules. Short lengths of heavily involved intestinal segments can be resected. Colonoscopy can be used to snare the polyps if they are within reach. Prognosis Most people with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome will have developed some form of neoplastic disease by age 60 Most patients will develop flat, brownish spots (melanotic macules) on the skin, especially on the lips and oral mucosa, during the first year of life, and a patient's first bowel obstruction due to intussusception usually occurs between the ages of six and 18 years. The cumulative lifetime cancer risk begins to rise in middle age. Cumulative risks by age 70 for all cancers, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and pancreatic cancer are 85%, 57%, and 11%, respectively.Riegert-Johnson D, Gleeson FC, Westra W, et al. Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome. 2008 Jul 18 [Updated 2008 Aug 9]. In: Riegert-Johnson DL, Boardman LA, Hefferon T, et al., editors. Cancer Syndromes [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National Center for Biotechnology Information (US); 2009‚Äì. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1826/ A 2011 Dutch study followed 133 patients for 14 years. The cumulative risk for cancer was 40% and 76% at ages 40 and 70, respectively. 42 (32%) of the patients died during the study, of which 28 (67%) were cancer related. They died at a median age of 45. Mortality was increased compared with the general population. A family with sinonasal polyposis were followed up for 28 years. Two cases of sinonasal type adenocarcinoma developed. This is a rare cancer. This report suggested that follow up of sinus polyps in this syndrome may be indicated.Chiang JM, Chen TC (2017) A Peutz-Jeghers syndrome family associated with sinonasal adenocarcinoma: 28 years follow up report. Fam Cancer doi: 10.1007/s10689-017-9983-z. =Monitoring= Barium enema radiograph showing multiple polyps (mostly pedunculated) and at least one large mass at the hepatic flexure coated with contrast in a patient with Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome. Some suggestions for surveillance for cancer include the following: * Small intestine with small bowel radiography every 2 years, * Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy every 2 years, * CT scan or MRI of the pancreas yearly, * Ultrasound of the pelvis and testes yearly * Mammography from age 25 annually * Papanicolaou smear (Pap smear) annually beginning at age 18-20 Follow-up care should be supervised by a physician familiar with Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome. Genetic consultation and counseling as well as urological and gynecological consultations are often needed.

The original series aired from October 6, 2004 until October 26, 2016 on Syfy. The original program spanned eleven seasons with 230 episodes, not including 10 specials. The series was revived in early 2019 and aired its twelfth season of 11 episodes, not including two specials, from August 21, 2019 to October 30, 2019 on A&E.; A thirteenth season premiered on April 8, 2020. The program featured Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, who founded The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS) team of paranormal investigators to investigate places that are reported to be haunted. The two worked as plumbers for Roto-Rooter while moonlighting as paranormal investigators at night. As of the twelfth season, the revived show features Wilson and a new investigatory team that has no discernible connection to TAPS, although the series still maintains the same format and producers and frequently references past episodes. The series, initially produced for 10 episodes as a docu-soap, had later episodes shift to a more documentary focus. Ghost Hunters episodes feature the team going to reportedly haunted locations across the United States, with some investigations in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Canada in earlier seasons. The latter concept led to the show's first spin-off, Ghost Hunters International, in 2008, which often featured Ghost Hunters investigators in lead and guest roles, including Hawes and Wilson. A second spin-off, Ghost Hunters Academy (2009‚Äì10), had TAPS members Dave Tango and Steve Gonsalves training prospective investigators in a competitive format. Additionally, annual Halloween specials were broadcast live from 2005 to 2011 and featured celebrity guests and interactivity. The series popularized paranormal reality television and ghost hunting, and some members of the show have moved on to feature in their own television programs.  Premise  Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, along with other team members who belong to the group they founded, The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS), investigate locations of interest by using various electronic equipment, which they believe is capable of detecting paranormal activity. The two originally worked as plumbers for Roto-Rooter as a day job while investigating locations at night. = Investigative procedures = When investigating a location, TAPS team members first visit and survey the property with its owners, who describe their experiences at the site. Next, the team sets up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hotspots. The TAPS team then spends several hours taking electromagnetic field and temperature readings, recording audio for EVPs, and filming with digital video cameras. Many times, they will even try to verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, the team spends several days analyzing all of the data for evidence of possible paranormal activity. A few days after reviewing the information, Hawes and Wilson discuss their findings with the location site owners, offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions the owners may have. The TAPS members state that they do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal and sometimes provide reasonable explanations such as cold spots which may be drafty windows, strange noises that may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, moving objects which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged, or phantom lights which can be reflections of light from a passing vehicle. Since the series began airing, TAPS has recorded thousands of hours of audio and video data. Most investigations, according to TAPS, turn up cold with very little, if any, paranormal activity occurring; however, the ghost hunters claim to have several decent recordings of moving objects, mysterious lights, strange mists, and shadowy figures that manifest before the camera and are highlighted at the end of the show. Sci Fi initially categorized the program as a docu-soap. In addition to the investigative aspect, the show has also presented personal conflicts and relationships among members of the TAPS team. Portions of some episodes portray Hawes and Wilson involved with their plumbing job or personal lives, but this varies by episode and is not always included. As the series progressed, however, the \\"behind- the-scenes\\" and \\"docu-soap\\" aspects were reduced, and by the fifth season the show focused primarily on the investigations, with virtually none of the docu- soap material that characterized earlier episodes. = Equipment used = During investigations, the TAPS ghost hunters team use various equipment, including digital thermometers, EMF meters, thermographic and night vision cameras, handheld and static digital video cameras, digital audio recorders, and laptop computers. The team has also experimented, in at least one episode, with a geiger counter during their investigation to see if it would register any anomalous readings. Starting around the third season, the team has used the K-2 (or K-II) meter, a type of EMF meter that uses a series of LEDs to measure the strength of an energy field instead of a numerical LCD screen. During the Manson murders investigation, in particular, the team used a K-2 meter in an attempt to get \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" responses to verbal questions posed to a supposed entity in a room. In the fifth season's \\"Edith Wharton Estate\\" case, the team introduced two new pieces of equipment: one is a custom-made geophone, which detects vibrations and flashes a series of LEDs that measure the intensity of the vibration; the second is a new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an electromagnetic field, and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes. In the episode, the geophones were recorded on video flashing to the vibrations of what sounded like footsteps across a floor, even though no one was supposedly in the room. Other gear not typically shown on screen are an ion generator, a device that charges the air with electricity and is theorized to help spirits manifest, and the white noise generator, an audio device that makes a static background noise and is theorized to act as a catalyst for assisting entities in making EVPs.

It has since been syndicated on NBC Universal sister cable channel Oxygen and also airs on the Canadian cable network OLN. In the early shows, TAPS was headquartered in a trailer located behind Jason Hawes' house, and they drove one white van to investigations. Within one season, they had moved the entire operation to a storefront in Warwick, Rhode Island, and acquired several new TAPS vehicles. In addition to their successful television venture, TAPS operates a website where they share their stories, photographs, and ghost hunting videos with an ever-growing membership list. Because of the popularity of the show, TAPS cast members have signed contracts with at least two talent agencies, Escape Artistry and GP Entertainment, to manage their appearances at lectures, conferences and public events. TAPS also ventured into the venue of radio broadcast with a three-hour weekly show called Beyond Reality, initially hosted by Hawes and Wilson. The radio show covers topics in a vast array of areas such as cryptozoology, spiritualism, ufology, and ghosts. The show includes guest appearances from other TAPS members and special guests such as John Zaffis, Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Chris Fleming, and others who specialize in certain fields. Noted paranormal author Jeff Belanger and Spooky Southcoast radio host and author Tim Weisberg served as fill-in hosts. The show also once simulcasted on Spooky Southcoast, airing from the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire. New episodes are broadcast every Saturday from 7 pm to 10 pm Eastern Time, though sometimes may skip a week due to the possibility of the hosts being busy with other ventures. On March 3, 2010, Ghost Hunters' 100th episode aired, featuring their investigation of Alcatraz Prison. The two-hour special featured a live studio audience with question and answer segments, hosted by Josh Gates of Destination Truth. The special also featured the GHI crew, the winning contestants of Ghost Hunters Academy, and Craig Piligian, the creator and executive producer of Ghost Hunters. On June 2, 2011, Syfy renewed Ghost Hunters for an eighth season, marking it as the longest-running reality series to air on the network. On February 15, 2012, Grant Wilson announced he would be leaving the cast of Ghost Hunters in order to focus on his personal life.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/ghost-hunters- grant-wilson-leaving-291915 In a statement, Hawes responded with, \\"I will miss working with Grant on a daily basis, and am indebted to the level of dedication and expertise he has brought to our field. I can‚Äôt imagine having a better partner through it all ‚Äî both on the show and off. Grant and I, along with our spouses and children, are all like one big family. While I fully support his decision to move on from the series, this longtime friendship ‚Äî as well as our business partnership ‚Äî will continue off-camera for years to come.\\"https://ew.com/article/2012/02/16/ghost-hunters-grant-wilson-leaving/ Subsequently, Wilson also left the Beyond Reality radio show and was eventually replaced by JV Johnson, the publisher/editor of TAPS Para-magazine. On June 7, 2016, Hawes announced that Ghost Hunters would be concluding on Syfy, with season 11 being the last season to be produced. On August 1, Wilson publicly reunited with Hawes for the first time, as a guest on Beyond Reality.https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ghost-hunters-grant-wilson-jason-hawes- to-reunite_b_579b8515e4b00e7e269f1e6a On June 26, 2019, it was announced that Ghost Hunters would be revived later that year, with Wilson returning with a new team. The 12th season, initially reported to consist of 20 episodes (later broadcast as 11 with two specials, with a 13th season premiering later), premiered on August 21, 2019 on A&E; and ended on October 30, 2019. Lead investigator and producer Grant Wilson confirmed prior to the October 30, 2019 episode that Ghost Hunters would return in 2020 for a 13th season of an unspecified number of episodes. On February 18, 2020, it was announced that the 13th season would premiere on April 8, 2020. =Criticism= Ghost Hunters has attracted various critics and skeptics, such as Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, Skeptical Inquirer author Lynne Kelly, James Randi, and Benjamin Radford. The Skeptical Analysis of the Paranormal Society (SAPS) was founded with the intent to recreate and debunk segments of the show. In June 2008, Ghost Hunters was awarded The Truly Terrible Television (TTTV) Award by Independent Investigations Group for peddling pseudoscience and superstition to its audience. During the seven-hour-long, live Halloween show on October 31, 2008, at least two events took place that critics have scrutinized: One occurs when lead investigator Grant Wilson has his jacket collar pulled down by an unseen force three times; all the while one of his hands remained at his side, which led detractors to claim he was pulling a hidden string. This happens again at one point where Hawes touches Wilson's back and his collar moves down again. Another occurs when a supposed disembodied voice tells the hunters, \\"You're not supposed to be here.\\" Critics have claimed the voice sounded like it was piped in from an external audio source. In regard to the scrutiny, Wilson and Hawes defended themselves, stating that everything in the show is real. TAPS Interview In a 2013 interview on The Reveal, Wilson stated that their television contracts forbade them from faking evidence on the show. In January 2019, Steve Gonsalves from Ghost Hunters, along with Chris Smith and Mike Goncalves of the TV show Haunted Towns, hosted a \\"Death Ship Ghost Hunt\\" as part of Ghost Hunt Weekends on the USS North Carolina. Paranormal researcher Kenny Biddle wrote an article for Skeptical Inquirer addressing the criticism this event received, stating that it could tarnish the reputation of this historical site.  Method  According to investigator Benjamin Radford, most ghost hunting groups including TAPS make many methodological mistakes. \\"After watching episodes of Ghost Hunters and other similar programs, it quickly becomes clear to anyone with a background in science that the methods used are both illogical and unscientific\\". Anyone can be a ghost investigator, \\"failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena\\", considering emotions and feelings as \\"evidence of ghostly encounters.\\" \\"Improper and unscientific investigation methods\\", for example, \\"using unproven tools and equipment\\", \\"sampling errors\\", \\"ineffectively using recording devices\\" and \\"focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena.\\" In an article for Skeptical Inquirer, Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation: \\"I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously. Most of the efforts to investigate ghosts so far have been badly flawed and unscientific ‚Äî and not surprisingly, fruitless.\\" In a New York Times article about Ghost Hunters and TAPS, Radford contended that \\"the group and others like it lack scientific rigor and mislead people into thinking that their homes are haunted.\\" The show's editing has been questioned, such as activity that is not captured on tape and findings that are unsupported by evidence in the show specifically. Tools are used in ways that are not proven effective, or in ways in which they have been proven ineffective, such as infrared thermometers that are claimed to detect cold spots in the middle of rooms when such tools are able only to measure the surface temperature of objects. Techniques with thermal imaging cameras, Geiger counters, electronic voice phenomenon, and EMF detectors are used with little or no explanation as to how the techniques have proven to provide evidence of ghosts or other entities. There are concerns that the devices are misused, such as the noting of Benjamin Radford's article for Skeptical Inquirer: \\"you may own the world's most sophisticated thermometer, but if you are using it as a barometer, your measurements are worthless. Just as using a calculator doesn't make you a mathematician, using a scientific instrument doesn't make you a scientist.\\" Popular culture Ghost Hunters helped popularize paranormal television and ghost hunting during its original run. For much of its initial airing on Syfy, it was the top-rated paranormal reality show on television. John Blake of CNN opined in 2013 that Ghost Hunters \\"is to the paranormal field what Sugarhill's 'Rapper's Delight' is to hip-hop...\\" Hawes, Wilson and Ghost Hunters were parodied on the 2009 episode of South Park entitled \\"Dead Celebrities\\". They have made talk-show appearances on the December 8, 2005 episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, the Oct 31, 2006 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, a 2008 episode of The View, and the October 28, 2010 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.  Related productions  = Spin-offs =  Ghost Hunters International  A spin-off series premiered on January 9, 2008, featuring investigators Robb Demarest, Brian Harnois, Donna LaCroix, Andy Andrews, Shannon Sylvia, and Barry Fitzgerald (who appeared in the summer 2007 Ireland episodes of Ghost Hunters) since the onset, along with other rotating members from the TAPS family.Current list of TAPS members The format is similar to Ghost Hunters but features investigations in various locations around the world.  UFO Hunters  Ghost Hunters producers Craig Pilligan and Tom Thayer released another paranormal investigation \\"special\\" titled UFO Hunters, (not to be confused with the show of the same name which aired on the History Channel), which first aired on January 30, 2008 but only aired for one episode. The episode followed New York Strange Phenomena Investigators (NY- SPI) co-founders Oliver Kemenczky and Ted Davis, along with paranormal researcher Dennis Anderson, as they investigated an alleged alien abduction case in Carteret, New Jersey and a strange fireball sighting in Normandy Beach, New Jersey. The format was similar to a typical Ghost Hunters episode, with most of the program dedicated to the investigation and wrapped up with a review of findings and evidence that was gathered. The pilot episode was reformatted and returned on December 13, 2008, as a special called Ny-Spi Investigates on Investigation Discovery,http://www.ny-spi.com/ Ny-Spy Investigates but was not picked up as a continuing series.  Ghost Hunters Academy  On October 23, 2008, TV Guide reported that Syfy would launch a spin-off of the show called Ghost Hunters: College Edition, which would feature \\"co-eds\\" in the ghost hunter roles. The show was later named Ghost Hunters Academy and began airing November 11, 2009. The series features Steve Gonsalves and Dave Tango leading a group of amateur ghost hunters through various investigations. = Later series =  Kindred Spirits  TAPS members Adam Berry (also the finalist from Ghost Hunters Academy) and Amy Bruni left the series in 2014 to start their own program, which was subsequently named Kindred Spirits, which started airing on Destination America and TLC in 2013 and has aired 4 seasons so far, later moving to Travel Channel.  Ghost Nation  After the decision to cut ties with Syfy in 2016 and negotiations to start a new Ghost Hunters series failed, Hawes, Gonsalves and Tango eventually came to decide to focus on efforts to help local investigators on a national level and start a new program, Ghost Nation. The program has aired on Travel Channel since October 2019.

As the manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments between 1977 and 1990, Lynch averaged a 29.2% annual return, consistently more than doubling the S&P; 500 stock market index and making it the best-performing mutual fund in the world.The Intelligent Investor, 2003, Commentary on the Introduction During his 13 year tenure, assets under management increased from US$18 million to $14 billion. He also co-authored a number of books and papers on investing and coined a number of well known mantras of modern individual investing strategies, such as Invest in what you know and ten bagger. Lynch is consistently described as a \\"legend\\" by the financial media for his performance record, and was called \\"legendary\\" by Jason Zweig in his 2003 update of Benjamin Graham's book, The Intelligent Investor. Early life and education Peter Lynch was born on January 19, 1944 in Newton, Massachusetts. In 1951, when Lynch was seven, his father was diagnosed with cancer. He died three years later, and Lynch's mother had to work to support the family. Lynch reports that from his early teens he worked as a caddy to help support the family.Beating the Street, chapter one. During Lynch's time as a sophomore at Boston College, he used his savings to buy 100 shares of Flying Tiger Airlines at $8 per share. The stock would later rise to $80 per share, profits from which helped pay for his education. In 1965, Lynch graduated from Boston College (BC) where he had studied history, psychology and philosophy. He later earned a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Investment career =Fidelity= In 1966, Lynch was hired as an intern with Fidelity Investments partly because he had been caddying for Fidelity's president, D. George Sullivan, (among others) at Brae Burn Country Club in Newton, Massachusetts. He initially covered the paper, chemical, and publishing industries, and when he returned after a two-year Army stint he was hired permanently in 1969. This time Lynch was charged with following the textiles, metals, mining, and chemicals industries, eventually becoming Fidelity's director of research from 1974 to 1977. Fidelity Magellan Fund In 1977, Lynch was named head of the then-obscure Magellan Fund which had $18 million in assets. By the time Lynch resigned as a fund manager in 1990, the fund had grown to more than $14 billion in assets with more than 1,000 individual stock positions. Taking over when Magellan was a small fund, Lynch had no restrictions on what assets he could buy (other than laws, such as an SEC-enforced federal law that prohibits investment company funds that are registered as \\"diversified\\" from holding more than 5% of total portfolio assets in a single company at time of purchase ). He focused on individual companies rather than any overarching strategy, starting with large US companies and gradually shifting emphasis to smaller and international stocks.Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634 From 1977 until 1990, the Magellan fund averaged a 29.2% annual return and as of 2003 had the best 20-year return of any mutual fund ever. Lynch's achieved dollar successes in a range of stocks including (by order of profit achieved - source is Beating the Street): Fannie Mae, Ford, Philip Morris, MCI, Volvo, General Electric, General Public Utilities, Student Loan Marketing, Kemper, and Lowe's. Investment philosophy Lynch has written (with co-author John Rothchild) three texts on investing, including One Up on Wall Street (), Beating the Street (), and Learn to Earn. The last-named book was written for beginning investors of all ages, mainly teenagers. In essence, One Up served as theory while Beating the Street is application. One Up lays out Lynch's investment technique including chapters devoted to stock classifications, the two-minute drill, famous numbers, and designing a portfolio. Most of Beating the Street consists of an extensive stock by stock discussion of Lynch's 1992 Barron's Magazine selections, essentially providing an illustration of the concepts previously discussed. As such, both books represent study material for investors of any knowledge level or ability. Lynch also wrote a series of investment articles for Worth magazine that expand on many of the concepts and companies mentioned in the books.Lynch coined some of the best-known mantras of modern individual investing strategies. His most famous investment principle is, \\"Invest in what you know,\\" popularizing the economic concept of \\"local knowledge\\". Since most people tend to become expert in certain fields, applying this basic \\"invest in what you know\\" principle helps individual investors find good undervalued stocks. Lynch uses this principle as a starting point for investors. He has also often said that the individual investor is potentially more capable of making money from stocks than a fund manager, because they are able to spot good investments in their day-to-day lives before Wall Street. Throughout his two classic investment primers, he has outlined many of the investments he found when not in his office. For example, in One Up Lynch explains how he invested in Dunkin' Donuts not after reading about the company in The Wall Street Journal, but after being impressed by their coffee as a customer. Assuming others would be similarly impressed and noting the company's Boston locations were always busy, he then studied the company's financial status and decided to invest in Dunkin' Donuts, which proved one of the best-performing stocks he ever bought. Lynch believes the individual investor is able to make similar smart investing choices noticing particular opportunities like Dunkin' Donuts or paying attention to business trends in their careers and hobbies. Using examples from Magellan Fund, his books outline how a novice should read and interpret company paperwork for information on stock valuation, earnings, cash flow and other data. Lynch has stated in One Up on Wall Street that his undergraduate studies in philosophy and logic were more important to his career than the math or finance he studied for his MBA. At Wharton, he came to believe that the two prevailing investing theories in academia, the random walk hypothesis and the efficient market hypothesis, were contradictory. The concepts taught by professors at school were regularly disproved by professionals during his internship at Fidelity. He thus came to rely more on practitioners than theoreticians: \\"It seemed to me that what was supposed to help you succeed in the investment business, could only help you fail ... Quantitative analysis taught me that the things I saw happening at Fidelity couldn't really be happening.\\"One Up on Wall Street, p. 34 Lynch has also argued against market timing, stating: \\"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections or trying to anticipate corrections than has been lost in the corrections themselves.\\"As quoted in \\"The Wisdom of Great Investors: Insights from Some of History's Greatest Investment Minds, by Davis Advisers, p. 7 Lynch popularized the stock investment strategy ‚ÄúGARP‚Äù (Growth At A Reasonable Price), which is a hybrid stock-picking approach that balances Growth investing potential for share-price increases with the discipline of Value investing to avoid buying overpriced stocks. Many well-known funds now follow the GARP model, ranging from equity funds such as Fidelity Investments Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and Lemma Senbet Fund, to index funds such as Russell Indexes iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index. He also coined the phrase \\"ten bagger\\" in a financial context. This refers to an investment which is worth ten times its original purchase price, and comes from baseball where the number of \\"bags\\" or \\"bases\\" that a batter can run to is a measure of the success of that runner's hit. A baseball player who hits a home run will pass all four bases, and so such a hit is sometimes called a four-bagger. Similarly, a baseball double hit is sometimes called a two bagger. As Lynch wrote in One Up on Wall Street, ‚ÄúIn my business a fourbagger is nice, but a tenbagger is the fiscal equivalent of two home runs and a double.‚Äù Personal life Lynch married his wife, Carolyn Ann Hoff, and cofounded the Lynch Foundation. They had three daughters. She died in October 2015 due to complications of leukemia at age 69. Wealth and philanthropy According to a 2006 Boston Magazine article, Lynch has an overall net worth of $352 million USD. Though he continues to work part time as vice chairman of Fidelity Management & Research Co., the investment adviser arm of Fidelity Investments, spending most of his time mentoring young analysts, Peter Lynch focuses a great deal of time on philanthropy. He said he views philanthropy as a form of investment. He said he prefers to give money to support ideas that he thinks can spread, such as First Night, the New Year's Eve festival that began in Boston in 1976 and has inspired similar events in more than 200 other communities, and City Year, a community service program founded in Boston in 1988 that now operates in 29 cities across the U.S. The Lynches give money primarily in five ways: as individuals, through the Lynch Foundation, through a Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, and through two charitable trusts. The Lynches have made gifts as individuals, donating $10 million to Peter Lynch's alma mater, Boston College. In turn, BC named the Lynch School of Education and Human Development after the family. The Lynch Foundation, valued at $125 million, gave away $8 million in 2013 and has made $80 million in grants since its inception. The Foundation supports education, religious organizations, cultural and historic organizations, and hospitals and medical research. The Lynch Foundation was one of the first major supporters of Teach For America, AmeriCares, and Partners In Health. Lynch was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1991. Lynch is a member of the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows.  Honors  Lynch received the 1992 Seton Award from the National Catholic Education Association.

It was based in Chicago. Synthesis/Regeneration, an affiliated journal of green social thought, was published in St. Louis. The now predominant Green Party of the United States split from the G/GPUSA in 2001. History The Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA) was founded at the August 1991 Green Gathering in Elkins, West Virginia, restructuring the Green Committees of Correspondence with the idea that the Green movement and Green Party would operate as part of a single organization. A press conference was held in Washington, D.C., to announce the new organization, featuring Charles Betz (G/GPUSA Coordinating Committee member), Howie Hawkins and Joni Whitmore (Chair, Green Party of Alaska), as well as Hilda Mason of the D.C. Statehood Party, and was featured on C-SPAN. Subsequently, legal documents were filed under Missouri law to form the Greens/Green Party USA as a 527 group. It was recognized by the FEC as a national political party in 1991. Subsequent G/GPUSA Green Gatherings were held in Minneapolis (Augsburg College, July 1992); Syracuse (August 1993); Boise (July 1994), Albuquerque (University of New Mexico, July 27‚Äì30, 1995), Los Angeles (UCLA, August 1996); and Lawrence, Massachusetts (August 1997). At various times, a \\"Green Clearinghouse\\" was the central administrative office of G/GPUSA. The Clearinghouse has operated from various locations, including (originally) Kansas City, Missouri; Blodgett Mills, New York; Lawrence, Massachusetts; and Chicago. Despite its development of a national-level organization, the G/GPUSA always emphasized that the \\"Green Local\\" is the primary organizing unit. Some members of G/GPUSA resisted efforts to organize Green parties at the state level, on the theory that state bureaucracy was inimical to the organic and democratic nature of autonomous Green locals. The model in the early days was based on the bioregion and not state boundaries. Other Greens pointed out that, in most jurisdictions in the United States, political parties gain recognition at the state level, so without state-level organizations it would be difficult for Greens to participate in election activities. At the 2001 Congress of the G/GPUSA, held at Carbondale, Illinois, on July 21, the delegates were to consider the Boston Proposal, a separation of powers agreement between it and the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). Many of those attending were also members of the ASGP. There was an intense organizational struggle, much of which revolved around whether or not to \\"accredit\\" various delegations (and thus grant them voting privileges). The proposal failed to reach the required two-thirds majority, although over half voted to approve it (99 in favor, 81 against). The result was very controversial, and ultimately led to the exodus of many G/GPUSA activists, some of whom went on to form The Green Alliance, an organization intended to bring \\"movement\\" politics in the style of the G/GPUSA into the Green Party of the United States. In 2001, the Green Party of the United States was founded and recognized by the FEC as a national committee, and has become a much larger and more visible than the G/GPUSA. In 2005, G/GPUSA lost its political party status at the FEC. It had reported no income or expenditures for some time. The G/GPUSA Coordinating Committee notified its members and supporters of the decision to disband the party in January of 2019. Contrast with the Green Party of the United States The Green Party of the United States and Greens/Green Party USA had no organizational connection but share a common and difficult history. The G/GPUSA is not an electoral party, although some of its members participate in elections. The name \\"G/GPUSA\\" is said to have reflected a compromise or a synergy between Greens who emphasized the primacy of combining non-electoral movement building with electoral campaigns, and those who sought to participate actively only in elections. It has also been characterized as a power grab when the original Committees of Correspondence split and a small group registered the name without consultation with the five existing state parties, all in the western states. The Greens/Green Party USA was an educational, grassroots organizing, advocacy group based on the 10 Key Values. The journal Synthesis/Regeneration published in St. Louis, was associated with the G/GPUSA. This journal publishes articles by writers with a wide range of Green viewpoints. Synthesis/Regeneration was first published in 1991 and is produced every four months. The source of the rift between the two national Green parties was a matter of contentious debate. Some point to differences of political philosophy or views on the proper structure of the party or attitudes toward elections, while others suggest it was more about personality conflicts, turf struggles, and poor communication leading to concerns about financial and political accountability, or perhaps the 1991 name grab or the inaccurate G/GPUSA FEC filing in 1995. It is important to note that the heated debates and the fighting that was waged for several years at the national level (and among Greens within a few states, such as New York, Missouri, California and New Jersey) seemed largely irrelevant to the vast majority of grassroots Greens, who preferred to devote their energies to local organizing. In an article on the G/GPUSA's website, the organization characterized the split between itself and the Green Party of the United States (GPUS) as akin to the fundi‚Äìrealo split in the German Greens, with itself being the fundi wing and GPUS the realos.

Carr served as a Sergeant with Colonel William Edmeston in the French and Indian War and was later employed as an agent for Edmeston and his brother Robert in establishing claims on tracts of land on the eastern bank of the Unadilla River just west of George Croghan's Otsego patent near what is now the hamlet of South Edmeston in the Town of Edmeston. Carr was then made caretaker for these tracts, which became known as Mount Edmeston (also known as Edmeston Plantation, Edmeston Manor, Carr's Garden, and commonly the Carr farm). The Edmeston brothers returned to England, but sent a number of settlers, likely including some Irish indentured servants, back to their estate. In 1773, William returned to Mount Edmeston to personally supervise its development, and by 1775, its population was nearing 100. With the advent of the Revolutionary War, Edmeston, now a British Major, was detained by American patriots in the eastern part of the state and Carr continued to manage Mount Edmeston. But, as a known Tory, he was suspected by patriots at Cherry Valley and German Flatts of selling provisions to Joseph Brant. In September 1778, a group of Native Americans who were allied with the British, mistakenly set Carr's house on fire and carried him and his wife to Canada through the Niagara region. At least one account has stated that Carr was treated very poorly, having been forced to lie down in steams to allow his captors to use his body as a footbridge. Carr and his wife returned to Mount Edmeston in 1783. Major Edmeston who had returned to duty in Europe, hired Carr to rebuild his estate, but in 1788, Robert Edmeston returned to America and fired Carr. John Tunnicliff, an influential farmer in the area, tried to mediate the dispute, but, as Tunnicliff reported in a letter to William Cooper, his efforts proved fruitless, even though Carr's friends and neighbors signed an affidavit testifying to his \\"frugal & industrious\\" dealings on behalf of his landlord. Carr's direct appeal for relief to William Edmeston, on the grounds of old age and a \\"State of absolute Penury\\", was equally without success. Finally, however, a small piece of property was secured for him, and Carr remained in Otsego County until his death in 1804, when he was buried on John Tunnicliff's farm near Schuyler Lake.

Dollar values on outstanding loans and bonds are illustrative; bonds were rarely issued for less than US$125 million, and lenders frequently accepted either 30‚Äì50% losses on face value or reduced interest rates fixed at below- market values. According to EMTA, a financial industry trade association, most lenders that accepted Brady bonds for outstanding loans were smaller US commercial banks or non-US financial institutions, rather than \\"major money center banks.\\" Brady bonds are dollar-denominated bonds, issued mostly by Latin American countries in the late 1980s. The bonds were named after U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who proposed a novel debt-reduction agreement for developing countries. History Brady bonds were created in March 1989 to convert bank loans, mostly in Latin America, into a variety or \\"menu\\" of new bonds after many countries defaulted on their debt in the 1980s. At the time, the market for emerging markets' sovereign debt was small and illiquid, and the standardization of emerging-market debt facilitated risk- spreading and trading. In exchange for commercial bank loans, the countries issued new bonds for the principal sum and, in some cases, unpaid interest. Because they were tradable and came with some guarantees, they were sometimes more valuable to the creditors than the original bonds. The key innovation behind the introduction of Brady Bonds was to allow the commercial banks to exchange their claims on developing countries into tradable instruments, allowing them to get the debt off their balance sheets. This reduced the concentration risk to those banks. The plan included two rounds. In the first round, creditors bargained with debtors over the terms of the new claims. Loosely interpreted, the options contained different mixes of \\"exit\\" and \\"new money\\" options. The exit options were designed for creditors who wanted to reduce their exposure to a debtor country. Those options allowed creditors to reduce their exposure to debtor nations, albeit at a discount. The new money options reflected the belief that those creditors that chose not to exit would experience a capital gain from the transaction, as the nominal outstanding debt obligation of the debtor would be reduced, and with it, the probability of future default. Those options allowed creditors to retain their exposure but required additional credit extension designed to \\"tax\\" the expected capital gains. The principal of many instruments was collateralized, as were \\"rolling interest guarantees,\\" which guaranteed payment for fixed short periods. The first round negotiations thus involved the determination of the effective magnitude of discount on the exit options together with the amount of new lending called for under the new money options. In the second round, creditors converted their existing claims into their choice among the \\"menu\\" of options agreed upon in the first round. The penalties for creditors failing to comply with the terms of the deal were never made explicit. Nevertheless, compliance was not an important problem under the Brady Plan. Banks wishing to cease their foreign lending activities tended to choose the exit option under the auspices of the deal. By offering a \\"menu\\" of options, the Brady Plan permitted credit restructurings to be tailored to the heterogeneous preferences of creditors. The terms achieved under the deals indicate that debtors used the menu approach to reduce the cost of debt reduction. Furthermore, it reduced the holdout problem in which certain shareholders have an incentive not to participate in the restructuring in the hope of getting a better deal. The principal amount was usually collateralized by specially issued US Treasury 30-year zero-coupon bonds purchased by the debtor country using a combination of International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the country's own foreign currency reserves. Interest payments on Brady bonds, in some cases, are guaranteed by securities of at least double-A-rated credit quality held with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Countries that participated in the initial round of issuing Brady bonds were Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Types There were two main types of Brady bonds: *Par bonds were issued to the same value as the original loan, but the coupon on the bonds is below market rate; principal and interest payments are usually guaranteed. *Discount bonds were issued at a discount to the original value of the loan, but the coupon is at market rate; principal and interest payments are usually guaranteed. Other, less common, types include front-loaded interest-reduction bonds (FLIRB), new-money bonds, debt-conversion bonds (DCB), and past-due interest bonds (PDI). Brady Bond negotiations generally involved some form of \\"haircut.\\" In other words, the value of the bonds resulting from the restructurings was less than the face value of the claims before the restructurings. Guarantees attached to Brady bonds included collateral to guarantee the principal, rolling interest guarantees, and value recovery rights. Not all Brady bonds would necessarily have all those forms of guarantee, and the specifics would vary from issuance to issuance. Current status Although the Brady bond process ended during the 1990s, many of the innovations introduced in these restructurings (call options embedded in the bonds, \\"stepped\\" coupons, pars and discounts) were retained in the later sovereign restructurings in, for example, Russia and Ecuador. The latter country, in 1999, became the first country to default on its Brady bonds. In 2003, Mexico became the first country to retire its Brady debt. The Philippines bought back all of its Brady bonds in May 2007, joining Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico as countries that have retired the bonds.

(also spelled Geretrude, Geretrudis, Gertrud; c. 628Butler, Alban. ‚ÄúSaint Gertrude, Virgin and Abbess of Nivelle‚Äù. Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866 ‚Äì 17 March 659) was a seventh- century abbess who, with her mother Itta, founded the Abbey of Nivelles located in present-day Belgium. Life =Family and childhood= The early history of Gertrude's family is not well documented. The anonymous author of her Early Middle Ages biography, Vita Sanctae Geretrudis, only hints at her origins: \\"it would be tedious to insert in this account in what line of earthly origin she was descended. For who living in Europe does not know the loftiness, the names, and the localities of her lineage?\\"Vita Sanctae Geretrudis Gertrude's father, Pepin of Landen (Pippin the Elder), a nobleman from east Francia, had been instrumental in persuading King Clothar II to crown his son, Dagobert I, as the King of Austrasia. Due to her position at the palace, Gertrude's mother, Itta of Metz, was likely acquainted with St. Amandus, the Bishop of Maastricht. When Dagobert succeeded his father and the court moved to Neustria, Pippin became mayor of the palace, and his family (including young Gertrude) moved with the king's court.Fredegar ch 84 Thus, Gertrude became introduced to politics during her childhood in the royal court. Arnulf of Metz, Pippin's close ally, was one of several royal counselors who received ecclesiastical posts after a secular career. McNamara argues that Arnulf retired into religion at the time of Clothar's death in 628, but he kept close ties to the family by marrying his son to Gertrude's sister, Begga.McNamara et al. 221 However, later scholars have disagreed. Marriage proposal St. Gertrude of Nivelles by an anonymous Flemish painter (ca. 1530) Gertrude's biography begins with her father hosting a banquet when Gertrude was ten years old.Some scholars think it may have been written by an Irish monk after Begga's death in 693. The dispute is discussed in Gertrude in Literature, below That the king accepted Pippin's invitation to the dinner at all shows Pippin's power and standing as well as that of his family.Fouracre At this feast, the King asked Gertrude if she would like to marry the \\"son of a duke of the Austrasians.... for the sake of his worldly ambition and mutual alliance.\\" Gertrude declined and \\"lost her temper and flatly rejected him with an oath, saying that she would have neither him nor any earthly spouse but Christ the Lord.\\"McNamara et al 223 Marriage alliances were important in this era although scholars disagree as to the extent parents or kings asserted power over spousal choice.Contrast Peyroux pp. 51‚Äì52, Wemple p. 54, and Wood p. 260 The marriage between Gertrude's sister Begga and Ansegisel helped set the stage for a Carolingian takeover of Austrasia.Wemple 54 The marriage of their son Pepin the Middle and Plectrude later secured the lands of Plectrude's parents Hugobert and Irmina of Oeren between the Rhine, Moselle and Meuse rivers, because Plectrude was an only child. Begga's sons enhanced Pepin's power by marrying women with political connections in the north and northwest. All agree that the girl's personal feeling mattered little. One scholar speculated that if Pippin I had lived longer, he would likely have forced Gertrude to marry the son of the Austrasian duke, thus giving power to the Pippinids sooner to supplant the Merovingians. Dagobert died in 639 and was succeeded by Sigebert. When Pippin died, Gertrude's brother Grimoald competed with Otto to become the new mayor of the palace; he revolted in a grab for power.Fredegar ch 86 After Otto died in battle a decade later, \\"the dignity of mayor of Sigebert's palace and control of all the kingdom of Austrasia was thus decisively assured to Grimoald\\" and the Pippinids.Fredegar, ch 88 The mention of Gertrude's decided rejection of her Austrasian suitor is unique for the era. At least one scholar considers it to have been deliberately included by the chronicler as expressing her character.Peyroux 40‚Äì53 The reference to a prior betrothal to Christ becomes common in later saints' lives. The suitor, while irritated, is not emotionally affected by this rejection. After Dagobert's death, Pippin returned to the east in 640, taking Gertrude with him. Soon after, Pippin himself died, giving Gertrude the freedom to take the veil and enter the monastic life. Scholars debate the date of the death of Pippin. Some sources date it as late as 650, although others date it much earlier. After her father's death The Vita describes how Itta, in order to prevent \\"violent abductors from tearing her daughter away by force,\\" shaved her daughter's hair, leaving only a crown shape. This action, known as tonsuring, marked Gertrude for a life of religious service. There were constant requests by \\"violators of souls\\" who wished to gain wealth and power by marrying Gertrude. As detailed in the Vita, only Itta's foundation of the Abbey of Nivelles stopped the constant flow of suitors interested in marrying Gertrude in order to ally with her wealthy family. Susan Wemple argues that Gertrude's story is an example of mothers dominating their daughters in Merovingian times in an effort to \\"safeguard [their] daughters' sexual purity and secure [their] future.\\"Wemple 60 Mothers, she says, were required to raise their daughters to be obedient and disciplined, and the standard \\"maternal feelings\\" were \\"vigilance and worry\\"Wemple 60-61 The biographer of St. Gertrude mentions that after the death of Pippin the Elder in 640, his widow Itta pondered daily on what was to become of her and her daughter. Upon the advice of Saint Amand, she ordered the construction of a monastery to which she and Gertrude could retire. According to Wemple, > \\"A mother's importance was acknowledged in law insofar as she had the right > to assume the guardianship for her fatherless children. In the propertied > classes, this meant that a widow could exercise considerable power by > managing the estates of her minor children and arranging for their > marriages.\\"Wemple 61 Itta lost this right after the death of her husband Pippin because their sons had come of age. She still had the option to find a suitable husband for Gertrude. Catherine Peyroux has said that Itta established the monastery in order to protect her and her daughter in the event that her sons fell out of favor with the ruling dynasty, as well as to safeguard the family lands from plunder or seizure through forced marriage.Peyroux 52 =Foundress= Nivelles (Belgium), fore-part and southern door of the Saint Gertrude Collegiate church (eleventh or thirteenth century) Christianity was not at all widespread in Gertrude's place and time. It was only the development of cities and the initiative of bishops that led to a vast movement of evangelism, and a flowering of monasteries in the 7th and 8th centuries.Donnay-Rocmans in translation, 34 Gertrude's Vita describes how Bishop Amand came to Itta's house, \\"preaching the word of God. At the Lord's bidding, he asked whether she would build a monastery for herself and Christ's handmaid, Gertrude.\\"McNamara et al. 224 Itta founded Nivelles, a double monastery, one for men, the other for women. However, after they entered the religious life, Gertrude and her mother suffered, \\"no small opposition\\" from the royal family. During this period, trials for the family are mentioned involving the usurper Otto's bid to replace the Pippinids at the side of the king. There is some precedent for Gertrude and Itta's move to the monastery at Nivelles. According to Wemple, \\"during the second half of the seventh century, women in Neustrian-Burgundian families concentrated on the creation of a network of monasteries rather than on the conclusion of politically advantageous unions, while families whose holdings were in the northeastern parts of the kingdom, centering around the city of Metz, were more concerned with the acquisition of power through carefully arranged marriages.\\" Itta's move to start a monastery was thus not completely out of the ordinary, and may have in fact been the norm for a widowed noblewoman.Wemple 54‚Äì55 Upon Itta's death at about the age of 60 in the year 652, twelve years after the death of her husband Pippin, Gertrude took over the monastery. At this time, Gertrude took the \\"whole burden of governing upon herself alone,\\" placing affairs of the family in the hand of \\"good and faithful administrators from the brothers.\\" Some have argued that this implies that Gertrude ruled the monastery with an abbot. Frankish double monasteries were almost always led by an abbess, or jointly by an abbess and abbot.Wemple 162 However, when Suzanne Wemple used Nivelles as an example of the latter, claiming that Gertrude ruled Nivelles jointly with Saint Amand \\"around 640,\\" she casts doubt on her own theory by mistaking the date. Many later scholars date the foundation of Nivelles between 647 and 650.Fouracre 315 =Monastic life= Console Oudegracht 321 The Vita states that in Gertrude, \\"temperance of character, the sobriety of her heart and the moderation of her words she anticipated maturity.\\" She was \\"an intelligent young woman, scholarly and charitable, devoting herself to the sick, elderly, and poor,\\" and as knowing much of the scripture by memory. Gertrude also memorized passages and books on divine law, and she \\"openly disclosed the hidden mysteries of allegory to her listeners.\\" Her Vita describes Gertrude as building churches, and taking care of orphans, widows, captives, and pilgrims. Upon becoming abbess, Gertrude \\"obtained through her envoy's men of good reputation, relics of saints and holy books from Rome, and from regions across the sea, experienced men for the teaching of the divine law and to practice the chants for herself and her people.\\" Fouracre and Gerberding assert that the men from across the sea are from Britain and Ireland and also highlight this as an example of the importance of Rome to the Franks long before Charlemagne ever had a relationship with the Pope. This is supported by Peyroux, Wemple, and the ancient Chronicles of Fredegar. She welcomed foreigners, lay or religious. She especially welcomed Irish monks who, since the sixth century, traveled to evangelize.Donnay-Rocmans in translation, 34‚Äì35 Among the numerous pilgrims that visited the monastery of Nivelles were the two brothers, Foillan and Ultan, both Irish monks on their way from Rome to Peronne, where their brother Fursey, lay buried. According to Wemple, \\"The Irish monasteries, with the ancient tradition of oral learning, were at the time the most distinguished centers of scholarship\\".MacNeill 39‚Äì48, 449‚Äì460 =Death of Foillan= In the Additum Additamentum Nivialense de Fuilano, an addendum to the Vita Sanctae Gertrudis, there is a story about several events involving Irish monks led by Foillan that involve Gertrude and the Abbey of Nivelles.Additamentum Before the foundation of Nivelles, Irish monks led by Foillan traveled to Francia, from Fursey's monastery in Ireland to escape pagan raids. They were received by Erchinoald, mayor of the palace, but were later expelled by him and moved to live with Itta and Gertrude. Grimoald and the Pippinids were happy to accept them and built the monastery of Berbrona for them with the help of Itta and Gertrude. In other works this monastery is referred to as Fosses. There is much praise of Gertrude in the text. Sometime later, Foillan went on a journey, saying mass in Nivelles before leaving. Ian Wood says that the purpose of Foilan's journey was to visit his benefactors, but he provides no evidence for this claim other than a citation of the Additamentum. After only a day of traveling, Foillan and his three companions were betrayed and murdered by an evil man who offered them shelter for the night in his house and then sold their belongings. Upon learning that Foillan did not reach his destination, the brothers of his monastery began to search for him. However, it was Gertrude who succeeded in finding Foillan's body 77 days after he was murdered, on the anniversary of his brother Fursey's death. The four bodies were immediately brought to Nivelles. \\"Dido, Bishop of Poitiers, and the mayor of the palace, Grimoald, a man of illustrious standing,\\" arrived by chance, or, as the text hints, divine intervention at Nivelles shortly before the bodies and the two men carried Foillan into Nivelles \\"on their own shoulders.\\" Foillan's body was then taken to his own monastery \\"and when noblemen had flocked from all sides to meet him and carried him on their own shoulders\\" he was buried at Fosses. =Miracles= Shrine of St. Gertrude of Nivelles, originally made in 1272‚Äì1298 - this reproduction in the Pushkin Museum was cast from the original because in 1940 a German bomb smashed the original reliquary into 337 fragments that subsequently was rebuilt Miraculous vision The first miracle attributed to Gertrude in the Vita takes place at the altar of Pope Sixtus II the Martyr as Gertrude was standing in prayer. \\"She saw descending above her a flaming pellucid sphere such that the whole basilica was illuminated by its brightness.\\" The vision persisted for about half an hour and later was revealed to some of the sisters at the monastery. The anonymous author of the Vita believes that this vision represents a \\"visitation of the True Light.\\" Salvation of the sailors The second miracle attributed to Gertrude in the Vita took place as the anonymous author and his friend were peacefully sailing over the sea on the monastery's business. This account is felt by some to indicate that the author was an Irish monk. In the account, an incredible storm appears as well as a sea monster, causing great despair as \\"the sailors... turned to their idols,\\" evidence of the persistence of paganism at the time. In desperation, the author's friend cries out to Gertrude to save himself and his companions from the storm and monster. Immediately the storm subsides and the monster dives back into the deep. =Appointment of Wulfetrud= Before her death, Gertrude appointed her niece Wulfetrud as Abbess of Nivelles. Wulfetrud's position was precarious because her father, Grimoald I, King of the Lombards, had warred against the Merovingians. According to Ian Wood, \\"It was the Neustrian court that had ended Grimoald's usurpation of the Austrasian throne.\\" Evidence for this claim comes from the Vita, which states that \\"out of hatred of her father that kings, queens, and even priests... wished to drag her from her place\\" and steal Wulfetrude's property. Wulfetrud was only 20 years old at the time. Wilfetrud's appointment was a testament to Gertrude's power and influence within the abbey and the Church itself. According to the Vita, Wulfetrud kept her position \\"through the grace of God.\\" At the same time, however, Gertrude was unable to help \\"Grimoald or his daughter against Clovis II.\\" =Death= Nivelles (Belgium), the Saint Gertrude of Nivelles statue Gertrude is portrayed as leading a devout life until her death. It was possible that after taking the veil in ca. 640, she never left the monastery cloister, thus escaping politics and local affairs. Gertrude is described as \\"exhausted by a life of charity, fasting and prayer\\" at the end of her short life. The Cambridge Medieval History says that \\"because of too much abstinence and keeping of vigils... her body was sorrily exhausted with serious illness.\\" Gertrude's Vita describes her, after relinquishing her role as abbess, spending her time praying intensely and secretly wearing a hair shirt. According to her biographer, Gertrude felt the time of her death approaching and asked a pilgrim from the Fosses monastery when she would die. This pilgrim is commonly believed to be Ultan, Foillan's brother. Fouracre and Gerberding dispute that Ultan was Abbot of Fosses, but there is some speculation. Ultan prophesied that Gertrude would die on 17 March, the very next day, and also the feast day of Saint Patrick. Furthermore, Ultan prophesied that \\"she may pass joyously because blessed Bishop Patrick with the chosen angels of God... are prepared to receive her.\\" True to the prophecy, Gertrude died the next day after praying all night and taking communion. Shortly after her death, the monk Rinchinus as well as the author of the Vita noticed a pleasant odor in cell with her body. Just before her death in 659, Gertrude instructed the nuns at Nivelles to bury her in an old veil left behind by a traveling pilgrim and Gertrude's own hair shirt. She died in poverty, 17 March 659, at the age, we are told, of thirty-three years. Gertrude's choice of burial clothing is a pattern in medieval hagiography as an expression of humility and piety. Her death and the image of her weak and humble figure is, in fact, a critical point in her biographer's narrative. Her monastery also benefitted from this portrayal because the haircloth and veil in which Gertrude was interred became relics. Bonnie Effros contends that identification with tombs like Gertrude's signaled higher privilege and prestige within the church. Tombs covered with cloths often functioned as altars for those who had access to them. At Nivelles, her relics were only publicly displayed for feast days, Easter, and other holy days.Effros 146, 154 Veneration Saint Gertrude saving a house on fire, detail of a mural in the Crosier Monastery, Maastricht Gertrude is the patron saint of the City of Nivelles, The towns of Geertruidenberg, Breda, and Bergen-op-Zoom in North Brabant, also are under her patronage. Saint Gertrude was also the patron saint of the Order of the Holy Cross (Crosiers or Crutched Friars). In the Crosier Church in Maastricht, the Netherlands, a large mural from the 16th century depicts eight scenes from her life and legend. The legend of Gertrude's vision of the ocean voyage led her to be as well the patron saint of travelers. In memory of this event, medieval travelers drank a so-called \\"Sinte Geerts Minne\\" or \\"Gertrudenminte\\" before setting out on their journey. Her attention to the care of her garden led her assistance to be invoked by gardeners, and also against rats and mental illness. Le Tour Sainte-Gertrude is a traditional procession around Nivelles. The abbesses and the canons used to regularly make a long journey outside the walls of the Abbey in emulation of St. Gertrude, to meet the farmers, the poor and the sick. Many of the pilgrims participate in costume, as they accompany a cart bearing a reliquary containing Gertrude's relics. In May 2004, the Saint Gertrude Tour was proclaimed \\"Oral and Intangible Heritage Masterpiece of the French Community.\\"\\"Le Tour Sainte-Gertrude\\", Patrimoine Culturel ImmaterielThe hundred years-old secondary school \\"Coll√®ge Sainte-Gertrude de Nivelles\\" founded by the Cardinal D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier in the city owes its name to the saint. Gertrude of Nivelles in Literature =Vita Sanctae Geretrudis and the Additamentum Nivialense de Fuilano= The Vita was originally thought to have been written in the eleventh century, but this was later disproven with the discovery of a version dating from the eighth century. Bruno Krush argues that the work is written around the same time that the events it describes take place, and there is wide agreement that it was written before 670, and after 663. The time range is determined using a combination of Latin style, references by contemporary works, the accuracy of the events (indicating a close proximity to their occurrence), and references in the text to known events. The Vita is one of just a few sources dating from seventh century France, and one of only three from Austrasia (all of which deal with Gertrude). This makes the Vita very important as a source for Charlemagne's ancestry as well as placing the \\"Cradle of the Carolingians\\" in the middle Meuse in Brabant as opposed to Moselle in Luxembourg, where Pepin II and Plectrude had large tracts of land. The author of Vita writes as a first-hand witness to the events he describes. Although it is perfectly plausible that he could have been a monk or nun, and there some debate on this topic.Peyroux 38 Based on his reference to himself \\"with another brother,\\" the author is most likely male. The Vita was originally written for Abbot Agnes, who succeeded Wulfetrud upon her death. =Source integrity= As indicated by Charlemagne's inclusion of the saintly Arnulf of Metz in his family tree (in a work by Paul the Deacon, a Lombard), there were incentives to being associated with saints in Carolingian times. Fouracre and Gerberding argue that there were large incentives to being associated with saints in the seventh century as well, casting doubt on the genealogy presented in many sources. However, these scholars argue that the close temporal relationship of the three Austrasian sources to the life of Gertrude as well as the monastic audience of the works make them more than likely credible. According to Catherine Peyroux, who believes that because author is writing very near Gertrude's lifetime, account must at least be \\"essentially plausible to Gertrude's contemporaries.\\" Relationship with St. Arnulf of Metz Gertrude's relationship with Arnulf of Metz is a persistent source of confusion for scholars and students alike. Numerous sources point to a relationship between Gertrude and Arnulf,WempleSainted Women while others believe this relationship is invented.Wood In particular, the debate focuses on Arnulf's relationship with Ansegisel, the husband of Begga, Gertrude's sister. Sources that include Arnulf in the Pippinid family state that Arnulf is that father of Ansegisel. Sources making the opposite claim do not. Ian Wood recommends focusing only on the four earliest sources for this information, as later sources are based on these few documents. He starts with the continuations of the chronicles of Fredegar, which do not mention this connection, and are based on an earlier work. He says that \\"since Childebrand himself was the half-brother of Charles Martel, it is not surprising that the Fredegar continuator add the information contained in the Liber Historiae Francorum material largely concerned with Austrasia and Frisia\\" in 751.Wood 257 However, he adds no information regarding Arnulf at this time. The Liber is one of the earliest works detailing the history of this period and makes no mention of the relationship between Arnulf and Ansegisel. Moving to a later source, Wood shows how the Annales Mettenses Priores radically change the picture (from the Liber, the earliest source for the late seventh century, written in 727). The Annales allude to the power held by previous members of the family, especially by Pippin I. They also allude to Pippin I's relationship to Arnulf, Bishop of Metz, although they do not specify the nature of that relationship. In addition they talk with great admiration of Pepin II's grandmother, Itta, and his Aunt, Gertrude. From the start, therefore, the Annales Mettenses Priores announce their intention of turning the history of the seventh and eighth centuries into a history of the Pippinids, or the Carolingians they were to become.\\" As a result of this shift, Wood argues that \\"For the period up until 714, therefore, Annales Mettenses Priores produce a substantially different account of events from that offered by the Liber Historiae Francorum, making Pepin the center of attention, and conferring on him complete power from the Battle of Tertry onwards.\\" This change in focus, while not invalid per se, certainly is problematic, because the Annales were written long after the time period they describe. This is especially important, notes Wood, because \\"as a reading of history the so-called Metz Prior Annals have been extremely influential, providing the most popular interpretation of the late Merovingian period. Nevertheless, they show the Pippinids and Merovingian history as the Carolingians wished to see them.\\" Despite this different focus, even the Metz Annales do not state that Arnulf is Ansegisel's father, saying only that he is a great ally of Pippin. Wood believes that the shift in focus of the Metz Prior Annals is deliberate, citing the need to glorify the sanctity of the newly powerful Pippinids. \\"The other asset which the family was to develop, its sanctity, was beginning to be realized only in the last decades of the seventh century. Although Arnulf of Metz is thought to have been Pepin II's grandfather, the evidence for this is not early, and even the Annales Mettenses Priores were uncertain about the nature of the relationship between Arnulf and the Pippinids.\\" According to Wood, this link comes first from Paul the Deacon (Gesta episcoporum Mettensium) and is suspect, as Paul was not familiar with the events he was writing about and had limited access to reference materials. Of the other early sources that might establish a link between Ansegisel and Arnulf, all that is left is the Vita Arnulfi, or \\"Life of Arnulf.\\" However, according to Wood, it is \\"not clear that the Vita Arnulfi... was written in the seventh century.\\" It is possible that this work was a forgery, created later to sanctify the Carolingian line. This argument is not without base, because after Gertrude died in 659, \\"her sanctity was unquestionably promoted by the family in the late seventh century\\" beginning with her 'Vita in 670.  Recent popular cult  The assignment of Gertrude as patron of cats and the designation of the cat as one of her attributes seems to date from the 1980s. It is not mentioned at all in Madou's extensive historical survey from 1975. A more superficial association of Gertrude with the cat as a mouse hunter goes further back. Her veneration as protector against rats and mice dates from the early 15th century during the Black Plague and spread from Southwestern Germany to the Netherlands and Catalonia. Some 20th-century folkloristics research conflated her with the Germanic goddess Frigg, who may have been depicted riding a cat.Hans Melchers, Das gro√üe Buch der Heiligen, M√ºnchen 1984 (1st ed. 1965), pp. 169‚Äì171. The authoritative Handw√∂rterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens (published in multiple volumes, 1927‚Äì1942) does not verify the connection to cats. The first major English-language publication presenting her as patron of cats is a 1981 catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.John Philip O'Neill, Metropolitan Cats, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1981, p. 47 References Bibliography *Collet, Emmanuel. \\"Sainte Gertrude de Nivelles: Culte, Histoire, Tradition.\\" Nivelles: Comit√© de Sainte Gertrude, 1985. *Delanne, Blanche.

A wrecked Japanese plane in a hangar on Tinian Island, 30 July 1944 The Battle of Tinian was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought on the island of Tinian in the Mariana Islands from 24 July until 1 August 1944. The 8,000-man Japanese garrison was eliminated, and the island joined Saipan and Guam as a base for the Twentieth Air Force. Background Map of the battle A two-prong attack through the Central Pacific and the Philippines was adopted at the 1943 Cairo Conference. Operation Granite II, was a U.S. Navy devised strategy of island hopping, calling for the seizure of Saipan, Tinian and Guam. The Gilbert and Marshall Islands had been seized by the summer of 1944, while some Japanese garrisons were left to starve. Following the conclusion of the Battle of Saipan on 9 July, the US began preparations for attacking nearby Tinian. Tinian was part of Japan's South Seas Mandate. By June 1944, it had a population of 15,700 Japanese civilians, including 2,700 ethnic Koreans and 22 ethnic Chamorro. The Japanese defending the island, the 50th Infantry Regiment, which was originally part of 29th Division, were commanded by Colonel Kiyochi Ogata. On May 12, 1943, there were also 2,349 Marines of the 3rd Special Forces Unit (Á¨¨ 3 ÁâπÂà• Ê†π Âú∞ Èöä, Dai-3 Tokubetsu Konkyochitai) and 950 marines of the 56th Naval Guards, who had been transferred there from Truk. These soldiers were under the command of Kaigun- Taisa Goichi Oya. The naval forces took over the defense of the airfields, as they belonged to the facilities of naval aviation. The Japanese naval troops also took over all the heavy artillery guns around the airfields and the 39 heavy anti-aircraft guns, which were set up directly around the slopes. In addition, there were construction crews, flight technicians and staff, so that a total of about 4,110 soldiers of various units defended the airfields. Vice- Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, commander of First Air Fleet, was headquartered in Manila, but was on Tinian on an inspection tour when the invasion started. Kakuta exercised no command authority over the army troops on the island, and also the naval troops were not subject to his direct command. The US naval bombardment commenced on 16 July, with three battleships, five cruisers and sixteen destroyers. The battleship and the destroyer were both hit by 150mm Japanese shore batteries. Colorado was hit 22 times, killing 43 men and wounding 198. Norman Scott was hit six times, killing the captain, Seymore Owens, and 18 of his seamen, plus wounding 47. Battle The 4th Marine Division landed on 24 July 1944, supported by naval bombardment and marine artillery firing across the strait from Saipan. With the help of Seabee ingenuity the Marines were able to land along the Northwest coast with its two small beaches and low coral. .https://seabeemuseum.wordpress.com/tag/doodlebug/ The rest of the island had coral cliffs up to 15 feet in height at the water's edge negating any assault plans. Commodore Paul J. Halloran (CEC) CB theater commander provided drawings of a conceptual landing ramp for the 18th and 121st CBs to fabricate. They mounted steel beams salvaged from Saipan's abandoned sugar mill on LVT-2s to create portable assault ramps. If they worked they would allow the Marines to outflank Tinian's prepared defenses. General Harry Schmidt was skeptical and ordered that the ramps be put through a 100-vehicle use test. The Seabee creation was named a Doodlebug. It worked exactly as the Marines had hoped.The Doodlebug, Naval History and Heritage Command, U.S. Navy Seabee Museum webpage, Port Hueneme, Ca, A successful feint for the major settlement of Tinian Town diverted defenders from the actual landing site on the north of the island. The feint withstood a series of night counterattacks supported by tanks, and the 2nd Marine Division landed the next day. thumb One of the \\"Satan\\" M3 Stuarts brought over from Saipan. Another piece of Seabee handiwork was brought across from Saipan: the 24 \\"Satan\\" mechanized flamethrowers that General Holland Smith USMC had requested from the Army's CWS Flame Tank Group in Hawaii. The terrain on Tinian was much more conducive to their use than Saipan.The Fires of Hell, Tank Encyclopedia online, Mark Nash, 2018, tanks- encyclopedia.com Saipan and Tinian served as a training grounds for the tank crews and proving grounds for the Corps. The weather worsened on 28 July, damaging the pontoon causeways, and interrupting the unloading of supplies. By 29 July, the Americans had captured half the island, and on 30 July, the 4th Marine Division occupied Tinian Town and Airfield No. 4. Japanese remnants made a final stand in the caves and ravines of a limestone ridge on the south portion of the island, making probes and counterattacks into the Marine line. Resistance continued through 3 August, with some civilians murdered by the Japanese. Aftermath By 10 August 1944, 13,000 Japanese civilians were interned, but up to 4,000 were dead through suicide, murdered by Japanese troops, or killed in combat. The garrison on Aguijan Island off the southwest cape of Tinian, commanded by Lieutenant Kinichi Yamada, held out until the end of the war, surrendering on 4 September 1945. The last holdout on Tinian, Murata Susumu, was captured in 1953. After the battle, Tinian became an important base for further Allied operations in the Pacific campaign. Camps were built for 50,000 troops. Fifteen thousand Seabees turned the island into the busiest airfield of the war, with six runways for attacks by United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers on enemy targets in the Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands, and mainland Japan, including the March 9/10 1945 Operation Meetinghouse firebombing of Tokyo and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. North Field was built over Airfields No. 1 and 3, and became operational in February 1945, while West Field was built over Airfield No. 2, and became operational in March 1945. Four 1,000-bed hospitals (110,111,112,113) were planned and located in preparation for the invasion of Japan. None were actually built, as the Japanese surrendered after the atomic bombs were dropped, which thus ended the need for the hospitals.

Boarfish (SS-327) was laid down on 12 August 1943; launched on 21 May 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn., sponsored by Miss Barbara Walsh, daughter of Senator Arthur Walsh of New Jersey; and commissioned on 23 September 1944, Commander Royce L. Gross in command.  World War II  Following shakedown training off the coast of New England, the submarine departed New London, Conn. on 29 October 1944 for Panama. After a week of intensive training in Panamanian waters, Boarfish transited the Panama Canal on 21 November and set out for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 2 December. Another three weeks of training in Hawaii followed, and then Boarfish stood out of Pearl Harbor on 24 December bound for the western Pacific. She refueled and took on provisions at Saipan before embarking upon her first war patrol on 5 January 1945. Boarfish sailed to the South China Sea to patrol the coast of French Indochina. Early on 21 January, the submarine's radar picked up a small convoy of five or six small ships. Boarfish closed the convoy three times in three hours, firing 16 torpedoes, all of which apparently passed under the targets. She broke off the attack at daybreak and did not regain contact. On 31 January, the boat made another radar contact on two cargo ships under escort. During Boarfish's initial approach, an escort sighted the submarine and chased her away. The boat then fired her torpedoes at periscope depth and scored hits on both ships. When Boarfish submerged to avoid the escorts, she left Enki Maru (6,968 tons) sinking and Taietsu Maru (6,890 tons) burning fiercely and beached nearby. Even while avoiding depth charges, Boarfish tried to close the beach to finish the job. She abandoned the attempt after 36 hours because fire had so ravaged the cargo ship that she seemed unsalvageable. Taietsu Maru was destroyed completely by American planes of the 14th Air Force later that same day, and Boarfish received partial credit for the sinking. The submarine ended her first patrol on 15 February when she pulled into Fremantle, Australia, for refit alongside submarine tender . The submarine's second patrol began on 11 March 1945 when she departed Fremantle for a second tour of duty in the South China Sea. Although she encountered and attacked two small convoys, their alert escorts foiled both attacks. Boarfish successfully carried out two reconnaissance missions along the east coast of French Indochina before ending her patrol in Subic Bay on 21 April. After refit alongside , Boarfish left Subic Bay on 16 May for the Java Sea. Her first action came when she sighted a small two-masted junk on 27 May. A boarding party searched the junk for arms, contraband, and Japanese, but found nothing, and the junk was allowed to proceed. Two days later, a small convoy of three ships accompanied by two escorts crossed Boarfish's path. She launched four torpedoes at the lead ship before losing firing position. Her crew heard an explosion; but, when the officer at the conn peered through her periscope, he saw a charging escort instead of a sinking ship. The submarine dived, intending to put of the charted at that location between her and the escort. At , the submarine grounded, knocking off her sound gear and making enough noise to betray her position easily. Eight depth charges followed as Boarfish tried to free herself. Despite damage to her port propeller, the submarine backed off the seamount and eased up to to escape. The damage sustained in the grounding was severe enough to force an early return to Fremantle, where she arrived on 8 June. After repair and refit alongside , she departed on 5 July for her fourth war patrol. Operating in a coordinated attack group Boarfish, , and covered the Java Sea off Java and the north coast of Bali. They made no surface contacts but encountered a number of enemy planes, one of which depth-bombed Boarfish on 8 July. On the 29th, Boarfish performed lifeguard duties during an Allied air strike on Singapore, and she remained off the Malay coast patrolling until 6 August, when she set course for Subic Bay. The submarine pulled alongside for refit on 10 August and was there when the Japanese capitulation was announced.  1945‚Äì1948  Boarfish sailed from Subic Bay on 30 August in company with Howard W. Gilmore and 17 submarines. She parted company with them on 5 September and put into Apra Harbor, Guam, where she remained until 17 November training in postwar maneuvers and drills. She got underway on 17 November and set course via Pearl Harbor for San Diego, Calif. where she arrived early in February 1946. Boarfish operated out of San Diego in local training exercises until 9 September, when she got underway for a tour in the western Pacific. After a brief stopover in Pearl Harbor, the submarine got underway on 1 October for a tour that included visits to Midway Island; Marcus Island; Okinawa; Tsingtao, China; and Guam. She began her return cruise to San Diego on 11 November and, upon her arrival, resumed local operations. Boarfish remained in the San Diego area until 15 November 1947 except for one cruise to Pearl Harbor in February 1947 and another to Alaska and Canada between July and November. Commensing 30 July 1947 Boarfish was the flagship of the first exploration under the Polar Ice Cap in the Bering Strait, this mission designated as Task Group 17.3 Operation Blue Nose under the command of R. Adm. Allan Rockwell McCann for the purpose of testing the under-ice use of Sonar, developed by Dr. Waldo K. Lyon, director of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory, who was also aboard. On 15 November, the submarine entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul before transfer to the Turkish Navy. She left Mare Island on 21 February 1948 and steamed via San Diego, Panama, New London, Malta, and Port Argostoli, Greece, to Izmir, Turkey. On 23 May, Boarfish was decommissioned and immediately recommissioned in the Turkish Navy as TCG Sakarya (S 332), the second submarine named in honor of the 1921 Battle of Sakarya.DANFS gives her name as Gur. Boarfish was struck from the Naval Register on 20 May 1948, and transferred (sold) to Turkey under terms of the Security Assistance Program, 23 August 1948. She was returned to US custody for scrapping, 1 January 1974. Boarfish received one battle star for her service in World War II.

The minerals which compose the rocks are dissolved and new mineral formations are deposited in their place. Dissolution and deposition occur simultaneously and the rock remains solid. Synonyms to the word metasomatism are metasomatose and metasomatic process. The word metasomatose can also be used as a name for specific varieties of metasomatism (for example Mg-metasomatose and Na- metasomatose). Metasomatism can occur via the action of hydrothermal fluids from an igneous or metamorphic source. Metasomatic albite + hornblende + tourmaline alteration of metamorphosed granite, Stone Mountain, Atlanta In the igneous environment, metasomatism creates skarns, greisen, and may affect hornfels in the contact metamorphic aureole adjacent to an intrusive rock mass. In the metamorphic environment, metasomatism is created by mass transfer from a volume of metamorphic rock at higher stress and temperature into a zone with lower stress and temperature, with metamorphic hydrothermal solutions acting as a solvent. This can be envisaged as the metamorphic rocks within the deep crust losing fluids and dissolved mineral components as hydrous minerals break down, with this fluid percolating up into the shallow levels of the crust to chemically change and alter these rocks. This mechanism implies that metasomatism is open system behaviour, which is different from classical metamorphism which is the in-situ mineralogical change of a rock without appreciable change in the chemistry of the rock. Because metamorphism usually requires water in order to facilitate metamorphic reactions, metamorphism nearly always occurs with metasomatism. Further, because metasomatism is a mass transfer process, it is not restricted to the rocks which are changed by addition of chemical elements and minerals or hydrous compounds. In all cases, to produce a metasomatic rock some other rock is also metasomatised, if only by dehydration reactions with minimal chemical change. This is best illustrated by gold ore deposits which are the product of focused concentration of fluids derived from many cubic kilometres of dehydrated crust into thin, often highly metasomatised and altered shear zones and lodes. The source region is often largely chemically unaffected compared to the highly hydrated, altered shear zones, but both must have undergone complementary metasomatism. Metasomatism is more complicated in the Earth's mantle, because the composition of peridotite at high temperatures can be changed by infiltration of carbonate and silicate melts and by carbon dioxide-rich and water-rich fluids, as discussed by Luth (2003). Metasomatism is thought to be particularly important in changing the composition of mantle peridotite below island arcs as water is driven out of ocean lithosphere during subduction. Metasomatism has also been considered critical for enriching source regions of some silica-undersaturated magmas. Carbonatite melts are often considered to have been responsible for enrichment of mantle peridotite in incompatible elements. Types of metasomatites Metasomatic rocks can be extremely varied. Often, metasomatised rocks are pervasively but weakly altered, such that the only evidence of alteration is bleaching, change in colour or change in the crystallinity of micaceous minerals. In such cases, characterising alteration often requires microscope investigation of the mineral assemblage of the rocks to characterise the minerals, any additional mineral growth, changes in protolith minerals, and so on. In some cases, geochemical evidence can be found of metasomatic alteration processes. This is usually in the form of mobile, soluble elements such as barium, strontium, rubidium, calcium and some rare earth elements. However, to characterise the alteration properly, it is necessary to compare altered with unaltered samples. When the process becomes extremely advanced, typical metasomatites can include: * Chlorite or mica whole-rock replacement in shear zones, resulting in rocks in which the existing mineralogy has been completely recrystallised and replaced by hydrated minerals such as chlorite, muscovite, and serpentine. * Skarn and skarnoid rock types, typically adjacent to granite intrusions and adjacent to reactive lithologies such as limestone, marl and banded iron formation. * Greisen deposits within granite margins and cupolas. * Rodingite typical of ophiolites partiuarly serpentised mafic dykes in an ultramafic sequence, containing grossular-andradite garnet and calcic pyroxene; vesuvianite, epidote and scapolite. * Fenite, as a variant of metasomatism associated with strongly alkaline or carbonatitic magmatism introducing a variety of feldspars, sodic pyroxenes or amphiboles and often unusual minerals (such as chevkinite or columbite) comprising ordinarily incompatible elements that do not readily become incorporated into a crystal lattice i.e. niobium, zirconium Effects of metasomatism in mantle peridotite can be either modal or cryptic. In cryptic metasomatism, mineral compositions are changed, or introduced elements are concentrated on grain boundaries and the peridotite mineralogy appears unchanged. In modal metasomatism, new minerals are formed. Cryptic metasomatism may be caused as rising or percolating melts interact with surrounding peridotite, and compositions of both melts and peridotite are changed. At high mantle temperatures, solid-state diffusion can also be effective in changing rock compositions over tens of centimeters adjacent to melt conduits: gradients in mineral composition adjacent to pyroxenite dikes may preserve evidence of the process. Modal metasomatism may result in formation of amphibole and phlogopite, and the presence of these minerals in peridotite xenoliths has been considered strong evidence of metasomatic processes in the mantle. Formation of minerals less common in peridotite, such as dolomite, calcite, ilmenite, rutile, and armalcolite, is also attributed to melt or fluid metasomatism. Alteration assemblages Investigation of altered rocks in hydrothermal ore deposits has highlighted several ubiquitous types of alteration assemblages which create distinct groups of metasomatic alteration effects, textures and mineral assemblages. * Propylitic alteration is caused by iron and sulfur-bearing hydrothermal fluids, and typically results in epidote-chlorite-pyrite alteration, often with hematite and magnetite facies. * Albite-epidote alteration is caused by silica-bearing fluids rich in sodium and calcium, and typically results in weak albite- silica-epidote. * Potassic alteration, typical of porphyry copper and lode gold deposits, results in production of micaceous, potassic minerals such as biotite in iron-rich rocks, muscovite mica or sericite in felsic rocks, and orthoclase (adularia) alteration, often quite pervasive and producing distinct salmon-pink alteration vein selvages. *Quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration, in which these minerals can be deposited both in veins and in a disseminated manner; sericite in particular replaces plagioclase and biotite. This is common in porphyry copper and porphyry molybdenum deposits. *Argillic alteration, commonly present in the distal areas of porphyry deposits, is a low-temperature assemblage that converts feldspars and some other minerals into clay minerals such as kaolinite and illite. It can overprint older, higher-temperature alteration assemblages.Taylor, R.D., Hammarstrom, J.M., Piatak, N.M., and Seal II, R.R., 2012, Arc-related porphyry molybdenum deposit model: Chapter D in Mineral deposit models for resource assessment: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report USGS Numbered Series 2010-5070-D, http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sir20105070D Rarer types of hydrothermal fluids may include highly carbonic fluids, resulting in advanced carbonation reactions of the host rock typical of calc-silicates, and silica- hematite fluids resulting in production of jasperoids, manto ore deposits and pervasive zones of silicification, typically in dolomite strata. Stressed minerals and country rocks of granitic plutons are replaced by porphyroblasts of orthoclase and quartz, in the Papoose Flat quartz monzonites.Dickson, F.

Featuring members of Los Crudos, Hail Mary, Devoid of Faith, By The Throat, and Kill the Man Who Questions, the band plays short, fast hardcore music, and covers themes concerning the gay community in their live performances and lyrics. They identify as part of the \\"queercore\\" punk subculture: referring to their style of music, the band declared in Frontiers magazine, \\"We put the 'core' back in 'Queercore'\\". The band are featured on the cover of My Brain Hurts, Liz Baillie's comic about queer teenagers in New York City. The singer, Martin, living in Chicago at the time and Mark, the original guitarist living in Albany, New York came up with the idea for the band. They then asked the bassist Andrew and original drummer Scott who were living in Philadelphia to join up for a first practice which was held in Philadelphia in late 1998. After a few weekends of practice, a first gig was set up in Philadelphia at Stalag 13 on June 13, 1999. The members have never all lived in the same city and thus play infrequently, except for an occasional tour. Background Their first recording was the self-released demo Don't Knock It Till You Try It. This was followed by a single called \\"What‚Äôs Up With The Kids\\" and then the self-titled LP Limp Wrist. However, since band members lived in different states maintaining the group became difficult. After an interlude they resumed touring in 2004 and released a new CD, Complete Discography the same year. The song \\"Ode\\" from this recording pays tribute to pioneering gay hardcore musicians Gary Floyd of The Dicks, Randy Turner of Big Boys and Joshua Plague of Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet, No Lord Shall Live, providing a historical context for Limp Wrist. The band's best known song was \\"I Love Hardcore Boys, I Love Boys Hardcore\\", which received much attention from fans and press alike. Lead singer Martin Sorrondeguy appears in Queercore: A Punk- u-mentary by Scott Treleaven and addresses the issue implicit in these song titles. In 2002, Maximum RockNRoll featured Martin Sorrondeguy in its \\"QueerPunk\\" issue, in discussion with Gary Fembot and Iraya Robles of Sta- Prest, and Aaron Detroit of The Little Deaths. In 1999, Sorrondeguy released his own documentary film, Beyond The Screams: A U.S. Latino Hardcore Punk Documentary. He had begun the film while still a member of his former band Los Crudos. In 2006, Limp Wrist released the split label 7\\", \\"Want Us Dead\\" on Cheap Art/Lengua Armada. In 2009, the band also self-released a 7-song 12\\" record in the US.

Background Guam, at 212 square miles (543 square kilometers), is the largest island of the Marianas, with a length of 32 miles (52 km) and a width ranging from 12 miles (19.31 km) to four miles (6.44 km) at different points of the island. It had been a United States possession since its capture from Spain in 1898 until it was captured by the Japanese on 10 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Japanese occupation of Guam, it was not as heavily fortified as the other Mariana Islands such as Saipan that had been Japanese possessions since the end of World War I. But by 1944, Guam had a large Japanese garrison. The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas, Operation Forager, called for heavy preliminary bombardment, first by carrier aircraft and USAAF bombers based in the Marshall Islands to the east, then once air superiority was gained, close bombardment by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Saipan, Tinian, and Guam were chosen as the targets due to their size and suitability as a base for supporting the next stage of operations toward the Philippines, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. The seaport at Apra Harbor was suitable for the largest ships; and air bases for Boeing B-29 Superfortresses could be built from which to bomb Japan. B-24 Liberators from the Marianas could also bomb Iwo Jima and the Bonin Islands, such as Chichi Jima. The invasion of Saipan was scheduled for 15 June 1944, with landings on Guam tentatively set for 18 June. The original timetable was optimistic, however. A large Japanese carrier attack and stubborn resistance by the unexpectedly large Japanese garrison on Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being postponed for a month. U.S. naval and air bombardments lasted from 11‚Äì13 June 1944, involving 216 carrier aircraft and land-based B-24 bombers from the Marshall Islands. On 12 and 13 June, 12 Japanese cargo ships and several fishing vessels were sunk. On 27 June, U.S. Navy battleships and cruisers started shelling the island, joined by a U.S. carrier group on 4 July, and two more on 6 July. Opposing forces United States US Fifth Fleet (Vice Adm.

Map showing the progress of the Guam campaign Before landing, US forces sought to ensure both air and naval superiority. A total of 274 ships, which fired 44,978 shots from 2-inch and 5-inch guns supported the landing. In addition, a total of 13 aircraft carriers participated in the air raid and a total of 4,283 bombs (weighing a total of 1,310 tons) were dropped from 18 to 20 July, the day before disembarkation. The heavy bombardment burned all the palm trees on the beach and destroyed every building that could be seen. Experience gained by the Japanese from the invasion of Saipan was used to try to mitigate the effects of the bombardment. Despite this, the bombardment far exceeded the expectations of the defending forces which were dug in along the coast as they were on Saipan. Many of the bases and guard towers were also destroyed. However, artillery pieces entrenched in dense forests, caves, trenches and locations four kilometers or more from the coast were able to escape destruction and became a source of heavy Japanese resistance. Guam, ringed by reefs, cliffs, and heavy surf, presents a formidable challenge for any attacker. Underwater demolition teams reconnoitered the beaches and removed obstacles from 14‚Äì17 July. Despite the obstacles, on 21 July, the American forces landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam, planning to secure Apra Harbor. The 3rd Marine Division landed near Agana to the north of Orote at 08:29, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near Agat to the south. Japanese artillery sank 30 U.S. LVTs and inflicted heavy casualties on the landing troops, especially of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, but by 09:00 marines and tanks were ashore at both beaches. By nightfall, the U.S. Marines, and soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division had established beachheads about deep.Gailey (1988), pp.90‚Äì112. Japanese counterattacks were made throughout the first few days of the battle, mostly at night, using infiltration tactics. The Japanese penetrated the American defenses several times but were driven back with heavy losses of men and equipment. The U.S. Army's 77th Infantry Division had a more difficult landing on 23‚Äì24 July. Lacking amphibious vehicles, they had to wade ashore from the edge of the reef where the landing craft dropped them off. The men stationed in the two beachheads were pinned down by heavy Japanese fire, making initial progress inland quite slow. Supply was very difficult for the landing troops on Guam in the first days of the battle. Landing ships could not come closer than the reef, several hundred yards from the beach and amphibious vehicles were scarce. The 1st Provisional Brigade blocked off the Orote Peninsula on 25 July, and that same night Japanese Lt. General Takashina counterattacked, coordinated with a similar attack against the 3rd Division to the north. The next day, General Obata reported, \\"our forces failed to achieve the desired objectives.\\" Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on 28 July, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the Japanese defenders. On 28 July, the two beachheads were linked, and by 29 July, the Americans secured the peninsula. The Japanese counterattacks against the American beachheads, as well as the fierce fighting, had exhausted the Japanese. At the start of August, they were running out of food and ammunition, and they had only a handful of tanks left. Obata withdrew his troops from southern Guam, planning to make a stand in the mountainous central and northern part of the island, \\"to engage in delaying action in the jungle in northern Guam to hold the island as long as possible\\". After ensuring that no significant Japanese forces operated in the southern portion of Guam, Marine Major General Geiger started an offensive north with the 3rd Marine Division on the left flank, and the 77th Infantry Division on the right, liberating Agana on the same day. The Tiyan Airfield was captured on 1 Aug. Rain and thick jungle made conditions difficult for the Americans, but after an engagement with the main Japanese line of defense around Mount Barrigada from 2‚Äì4 August, the Japanese line collapsed. The 1st Provisional Brigade formed up on the left flank of the 3rd Marine Division on 7 August because of the widening front and continued casualties, in an effort to prevent the Japanese from slipping through the American gaps. The Japanese had another stronghold at Mount Santa Rosa, which was secured on 8 August. On 10 August, organized Japanese resistance ended, and Guam was declared secure, but 7,500 Japanese soldiers were estimated to be at large. The next day, Obata committed ritual suicide at his headquarters on Mount Mataguac after he had sent a farewell message to Japan. Aftermath U.S. Marines show their appreciation to the Coast Guard. Three Marine officers of an amphibian tractor battalion who took part in the invasion of Guam (left to right): Major Erwin F. Wann, Major W. W. Butler, and Lt. Colonel Sylvester Stephens A few Japanese soldiers held out in the jungle after the fighting on Guam. On 8 December 1945, three U.S. Marines were ambushed and killed. On 24 January 1972, Japanese Army Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi was discovered by hunters on the island. He had lived alone in a cave for 28 years, near Talofofo Falls. Guam was turned into a base for Allied operations after the battle. 5 large airfields were built by the Navy Seabees and African American Aviation Engineering Battalions. Army Air Forces B-29 bombers flew from Northwest Field and North Field on Guam to attack targets in the Western Pacific and on mainland Japan.

PK-232MBX, circa 1991. A terminal node controller (TNC) is a device used by amateur radio operators to participate in AX.25 packet radio networks. It is similar in function to the Packet Assembler/Disassemblers used on X.25 networks, with the addition of a modem to convert baseband digital signals to audio tones. Amateur Radio TNCs were first developed around 1978, in Canada, by the Montreal Amateur Radio Club and the Vancouver Area Digital Communications group. These never gained much popularity because only a bare printed circuit board was made available and builders had to gather up a large number of components. In 1983 the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR) association produced complete kits for their TNC-1 design, This was later available as the Heathkit HD-4040. A few years later, the improved TNC-2 became available and it was licensed to commercial manufacturers such as MFJ.  Description  The Kantronics 9612+ was implemented around an 8-bit Motorola microcontroller. A typical model consists of a microprocessor, a modem, and software (in EPROM) that implements the AX.25 protocol and provides a command line interface to the user. (Commonly, this software provides other functionality as well, such as a basic bulletin board system to receive messages while the operator is away.) Because the TNC contains all the intelligence needed to communicate over an AX.25 network, no external computer is required. All of the network's resources can be accessed using a dumb terminal. The TNC connects to the terminal and a radio transceiver. Data from the terminal is formatted into AX.25 packets and modulated into audio signals (in traditional applications) for transmission by the radio. Received signals are demodulated, the data unformatted, and the output sent to the terminal for display. In addition to these functions, the TNC manages the radio channel according to guidelines in the AX.25 specification. Early usage was mostly one-to-one communication, either between two people, or a person to an automated Bulletin Board / E-mail system.  Current status  Since the late 1990s, most AX.25 usage has shifted to a different one-to-many communication paradigm with the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). The TNCs, of the 1980s and 1990s, were complete solutions that only needed a radio and an optional dumb terminal. As home computers made their way into ham \\"shacks,\\" there was a movement to simpler cheaper \\"KISS\\" (keep it simple stupid) devices. These have a modem and minimal processing of the AX.25 protocol. Most of the processing is moved to the personal computer. The next logical step, in the evolution, is to eliminate the specialized hardware and move all of the processing to a computer. A \\"soundcard\\" is used for audio to and from the radio. Everything else is done in software. Some of the earlier attempts performed poorly, giving this approach a bad reputation. Modern software TNCs, using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, can successfully decode poor quality signals that the older equipment can't. Some handheld and mobile VHF radios currently on the market incorporate TNC abilities within the radio itself in support of the APRS protocol. Many TNCs are still in use, especially in unattended stations where reliability is important. The importance of location to the APRS system has fueled development of a new generation of small low-power TNCs often integrated with a GPS module for use in mobile tracking stations. APRS digipeating protocols require specific naming conventions, and older TNCs may not have the required support to be used as a digipeater. However, almost any TNC can be pressed into service for Home or Tracker use. TNCs that were clones of the popular TAPR TNC-2 may be upgradeable via the UIDIGI firmware project. TNC/Radio data ports Although typically described as data ports, the interface between a radio and a TNC is almost entirely analog audio (plus lines for PTT and squelch). The connectors used for this purpose varies widely across TNC manufacturers, but modern radios that offer data ports have widely adopted the Mini-DIN 6-pin connector. Also used are full-size DIN connectors, modular telephone (RJ) connectors, and combinations of mini- and micro- headphone connectors (typically on handheld radios). * 6-pin Mini-DIN  Terminal data port  TNCs were originally designed to accept messages from a human typing on a dumb terminal and had a DB-25 or DE-9 connector carrying asynchronous start-stop bytes with RS-232 signal levels. This could also be used with the serial port of a personal computer. Serial ports are now pretty much extinct but USB-to-serial converter cables are available. Modern Software TNCs provide TCP/IP interfaces which can be accessed across computer networks. For example, you might be running a software TNC on a Raspberry Pi, near the radio, and access it from a laptop computer in another location. Software TNCs also provide \\"pseudo terminals\\" so they can be used with old applications that only know how to use serial ports.

This battle was part of a larger offensive campaign known as Operation Forager which ran from June 1944 to November 1944 in the Pacific Theater of Operations, and Operation Stalemate II in particular.Moran, J. and Rottman, G.L., 2002, Peleliu 1944, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., Background Angaur is a tiny limestone island, just long, separated from Peleliu by a strait, from which phosphate was mined. In mid-1944, the Japanese had 1,400 troops on the island, under the overall command of Palau Sector Group commander Lieutenant General Sadae Inoue and under the direct command of Major Goto who was stationed on the island. The weak defenses of the Palaus and the potential for airfield construction made them attractive targets for the Americans after the capture of the Marshall Islands, but a shortage of landing craft meant that operations against the Palaus could not begin until the Mariana Islands were secure. Once the assault on Peleliu was \\"well in hand\\", the 322nd Regimental combat team (RCT) would land on the northern Beach Red, and the 321st RCT on the eastern Beach Blue, both of the 81st Infantry Division. Battle Bombardment of Angaur by the battleship , four cruisers, and forty Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the aircraft carrier began on 11 September 1944. Six days later on 17 September, the U.S. 81st Infantry Division‚Äîcommanded by Major General Paul J. Mueller‚Äîlanded on the northeast and southeast coasts. Both RCTs were counterattacked during the night. Both RCTs linked up the next day. By the end of the third day, 19 Sept., the main area of Japanese resistance was to the northeast around Romauldo Hill, so the 323rd RCT was sent to Ulithi. Resistance stiffened as the Americans advanced on \\"the Bowl\\", a hill near Lake Salome in the northwest of the island where the Japanese planned to make their last stand, after the rest of Angaur and Saipan town were taken. There was another small position where the Japanese had about 400 soldiers in a defense at the southeast corner of the island, around Beach Green, that was neutralized on September 20 after 2 days of harsh fighting and about 300 U.S. casualties. From 20 September, the 322nd Infantry Regiment repeatedly attacked the Bowl, but the 750 defenders repulsed them with artillery, mortars, grenades and machine guns. Gradually, hunger, thirst, and American shellfire and bombing took their toll on the Japanese, and by 25 September the Americans had penetrated the Bowl. Rather than fight for possession of the caves, they used bulldozers to seal the entrances. By 30 September, the island was said to be secure although the Japanese still had about 300 more soldiers in the Bowl and surrounding areas that held out for almost four more weeks. Toward the end of the first week of October, 1944, the protracted conflict had degenerated into minor patrol action with sniping, ambushing, and extensive booby-trapping employed by both sides.SSgt Edwin \\"Ed\\" C Rowold, USMC was killed on Angaur, Palau on 5 Oct 1944.

The last day of fighting was October 22 with a total of 36 days of fighting and blasting the Japanese resistance from their caves with explosives, tanks, artillery and flamethrowers. The 81 Infantry Division had finally taken the whole of Angaur. Aftermath Airfields were being constructed as the battle was still being fought, but the delay in the start of the Palaus operation meant that the airfields were not ready in time for the start of the Philippines operations in October 1944. Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. had argued before the invasion of the Palaus that the operation was unnecessary, and military historians have agreed with him, suggesting that the main benefit was the combat experience gained by the 81st Infantry Division. During the fighting, Seabees created an airstrip that would house B 24 Liberator bombers of the 494th Bomb Group, 7th Air Force. The group engaged in frequent bombings of the Philippines and other Palau Islands. The 81st Division moved on directly to the battle on Peleliu Island to aid the 1st Marine Division, which had encountered extremely stiff resistance in the central highland of that island. They would remain on Peleliu for another month taking the island and mopping-up.

It was situated in the northern dock system in Bootle. It connected to Gladstone Dock to the north and Alexandra Dock to the south and encompassed a sloping quayside. History Northern docks of Liverpool The dock was built by George Fosbery Lyster between 1880-3. Opened in 1884, Hornby Dock marked the completion of Liverpool dock system's period of expansion in the nineteenth century. The dock was named after Thomas Dyson Hornby, chairman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board between 1876 and 1889, and was used by the timber trade during its early years. The dock had a lighthouse which, because of its foghorn, was known as the Bootle Bull. The lighthouse was demolished in 1928, being replaced by one built north of Gladstone Dock. In 1940, during World War II, the Hornby River Entrance was bombed and very badly damaged, which restricted use of the dock throughout the war. The dock was still receiving significant traffic by 1992, mainly in the form of general cargo and containers, with new quayside sheds being built. Present Apart from an access channel along the river wall, the dock has been filled in to provide additional space for the coal terminal at Gladstone Dock.

C, p. 287 ‚Äì 15 April 1814) was the second Prince Lichnowsky and a chamberlain at the Imperial Austrian court. He is remembered for his patronage of music and his relationships with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. Life Lichnowsky was born in Vienna the eldest son of Count Johann Carl Gottlieb von Lichnowsky and his wife, Countess Carolina von Althann. Although Lichnowsky spent most of his time in Vienna, it was actually in Prussia that he held the title of prince, while his estates were located in Gr√§tz, then in the Silesian province that Prussia had conquered from Austria earlier in the century. The location is today called Hradec nad Moravic√≠ and is within the borders of the Czech Republic.Clive 2001, 205 In his youth (1776 to 1782) he was a law student, studying in Leipzig and in G√∂ttingen. While in G√∂ttingen he met Johann Nikolaus Forkel, who later was to become famous for writing the first biography of J. S. Bach. Lichnowsky at the time began to collect works by Bach in manuscript copies.Grove He also was a musician and a composer. Lichnowsky was married (1788) to the former Maria Christiane Imperial Countess von Thun und Hohenstein, the \\"beautiful\\" (according to Otto Erich Deutsch) daughter of Imperial Countess Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein n√©e Imperial Countess von Uhlfeldt, and of Imperial Count Franz Josef Anton von Thun und Hohenstein (born 1734), who later became an Imperial Chamberlain. Lichnowsky's father-in-law had sympathy for Friedrich Christoph Oetinger's theosophy and for astromechanics: Count Josef Anton von Thun und Hohenstein was hereby a customer of Philipp Matth√§us Hahn. He ordered as his uncle Josef Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen an astronomic machine constructed by Hahn (former pastor in Onstmettingen near Hechingen) and produced by Philipp Gottfried Schaudt, head teacher in Onstmettingen.

For details of the trip, see Mozart's Berlin journey. He also lent Mozart money, which Mozart was unable to repay. This led the Prince to sue Mozart, and on 9 November 1791, a few weeks before Mozart died, the Lower Austria Court (Landrechte) decided the case in favor of the Prince, ruling that Mozart owed him the sum of 1,435 florins and 32 kreutzer, a substantial amount. The court issued an order to the chamber of the Imperial court (Mozart's employer) to attach half of Mozart's salary of 800 florins per year. The evidence of the lawsuit was uncovered (by Otto Mraz) only in 1991, and hence is not discussed in earlier Mozart biographies. Relationship with Beethoven Lichnowsky was one of the most significant aristocratic supporters of Beethoven. In an 1805 letter the composer called him \\"one of my most loyal friends and promoters of my art.\\" In 1796, the Prince traveled to Prague, this time taking Beethoven with him. The composer was on his way to Berlin. In 1800, Lichnowsky gave Beethoven an annual allowance of 600 florins until such time as he found a regular appointment as a musician. The stipend continued until 1806, when a furious quarrel erupted between the two, terminating their friendship: Beethoven, staying at Lichnowsky's country estate, had refused to play for visiting French officers. Later, arriving home in Vienna, Beethoven smashed a bust of the Prince. Seven of Beethoven's musical compositions, all before 1806, were dedicated to Lichnowsky: *The three piano trios, Opus 1 (1793) *The \\"Nine variations for piano on 'Quant'√® pi√π bello' from Giovanni Paisiello's opera La Molinara\\", for piano solo, WoO 69 (1795)Date from Nosow (1997) *The Piano sonata in C minor, Opus 13, \\"Path√©tique\\" (1798) *The Piano sonata in A flat, Opus 26 (1801) *The Second Symphony (1802) Notes * References Sources *Clive, Peter (2001) Beethoven and his World: A Biographical Dictionary.

It was located atop the New Jersey Palisades lying partly in Cliffside Park and partly in Fort Lee. The park operated from 1898 until 1971, remaining one of the most visited amusement parks in the country until the end of its existence. After the park closed in 1971, a high-rise luxury apartment complex was built on its site. Trolley park era: 1898-1910 The park overlooked the Hudson River on of New Jersey riverfront land. It straddled what is now Cliffside Park and Fort Lee, and facing the northern end of Manhattan. In 1898, before common use of automobiles, the Bergen County Traction Company conceived the park as a trolley park to attract evening and weekend riders. It was originally known as \\"The Park on the Palisades\\". In 1908, the trolley company sold the park to August Neumann and Frank Knox, who hired Alven H. Dexter to manage it. Dexter imported a crude assortment of attractions which included a Ferris wheel, a baby parade, and diving horses. Schenck brothers' ownership: 1910-1934 Main entrance, 1912 By 1908, the park was renamed Palisades Amusement Park, and the new owners began adding amusement rides and attractions. In 1910 the park was purchased by Nicholas and Joseph Schenck and their Realty Trust Company. The Schencks were brothers who were active in the nascent motion picture industry in nearby Fort Lee, as well as operated the Fort George Amusement Park in New York City, across the Hudson River to the east. They renamed the park once again, naming it Schenck Bros. Palisade Park. In 1912 the park added a salt-water swimming pool. It was filled by pumping water from the saline Hudson River, 200 feet (60 m) below. This pool, 400 by 600 feet (120 meters by 180 meters) in surface area, was advertised as the largest salt-water wave pool in the nation. Behind the water falls were huge pontoons that rose up and down as they rotated, creating a one-foot wave in the pool. As the park added more and more attractions, it became so famous by the 1920s that the Borough of Palisades Park, located just west of the amusement park, considered changing its name to avoid confusion among amusement park visitors. In 1928 the park introduced the Cyclone roller coaster, the third of Harry Traver's \\"Terrifying Triplets\\". Due to the high maintenance costs, the ride was removed six years later.  Rosenthal brothers' ownership: 1934-1971  Historic picture of Palisades Amusement Park In 1934 or 1935, Nicholas and Joseph Schenck sold the site for $450,000 to Jack and Irving Rosenthal. The brothers and entrepreneurs had made a fortune as concessionaires at Coney Island in Brooklyn. They also owned some concessions and a carousel at Savin Rock Park in Connecticut. The Rosenthals built the Coney Island Cyclone, a wooden coaster (completely different from the Travers' Triplets), in 1927. In 1935 the park was partially damaged by fire. In 1944, a second fire forced the park to close until the start of the 1945 season. Flight to Mars attractionThe Rosenthals reverted the park's name to the more recognizable Palisades Amusement Park. One of the many attractions, rebuilt and redesigned by construction superintendent Joe McKee, was the Skyrocket roller coaster. The Rosenthals named the newly repaired coaster the \\"Cyclone\\", after their Coney Island coaster. In 1958, Joe built the Wild Mouse roller coaster with his construction foreman Bert Whitworth,. The park's reputation and attendance continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, largely due to saturation advertising and the continued success of the park's music pavilion and Caisson bar erected during that time. During the mid-1950s the park started featuring rock and roll shows hosted by local radio announcers Clay Cole and \\"Cousin Brucie\\" Morrow, and starting during the 1960s, Motown musical acts were performed there. Advertisements for the park were frequently printed in the back pages of 1950s and 1960s comic books. The Rosenthals realized that youths in the New York metropolitan area represented the largest single market for comic books in the nation, and that comic book advertising was a cheap way to reach thousands of potential customers. =Segregation= In 1946, the park formed the Sun and Surf Club and restricted pool access to members only. In the book Palisades Amusement Park: A Century of Fond Memories, the author Vince Gargiulo writes that \\"In reality, the club allowed park officials to discriminate according to the color of the patron's skin\\". He cites an example in July 1946, where eight black and two white people entered the park together; the white people were allowed to purchase tickets while the black people were prohibited from doing so. In response, African Americans started protesting against the Palisades Amusement Park pool's segregation policy; some protesters held signs that stated \\"Protest Jim Crow\\". On July 13, 1947, Melba Valle, a 22-year-old African-American woman, tried to use a pool admission ticket from a Caucasian friend, but was not allowed to enter the pool. Valle was then \\"'forcibly dragged and ejected' from the Park\\", as described in several newspapers; as a result, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) started protesting at the Palisades Amusement Park entrance. Even though police detained 11 CORE members, the group stated that they would protest at the park entrance on Sundays, and would only stop their protests when the pool started allowing African Americans. The protesters handed out the following flyer in 1947, which is now on exhibit in the Fort Lee Museum. The policy was dropped by the 1950s. =\\"Palisades Park\\" song and boom in popularity= In 1962, Chuck Barris composed and Freddy Cannon recorded a song about the park entitled \\"Palisades Park\\". The song was an up-tempo rock and roll tune initiated by a distinctive organ part. The song also incorporated amusement park sound effects. \\"Palisades Park\\" received nationwide radioplay and increased the park's fame even more. The \\"Palisades Park\\" song generated a surge of park visitors. Palisades Amusement Park ride ticket Third Degree attraction There was a hole in the fence behind the amusement park's music stage, which was used by local children to sneak into the park without paying admission. Although the Rosenthal brothers knew about the hole, they did not repair it. Unlike some modern amusement parks that sell passes to enter the grounds themselves, Palisades Amusement Park also charged individual fees for each ride and attraction inside the park. Irving Rosenthal, who loved children even though he had none of his own, allowed this \\"secret\\" entrance to remain and instructed security personnel to ignore anyone sneaking through it. He felt that children, who had little money to start with, would be more willing to spend their limited funds inside the park if they got in for free. Irving Rosenthal also printed free-admission offers on matchbooks and in other media. He owned an advertising company that put up billboards known as \\"three sheeters\\" all over New York City. Parking was free for the same reasons. However, as the park began attracting bigger and bigger crowds in later years, the on-site parking lot became less and less adequate, often rapidly filling to capacity. An overflow parking lot was opened at the bottom of the cliff in Edgewater, and shuttle buses carried visitors up to the park. The overflow lot sometimes also reached capacity, and when this happened, motorists were directed to park on local streets anywhere between the nearby George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel several miles south. This reduced parking for local residents and businesses, as well as added to street congestion. From 1947 to 1971 Palisades Park averaged 6 million visitors. Peak attendance was reached in 1969 with 10 million visitors.Giordano, Ralph. Social Dancing in America: Lindy Hop to Hip Hop, 1901-2000. Greenwood Press, 2007, page 167 Radio and television commercials broadcast in the greater New York area encouraged the public to, \\"Come on over!\\" They did just that. Demise Three factors contributed to the eventual closing of Palisades Amusement Park: inadequate parking facilities; growing uncertainty about the park's future; and an increase in the number of incidents where visitors got injured or killed. By 1967, Jack Rosenthal had died of Parkinson's disease, leaving his brother Irving as sole owner. Irving, in his 70s, was not expected to manage the park for much longer. Without family heirs, it was unclear as to who would eventually assume ownership. Meanwhile, the park had become so popular that the towns of Cliffside Park and Fort Lee saw increased and worsening congestion from park patrons who did not live in the area. Former site of the amusement park, where high rise condominiums now stand Local residents objected to the traffic jams, litter, changing racial demographics, and other effects of the park's immense popularity. They demanded action from local elected officials. Developers wanted to profit by the Palisades' view of Manhattan, and they successfully pressured the local government to re-zone the amusement park site for high-rise apartment housing and condemn it under eminent domain. During the next few years, the land was surveyed by a number of builders who made lucrative offers, but Rosenthal tried to postpone the park's inevitable closing and refused to sell. During the heyday of \\"Palisades Park\\" in the 1950s and 1960s, Irving would refer to Fort Lee as his town. In January 1971 a Texas developer, Winston-Centex Corporation, acquired the property for $12.5 million and agreed to lease it back to Irving Rosenthal so that Palisades Amusement Park could operate for one final season. The park permanently closed on Sunday, September 12, 1971. After it closed, Morgan \\"Mickey\\" Hughes and Fletch Creamer, Jr. tried to reopen the park for one more season and obtained a lease from Winston-Centex. However, the town of Fort Lee would not issue a business license until the next spring, and even then the town could not guarantee such a license. The buildings were subsequently demolished; the rides sold, dismantled and transported to other amusement operators in the United States and Canada. The towns of Cliffside Park and Fort Lee considered using the park's salt-water swimming pool for municipal recreation, only to find that its filtration system had been damaged beyond repair by vandals. Four high-rise luxury apartment buildings stand on the old park site today. The first two built were Winston Towers. Carlyle Towers followed and then the Royal Buckingham. In 1998, on the centennial of the opening of the original Park on the Palisades, Winston Towers management dedicated a monument to Palisades Amusement Park on its property. The monument is a small park, with the names of the rides inscribed on its bricks, named \\"The Little Park of Memories.\\" In June 2014, five original roller coaster cars from The Cyclone that were \\"gathering dust for decades\\" were returned to Bergen County from Pennsylvania, and were planned to undergo a restoration project, more than 40 years after the park's closing.http://www.northjersey.com/community-news/oh-what-a-ride-it- was-1.1031787?page=all Though the cars are not functional, they were anticipated to be publicly showcased and displayed.

Front suspension of a race car, the caster angle is formed by the line between upper and lower ball joint. chopper with a raked fork at an extreme caster angle. The caster angle or castor angle is the angular displacement of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle, other vehicle or a vessel, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line that runs through the center of the upper ball joint to the center of the lower ball joint) and vertical. In automobile racing, the caster angle may be adjusted to optimize handling characteristics for a particular venue. This is all connected to the front wheels.  History  Arthur Krebs proposed placing the front axle of a car at a positive caster angle in his UK patent of 1896, entitled Improvements in mechanically propelled vehicles. In it he stated it was intended \\"To ensure stability of direction by means of a special arrangement of fore-carriage, that is to say, to re-establish automatically the parallelism of the two axles of the vehicle when there is no tendency to keep them in any other direction, or after a temporary effort has caused them to diverge from said parallelism. [...] The axle of the fore- carriage is situated a suitable distance behind the projection of the axis of the pivot-pin in order to ensure the stability of direction above referred to.\\" Positive caster angle The pivot points of the steering are angled such that a line drawn through them intersects the road surface slightly ahead of the center of the contact patch of the tire on the pavement by a distance called trail. The purpose of this is to provide a degree of self-centering for the steering ‚Äî the wheel casters around in order to trail behind the axis of steering. This makes a vehicle easier to control and improves its directional stability (reducing its tendency to wander). Excessive caster angle will make the steering heavier and less responsive, although in racing large caster angles are used for improving camber gain in cornering. Caster angles over 7 degrees with radial tires are common. Power steering is usually necessary to overcome the jacking effect from the high caster angle. Some front-end alignment calls for different right side and left side caster. This is called cross caster and the difference is called the spread. Cross camber may also be specified, but not usually both. Trail or trailing The steering axis (the red dotted line in the diagram above) does not have to pass through the center of the wheel, so the caster can be set independently of the trail, which is the distance between where the steering axis intersects the ground, in side view, and the point directly below the axle. Caster angle and trail both influence the steering, albeit in different ways: caster tends to add damping, while trail adds 'feel', and returnability. The caster wheel on shopping carts are an extreme case - the system is undamped but stable, as the wheel oscillates around the 'correct' path. The construction has relatively high trail, but no caster, which allows changing of direction with minimal force. In this case the lateral forces at the tire do not act at the center of the contact patch, but at a point behind the center. This distance is called the pneumatic trail and varies with speed, load, steer angle, surface, tire type, tire pressure and time. A good starting point for this is 30 mm behind the center of the contact patch. Front end alignment When the front suspension of a vehicle is aligned, caster is adjusted to achieve a self-centering action in the steering, which affects the vehicle's straight-line stability. Improper caster settings will require the driver to move the steering wheel both into and out of each turn, making it difficult to maintain a straight line. Two- wheeled vehicles In the context of bicycles and motorcycles, caster is more commonly referred to as \\"head angle\\", \\"rake angle\\" or \\"rake and trail\\", especially in American English. The terms caster or castor angle are still predominantly used in British English. Some bicycle constructors refer to the angle subtended by the mechanical trail at the wheel center as caster.http://www.bikeforest.com/CAD/caster_angle.php  See also  * Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics * Camber angle * Toe (automotive) * Trail * Vehicle dynamics * Caster References Category:Automotive steering technologies ","title":"Caster angle"},{"id":"1130003","text":"Paschal Artos, between services during bright Week, in front of opened royal doors.

Depicted on the top of the Artos are either the symbol of Christ's victory over death‚Äîthe Cross, surmounted by a crown of thorns‚Äîor the Resurrection of Christ. The Artos symbolizes the physical presence of the resurrected Christ among the disciples. The priest blesses the Artos with a special prayer and sprinkles it with Holy Water. The Artos is then placed on a small table before the Iconostasis where it remains throughout Bright Week. It is customary, whenever the faithful enter the Temple, for them to kiss the Artos as a way of greeting the Risen Christ. On every day of Bright Week, after the Paschal Divine Liturgy (or, alternatively, after Paschal Matins), the Artos is carried in a solemn procession around the outside of the church. In monasteries, the Artos is carried to the Trapeza every day of Bright Week, where at the end of the festive meal, it is lifted in a ceremony called the Lifting of the Artos. The one performing the ceremony will lift up the Artos (symbolizing Christ's Resurrection) and say, \\"Christ is Risen!\\" All will respond, \\"He is truly Risen!\\" The celebrant will then make the sign of the Cross with the Artos as he says, \\"We worship His Resurrection on the third day!\\" Then two Paschal hymns are sung and everyone comes forward to kiss the Artos and receive the Superior's blessing, as all sing the Paschal troparion many times. On Bright Saturday, after the Divine Liturgy, the priest says another prayer over the Artos and it is then broken and distributed among the whole congregation along with the Antidoron. =Significance= The significance of the artos is that it serves to remind all Christians of the events connected with the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ. While still living on earth, the Lord called Himself the Bread of Life, saying: I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall not hunger, and He who believes in Me shall never thirst (). After His Resurrection, more than once Jesus appeared to His disciples, ate before them and blessed their own food. For example, as evening fell on the first day of His Resurrection, He was recognized in Emmaus by two of His disciples as He blessed and broke bread (). On the 40th day after His Resurrection, the Lord ascended into heaven, and His disciples and followers found comfort in their memories of the Lord: they recalled His every word, His every step and His every action. When they met for common prayer, they would partake of the Body and Blood of Christ, remembering the Last Supper. When they sat down to an ordinary meal, they would leave a place at the head of the table empty for the invisibly present Lord and would lay bread on that place. Remembering this custom of the Apostles, the Fathers of the Church made it their custom to put out the Artos at the Paschal Feast in memory of the appearances of the Risen Lord to His disciples, and also in memory of the fact that the Lord Who suffered and was resurrected for our justification has made Himself the true Bread of Life and is invisibly present in His church always, to the close of the age (). Whereas special Paschal breads, called kulichi are broken and eaten on the first day of Pascha, the Artos is kept whole throughout the whole of Bright Week as a reminder of the presence of the Risen Savior in the midst of those who believe in Him and is only divided and distributed on Saturday. In this way Bright Week begins and ends with the eating of especially baked and blessed bread. The Artos may also be compared to the unleavened bread of the Old Testament, of which ancient Israel, delivered from their captivity in the land of Egypt, ate during the week of the Passover (Ex. 12:15-20). As Cyril, Bishop of Turov, who lived during the 12th Century in Russia, said in a sermon for the Sunday after Pascha: > Even as the Jews bore the unleavened bread upon their heads out of Egypt > through the desert () until they had crossed the Red Sea, after which they > dedicated the bread to God, divided it amongst all their host, and having > all eaten thereof, became...terrible to their enemies, even so do we, saved > by our Resurrected Lord from the captivity of that Pharaoh of the mind, the > Devil, bear forth the blessed bread the Artos from the day of the > Resurrection of Christ and, finally, having dedicated this bread to God, we > eat of it and preserve it to the health of body and soul. It is a custom among Russian Orthodox Christians to this day to keep a portion of the artos throughout the year and with due reverence and faith to eat of it in time of illness or distress. This is eaten, often together with a drink of Holy Water, which had been blessed at the Feast of the Theophany of Our Lord. Artoklasia Loaves prepared for Artoklasia. On feast days towards the end of vespers there is a blessing of loaves, wheat, wine, and oil, whereafter the priest breaks one of the loaves from which action the rite receives its name: Artoklasia, \\"breaking of bread\\". The loaves for the Artoklasia may be sealed (before baking) with a stamp (as are the Prosphora for the Divine Liturgy); such a seal may have an Icon of a saint on it, or it may be a simple cross‚Äîperhaps inscribed with a prayer on it, such as \\"May the Blessing of the Lord be upon us. Amen.\\" See also *Prosphora *Artoklasia Notes and references ;Notes ;References External links *Paschal Artos (Photo) Category:Byzantine Rite Category:Easter food Category:Religious food and drink Category:Eastern Christian liturgical objects ","title":"Artos"},{"id":"1130008","text":"The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, commonly known as the United Steelworkers (USW), is a general trade union with members across North America. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, the United Steelworkers represents workers in Canada, the Caribbean, and the United States. The United Steelworkers represent workers in a diverse range of industries, including primary and fabricated metals, paper, chemicals, glass, rubber, heavy-duty conveyor belting, tires, transportation, utilities, container industries, pharmaceuticals, call centers and health care. The United Steelworkers is currently affiliated with the AFL‚ÄìCIO in the United States and the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) in Canada as well as several international union federations. On July 2, 2008, the United Steelworkers signed an agreement to merge with the United Kingdom and Ireland‚Äìbased union Unite to form a new global union entity called Workers Uniting. The current International President of the United Steelworkers is Tom Conway, who was installed as President after the retirement of Leo Gerard. Rank-and-file members, as well as representatives, of the United Steelworkers refer to themselves, and are most often referred to, as Steelworkers. The use of the capitalized single word Steelworker or Steelworkers, as opposed to the lowercase two-worded steel worker or steel workers, is also an identifier of those who are part of, or affiliated with, the United Steelworkers International Union rather than being general non-union workers within the steel industry. This distinction is important in North America wherein a vast majority of the steel industry is unionized. For example, some of the most recognizable and largest companies in the business such as United States Steel (USS), Servestal, and the largest steel company in the world, ArcelorMittal, with their combined hourly workforces at facilities in North America being Steelworkers and represented by the USW, including the largest facilities on the continent, like US Steel's Gary Works in Gary, Indiana, ArcelorMittal's Burns Harbor in Burns Harbor, Indiana, Indiana Harbor East and West in Northwest Indiana, and Cleveland Plant in Cleveland, Ohio, all of which are situated on the Great Lakes freshwater system. On the other hand, only a handful of smaller companies, usually at facilities known as \\"mini-mills\\", like Nucor Steel and its facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, are non-union shops not represented by the United Steelworkers. Origins and history Five Gateway Center The USW was established May 22, 1942, in Cleveland, Ohio, through the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) by a convention of representatives from the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers and the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, after almost six years of divisive struggles to create a new union of steelworkers. The drive to create this union included such violent incidents as the infamous Memorial Day, 1937, when Chicago policemen supporting the rival American Federation of Labor (AFL) fired on workers outside a Republic Steel mill and killed 10 men.Michael Dennis, Blood on Steel: Chicago Steelworkers and the Strike of 1937 (2014) The founder and first president of the USW, Philip Murray, led the union through its first organizing drives and dangerous first decade, when the workers of USW went on strike several times to win the right to bargain collectively with steel companies. Through collective bargaining they secured higher wages and paid vacations. Significant job actions of the USW include the 1952 steel strike, the steel strike of 1959, and the steel strike of 1986. Growth of the union The 46,000 members of the Aluminum Workers of America voted to merge with the budding steelworker union that was the USW in June 1944. Eventually, eight more unions joined the USW as well: the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (1967); the United Stone and Allied Product Workers of America (1971); District 50, the Allied and Technical Workers of America (1972); the Upholsterers International Union of North America (1985); the United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum & Plastic Workers of America (URW) (1995); the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers Union (ABG) (1996); the Canadian Division of the Transportation Communications International Union (1999); and the American Flint Glass Workers Union (AFGWU) (2003). In June 2004, the USW announced a merger with the 57,000 member Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers of Canada (IWA Canada), a major Canadian forestry workers union. In 2005 it then announced an even larger merger with the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union (PACE). The resulting new union adopted its current name after the PACE merger. In September 2006, the Independent Oil Workers Union of Aruba, which represents refinery workers on the Caribbean island of Aruba, affiliated with the United Steelworkers, becoming the first USW union local outside of the US (including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) and Canada.USW@Work, Volume 1/5, p. 27 (Fall 2006). In April 2007, the USW also merged with the Independent Steelworkers Union, adding 1,150 members at Arcelor-Mittal's Weirton, West Virginia steel mill.One Strong Voice: USW, Weirton Independent Union Sign Merger Agreement, USW, April 2007 . Strategic alliances In addition to mergers, the USW has also formed strategic alliances with several other unions as well as other groups. In April 2005, the USW and the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA) announced that they had formed a strategic alliance to take on the globalization of the culture industry and to address a range of common issues. In July 2006, the USW announced a similar arrangement with the United Transportation Union (UTU), to address common issues in the transportation industry, including the globalization of the industry.United Transportation Union Signs Strategic Alliance with United Steelworkers (July 2006) In July 2007, the USW inked yet another strategic alliance with the Canadian Region of the Communications Workers of America.Steelworkers and Communications Workers Sign Strategic Alliance , USW, July 17, 2007. Beyond its affiliations with other unions, in June 2006, the USW announced the formation of a 'Blue-Green Alliance' with the Sierra Club, which is the largest grassroots environmental organization in the United States. The goal of this new partnership is to pursue a joint public policy agenda reconciling workers' need for good jobs with all people's need for a cleaner environment and safer world.Sierra Club, United Steelworkers Announce ‚ÄòBlue-Green Alliance‚Äô (June 2006) In October 2009, the USW announced a framework for collaboration between US and Canadian Steelworkers with Mondragon Internacional, S.A., the world's largest federation of worker cooperatives.USW Site announcement of USW-Mondragon Collaboration October 2009 Transoceanic merger In early April 2007, the BBC announced that Amicus, then the United Kingdom's second-largest trade union, was to begin discussions with the USW about a possible merger.BBC announces start of discussions with UK trade union Amicus (April 2007) Amicus subsequently merged with the British Transport and General Workers Union to form the new union Unite. Unite and the USW continued the merger talks initiated by Amicus. In May 2008, the unions announced that they were putting the \\"finishing touches\\" on the merger, that the merger had been endorsed by Unite officials, and that the USW would discuss the plan at its forthcoming convention in July. Once completed, the new merged entity would represent more than 3 million workers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and the Caribbean. The unions have further announced that the new entity would target further mergers with labor groups in Australia and in the emerging economies of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.Bill Toland, \\"USW, Brits near creation of 'super' union,\\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 28, 2008. On July 2, 2008, USW and Unite leadership formally signed the merger agreement to create the new entity, to be called Workers Uniting.Steven Greenhouse, \\"Steelworkers Merge With British Union,\\" New York Times, July 3, 2008. The merger creates the first transoceanic trade union since the 1930s (when the Industrial Workers of the World [IWW] was the largest international trade union), and also creates one of the world's largest trade unions. The purpose of the merger is to globalize the labor movement in the era of multinational corporations. American politics =2006 midterm elections= In the 2006 election, the USW led a massive political mobilization program that eventually grew to include 350 full-time political organizers in 26 states, a majority of whom were rank and file USW members who took time from work to organize their communities and educate fellow union members. The USW turned out some 5,000 USW volunteers on Election Day, including over 1,000 each in the key states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Exit polls suggested union families made up 23 percent of the total vote and supported Democratic candidates by a substantial 32 percent margin, 65 percent to 33 percent. Based on these numbers, the United Steelworkers, in conjunction with the rest of the labor movement, took substantial credit for the eventual Democratic victory.Press Release: \\"Unprecedented USW Voter Turnout Effort Highlighted Trade and Economy,\\" November 8, 2006. =2008 presidential election= In May 2008, the USW announced its endorsement of Barack Obama's presidential campaign for president by way of Sen.

Philanthropy The USW has contributed to various charitable and philanthropic causes since its creation. The USW has enthusiastically supported The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP), a nonprofit organization that works with brain-injured children. The USW has hosted the IAHP's founder, Glenn Doman, at their annual convention. The USW has also held fundraising events for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. The USW has consistently stated that such charitable causes are important to its mission.

The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, \\"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!\\" Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features. According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel claimed the story was born in early 1940 when he left a window open in his studio, and the wind fortuitously blew a sketch of an elephant on top of a sketch of a tree. However, according to later biographer Charles Cohen, this account is probably apocryphal. He found elements of Horton in earlier Dr. Seuss works, most notably the 1938 short story \\"Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex\\". Horton Hatches the Egg was published to immediate critical acclaim and financial success and has remained popular with the general public. The book has also been used as the basis for academic articles on a variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. Horton appeared again in the 1954 Dr. Seuss book Horton Hears a Who! These two books later provided the thrust of the plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical. Plot summary The book centers on a genial elephant named Horton, who is convinced by Mayzie, a lazy, irresponsible bird, to sit on her egg while she takes a short \\"break\\", which turns into her permanent relocation to Palm Beach. As Horton sits in the nest on top of a tree, he is exposed to the elements, laughed at by his jungle friends, captured by hunters, forced to endure a terrible sea voyage, and finally placed in a traveling circus. However, despite his hardships and Mayzie's clear intent not to return, Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word, often repeating, \\"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred per cent!\\" The traveling circus ends up visiting near Mayzie's new Palm Beach residence. She visits the circus just as the egg is due to hatch (after 51 weeks in Palm Beach) and demands that Horton should return it, without offering him a reward. However, when the egg hatches, the creature that emerges is an \\"elephant-bird\\", a cross between Horton and Mayzie, and Horton and the baby are returned happily to the jungle, while Mayzie is punished for her laziness by ending up with absolutely nothing. Background According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg was born in 1940, the day after New Year's, when he took a break from drawing in his Park Avenue apartment and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree.Morgan 1995, pp. 96-97 This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.Cohen 2004, pp. 2-5 Charles Cohen, on the other hand, found traces of Horton Hatches the Egg in early Dr. Seuss works. In an early installment of Geisel's cartoon feature \\"Boids and the Beasties\\", which began in Judge magazine in 1927, he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant. A few weeks later, he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a catalpa tree. In a 1959 cartoon for Life magazine, he depicted a dachshund who sits on eggs for storks. In 1961, he drew an illustration for Judge that showed a walrus sitting in a tree, trying to hatch the eggs in a bird nest. Some of his earlier work also featured elephant-bird hybrids, which prefigured the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of Horton Hatches the Egg.Cohen 2004, pp. 6-11 In 1938, two years before Horton Hatches the Egg, Judge published perhaps the most obvious precursor to Horton, \\"Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex\\", a short story by Geisel about an \\"old maid elephant\\" who sits on a chickadee egg until it hatches, only to have the newborn chickadee fly away from her. In 1939, Geisel created an advertisement for NBC featuring a sympathetic-looking elephant lashed with ropes and contained in a cage made of sticks, similar to Horton's situation when the hunters capture him in Horton Hatches the Egg.Cohen 2004, p. 9 In early drafts, the elephant's name changed from Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was apparently after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered to sit on the eggs for the bird, who was very reluctant.Morgan 1995, pp. 97-98 Publication and reception Horton Hatches the Egg was published by Random House in fall 1940 to immediate success.Morgan (1995), p. 99 It received primarily positive notice from critics. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"sheer nonsense, but good fun.\\" The reviewer for The New York Times Book Review wrote, \\"A moral is a new thing to find in a Dr. Seuss book, but it doesn't much interfere with the hilarity with which he juggles an elephant up a tree. To an adult, the tale seems a little forced compared to his first grand yarns, less inevitable in its nonsense, but neither young nor old are going to quibble with the fantastic comedy of his pictures.\\" The book also found early success with book buyers and the general public. It sold 6,000 copies in its first year and 1,600 in its second.Minear (1999), p. 9 Frances Chrystie, the juvenile buyer for FAO Schwarz, wrote to Bennett Cerf, Geisel's publisher, \\"I've been sitting alone in my apartment reading Horton aloud to myself over and over again... It's the funniest book I've ever seen... [Our] merchandise manager thinks he can find an elephant in the store, and we can make a tree and lay an egg and have a very fine window for Book Week.\\" Mary Stix of James Book Store in Cincinnati, Ohio, noted the book's popularity with adults as well as children. Numerous booksellers invited Geisel to hold autographing events at their stores, and Cerf sent him on a tour across several U.S. cities to promote the book. However, the book was less well received in England, where it was rejected by seven publishers before Hamish Hamilton finally published it, to modest success, in 1947. This mirrored a general trend, as Dr. Seuss books were slow to catch on in England.Morgan (1995), p. 175 Horton Hatches the Egg has remained popular in the United States. In 2001, Publishers Weekly reported that the book had sold 987,996 to that point, placing it at 138 in the magazine's list of the best-selling children's books of all time. It was included in Six by Seuss: A Treasury of Dr. Seuss Classics, which was the main selection for the Book-of-the-Month Club in June 1991.Morgan (1995), p. 286 In 1992, less than a year after Geisel's death, Horton's refrain was included in the 16th edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. In 2007, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\", based on an online poll. Analysis Horton Hatches the Egg has been used in discussions on a wide variety of topics, including economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. Alison Lurie, in a 1990 article about Dr. Seuss from a feminist perspective, criticized Horton Hatches the Egg as a statement for fetal rights and for its negative treatment of Mayzie. Lurie pointed out the almost complete lack of strong female protagonists in Dr. Seuss books and argued that Mayzie, who is obviously an antagonist and is depicted as lazy and irresponsible, is \\"the most memorable female character in [Dr Seuss's] entire oeuvre\\". Geisel responded to Lurie's criticism, by way of his biographers near the end of his life, by remarking that most of his characters are animals, noting, \\"if she can identify their sex, I'll remember her in my will.\\" Jill Deans, in a 2000 article, used the book in a discussion of adoption, surrogacy, and particularly, embryo donation. She noted that it is \\"a classic tale of surrogacy\\" and that it \\"evokes the intricacies of the nature/nurture debate\\". She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers, in the form of Horton, but vilifies birth mothers, in the form of Mayzie. Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book's real-life implications for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in Horton and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like. Nel, meanwhile, connected the book to the short story \\"Matilda the Elephant\\". Noting that the Geisels could not have children, Nel argued that \\"Matilda\\", and by extension Horton, may have been manifestations of the Geisels' longing for children.Nel (2004), p. 113-115 In 2004, James W. Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, compared Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, as evidenced by the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book. Richard B. Freeman, writing in 2011 about the contemporaneous economic situation in the United States, called Horton Hatches the Egg a tale of investment. Freeman argued that \\"economic growth requires long-term investments\\", as embodied by Horton's sitting on the egg, and that \\"trust is important in a well- functioning economy\\", as embodied by Horton's repeated maxim, \\"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant.\\" Adaptations The book was adapted into a ten-minute animated short film by Leon Schlesinger Productions and released in 1942 as part of Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies series. The short was directed by Bob Clampett and marked the first time a Dr. Seuss work was adapted for the screen and also the only time a WB animated short was licensed to be based on pre-existing work still under copyright. In 1966, Soyuzmultfilm released an 18-minute Russian film adaptation called I Am Waiting for a Nestling. It was directed by Nikolai Serebryakov and won the Silver Medal for Best Children's Film at Tours in 1967.I Am Waiting for a Nestling In 1992, Random House released \\"Horton Hatches the Egg\\" in its series of Dr. Seuss videos, narrated by Billy Crystal and directed by Mark Reeder. \\"If I Ran the Circus\\" is second in the double feature video.Dr. Seuss Horton Hatches the Egg/If I Ran the Circus [VHS] (1992) Random House Home Video Horton appeared again in Horton Hears a Who, published in 1954. The plot of the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical, a retelling of a number of Dr. Seuss books, borrows heavily from both Horton books. Notes References * Cohen, Charles (2004).

This can be contrasted with steer, which is the antisymmetric angle, i.e. both wheels point to the left or right, in parallel (roughly). Negative toe, or toe out, is the front of the wheel pointing away from the centreline of the vehicle. Positive toe, or toe in, is the front of the wheel pointing towards the centreline of the vehicle. Historically, and still commonly in the United States, toe was specified as the linear difference (either inches or millimeters) of the distance between the two front-facing and rear-facing tire centerlines at the outer diameter and axle-height; since the toe angle in that case depends on the tire diameter, the linear dimension toe specification for a particular vehicle is for specified tires. Description In a rear wheel drive vehicle, increased front toe in provides greater straight-line stability at the cost of some sluggishness of turning response. Performance vehicles may run zero front toe or even some toe out for a better response to steering inputs. The wear on the tires is marginally increased as the tires are under slight side slip conditions when the steering is set straight ahead. On front wheel drive vehicles, the situation is more complex. Rear toe in provides better stability during cornering. Toe is usually adjustable in production automobiles, even though caster angle and camber angle are often not adjustable. Maintenance of front end alignment, which used to involve all three adjustments, currently involves only setting the toe; in most cases, even for a car in which caster or camber are adjustable, only the toe will need adjustment. Toe may only be adjustable on the front wheels. One related concept is that the proper toe for straight line travel of a vehicle will not be correct while turning, since the inside wheel must travel around a smaller radius than the outside wheel; to compensate for this, the steering linkage typically conforms more or less to Ackermann steering geometry, modified to suit the characteristics of the individual vehicle. Road‚Äìrail vehicles The front rail wheels of road‚Äìrail vehicles are often set to toe-in by a distance of 6 mm over 1 metre. Unlike other forms of rolling stock, road-rail vehicles do not always have a common axle between the rail wheels and the toe-in angle prevents the vehicle from hunting when on-rail. Interaction with camber When a wheel is set up to have some camber angle, the interaction between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance.

Under the maximum-parsimony criterion, the optimal tree will minimize the amount of homoplasy (i.e., convergent evolution, parallel evolution, and evolutionary reversals). In other words, under this criterion, the shortest possible tree that explains the data is considered best. The principle is akin to Occam's razor, which states that‚Äîall else being equal‚Äîthe simplest hypothesis that explains the data should be selected. Some of the basic ideas behind maximum parsimony were presented by James S. Farris in 1970 and Walter M. Fitch in 1971. Maximum parsimony is an intuitive and simple criterion, and it is popular for this reason. However, although it is easy to score a phylogenetic tree (by counting the number of character-state changes), there is no algorithm to quickly generate the most-parsimonious tree. Instead, the most-parsimonious tree must be found in \\"tree space\\" (i.e., amongst all possible trees). For a small number of taxa (i.e., fewer than nine) it is possible to do an exhaustive search, in which every possible tree is scored, and the best one is selected. For nine to twenty taxa, it will generally be preferable to use branch-and-bound, which is also guaranteed to return the best tree. For greater numbers of taxa, a heuristic search must be performed. Because the most-parsimonious tree is always the shortest possible tree, this means that‚Äîin comparison to the \\"true\\" tree that actually describes the evolutionary history of the organisms under study‚Äîthe \\"best\\" tree according to the maximum-parsimony criterion will often underestimate the actual evolutionary change that has occurred. In addition, maximum parsimony is not statistically consistent. That is, it is not guaranteed to produce the true tree with high probability, given sufficient data. As demonstrated in 1978 by Joe Felsenstein, maximum parsimony can be inconsistent under certain conditions, such as long-branch attraction. Of course, any phylogenetic algorithm could also be statistically inconsistent if the model it employs to estimate the preferred tree does not accurately match the way that evolution occurred in that clade. This is unknowable. Therefore, while statistical consistency is an interesting theoretical property, it lies outside the realm of testability, and is irrelevant to empirical phylogenetic studies. Alternate characterization and rationale The maximization of parsimony (preferring the simpler of two otherwise equally adequate theorizations) has proven useful in many fields. Occam's razor, a principle of theoretical parsimony suggested by William of Ockham in the 1320s, asserted that it is vain to give an explanation which involves more assumptions than necessary. Alternatively, phylogenetic parsimony can be characterized as favoring the trees that maximize explanatory power by minimizing the number of observed similarities that cannot be explained by inheritance and common descent. Minimization of required evolutionary change on the one hand and maximization of observed similarities that can be explained as homology on the other may result in different preferred trees when some observed features are not applicable in some groups that are included in the tree, and the latter can be seen as the more general approach. While evolution is not an inherently parsimonious process, centuries of scientific experience lend support to the aforementioned principle of parsimony (Occam's razor). Namely, the supposition of a simpler, more parsimonious chain of events is preferable to the supposition of a more complicated, less parsimonious chain of events. Hence, parsimony (sensu lato) is typically sought in constructing phylogenetic trees, and in scientific explanation generally. In detail Parsimony is part of a class of character-based tree estimation methods which use a matrix of discrete phylogenetic characters to infer one or more optimal phylogenetic trees for a set of taxa, commonly a set of species or reproductively isolated populations of a single species. These methods operate by evaluating candidate phylogenetic trees according to an explicit optimality criterion; the tree with the most favorable score is taken as the best estimate of the phylogenetic relationships of the included taxa. Maximum parsimony is used with most kinds of phylogenetic data; until recently, it was the only widely used character-based tree estimation method used for morphological data. Estimating phylogenies is not a trivial problem. A huge number of possible phylogenetic trees exist for any reasonably sized set of taxa; for example, a mere ten species gives over two million possible unrooted trees. These possibilities must be searched to find a tree that best fits the data according to the optimality criterion. However, the data themselves do not lead to a simple, arithmetic solution to the problem. Ideally, we would expect the distribution of whatever evolutionary characters (such as phenotypic traits or alleles) to directly follow the branching pattern of evolution. Thus we could say that if two organisms possess a shared character, they should be more closely related to each other than to a third organism that lacks this character (provided that character was not present in the last common ancestor of all three, in which case it would be a symplesiomorphy). We would predict that bats and monkeys are more closely related to each other than either is to an elephant, because male bats and monkeys possess external testicles, which elephants lack. However, we cannot say that bats and monkeys are more closely related to one another than they are to whales, though the two have external testicles absent in whales, because we believe that the males in the last common ancestral species of the three had external testicles. However, the phenomena of convergent evolution, parallel evolution, and evolutionary reversals (collectively termed homoplasy) add an unpleasant wrinkle to the problem of estimating phylogeny. For a number of reasons, two organisms can possess a trait not present in their last common ancestor: If we naively took the presence of this trait as evidence of a relationship, we would reconstruct an incorrect tree. Real phylogenetic data include substantial homoplasy, with different parts of the data suggesting sometimes very different relationships. Methods used to estimate phylogenetic trees are explicitly intended to resolve the conflict within the data by picking the phylogenetic tree that is the best fit to all the data overall, accepting that some data simply will not fit. It is often mistakenly believed that parsimony assumes that convergence is rare; in fact, even convergently derived characters have some value in maximum- parsimony-based phylogenetic analyses, and the prevalence of convergence does not systematically affect the outcome of parsimony-based methods. Data that do not fit a tree perfectly are not simply \\"noise\\", they can contain relevant phylogenetic signal in some parts of a tree, even if they conflict with the tree overall. In the whale example given above, the lack of external testicles in whales is homoplastic: It reflects a return to the condition present in ancient ancestors of mammals, whose testicles were internal. This similarity between whales and ancient mammal ancestors is in conflict with the tree we accept, since it implies that the mammals with external testicles should form a group excluding whales. However, among the whales, the reversal to internal testicles actually correctly associates the various types of whales (including dolphins and porpoises) into the group Cetacea. Still, the determination of the best-fitting tree‚Äîand thus which data do not fit the tree‚Äîis a complex process. Maximum parsimony is one method developed to do this.  Character data  The input data used in a maximum parsimony analysis is in the form of \\"characters\\" for a range of taxa. There is no generally agreed-upon definition of a phylogenetic character, but operationally a character can be thought of as an attribute, an axis along which taxa are observed to vary. These attributes can be physical (morphological), molecular, genetic, physiological, or behavioral. The only widespread agreement on characters seems to be that variation used for character analysis should reflect heritable variation. Whether it must be directly heritable, or whether indirect inheritance (e.g., learned behaviors) is acceptable, is not entirely resolved. Each character is divided into discrete character states, into which the variations observed are classified. Character states are often formulated as descriptors, describing the condition of the character substrate. For example, the character \\"eye color\\" might have the states \\"blue\\" and \\"brown.\\" Characters can have two or more states (they can have only one, but these characters lend nothing to a maximum parsimony analysis, and are often excluded). Coding characters for phylogenetic analysis is not an exact science, and there are numerous complicating issues. Typically, taxa are scored with the same state if they are more similar to one another in that particular attribute than each is to taxa scored with a different state. This is not straightforward when character states are not clearly delineated or when they fail to capture all of the possible variation in a character. How would one score the previously mentioned character for a taxon (or individual) with hazel eyes? Or green? As noted above, character coding is generally based on similarity: Hazel and green eyes might be lumped with blue because they are more similar to that color (being light), and the character could be then recoded as \\"eye color: light; dark.\\" Alternatively, there can be multi-state characters, such as \\"eye color: brown; hazel, blue; green.\\" Ambiguities in character state delineation and scoring can be a major source of confusion, dispute, and error in phylogenetic analysis using character data. Note that, in the above example, \\"eyes: present; absent\\" is also a possible character, which creates issues because \\"eye color\\" is not applicable if eyes are not present. For such situations, a \\"?\\" (\\"unknown\\") is scored, although sometimes \\"X\\" or \\"-\\" (the latter usually in sequence data) are used to distinguish cases where a character cannot be scored from a case where the state is simply unknown. Current implementations of maximum parsimony generally treat unknown values in the same manner: the reasons the data are unknown have no particular effect on analysis. Effectively, the program treats a ? as if it held the state that would involve the fewest extra steps in the tree (see below), although this is not an explicit step in the algorithm. Genetic data are particularly amenable to character-based phylogenetic methods such as maximum parsimony because protein and nucleotide sequences are naturally discrete: A particular position in a nucleotide sequence can be either adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine / uracil, or a sequence gap; a position (residue) in a protein sequence will be one of the basic amino acids or a sequence gap. Thus, character scoring is rarely ambiguous, except in cases where sequencing methods fail to produce a definitive assignment for a particular sequence position. Sequence gaps are sometimes treated as characters, although there is no consensus on how they should be coded. Characters can be treated as unordered or ordered. For a binary (two-state) character, this makes little difference. For a multi-state character, unordered characters can be thought of as having an equal \\"cost\\" (in terms of number of \\"evolutionary events\\") to change from any one state to any other; complementarily, they do not require passing through intermediate states. Ordered characters have a particular sequence in which the states must occur through evolution, such that going between some states requires passing through an intermediate. This can be thought of complementarily as having different costs to pass between different pairs of states. In the eye-color example above, it is possible to leave it unordered, which imposes the same evolutionary \\"cost\\" to go from brown-blue, green-blue, green-hazel, etc. Alternatively, it could be ordered brown-hazel-green-blue; this would normally imply that it would cost two evolutionary events to go from brown-green, three from brown-blue, but only one from brown-hazel. This can also be thought of as requiring eyes to evolve through a \\"hazel stage\\" to get from brown to green, and a \\"green stage\\" to get from hazel to blue, etc. For many characters, it is not obvious if and how they should be ordered. On the contrary, for characters that represent discretization of an underlying continuous variable, like shape, size, and ratio characters, ordering is logical, and simulations have shown that this improves ability to recover correct clades, while decreasing the recovering of erroneous clades. There is a lively debate on the utility and appropriateness of character ordering, but no consensus. Some authorities order characters when there is a clear logical, ontogenetic, or evolutionary transition among the states (for example, \\"legs: short; medium; long\\"). Some accept only some of these criteria. Some run an unordered analysis, and order characters that show a clear order of transition in the resulting tree (which practice might be accused of circular reasoning). Some authorities refuse to order characters at all, suggesting that it biases an analysis to require evolutionary transitions to follow a particular path. It is also possible to apply differential weighting to individual characters. This is usually done relative to a \\"cost\\" of 1. Thus, some characters might be seen as more likely to reflect the true evolutionary relationships among taxa, and thus they might be weighted at a value 2 or more; changes in these characters would then count as two evolutionary \\"steps\\" rather than one when calculating tree scores (see below). There has been much discussion in the past about character weighting. Most authorities now weight all characters equally, although exceptions are common. For example, allele frequency data is sometimes pooled in bins and scored as an ordered character. In these cases, the character itself is often downweighted so that small changes in allele frequencies count less than major changes in other characters. Also, the third codon position in a coding nucleotide sequence is particularly labile, and is sometimes downweighted, or given a weight of 0, on the assumption that it is more likely to exhibit homoplasy. In some cases, repeated analyses are run, with characters reweighted in inverse proportion to the degree of homoplasy discovered in the previous analysis (termed successive weighting); this is another technique that might be considered circular reasoning. Character state changes can also be weighted individually. This is often done for nucleotide sequence data; it has been empirically determined that certain base changes (A-C, A-T, G-C, G-T, and the reverse changes) occur much less often than others (A-G, C-T, and their reverse changes). These changes are therefore often weighted more. As shown above in the discussion of character ordering, ordered characters can be thought of as a form of character state weighting. Some systematists prefer to exclude characters known to be, or suspected to be, highly homoplastic or that have a large number of unknown entries (\\"?\\"). As noted below, theoretical and simulation work has demonstrated that this is likely to sacrifice accuracy rather than improve it. This is also the case with characters that are variable in the terminal taxa: theoretical, congruence, and simulation studies have all demonstrated that such polymorphic characters contain significant phylogenetic information.  Taxon sampling  The time required for a parsimony analysis (or any phylogenetic analysis) is proportional to the number of taxa (and characters) included in the analysis. Also, because more taxa require more branches to be estimated, more uncertainty may be expected in large analyses. Because data collection costs in time and money often scale directly with the number of taxa included, most analyses include only a fraction of the taxa that could have been sampled. Indeed, some authors have contended that four taxa (the minimum required to produce a meaningful unrooted tree) are all that is necessary for accurate phylogenetic analysis, and that more characters are more valuable than more taxa in phylogenetics. This has led to a raging controversy about taxon sampling. Empirical, theoretical, and simulation studies have led to a number of dramatic demonstrations of the importance of adequate taxon sampling. Most of these can be summarized by a simple observation: a phylogenetic data matrix has dimensions of characters times taxa. Doubling the number of taxa doubles the amount of information in a matrix just as surely as doubling the number of characters. Each taxon represents a new sample for every character, but, more importantly, it (usually) represents a new combination of character states. These character states can not only determine where that taxon is placed on the tree, they can inform the entire analysis, possibly causing different relationships among the remaining taxa to be favored by changing estimates of the pattern of character changes. The most disturbing weakness of parsimony analysis, that of long-branch attraction (see below) is particularly pronounced with poor taxon sampling, especially in the four-taxon case. This is a well-understood case in which additional character sampling may not improve the quality of the estimate. As taxa are added, they often break up long branches (especially in the case of fossils), effectively improving the estimation of character state changes along them. Because of the richness of information added by taxon sampling, it is even possible to produce highly accurate estimates of phylogenies with hundreds of taxa using only a few thousand characters. Although many studies have been performed, there is still much work to be done on taxon sampling strategies. Because of advances in computer performance, and the reduced cost and increased automation of molecular sequencing, sample sizes overall are on the rise, and studies addressing the relationships of hundreds of taxa (or other terminal entities, such as genes) are becoming common. Of course, this is not to say that adding characters is not also useful; the number of characters is increasing as well. Some systematists prefer to exclude taxa based on the number of unknown character entries (\\"?\\") they exhibit, or because they tend to \\"jump around\\" the tree in analyses (i.e., they are \\"wildcards\\"). As noted below, theoretical and simulation work has demonstrated that this is likely to sacrifice accuracy rather than improve it. Although these taxa may generate more most- parsimonious trees (see below), methods such as agreement subtrees and reduced consensus can still extract information on the relationships of interest. It has been observed that inclusion of more taxa tends to lower overall support values (bootstrap percentages or decay indices, see below). The cause of this is clear: as additional taxa are added to a tree, they subdivide the branches to which they attach, and thus dilute the information that supports that branch. While support for individual branches is reduced, support for the overall relationships is actually increased. Consider analysis that produces the following tree: (fish, (lizard, (whale, (cat, monkey)))). Adding a rat and a walrus will probably reduce the support for the (whale, (cat, monkey)) clade, because the rat and the walrus may fall within this clade, or outside of the clade, and since these five animals are all relatively closely related, there should be more uncertainty about their relationships. Within error, it may be impossible to determine any of these animals' relationships relative to one another. However, the rat and the walrus will probably add character data that cements the grouping any two of these mammals exclusive of the fish or the lizard; where the initial analysis might have been misled, say, by the presence of fins in the fish and the whale, the presence of the walrus, with blubber and fins like a whale but whiskers like a cat and a rat, firmly ties the whale to the mammals. To cope with this problem, agreement subtrees, reduced consensus, and double-decay analysis seek to identify supported relationships (in the form of \\"n-taxon statements,\\" such as the four-taxon statement \\"(fish, (lizard, (cat, whale)))\\") rather than whole trees. If the goal of an analysis is a resolved tree, as is the case for comparative phylogenetics, these methods cannot solve the problem. However, if the tree estimate is so poorly supported, the results of any analysis derived from the tree will probably be too suspect to use anyway.  Analysis  A maximum parsimony analysis runs in a very straightforward fashion. Trees are scored according to the degree to which they imply a parsimonious distribution of the character data. The most parsimonious tree for the dataset represents the preferred hypothesis of relationships among the taxa in the analysis. Trees are scored (evaluated) by using a simple algorithm to determine how many \\"steps\\" (evolutionary transitions) are required to explain the distribution of each character. A step is, in essence, a change from one character state to another, although with ordered characters some transitions require more than one step. Contrary to popular belief, the algorithm does not explicitly assign particular character states to nodes (branch junctions) on a tree: the fewest steps can involve multiple, equally costly assignments and distributions of evolutionary transitions. What is optimized is the total number of changes. There are many more possible phylogenetic trees than can be searched exhaustively for more than eight taxa or so. A number of algorithms are therefore used to search among the possible trees. Many of these involve taking an initial tree (usually the favored tree from the last iteration of the algorithm), and perturbing it to see if the change produces a higher score. The trees resulting from parsimony search are unrooted: They show all the possible relationships of the included taxa, but they lack any statement on relative times of divergence. A particular branch is chosen to root the tree by the user. This branch is then taken to be outside all the other branches of the tree, which together form a monophyletic group. This imparts a sense of relative time to the tree. Incorrect choice of a root can result in incorrect relationships on the tree, even if the tree is itself correct in its unrooted form. Parsimony analysis often returns a number of equally most- parsimonious trees (MPTs). A large number of MPTs is often seen as an analytical failure, and is widely believed to be related to the number of missing entries (\\"?\\") in the dataset, characters showing too much homoplasy, or the presence of topologically labile \\"wildcard\\" taxa (which may have many missing entries). Numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of MPTs, including removing characters or taxa with large amounts of missing data before analysis, removing or downweighting highly homoplastic characters (successive weighting) or removing wildcard taxa (the phylogenetic trunk method) a posteriori and then reanalyzing the data. Numerous theoretical and simulation studies have demonstrated that highly homoplastic characters, characters and taxa with abundant missing data, and \\"wildcard\\" taxa contribute to the analysis. Although excluding characters or taxa may appear to improve resolution, the resulting tree is based on less data, and is therefore a less reliable estimate of the phylogeny (unless the characters or taxa are non informative, see safe taxonomic reduction). Today's general consensus is that having multiple MPTs is a valid analytical result; it simply indicates that there is insufficient data to resolve the tree completely. In many cases, there is substantial common structure in the MPTs, and differences are slight and involve uncertainty in the placement of a few taxa. There are a number of methods for summarizing the relationships within this set, including consensus trees, which show common relationships among all the taxa, and pruned agreement subtrees, which show common structure by temporarily pruning \\"wildcard\\" taxa from every tree until they all agree. Reduced consensus takes this one step further, by showing all subtrees (and therefore all relationships) supported by the input trees. Even if multiple MPTs are returned, parsimony analysis still basically produces a point-estimate, lacking confidence intervals of any sort. This has often been levelled as a criticism, since there is certainly error in estimating the most-parsimonious tree, and the method does not inherently include any means of establishing how sensitive its conclusions are to this error. Several methods have been used to assess support. Jackknifing and bootstrapping, well-known statistical resampling procedures, have been employed with parsimony analysis. The jackknife, which involves resampling without replacement (\\"leave-one-out\\") can be employed on characters or taxa; interpretation may become complicated in the latter case, because the variable of interest is the tree, and comparison of trees with different taxa is not straightforward. The bootstrap, resampling with replacement (sample x items randomly out of a sample of size x, but items can be picked multiple times), is only used on characters, because adding duplicate taxa does not change the result of a parsimony analysis. The bootstrap is much more commonly employed in phylogenetics (as elsewhere); both methods involve an arbitrary but large number of repeated iterations involving perturbation of the original data followed by analysis. The resulting MPTs from each analysis are pooled, and the results are usually presented on a 50% Majority Rule Consensus tree, with individual branches (or nodes) labelled with the percentage of bootstrap MPTs in which they appear. This \\"bootstrap percentage\\" (which is not a P-value, as is sometimes claimed) is used as a measure of support. Technically, it is supposed to be a measure of repeatability, the probability that that branch (node, clade) would be recovered if the taxa were sampled again. Experimental tests with viral phylogenies suggest that the bootstrap percentage is not a good estimator of repeatability for phylogenetics, but it is a reasonable estimator of accuracy. In fact, it has been shown that the bootstrap percentage, as an estimator of accuracy, is biased, and that this bias results on average in an underestimate of confidence (such that as little as 70% support might really indicate up to 95% confidence). However, the direction of bias cannot be ascertained in individual cases, so assuming that high values bootstrap support indicate even higher confidence is unwarranted. Another means of assessing support is Bremer support, or the decay index which is a parameter of a given data set, rather than an estimate based on pseudoreplicated subsamples, as are the bootstrap and jackknife procedures described above. Bremer support (also known as branch support) is simply the difference in number of steps between the score of the MPT(s), and the score of the most parsimonious tree that does not contain a particular clade (node, branch). It can be thought of as the number of steps you have to add to lose that clade; implicitly, it is meant to suggest how great the error in the estimate of the score of the MPT must be for the clade to no longer be supported by the analysis, although this is not necessarily what it does. Branch support values are often fairly low for modestly-sized data sets (one or two steps being typical), but they often appear to be proportional to bootstrap percentages. As data matrices become larger, branch support values often continue to increase as bootstrap values plateau at 100%. Thus, for large data matrices, branch support values may provide a more informative means to compare support for strongly-supported branches. However, interpretation of decay values is not straightforward, and they seem to be preferred by authors with philosophical objections to the bootstrap (although many morphological systematists, especially paleontologists, report both). Double-decay analysis is a decay counterpart to reduced consensus that evaluates the decay index for all possible subtree relationships (n-taxon statements) within a tree.  Problems with maximum parsimony phylogenetic inference  An example of long branch attraction. If branches A & C have a high number of substitutions in the \\"true tree\\" (assumed, never actually known except in simulations), then parsimony might interpret parallel changes as synapomorphies and group A and C together. Maximum parsimony is an epistemologically straightforward approach that makes few mechanistic assumptions, and is popular for this reason. However, it may not be statistically consistent under certain circumstances. Consistency, here meaning the monotonic convergence on the correct answer with the addition of more data, is a desirable property of statistical methods. As demonstrated in 1978 by Joe Felsenstein, maximum parsimony can be inconsistent under certain conditions. The category of situations in which this is known to occur is called long branch attraction, and occurs, for example, where there are long branches (a high level of substitutions) for two characters (A & C), but short branches for another two (B & D). A and B diverged from a common ancestor, as did C and D. Assume for simplicity that we are considering a single binary character (it can either be + or -). Because the distance from B to D is small, in the vast majority of all cases, B and D will be the same. Here, we will assume that they are both + (+ and - are assigned arbitrarily and swapping them is only a matter of definition). If this is the case, there are four remaining possibilities. A and C can both be +, in which case all taxa are the same and all the trees have the same length. A can be + and C can be -, in which case only one character is different, and we cannot learn anything, as all trees have the same length. Similarly, A can be - and C can be +. The only remaining possibility is that A and C are both -. In this case, however, the evidence suggests that A and C group together, and B and D together. As a consequence, if the \\"true tree\\" is a tree of this type, the more data we collect (i.e. the more characters we study), the more the evidence will support the wrong tree. Of course, except in mathematical simulations, we never know what the \\"true tree\\" is. Thus, unless we are able to devise a model that is guaranteed to accurately recover the \\"true tree,\\" any other optimality criterion or weighting scheme could also, in principle, be statistically inconsistent. The bottom line is, that while statistical inconsistency is an interesting theoretical issue, it is empirically a purely metaphysical concern, outside the realm of empirical testing. Any method could be inconsistent, and there is no way to know for certain whether it is, or not. It is for this reason that many systematists characterize their phylogenetic results as hypotheses of relationship. Another complication with maximum parsimony, and other optimaltiy-criterion based phylogenetic methods, is that finding the shortest tree is an NP-hard problem. The only currently available, efficient way of obtaining a solution, given an arbitrarily large set of taxa, is by using heuristic methods which do not guarantee that the shortest tree will be recovered. These methods employ hill-climbing algorithms to progressively approach the best tree. However, it has been shown that there can be \\"tree islands\\" of suboptimal solutions, and the analysis can become trapped in these local optima. Thus, complex, flexible heuristics are required to ensure that tree space has been adequately explored. Several heuristics are available, including nearest neighbor interchange (NNI), tree bisection reconnection (TBR), and the parsimony ratchet.  Criticism  It has been asserted that a major problem, especially for paleontology, is that maximum parsimony assumes that the only way two species can share the same nucleotide at the same position is if they are genetically related. This asserts that phylogenetic applications of parsimony assume that all similarity is homologous (other interpretations, such as the assertion that two organisms might not be related at all, are nonsensical). This is emphatically not the case: as with any form of character-based phylogeny estimation, parsimony is used to test the homologous nature of similarities by finding the phylogenetic tree which best accounts for all of the similarities. It is often stated that parsimony is not relevant to phylogenetic inference because \\"evolution is not parsimonious.\\" In most cases, there is no explicit alternative proposed; if no alternative is available, any statistical method is preferable to none at all. Additionally, it is not clear what would be meant if the statement \\"evolution is parsimonious\\" were in fact true. This could be taken to mean that more character changes may have occurred historically than are predicted using the parsimony criterion. Because parsimony phylogeny estimation reconstructs the minimum number of changes necessary to explain a tree, this is quite possible. However, it has been shown through simulation studies, testing with known in vitro viral phylogenies, and congruence with other methods, that the accuracy of parsimony is in most cases not compromised by this. Parsimony analysis uses the number of character changes on trees to choose the best tree, but it does not require that exactly that many changes, and no more, produced the tree. As long as the changes that have not been accounted for are randomly distributed over the tree (a reasonable null expectation), the result should not be biased. In practice, the technique is robust: maximum parsimony exhibits minimal bias as a result of choosing the tree with the fewest changes. An analogy can be drawn with choosing among contractors based on their initial (nonbinding) estimate of the cost of a job. The actual finished cost is very likely to be higher than the estimate. Despite this, choosing the contractor who furnished the lowest estimate should theoretically result in the lowest final project cost. This is because, in the absence of other data, we would assume that all of the relevant contractors have the same risk of cost overruns. In practice, of course, unscrupulous business practices may bias this result; in phylogenetics, too, some particular phylogenetic problems (for example, long branch attraction, described above) may potentially bias results. In both cases, however, there is no way to tell if the result is going to be biased, or the degree to which it will be biased, based on the estimate itself. With parsimony too, there is no way to tell that the data are positively misleading, without comparison to other evidence. Parsimony is often characterized as implicitly adopting the position that evolutionary change is rare, or that homoplasy (convergence and reversal) is minimal in evolution. This is not entirely true: parsimony minimizes the number of convergences and reversals that are assumed by the preferred tree, but this may result in a relatively large number of such homoplastic events. It would be more appropriate to say that parsimony assumes only the minimum amount of change implied by the data. As above, this does not require that these were the only changes that occurred; it simply does not infer changes for which there is no evidence. The shorthand for describing this is that \\"parsimony minimizes assumed homoplasies, it does not assume that homoplasy is minimal.\\" Parsimony is also sometimes associated with the notion that \\"the simplest possible explanation is the best,\\" a generalisation of Occam's Razor. Parsimony does prefer the solution that requires the fewest unsubstantiated assumptions and unsupportable conclusions, the solution that goes the least theoretical distance beyond the data. This is a very common approach to science, especially when dealing with systems that are so complex as to defy simple models. Parsimony does not by any means necessarily produce a \\"simple\\" assumption. Indeed, as a general rule, most character datasets are so \\"noisy\\" that no truly \\"simple\\" solution is possible. Recent simulation studies suggest that parsimony may be less accurate than trees built using Bayesian approaches for morphological data, potentially due to overprecision, although this has been disputed . Studies using novel simulation methods have demonstrated that differences between inference methods result from the search strategy and consensus method employed, rather than the optimization used. Also, analyses of 38 molecular and 86 morphological empirical datasets have shown that the common mechanism assumed by the evolutionary models used in model-based phylogenetics apply to most molecular, but few morphological datasets. This finding validates the use of model-based phylogenetics for molecular data, but suggests that for morphological data, parsimony remains advantageous, at least until more sophisticated models become available for phenotypic data.  Alternatives  There are several other methods for inferring phylogenies based on discrete character data, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Each offers potential advantages and disadvantages. In practice, these methods tend to favor trees that are very similar to the most parsimonious tree(s) for the same dataset; however, they allow for complex modelling of evolutionary processes, and as classes of methods are statistically consistent and are not susceptible to long-branch attraction. Note, however, that the performance of likelihood and Bayesian methods are dependent on the quality of the particular model of evolution employed; an incorrect model can produce a biased result - just like parsimony. In addition, they are still quite computationally slow relative to parsimony methods, sometimes requiring weeks to run large datasets. Most of these methods have particularly avid proponents and detractors; parsimony especially has been advocated as philosophically superior (most notably by ardent cladists). One area where parsimony still holds much sway is in the analysis of morphological data, because‚Äîuntil recently‚Äîstochastic models of character change were not available for non-molecular data, and they are still not widely implemented. Parsimony has also recently been shown to be more likely to recover the true tree in the face of profound changes in evolutionary (\\"model\\") parameters (e.g., the rate of evolutionary change) within a tree. Distance matrices can also be used to generate phylogenetic trees. Non- parametric distance methods were originally applied to phenetic data using a matrix of pairwise distances and reconciled to produce a tree. The distance matrix can come from a number of different sources, including immunological distance, morphometric analysis, and genetic distances. For phylogenetic character data, raw distance values can be calculated by simply counting the number of pairwise differences in character states (Manhattan distance) or by applying a model of evolution. Notably, distance methods also allow use of data that may not be easily converted to character data, such as DNA-DNA hybridization assays. Today, distance-based methods are often frowned upon because phylogenetically-informative data can be lost when converting characters to distances. There are a number of distance-matrix methods and optimality criteria, of which the minimum evolution criterion is most closely related to maximum parsimony. = Minimum Evolution = From among the distance methods, there exists a phylogenetic estimation criterion, known as Minimum Evolution (ME), that shares with maximum-parsimony the aspect of searching for the phylogeny that has the shortest total sum of branch lengths. A subtle difference distinguishes the maximum-parsimony criterion from the ME criterion: while maximum-parsimony is based on an abductive heuristic, i.e., the plausibility of the simplest evolutionary hypothesis of taxa with respect to the more complex ones, the ME criterion is based on Kidd and Sgaramella- Zonta's conjectures (proven true 22 years later by Rzhetsky and Nei) stating that if the evolutionary distances from taxa were unbiased estimates of the true evolutionary distances then the true phylogeny of taxa would have a length shorter than any other alternative phylogeny compatible with those distances. Rzhetsky and Nei's results set the ME criterion free from the Occam's razor principle and confer it a solid theoretical and quantitative basis.

Often considered one of the pioneers of screamo, Orchid combined an extreme yet emotionally complex sound with a cerebral aesthetic. Active from 1997 until 2002, they released several EPs and splits as well as three studio albums. The band consisted of Jayson Green as lead vocalist, drummer Jeffrey Salane, guitarist Will Killingsworth and bassist Geoff Garlock. In 1999 Orchid released their first record Chaos Is Me and a year after in 2000 released Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow! In July 2002 they released their third studio album Gatefold and later in the year, in September, Orchid released a compilation of both their first and second albums onto CD containing all 21 tracks from both. After the release of both they split up. Posthumously, in 2005 Orchid released Totality, a compilation album comprised all of 24 tracks from out of press and hard to find B-side and split EP material previously only available on vinyl. History The band was formed while Jayson Green, Will Killingsworth, and Brad Wallace were studying at Hampshire College, and Jeff Salane was attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst in early 1998. The majority of their discography was released on vinyl records which they often shared with other bands. There were three full-length (by their standards) records released: Chaos Is Me, Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow! and the final Self-Titled release (often called \\"Gatefold\\" after its packaging), all on Ebullition Records. Towards the end of their lifespan, the final line-up of Orchid had formed various side-projects, with vocalist Green, bassist Geoff Garlock and drummer Salane forming the band Panthers. Guitarist Will Killingsworth played in the band Bucket Full of Teeth and worked on Dead Air Studios, his recording project based in Amherst, MA, where the band recorded their final album. They had previously recorded at Godcity with Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou. Orchid played their last shows in a number of cities during the summer of 2002, the last of which was on July 9, 2002 at The Advocate in Harvard Square in Cambridge, MA, where they played with Sinaloa and the band Wolves, who had former Orchid bassist Brad Wallace playing guitar for them. Killingsworth continues to run his own label, Clean Plate Records, whilst his band Bucket Full of Teeth released several records, including a full-length LP on Level Plane Records before he formed the band Ampere, who are still active. Green, Garlock, and Salane continue to play in the band Panthers, who have released two full-length albums and an EP. After Wolves finished, Brad joined Transistor Transistor to play guitar, who also recently released an album on Level-Plane. Jayson Green later formed a hardcore punk supergroup named Violent Bullshit, with members of Black Army Jacket and the Fiery Furnaces. Jayson Green, Will Killingsworth, and Geoff Garlock currently play together in the band Ritual Mess. Style and legacy Orchid's musical style, which has primarily been described as hardcore punk and screamo, is highly dissonant, fast and chaotic. It combines the melodic and poetic approach of post-hardcore and emo with the extremity of powerviolence (a fusion sometimes termed emoviolence) and grindcore. Orchid was known for their well-conceived literary approach to lyrics which are of a personal nature, even more than other screamo bands. Their lyrics make reference to Anna Karina, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer & the Frankfurt School, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jacques Attali, Guy Debord, and other aspects of European critical theory and culture.Orchid, Dance Tonight, Revolution Tomorrow. Allmusic Guide. [] Access date: June 17, 2008. But their music also includes melodic elements, violins, and brief snippets of modern classical music. Italian site \\"Emotional Breakdown\\" gave a positive review of Orchid's compilation album Totality, saying: \\"[Orchid] are the concentrated essence of the most poignant music you can imagine: the vocal cords that are pulled until they tear, the music sounds dark and desperate. They possess all these characteristics as the undisputed masters they have taught many proselytes, in all of their cynical splendor.\\" Orchid is considered a prominent and quintessential band in screamo. Orchid are considered legends in the emotional hardcore scene primarily due to their debut album Chaos Is Me, which left \\"a huge crater that was their influence\\". Lars Gotrich, when writing for NPR music credited Orchid alongside bands Pg 99, Circle Takes the Square and Majority Rule as being prominent influences on emotional post-hardcore. In January 2012, Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein released a sixth studio album titled Short Songs, which included a covered Orchid's \\"Destination: Blood\\". The cover was included on a second disc of covers of, in the band's opinion \\"classic punk songs\\" which were all less than 90 seconds in length.

Those with the most credible claims were John Balliol, Robert Bruce, John Hastings and Floris V, Count of Holland. Fearing civil war, the Guardians of Scotland asked Edward I of England to arbitrate. Before agreeing, Edward obtained concessions going some way to revive English overlordship over the Scots. A commission of 104 \\"auditors\\" was then appointed: 24 were appointed by Edward himself acting as president, and the remainder by Bruce and Balliol in equal numbers. In November 1292 this body decided in favour of John Balliol, whose claim was based on the traditional criterion of primogeniture‚Äîinheritance through a line of firstborn sons. The decision was accepted by the majority of the powerful in Scotland, and John ruled as King of Scots from then until 1296. Background With the death of King Alexander III in 1286, the crown of Scotland passed to his only surviving descendant, his three-year-old granddaughter Margaret (the Maid of Norway). In 1290, the Guardians of Scotland, who had been appointed to govern the realm during the young Queen's minority, drew up the Treaty of Birgham, a marriage contract between Margaret and the five-year-old Edward of Caernarvon, heir apparent to the English throne. The treaty, amongst other points, contained the provision that although the issue of this marriage would inherit the crowns of both England and Scotland, the latter kingdom should be \\"separate, apart and free in itself without subjection to the English Kingdom\\".Powicke, Maurice, The Thirteenth Century, 1216‚Äì1307, 1963, The intent was to keep Scotland as an independent entity. Margaret died on 26 September 1290 in Orkney on her way to Scotland, leaving the throne vacant. The Guardians called upon her fianc√©'s father, Edward I of England, to conduct a court in which 104 auditors would choose from among the various competitors for the Scottish throne in a process known as the Great Cause (). One of the strongest claimants, John Balliol, Lord of Galloway, forged an alliance with the powerful Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, the representative of Edward I in Scotland and began styling himself 'heir of Scotland',Stevenson, J., Documents Illustrative of the History of Scotland, 1870 while another, Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, turned up to the site of Margaret's supposed inauguration with a force of soldiers amidst rumours that his friends the Earl of Mar and the Earl of Atholl were also raising their forces.Barrow, Geoffrey W.S., Robert Bruce & The Community of The Realm of Scotland, 1988, Scotland looked to be headed for civil war.  Edward I steps in  To avoid the catastrophe of open warfare between the Bruce and Balliol, the Guardians and other Scots magnates asked Edward I to intervene.Simpson, Grant G., and Stones, ELG., Edward I and the Throne of Scotland: An Edition of the Record Sources for the Great Cause, 1979, Edward seized the occasion as an opportunity to gain something he had long desired‚Äîlegal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England. The English kings had a long history of presuming an overlordship of Scotland, harking back to the late 12th century when Scotland had actually been a vassal state of Henry II's England for 15 years from 1174 (Treaty of Falaise) until the Quitclaim of Canterbury (1189), but the legality of Edward's 13th century claim was questionable. Alexander III, giving homage to Edward, had chosen his words very carefully: \\"I become your man for the lands I hold of you in the Kingdom of England for which I owe homage, saving my Kingdom\\"Stones, ELG., Anglo- Scottish Relations 1174‚Äì1328, 1970, (author's italics). In line with this desire, Edward demanded in May 1291 that his claim of feudal overlordship of Scotland be recognised before he would step in and act as arbiter. He demanded that the Scots produce evidence to show that he was not the lawful overlord, rather than presenting them with evidence that he was. The Scots' reply came that without a king there was no one in the realm responsible enough to possibly make such an admission, and so any assurances given by the Scots were worthless. Although technically and legally correct by the standards of the time, this reply infuriated Edward enough that he refused to have it entered on the official record of the proceedings. The Guardians and the claimants still needed Edward's help, and he did manage to press them into accepting a number of lesser though still important terms. The majority of the competitors and the Guardians did eventually step forward to acknowledge Edward as their rightful overlord, even though they could not be taken as speaking for the realm as a whole. They also agreed to put Edward in temporary control of the principal royal castles of Scotland despite the castles in question not being theirs to give away. For his part, Edward agreed that he would return control of both kingdom and castles to the successful claimant within two months. In the ongoing negotiations between the two countries, the Scots continued to use the Treaty of Birgham as a reference point, indicating that they still wished to see Scotland retain an independent identity from England. Having got these concessions, Edward arranged for a court to be set up to decide which of the claimants should inherit the throne. It consisted of 104 auditors plus Edward himself as president. Edward chose 24 of the auditors while the two claimants with the strongest cases‚ÄîBruce and Balliol‚Äîwere allowed to appoint forty each.  The competitors  When Margaret died, there were no close relatives to whom the succession might pass in a smooth and clear manner. Her nearest relatives derived through legitimate descent from prior kings were the descendants of Margaret's great-great-great-grandfather, Henry, the son of king David I of Scotland, though there were noblemen descended from illegitimate daughters of more recent Scottish kings who also made claims. Thirteen nobles put themselves forward as candidates for the throne (with those claiming the throne through illegitimate lines in italic):Massingberd, Hugh Montgomery-, Burke's Guide to the Royal Family, 1973, London: Burke's Peerage *John Balliol, Lord of Galloway, son of Devorguilla, daughter of Margaret, eldest daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I. He pleaded primogeniture in legitimate, cognatic line. *Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, son of Isabella, second daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon. This Robert Bruce was regent of Scotland sometime during the minority of King Alexander III and was occasionally recognized as a tanist of the Scottish throne. In the succession dispute, he pleaded tanistry and proximity in degree of kinship to the deceased King, his descent being a generation shorter. *John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, son of Henry de Hastings, son of Ada, third daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon. *Floris V, Count of Holland, son of William II, Count of Holland, son of Floris IV, Count of Holland, son of William I, Count of Holland, son of Ada, daughter of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon.

Great Cause family tree  The arguments  In reality only four of these men had genuine claims to the throne: John Hastings, John Balliol, Robert de Brus and Floris V. Of these only Bruce and Balliol had realistic grounds on which to claim the crown. The rest merely wished to have their claims put on the legal record. John Hastings, an Englishman with extensive estates in Scotland, could not succeed to the throne by any of the normal rules governing feudal legacy and instead had his lawyers argue that Scotland was not a true kingdom at all, based, amongst other things, on the fact that Scots kings were traditionally neither crowned nor anointed. As such, by the normal rules of feudal law the kingdom should be split amongst the direct descendants of the co-heiresses of David I. Unsurprisingly, a court made up of Scots nobles rejected these arguments out of hand. John Balliol had the simplest, and thus, by some measure, the strongest claim of the four. By the tradition of primogeniture, he was the rightful claimant, and that tradition had been followed in choosing heirs to the Scottish throne since King Edgar in 1097. Indeed, the other Scottish claimants (including Bruce) had already tacitly acknowledged the tradition of primogeniture in allowing Margaret of Norway to claim the throne. Balliol also argued that the Kingdom of Scotland was, as royal estate, indivisible as an entity. This was necessary to prevent the kingdom being split equally amongst the heirs as Hastings was suggesting should be done. Robert de Brus (also spelled Bruce), Lord of Annadale, was the next in line to the throne according to proximity of blood. As such, his arguments centered on this being a more suitable way to govern the succession than primogeniture. His lawyers suggested that this was the case in most successions and as such had become something of a 'natural law'. Unfortunately for Bruce, the Scots' tradition for the preceding 200 years had been demonstrably different, relying on primogeniture instead. They also put before the court the suggestion that Alexander III had designated Bruce as heir when he himself was still childless.Palgrave, F., Documents Illustrative of the History of Scotland, 1873 Whatever the truth of this, the fact remained that Alexander did eventually produce a male heir and that in the same period John Balliol also produced sons, all of whom had a stronger claim than Bruce. Bruce also began by arguing alongside Balliol that the kingdom was indivisible, but when it became apparent that his own claim was going to fail he instead performed a rapid U-turn and joined Hastings in arguing that it be split amongst the three senior claimants. Floris V's argument was that Earl David had resigned the right of himself and his heirs. Although Floris was not a direct descendant of David I, he claimed that David had given up his right to the throne to his brother William in exchange for a grant of land in Aberdeenshire. If true, this would make Floris the rightful King of Scotland. Floris claimed that although he did not possess copies of the documents detailing the handover of power, one must exist somewhere in Scotland, and Edward postponed the court for a full ten months while a search was made through various castle treasuries. No copy was found at the time, but copies later surfaced at Pluscarden. One of the early \\"certified copies\\", dating the certification seals of the bishop of Moray and the prior of Pluscarden to 1291, is currently located in the Hague. This document is thought to be a forgery. Floris's case was rejected for lack of evidence. However, there is evidence that he entered into an agreement with Bruce in which if one of them was to successfully claim the throne, he would grant the other one third of the kingdom as a feudal fief. Other clauses in the agreement strongly suggest that of the two, only Bruce could really expect to be a successful claimant. This has been interpreted to mean that Floris and Bruce were in collusion, with Bruce hoping that taken together their arguments could defeat Balliol, with Bruce's claim then being upheld in favour of Floris'. It is striking that there is no record of Bruce and Floris being at loggerheads during the proceedings.  Election  Edward delivered the judgement of the jurors on the Scottish case on 17 November 1292 in favour of John Balliol, with his son Edward becoming heir designate. This decision had the support of the majority of Scots nobles and magnates, even a number of those appointed by Bruce as auditors. Of special note was the support of John II Comyn, another competitor and head of the most powerful baronial family in Scotland, who was married to Balliol's sister, Eleanor. In later years the Comyn family remained staunch supporters of the Balliol claim to the throne.

The franchise extends to all citizens aged 16 and over, and voting is mandatory (with a few exceptions) for all those who are between 18 and 70 years of age. The President and the Vice-President are elected in one ballot, for a four-year term, by direct popular vote, using a runoff voting system: a second vote is held if no party wins more than 45% of the votes, or more than 40% with also at least 10 percentage points more than the runner-up. Before the 1995 election, the president and vice-president were both elected by an electoral college. The National Congress (Congreso Nacional) has two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies of the Nation (C√°mara de Diputados de la Naci√≥n) has 257 members, elected for a four-year term in each electoral district (23 Provinces and the Autonomous city of Buenos Aires) by proportional representation using the D'Hondt method, with half of the seats renewed every two years in all districts. The Senate of the Nation (Senado de la Naci√≥n) has 72 members, elected for a six-year term in three-seat constituencies (23 provinces and the Autonomous city of Buenos Aires) for a six-year term, with two seats awarded to the largest party or coalition and one seat to the second largest party or coalition. One-third of the constituencies are renewed every two years. In 2001 the whole senate was renewed. A quota law lays down that at least a third of the candidates on the ballots presented by each party participating in legislative elections must be women. Provincial elections Provincial law and constitutions, controlled by provincial legislatures regulate elections at the provincial level and local level. Since the separation of powers applies to provinces as well as the federal government, provincial legislatures and the executive (the governor) are elected separately. Governors are elected in all provinces. All members of provincial legislatures and territorial jurisdiction legislature are elected. As a matter of convenience and cost-saving, elections for many of these provincial and local offices are held at the same time as the federal presidential elections. There is a handful of provinces, however, that instead hold their elections separately.

Most people are able to carry the meningococcus bacteria safely with no ill effects. However, meningococcal disease can cause meningitis and sepsis, resulting in brain damage, failure of various organs, severe skin and soft-tissue damage, and death. Immunisation with MeNZB requires three doses, administered approximately six weeks apart (except in newborns, who have them in conjunction with their 6-week, 3-month and 5-month injections). People who have been fully immunised may still carry the meningococcus bacteria and may still contract meningococcal disease. Components Each dose is 0.5 ml and contains: *25 mcg of outer membrane vesicles from the Neisseria meningitidis group B strain NZ98/254. The vaccine does not contain any whole bacteria (alive or dead). The \\"outer membrane vesicles\\" it contains are a small part of the \\"skin\\" of the bacteria that let the immune system recognise and prepare for being infected with the real thing. MeNZB vaccine does not contain any human, blood, or bovine (cow)products, egg products, neomycin or the preservative thiomersal (mercury). There are no live meningococcal bacteria in the vaccine and it is not possible to catch the disease or become a carrier of the disease from the vaccine. *1.65 mg of aluminium hydroxide (an adjuvant). The immune system will normally not mount an immune response to the outer membrane vesicles if they are presented alone. The presence of the adjuvant forces the immune system to respond to the membrane vesicles by acting to prevent their breakdown and elimination, while causing local tissue damage to provoke the desired immune reaction. *histidine (to stabilise the pH). The histidine pH buffer is to ensure the vaccine stays as close as possible to the pH of human body fluids. This is to ensure the immune system does not waste time trying to neutralise the vaccine instead of responding to the outer membrane vesicles. *normal saline. The saline (sterile salt and water) is also like packaging. It is required so that all of the above can be dissolved into a solution that can be injected. It is the same salinity (saltiness) as normal human body fluid. The antigen in MeNZB is prepared from B:4:P1.7b,4 (NZ 98/254 ) N. meningitidis strain, grown in a fermentor. The bacteria are grown in a synthetic culture medium containing sugar, essential amino acids and essential elements such as iron and potassium. The fermentation does not use bovine or porcine products. The cellular outer membranes are extracted with the detergent deoxycholate, which kills the bacteria. Outer membrane vesicles are purified out of the culture medium by ultracentrifugation, stabilised by histidine and then adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide Al(OH)3 as an adjuvant. Purification is achieved by ultrafiltration/diafiltration. Impact Since its introduction the vaccine has had a dramatic impact on the meningitis epidemic that broke out in 2004. In April 2008 it was announced by the New Zealand Ministry of Health that the MeNZB vaccination programme will be completed by 31 December 2008, and that after this period vaccination would require authorization of a GP. Reasons given for this halt of the programme include that the epidemic was coming to an end, and that immune protection given by the vaccine is only short-term.Ministry of Health statement, http://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/menzb-vaccine-helped-curb- epidemic The primary analysis estimated MeNZB to have an effectiveness of 77% after 3 doses and a mean follow-up time of 3.2 years. As N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis are closely related bacteria and have 80‚Äì90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines against N. gonorrhoeae infections is plausible. A study published in 2017 showed that MeNZB vaccine provided a partial protection against Gonorrhea.The vaccine efficiency was calculated to be 31%.

This rapid expansion increased the linear dimensions of the early universe by a factor of at least 1026 (and possibly a much larger factor), and so increased its volume by a factor of at least 1078. Expansion by a factor of 1026 is equivalent to expanding an object 1 nanometer (10‚àí9 m, about half the width of a molecule of DNA) in length to one approximately 10.6 light years (about 62 trillion miles) long. Inflationary epoch The expansion is thought to have been triggered by the phase transition that marked the end of the preceding grand unification epoch at approximately 10‚àí36 seconds after the Big Bang. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a scalar field called the inflaton field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated a repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space. This expansion explains various properties of the current universe that are difficult to account for without such an inflationary epoch. It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10‚àí33 and 10‚àí32 seconds after the Big Bang. The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflaton field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, repopulating the universe with a dense, hot mixture of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons as it entered the electroweak epoch. On 17 March 2014, astrophysicists of the BICEP2 collaboration announced the detection of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum, providing the first clear experimental evidence for cosmological inflation and the Big Bang. However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the cosmic inflation findings was reported. A preprint released by the Planck team in September 2014, eventually accepted in 2016, provided the most accurate measurement yet of dust, concluding that the signal from dust is the same strength as that reported from BICEP2. On January 30, 2015, a joint analysis of BICEP2 and Planck data was published and the European Space Agency announced that the signal can be entirely attributed to dust in the Milky Way. In 2015, the BICEP2, Keck Array and Planck data was combined within a joint analysis; a March 2015 publication in Physical Review Letters set a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of .

According to Human Rights Watch, the Cuban government represses nearly all forms of political dissent. Background =1959 Cuban Revolution= Fidel Castro came to power with the Cuban Revolution of 1959. By the end of 1960, according to Paul H. Lewis in Authoritarian Regimes in Latin America, all opposition newspaper had been closed down and all radio and television stations were in state control. Lewis states that moderate teachers and professors were purged, about 20,000 dissidents were held and tortured in prisons. Homosexuals as well as other \\"deviant\\" groups who were barred from military conscription, were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in camps called \\"Military Units to Aid Production\\" in the 1960s, and were subjected to political \\"reeducation\\". Some of Castro's military commanders brutalized the inmates. In nearly all areas of government, loyalty to the regime became the primary criterion for all appointments. Government authority * The media is operated under the Cuban Communist Party‚Äôs Department of Revolutionary Orientation, which \\"develops and coordinates propaganda strategies\\". * A Human Rights Watch 1999 report on Cuba notes that Cuba has penalties for anyone who \\"threatens, libels or slanders, defames, affronts (injuria) or in any other way insults (ultraje) or offends, with the spoken word or in writing, the dignity or decorum of an authority, public functionary, or his agents or auxiliaries\\". There are even harsher penalties for those who show contempt for the President of the Council of the State, the President of the National Assembly of Popular Power, the members of the Council of the State or the Council of Ministers, or the Deputies of the National Assembly of the Popular Power. * There is a three-month to one-year sentence for anyone who \\"publicly defames, denigrates, or scorns the Republic's institutions, the political, mass, or social organizations of the country, or the heroes or martyrs of the nation\\". * Cubans are not allowed to produce, distribute or store publications without telling to authorities. * Social dangerousness, defined as violations of socialist morality, can warrant \\"pre-criminal measures\\" and \\"therapeutic measures\\". * Regarding institutions, the Human Rights Watch report notes that the Interior Ministry has principal responsibility for monitoring the Cuban population for signs of dissent. * In 1991, two new mechanisms for internal surveillance and control emerged. Communist Party leaders organized the Singular Systems of Vigilance and Protection (Sistema Unico de Vigilancia y Protecci√≥n, SUVP). Rapid Action Brigades (Brigadas de Acci√≥n Rapida, also referred to as Rapid Response Brigades, or Brigadas de Respuesta R√°pida) observe and control dissidents. The regime also \\"maintains academic and labor files (expedientes escolares y laborales) for each citizen, in which officials record actions or statements that may bear on the person's loyalty to the regime. Before advancing to a new school or position, the individual's record must first be deemed acceptable\\". =Situation today= In 2017, Cuba was described as one of only two \\"authoritarian regimes\\" in the Americas by The Economist's 2017 Democracy Index. The island had the second highest number of imprisoned journalists in the world in 2008, second only to the People's Republic of China, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an international press organization. The military of Cuba is a central organization; it controls 60 percent of the economy and is Ra√∫l Castro's base. According to a paper published in the Harvard International Review, dissident groups are weak and infiltrated by Cuban state security. Media is totally state-controlled. Dissidents find it difficult to organize and \\"Many of their leaders have shown enormous courage in defying the regime. Yet, time and again, the security apparatus has discredited or destroyed them. They do not represent a major threat to the regime.\\" Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez assailed the Cuban thaw as a capitulation to the Castro's regime The paper Can Cuba Change? in the National Endowment for Democracy's Journal of Democracy states that about nine-tenths of the populace forms an economically and politically oppressed underclass and \\"Using the principles of democracy and human rights to unite and mobilize this vast, dispossessed majority in the face of a highly repressive regime is the key to peaceful change\\". Working people are a critical source of discontent. The only legal trade union is controlled by the government and strikes are banned. Afro-Cuban dissidents have also risen, fueled by racism in Cuba. In 2012, Amnesty International warned that repression of Cuban dissidents was on the rise over the past two years, citing the Wilmar Villar hunger strike death, as well as the arrests of prisoners of conscience Yasmin Conyedo Riveron, Yusmani Rafael Alvarez Esmori, and Antonio Michel and Marcos M√°iquel Lima Cruz. The Cuban Commission of Human Rights reported that there were 6,602 detentions of government opponents in 2012, up from 4,123 in 2011. Dissident groups There are a number of opposition parties and groups that campaign for political change in Cuba. Though amendments to the Cuban Constitution of 1992 decriminalized the right to form political parties other than the Communist Party of Cuba, these parties are not permitted to engage in public political activities on the island. * Alpha 66, an organization that targets the Cuban government of Fidel Castro. * Christian Liberation Movement ‚Äì Movement and group of Catholics that was founded by Oswaldo Pay√°. * Ladies in White received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament in 2005. * Lawton Foundation ‚Äì An organization to promote the \\"study, defense and denunciation of human rights inside Cuba\\". The group was formed by Oscar El√≠as Biscet. * Cuban Democratic Directorate ‚Äì Non-governmental organization aligned with the Centrist Democrat International and International Democratic Union. * Omega 7, a small terrorist group that operated against the Cuban government from the 1960s to the 1980s. * Rosa Parks Feminist Movement for Civil Rights. * Varela Project ‚Äì The organization reported having collected more than 10,000 signatures for a referendum requesting freedom of the press, freedom to form political parties, and freedom to create private business. According to Amnesty International their methods were non-violent, and their philosophy was democratic. The government responded with its own petition drive to make the socialist system \\"untouchable\\", for which the government claimed 99% voter approval. Fidel Castro said that, \\"The revolutionary process of socialism cannot be reversed\\" and \\"Cuba will never return to capitalism\\". * Yo No Coopero Con La Dictadura () ‚Äì Organization of civil resistance campaign. Dissidents =Black Spring= During the \\"Black Spring\\" in 2003, the regime imprisoned 75 dissidents, including 29 journalists. Their cases were reviewed by Amnesty International who officially adopted them as prisoners of conscience. To the original list of 75 prisoners of conscience resulting from the wave of arrests in spring 2003, Amnesty International added four more dissidents in January 2004. They had been arrested in the same context as the other 75 but did not receive their sentences until much later. These prisoners have since been released in the face of international pressure. Tripartite talks between the Cuban government, the Catholic Church in Cuba and the Spanish government were initiated in spring 2010 in reaction to the controversial death of political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo in February 2010 following a hunger strike amid reports of massive abuse at the hands of prison staff. These negotiations resulted in a July 2010 agreement that all remaining prisoners of the 'Group of 75' would be freed. Spain offered to receive those prisoners who would agree to be released and immediately exiled together with their families. Of the 79 prisoners of conscience 56 were still behind bars at the time of the agreement. Of the total group, 21 are still living in Cuba today whereas the others are in exile, most of them in Spain. The final two prisoners were released on 23 March 2011. =Notable people= Antonio Rodiles, Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez and Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat in 2017 * Manuel V√°zquez Portal, a poet, writer, and a journalist, received the 2003 CPJ International Press Freedom Award. * H√©ctor Maseda Guti√©rrez, a jailed nuclear engineer and journalist, received the 2008 CPJ International Press Freedom Award. * Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez (known as Ant√∫nez) was jailed for criticizing communism and spent 17 years in jail until released in 2007. As the longest-serving jailed black dissident when he was released, he has been referred to as Cuba's Nelson Mandela. *Jorge Mas Canosa (1939-1997), founder of the Cuban American National Foundation *Jesus Permuy, human rights activist, founder of the Human Rights Center of Miami * Gorki √Åguila, musician * Jose Luis Llovio-Menendez, bureaucrat, defected in 1981. * Rafael del Pino D√≠az, Brigadier General. Highest government official to have defected so far, in 1987 Independent bloggers The Foreign Policy magazine named Yoani S√°nchez one of the 10 Most Influential Intellectuals of Latin America, the only woman on the list. An article in El Nuevo Herald by Ivette Leyva Martinez, speaks to the role played by Yoani Sanchez and other young people, outside the Cuban opposition and dissidence movements, in working towards a free and democratic Cuba today: On 29 March 2009, Yoani S√°nchez, at Tania Bruguera's performance where a podium with an open mic was staged for people to have one minute of uncensored public speech, S√°nchez was among people to publicly criticize censorship and said that \\"the time has come to jump over the wall of control\\". The government condemned the event. Yoani S√°nchez is under permanent surveillance by Cuba's police force, which camps outside her home. June 2010 letter to United States Congress On Thursday, 10 June 2010, seventy-four of Cuba's dissidents signed a letter to the United States Congress in support of a bill that would lift the US travel ban for Americans wishing to visit Cuba. The signers include blogger Yoani Sanchez and hunger striker Guillermo Farinas, as well as Elizardo Sanchez, head of Cuba's most prominent human rights group and Miriam Leiva, who helped found the Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White, a group of wives and mothers of jailed dissidents. The letter supports a bill introduced on 23 February by Rep. Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat, that would bar the president from prohibiting travel to Cuba or blocking transactions required to make such trips. It also would bar the White House from stopping direct transfers between US and Cuban banks. The signers stated that: > We share the opinion that the isolation of the people of Cuba benefits the > most inflexible interests of its government, while any opening serves to > inform and empower the Cuban people and helps to further strengthen our > civil society. The Center for Democracy in the Americas, a Washington-based group supporting the bill, issued a press release stating that \\"74 of Cuba's most prominent political dissidents have endorsed the Peterson-Moran legislation to end the travel ban and expand food exports to Cuba because in their words it is good for human rights, good for alleviating hunger, and good for spreading information and showing solidarity with the Cuban people. Their letter answers every argument the pro-embargo forces use to oppose this legislation. This, itself, answers the question 'who is speaking for the Cuban people in this debate?' - those who want to send food and Americans to visit the island and stand with ordinary Cubans, or those who don't. If Cuba's best known bloggers, dissidents, hunger strikers, and other activists for human rights want this legislation enacted, what else needs be said?\\" The Center also hosts English as well as the Spanish version of the letter signed by the 74 dissidents. Hunger strikes Pedro Luis Boitel, a poet who died on hunger strike. On 3 April 1972, Pedro Luis Boitel, an imprisoned poet and dissident, declared himself on hunger strike. After 53 days on hunger strike without receiving medical assistance and receiving only liquids, he died of starvation on 25 May 1972. His last days were related by his close friend, poet Armando Valladares. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the C√≥lon Cemetery in Havana. Guillermo Fari√±as did a seven-month hunger strike to protest against the extensive Internet censorship in Cuba. He ended it in Autumn 2006, with severe health problems although still conscious. Reporters Without Borders awarded its cyber-freedom prize to Guillermo Fari√±as in 2006. Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez (known as Ant√∫nez) has done hunger strikes. In 2009, following the end of his 17-year imprisonment, Ant√∫nez, his wife Iris, and Diosiris Santana P√©rez started a hunger strike to support other political prisoners. Leaders from Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Argentina declared their support for Ant√∫nez. Orlando Zapata Tamayo, an imprisoned activist and dissident, died while on a hunger strike for more than 80 days. Zapata went on the strike in protest against the Cuban government for having denied him the choice of wearing white dissident clothes instead of the designated prisoner uniform, as well as denouncing the living conditions of other prisoners. As part of his claim, Zapata was asking for the prisoners conditions to be comparable to those that Fidel Castro had while incarcerated after his 1953 attack against the Moncada Barracks. In 2012, Wilmar Villar Mendoza died after a 50+ day hunger strike. Cuban exiles More than one million Cubans of all social classes have left the island to the United States, and to Spain, the UK, Canada, Mexico and other countries. Because leaving required exit permit and a substantial amount of money, most Cubans could never leave Cuban soil. Many Cuban exiles have actively campaigned for a change of government in Cuba.

He flourished at the end of the ninth or at the beginning of the tenth century. He was a native of Damagan, the capital of the province of Qumis, in the former state of Tabaristan, (present-day Semnan province of Iran), as is shown by his two surnames, the latter of which is found only in Qirqisani. His attitude to Anan ben David and his violent opposition to the Ananites (i.e., the first Karaites, Anan's followers and immediate successors) are characteristic of his place in Karaism. At first he esteemed Anan highly, calling him rosh hamaskilim (\\"chief of the scholars\\"); but later he despised him and called him rosh ha-kesilim (\\"chief of the fools\\"). Nevertheless, Daniel's opinions were respected by the Karaites. Daniel later immigrated to Jerusalem, and founded the order of the \\"Mourners of Zion.\\" He may have built the oldest Karaite Synagogue, which is located in Jerusalem. Espousing proto-Zionist views, he urged his fellow Karaites to return to Israel, and called those who opposed doing so \\"fools who draw the Lord's wrath\\" in his Epistle to the Diaspora. As regards Daniel's theories, he denied that speculation could be regarded as a source of knowledge, and, probably in accordance with this tenet, he maintained, in opposition to Anan, the principle that the Biblical laws must not be interpreted allegorically, nor explained contrary to the simple text (see below). He evinces little regard for science, as, for instance, when he asserts that it is forbidden to determine the beginning of the new moon by calculation, after the manner of the Rabbis, because such calculations are condemned like astrology, and the practise of them is threatened with severe punishment, according to Isaiah xlvii. 13‚Äì14. Yet Daniel himself, in his commentary to Leviticus xxvi., indulges in long reflections on the theodicy and on the suffering of the pious. His conception of the angels, also, is most extraordinary. He says that wherever \\"mal'akhim\\" (angels) are mentioned in the Bible, the designation does not refer to living, speaking beings who act as messengers, but to forces of nature, as fire, fog, winds, etc., by means of which God performs His works (compare Maimonides, \\"Moreh,\\" ii. 6). This may be due to the influence of the Sadducees (who also denied the existence of angels; compare Acts xxiii. 8), in view of the fact that works circulated among the earlier Karaites named after Zadok and containing Sadducee opinions. Legal Decisions Daniel favored a rigorous interpretation of the Torah. The following decisions of his have been preserved: It is forbidden to do any work whatever on the Shabbat (Sabbath)‚Äîeven to clean the hands with powder‚Äîor to have any work done on the Sabbath by a non-Jew, whether gratuitously, or for wages or any other compensation. The burning of lights is forbidden not only on Friday evenings, but also on the evenings of the festivals. In the description in Lev. xxiii. 40 of the trees which, according to Daniel, were used in erecting the sukkah, the phrase \\"periez hadar\\" (the fruit of goodly trees) is more definitely explained by \\"kappot temarim\\" (branches of palms), the palm being distinguished for its beauty (Cant. vii. 8). Like Anan, Benjamin al-Nahawandi, and Ishmael al-Ukbari, Daniel forbade in the Diaspora the eating of those animals that were used for sacrifice, adding to the proofs of his predecessors others drawn from Hosea ix. 4 and Isa. lxvi. 3. The prohibition contained in Exodus xxiii. 19 (\\"Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk\\") must not be interpreted allegorically, as Anan interpreted it, but literally. The priest carried out the injunction to \\"wring [pinch] off the head\\" of the bird (\\"meliqah,\\" Lev. i. 15) by cutting the head off entirely, after the slaughtering. The clean birds are not recognizable by certain signs, as the Rabbinites assert, but the names of the birds as found in the Pentateuch are decisive (and as these can not always be identified, the Karaites make the class of forbidden birds very large). Among the locusts only the four species expressly named in Lev. xi. 22 are permitted as food. It is forbidden to eat eggs because they must be considered as living things that can not be slaughtered, as is proved by Deut. xxii. 6‚Äì7, where it is permitted to take the young, but not the eggs. Of fish the eggs only are permitted; the blood is forbidden. The leper must still be considered as unclean (this, too, is directed against Anan, who had held that the laws regarding the clean and the unclean were not applicable in the Diaspora). The carcass of an animal, however, ceases to be unclean after use has been made of it in any way, as is proved by Lev. vii. 24. Influence of Islam and Talmud In regard to the levirate marriage Daniel agrees with Anan that \\"ahim,\\" in Deut. xxv. 5, does not mean \\"brothers,\\" which would violate the prohibition contained in Lev. xviii. 16, but \\"relations.\\" The story of Judah and his sons (Genesis xxxviii. 8) proves nothing, because at that time the prohibition against marrying a brother's wife did not exist. The prohibition contained in Lev. xviii. 18 can not be taken literally (as the Rabbinites take it), for the wife's sister is forbidden under any circumstance, just as is the husband's brother (there is here an example of the method of analogy, \\"heqqesh\\"); it is rather the stepsister of the wife that is meant in the passage in question; e.g., the daughter of the father-in-law's wife whom the last named had by her first husband. In this case the prohibition ends with the wife's death. The daughter is not excluded from the heritage, as the Rabbinites say, although her portion is less than that of the son, being only one-third; for in the law of valuation in connection with vows (Lev. xxvii.) women were valued less than men. In conformity with this law, the mother also receives one-third. Daniel was possibly influenced here by the shariah (see Quran, sura iv. 12, 175). In other respects Daniel follows the Talmud in holding that the descendants of one entitled to a portion succeed to his entire rights; the children of the son‚Äîi.e., grandchildren‚Äîtaking precedence over the daughter, their aunt. Finally, Daniel holds that responsibility for the observance of the commandments must begin not with the thirteenth, but with the twentieth year; that the New-Year begins on the tenth of Tishri, as follows from Ezek. xl. 1; and that Muslims also may act as witnesses of the new moon's appearance. Daniel wrote several works in the Hebrew language, all of which, save for a few quotations and fragments, have been lost. There is undeniable evidence that he compiled a legal code (Sefer ha-Mitzvot or \\"Book of Commandments\\"), and a work on the rights of inheritance. The latter, against which Saadia directed his polemics, was perhaps merely a part of the code just mentioned. He also wrote commentaries to the Pentateuch, to Joshua, and to Judges, and probably to other Biblical books. They were not running commentaries, but explanations to certain passages, and contained also digressions. Words were often explained in Arabic. These commentaries, especially that to the Pentateuch, probably contained many of the decisions enumerated above.

However, the Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy is rejected by several U.S. historians as a fringe theory. Ten official U.S. inquiries The U.S. government made nine official inquiries into the attack between 1941 and 1946, and a tenth in 1995. They included an inquiry by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox (1941); the Roberts Commission (1941‚Äì42); the Hart Inquiry (1944); the Army Pearl Harbor Board (1944); the Naval Court of Inquiry (1944); the Hewitt investigation; the Clarke investigation; the Congressional InquiryIn general, \\"Congressional inquiry\\" refers to any United States congressional hearing. (Pearl Harbor Committee; 1945‚Äì46); a top-secret inquiry by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, authorized by Congress and carried out by Henry Clausen (the Clausen Inquiry; 1946); and the Thurmond-Spence hearing, in April 1995, which produced the Dorn Report. (Source: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Online page created 24 December 1996, begun by Larry W. Jewell.) The inquiries reported incompetence, underestimation, and misapprehension of Japanese capabilities and intentions; problems resulting from excessive secrecy about cryptography; division of responsibility between Army and Navy (and lack of consultation between them); and lack of adequate manpower for intelligence (analysis, collection, processing).Holmes, Double-Edged Secrets; Prange et al, Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History Investigators prior to Clausen did not have the security clearance necessary to receive the most sensitive information, as Brigadier General Henry D. Russell had been appointed guardian of the pre-war decrypts, and he alone held the combination to the storage safe.Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement, Henry C. Clausen and Bruce Lee, HarperCollins, 2001, p. 269. Clausen claimed, in spite of Secretary Stimson having given him a letter informing witnesses he had the necessary clearances to require their cooperation, he was repeatedly lied to until he produced copies of top secret decrypts, thus proving he indeed had the proper clearance. Stimson's report to Congress, based on Clausen's work, was limited due to secrecy concerns, largely about cryptography. A more complete account was not made publicly available until the mid-1980s, and not published until 1992 as Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement. Reaction to the 1992 publication has varied. Some regard it as a valuable addition to understanding the events, Review of Henry C. Clausen and Bruce Lee, Pearl Harbor: Final Judgment (New York: Crown Books, 1992). while one historian noted Clausen did not speak to General Walter Short, Army commander at Pearl Harbor during the attack, and called Clausen's investigation \\"notoriously unreliable\\" in several aspects.Wohlstetter, Pearl Harbor ‚Äì Warning and Decision, p. 35.  Diplomatic situation  Some authors argue that US President Roosevelt was actively provoking Japan in the weeks prior to the Pearl Harbor attack. These authors assert that Roosevelt was imminently expecting and seeking war, but wanted Japan to take the first overtly aggressive action.Costello, John.

Roosevelt's inner circle, remarked that: Another \\"eye witness viewpoint\\" akin to Beatty's is provided by Roosevelt's administrative assistant at the time of Pearl Harbor, Jonathan Daniels; it is a telling comment about FDR's reaction to the attack ‚Äì \\"The blow was heavier than he had hoped it would necessarily be. ... But the risks paid off; even the loss was worth the price. ...\\"1941: Pearl Harbor Sunday: The End of an Era, in \\"The Aspirin Age ‚Äì 1919‚Äì1941,\\" edited by Isabel Leighton, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1949, page 490. \\"Ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor\\", Henry L. Stimson, United States Secretary of War at the time \\"entered in his diary the famous and much-argued statement ‚Äì that he had met with President Roosevelt to discuss the evidence of impending hostilities with Japan, and the question was 'how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.'\\"Cumings, Bruce: \\"Parallax Visions: Making Sense of American-East Asian Relations\\" Duke 1999 p. 47; Text above from Wikipedia's Henry L. Stimson However Stimson, in reviewing his diary after the war, recalled that the commanders at Pearl Harbor had been warned of the possibility of attack, and that the poor state of readiness that the attack had revealed was a surprise to him: > [Yet] General Short had been told the two essential facts: 1) a war with > Japan is threatening, 2) hostile action by Japan is possible at any moment. > Given these two facts, both of which were stated without equivocation in the > message of Nov. 27, the outpost commander should be on the alert to make his > fight ...

Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically in support of the British. An attack by Japan would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox, two of Roosevelt's military advisors, on October 7, 1940, there is no evidence to suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett's claims of evidence he did is nonexistent.Young, p. 2. Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, \\"If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better,\\" of the eight \\"plans\\" (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollom memo was the inspiration. Nonetheless, in Day of Deceit Stinnett claims all action items were implemented.Notes for Chapter Two, paperback edition, pp. 321‚Äì322, notes 7, 8, and 11. Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay The United States in the Pacific, wrote, \\"[t]hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the United States into it.\\"Parillo, Mark, \\"The United States in the Pacific\\", in Higham, Robin, and Harris, Stephen, Why Air Forces Fail: The Anatomy of Defeat (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2006), p. 289. Furthermore, on 5 November 1941, in a joint memo, Stark, CNO, and Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, warned, \\"if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached.... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided....\\"Prange, Gordon W., Dillon, Katherine V., and Goldstein, Donald M. At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor (New York: Penguin, 1991), p. 336. Additionally, in a 21 November 1941 memo, Brigadier Leonard T. Gerow, head of Army War Plans, stated, \\"one of our present major objectives [is] the avoidance of war with Japan...[and to] insure continuance of material assistance to the British.\\"Prange, et al., At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor (New York: Penguin, 1991), p. 369. He concluded, \\"[I]t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe...\\" Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a 15 May 1940 telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would \\"quiet\\" Japan, following with a 4 October message requesting a USN courtesy visit to Singapore aimed at \\"preventing the spreading of the war\\"Prange et al., At Dawn We Slept, p. 861. And Stark's own Plan Dog expressly stated, \\"Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany...\\"Prange et al., At Dawn We Slept, quoted p. 861. Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark's views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt's express wish to aid Britain. Oliver Lyttelton, the British Minister of War Production, said, \\"... Japan was provoked into attacking the Americans at Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty of history ever to say that America was forced into the war. Everyone knows where American sympathies were. It is incorrect to say that America was truly neutral even before America came into the war on an all-out basis.\\"Gordon Prange, Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History, p. 35. How this demonstrates anything with regard to Japan is unclear. Rather, it refers to other aid to Britain. Lend-Lease, enacted in March 1941, informally declared the end of American neutrality in favor of the Allies by agreeing to supply Allied nations with war materials. In addition, Roosevelt authorized a so-called Neutrality Patrol, which would protect the merchantmen of one nation, namely Britain, from attack by another, Germany. This made shipping legitimate target of attack by submarine.Holwitt, Joel I. \\"Execute Against Japan\\", Ph.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 2005. Furthermore, Roosevelt ordered U.S. destroyers to report U-boats, then later authorized them to \\"shoot on sight\\". This made the U.S. a de facto belligerent. None was the act of a disinterested neutral, while all are unquestionably of assistance to Britain. When considering information like this as a point for or against, the reader must keep in mind questions such as: was this official privy to information about the U.S. government? Did he have communications with high-level administration figures such as President Roosevelt or Ambassador Joseph Grew? Is this just a strongly held personal opinion? Or were there measures justifying this view? If Britain, did, indeed know and chose to conceal, \\"withholding this vital intelligence only ran the risk of losing American trust\\",Parillo, in Higham and Harris, p. 289. and with it any further American aid, which would be reduced after the attack in any event. There is also a claim, first asserted in Toland's Infamy, that ONI knew about Japanese carrier movements. Toland cited entries from the diary of Rear Admiral J. E. Meijer Ranneft of the Dutch Navy for 2 December and 6 December. Ranneft attended briefings at ONI on these dates. According to Toland, Ranneft wrote that he was told by ONI that two Japanese carriers were northwest of Honolulu. However, the diary uses the Dutch abbreviation beW, meaning \\"westerly\\", contradicting Toland's claim. Nor did any other persons present at the briefings report hearing Toland's version. In their reviews of Infamy, David KahnThe New York Review of Books, May 27, 1982. and John C. ZimmermanIntelligence and National Security, Vol 17, No. 2, Summer 2002. suggested Ranneft's reference was to carriers near the Marshall Islands. Toland has made other conflicting and incorrect claims about the diary during lectures at the Holocaust denial organization the Institute for Historical Review. The diary states at 02:00 (6-12-41) Turner fears a sudden Japanese attack on Manila. At 14:00 the diary states \\"Everyone present on O.N.I. I speak to Director Admiral Wilkinson, Captain MacCollum, Lt. Cdr. Kramer ... They show me ‚Äì on my request ‚Äì the place of the 2 carriers (see 2‚Äì12‚Äì41) West of Honolulu. I ask what the idea is of these carriers on that place. The answer was: 'perhaps in connection with Japanese rapports [sic] on eventual American actions'. There is not one of ours who speaks about a possible air attack on Honolulu. I myself did not think of it because I believed everyone on Honolulu to be 100% on the alert, as everyone here on O.N.I. There prevails a tense state of mind at O.N.I.\\" These diary entries are provided (in Dutch) in the photo section in George Victor's The Pearl Harbor Myth: Rethinking the Unthinkable.photograph section following page 178. CBS correspondent Edward R. Murrow had a dinner appointment at the White House on 7 December. Because of the attack he and his wife only ate with Mrs. Roosevelt, but the president asked Murrow to stay afterwards. As he waited outside the Oval Office, Murrow observed government and military officials entering and leaving. He wrote after the war: One historian has written, however, that when Murrow met Roosevelt with William J. Donovan of the OSS that night, while the magnitude of the destruction at Pearl Harbor horrified the president, Roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men. According to Murrow, the president told him, \\"Maybe you think [the attack] didn't surprise us!\\" He said later, \\"I believed him\\", and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness. When allegations of Roosevelt's foreknowledge appeared after the war, John Gunther asked Murrow about the meeting. Murrow reportedly responded the full story would pay for his son's college education and \\"if you think I'm going to give it to you, you're out of your mind\\". Murrow did not write the story, however, before his death. = McCollum memo = The McCollum memo On October 7, 1940, Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. McCollum of the Office of Naval Intelligence submitted a memo to Navy Captains Walter S. Anderson and Dudley Knox, which details eight actions which might have the effect of provoking Japan into attacking the United States. The memo remained classified until 1994 and contains the notable line, \\"If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better.\\" Sections 9 and 10 of the memo are said by Gore Vidal to be the \\"smoking gun\\" revealed in Stinnett's book, suggesting it was central to the high level plan to lure the Japanese into an attack. Evidence the memo or derivative works actually reached President Roosevelt, senior administration officials, or the highest levels of U.S. Navy command, is circumstantial, at best. = Roosevelt's desire for war with Germany = U.S. propaganda poster calling for revenge for the Pearl Harbor attack. Theorists challenging the traditional view that Pearl Harbor was a surprise repeatedly note that Roosevelt wanted the U.S. to intervene in the war against Germany, though he did not say so officially. A basic understanding of the political situation of 1941 precludes any possibility the public wanted war. Thomas Fleming argued President Roosevelt wished for Germany or Japan to strike the first blow, but did not expect the United States to be hit as severely as it was in the attack on Pearl Harbor. An attack by Japan on the U.S. could not guarantee the U.S. would declare war on Germany.Prange, Pearl Harbor: The Verdict of History? After such an attack, American public anger would be directed at Japan, not Germany, just as happened. The Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan) called for each to aid another in defense; Japan could not reasonably claim America had attacked Japan if she struck first.Prange? For instance, Germany had been at war with the UK since 1939, and with the USSR since June 1941, without Japanese assistance. There had been a serious, if low-level, naval war going on in the Atlantic between Germany and the U.S. since summer of 1941, as well.Hitler versus Roosevelt?; Toland, Japan's War? Nevertheless, it was only Hitler's declaration of war on 11 December, unforced by treaty, that brought the U.S. into the European war. Clausen and Lee's Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement reproduces a Purple message, dated 29 November 1941, from the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin to Tokyo. A closing paragraph reads, \\"... He (Ribbentrop) also said that if Japan were to go to war with America, Germany would, of course, join in immediately, and Hitler's intention was that there should be absolutely no question of Germany making a separate peace with England. ...\\"Clausen & Lee, Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement, p. 367. While theorists challenging the conventional view that the attack was a surprise, treat this as a guarantee to join after Japan's attack, it can as easily be taken as a guarantee to come to Japan's aid, as Germany had done for Italy in Libya. Assertions that Japanese codes had already been broken U.S. signals intelligence in 1941 was both impressively advanced and uneven. In the past, the U.S. MI-8 cryptographic operation in New York City had been shut down by Henry Stimson (Hoover's newly appointed Secretary of State), citing \\"ethical considerations\\", which inspired its now broke former director, Herbert Yardley, to write a 1931 book, The American Black Chamber, about its successes in breaking other nations' crypto traffic. Most countries responded promptly by changing (and generally improving) their ciphers and codes, forcing other nations to start over in reading their signals. The Japanese were no exception. Nevertheless, U.S. cryptanalytic work continued after Stimson's action in two separate efforts: the Army's Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) and the Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) crypto group, OP-20-G. Cryptanalytic work was kept secret to such an extent, however, commands such as the 14th Naval District at Pearl Harbor were prohibited from working on codebreaking by Admiral Kelly Turner as a consequence of the bureaucratic infighting in Washington. By late 1941, those organizations had broken several Japanese ciphers, such as J19 and PA-K2, called Tsu and Oite respectively by the Japanese.Kahn's The Codebreakers has the specifies on these lower-level codes, beginning with LA, beginning on p. 14. The highest security diplomatic code, dubbed Purple by the U.S., had been broken, but American cryptanalysts had made little progress against the IJN's current Kaigun Ango Sho DWilford, Timothy. \\"Decoding Pearl Harbor\\", in The Northern Mariner, XII, #1 (January 2002), p. 18. (Naval Code D, called AN-1 by the U.S.;Wilford, p. 18. JN-25 after March 1942). In addition, there was a perennial shortage of manpower, thanks to penury on one hand and the perception of intelligence as a low-value career path on the other. Translators were over-worked, cryptanalysts were in short supply, and staffs were generally stressed. In 1942 Not every cryptogram was decoded . Japanese traffic was too heavy for the undermanned Combat Intelligence Unit. Furthermore, there were difficulties retaining good intelligence officers and trained linguists; most did not remain on the job for the extended periods necessary to become truly professional. For career reasons, nearly all wanted to return to more standard assignments. However, concerning the manning levels, \\"... just prior to World War II, [the US] had some 700 people engaged in the effort and [was], in fact, obviously having some successes.\\"U,.S. Navy Oral History Interview conducted by Cdr. \\"Irv\\" Newman (USN Retired) on May 4, 5, and 6, 1983, of Robert D. Ogg, SRH-255, declassified on 17 November 1983, p. 23. Commander Laurence Safford, SRH-149, pp. 6 and 19, shows 730. (SRH-149, via the FOIA appeal process, had all remaining redactions removed in July 2009. There remain several redactions in SRH-255.) Of these, 85% were tasked to decryption and 50% to translation efforts against IJN codes.Safford, loc. cit.. The nature and degree of these successes has led to great confusion among non-specialists. Furthermore, OP-20-GY \\"analysts relied as much on summary reports as on the actual intercepted messages.\\"Parillo, \\"The United States in the Pacific\\", in Higham and Harris, p. 290. The U.S. was also given decrypted messages by Dutch (NEI) intelligence, who like the others in the British‚ÄìDutch‚ÄìU.S. agreement to share the cryptographic load, shared information with allies. However, the U.S. refused to do likewise.C. H. Baker, \\"Nanyo\\" 1987. This was, at least in part, due to fears of compromise; sharing even between the US Navy and Army was restricted (e.g see Central Bureau). The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities. There were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with Magic was found in the desk of Brigadier General Edwin M. (Pa) Watson, the President's military aide.Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement, Henry C. Clausen and Bruce Lee, HarperCollins, 2001, p. 45. = Purple= The Japanese code dubbed \\"Purple\\", which was used by the Foreign Office and only for diplomatic (but not for military) messages, was broken by Army cryptographers in 1940. A 14-part message using this code, sent from Japan to its embassy in Washington, was decoded in Washington on 6 and 7 December. The message, which made plain the Japanese intention to break off diplomatic relations with the United States, was to be delivered by the Japanese ambassador at 1 p.m. Washington time (dawn in the Pacific). Colonel Rufus S. Bratton, then serving as an aide to Marshall, took this to mean that the Japanese intended to attack at dawn somewhere in the Pacific. Marshall ordered a warning message sent to American bases in the area, including Hawaii. Due to atmospheric transmission conditions the message was sent out via Western Union rather than the usual signal channels and was not received until the attack was already underway. The claim no pre-attack IJN message expressly mentioned Pearl Harbor is perhaps true. The claims that no Purple traffic pointed to Pearl Harbor may also be true, as the Foreign Office was not well thought of by the military and, during this period was routinely excluded from sensitive or secret material including war planning. It is also possible any such intercepts were not translated until after the attack, or indeed, after the war ended; some messages were not.Parker, Frederick D. Pearl Harbor Revisited: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence 1928-1941. (Ft. Meade, MD, undated PDF), pp.41 and 45. Found here (retrieved 16 May 2018). Stinnett, indeed, reproduces copies of messages not translated until after the war as \\"evidence\\". Day of Deceit, pp.50 and 51. In both instances, all traffic from these pre-attack intercepts has not yet been declassified and released to the public domain. Hence, any such claims are now indeterminate, pending a fuller accounting. Additionally, no decrypts have come to light of JN-25B traffic with any intelligence value prior to Pearl Harbor, and certainly no such has been identified. Such breaks as recorded by authors W. J. Holmes and Clay Blair Jr., were into the additive tables, which was a required second step of three (see above). The first 100 JN-25 decrypts from all sources in date/time order of translation have been released, and are available in the National Archives. The first JN-25B decrypt was in fact by HYPO (Hawaii) on 8 January 1942 (numbered #1 up JN-25B RG38 CNSG Library, Box 22, 3222/82 NA CP). The first 25 decrypts were very short messages or partial decrypts of marginal intelligence value. As Whitlock stated, \\"The reason that not one single JN-25 decrypt made prior to Pearl Harbor has ever been found or declassified is not due to any insidious cover-up... it is due quite simply to the fact that no such decrypt ever existed. It simply was not within the realm of our combined cryptologic capability to produce a usable decrypt at that particular juncture.\\"The Truth About Pearl Harbor: A Debate, Stephen Budiansky The Independent Institute 1/30/03. =JN-25= The JN-25 superencrypted code, and its cryptanalysis by the US, is one of the most debated portions of Pearl Harbor lore. JN-25 is the U.S. Navy's last of several names for the cryptosystem of the Imperial Japanese Navy, sometimes referred to as Naval Code D.And I Was There ‚Äì Pearl Harbor and Midway ‚Äì Breaking the Secret, Rear Admiral Edwin T. Layton (USN Retired) with Captain Roger Pineau (USNR Retired), and John Costello, William Morrow and Company, Inc., New York, NY, 1985, page 249 (taken from SRN-116741). Other names used for it include five-numeral, 5Num, five-digit, five-figure, AN (JN-25 Able), and AN-1 (JN-25 Baker), and so on.Some writers, notably Stinnett, have refused to recognize \\"5Num\\" as JN-25, despite years of research. See comprehensive end remarks with references to examples. Superenciphered codes of this sort were widely used and were the state of the art in practical cryptography at the time. JN-25 was very similar in principle to the British \\"Naval Cypher No. 3\\", known to have been broken by Germany during World War II.\\"Rhapsody in Purple: A New History of Pearl Harbor\\" in Cryptologia, July 1982, pp. 193‚Äì229, and October 1982, pp. 346‚Äì467. Once it was realized what sort of cryptosystem JN-25 was, how to attempt breaking into it was known. Stinnett notes the existence of a USN handbook for attacks on such a system, produced by OP-20-G. Even so, breaking any such code was not easy in actual practice. It took much effort and time, not least in accumulating sufficient 'cryptanalytic depth' in intercepted messages prior to the outbreak of hostilities when IJN radio traffic increased abruptly and substantially; prior to 7 December 1941, IJN radio traffic was limited, since the IJN played only a minor role in the war against China and therefore was only rarely required to send radio messages whatever the highest level crypto system might have been. (As well, interception of IJN traffic off China would have been at best spotty.) Rather oddly however, the official history of GYP-1 shows nearly 45,000 IJN messages intercepted during the period from 1 June 1941 until 4 December 1941. Thus, most Japanese encrypted broadcast military radio traffic was Army traffic associated with the land operations in China, none of which used IJN cryptography. Broadly, the cryptanalytic approach was related to cryptanalytic attacks used as long ago as the early 19th century; Scovell's analysis survives from Wellington's Peninsular Campaign. See Mark Urban, The Man Who Broke Napoleon's Codes: The Story of George Scovell (London: Faber, 2001). Breaking a superencrypted cipher like JN-25 was a three-step process: (a) determining the \\"indicator\\" method to establish the starting point within the additive cipher, (b) stripping away the superencryption to expose the bare code, and then (c) breaking the code itself. When JN-25 was first detected and recognized, such intercepted messages as were interceptable were collected (at assorted intercept stations around the Pacific by the Navy) in an attempt to accumulate sufficient depth to attempt to strip away the superencryption. Success at doing so was termed by the cryptographers a 'break' into the system. Such a break did not always produce a cleartext version of the intercepted message; only a break in the third phase could do so. Only after breaking the underlying code (another difficult process) would the message be available, and even then its meaning‚Äîin an intelligence sense‚Äîmight be less than fully clear. When a new edition was released, the cryptographers were forced to start again. The original JN-25A system replaced the 'Blue' code (as Americans called it), and used five-digit numbers, each divisible by three (and so usable as a quick, and somewhat reliable, error check, as well as something of a 'crib' to cryptanalysts), giving a total of 33,334 legal code values. To make it harder to crack a code value, meaningless additives (from a large table or book of five-digit numbers) were added arithmetically to each five-digit cipher element. JN-25B superseded the first release of JN-25 at the start of December 1940. JN-25B had 55,000 valid words, and while it initially used the same additive list, this was soon changed and the cryptanalysts found themselves entirely locked out again. Over the years, various claims have been made as to the progress made decrypting this system, and arguments made over when it was readable (in whole or part). Lt. \\"Honest John\\" Leitwiler,PHA, Part 10, p. 4810. Commander of Station CAST, the Philippines, stated in November 1941 that his staff could \\"walk right across\\" the number columns of the coded messages. He is frequently quoted in support of claims JN-25 was then mostly readable. This comment, however, refers not to the message itself but to the superenciphering additives and referred to the ease of attacking the code using a new method for discovery of additive values. The 16 November 1941 letterNavy Department, Philippines Operations Summaries, 3200/1-NSRS. to L.W. Parks (OP-20-GY) sent by Leitwiler states, \\"We have stopped work on the period 1 February to 31 July as we have all we can do to keep up with the current period. We are reading enough current traffic to keep two translators very busy.\\" Another document, Exhibit No. 151 (Memoranda from Captain L. F.

Tallied results for September, October, and November reveal roughly 3,800 code groups (out of 55,000, about 7%) had been recovered by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In all, the U.S. intercepted 26,581 messages in naval or related systems, not counting PURPLE, between September and December 1941 alone.Parker, Frederick D. Pearl Harbor Revisited: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence 1928-1941. (Ft. Meade, MD, undated PDF), p.40. Found here (retrieved 16 May 2018). So convinced were U.S. Navy planners Japan could only stage a single operation at a time,Wilmott, Chester. Barrier and the Javelin (Annapolis, 1983). after intercepts indicated a Japanese buildup for operations in the Dutch East Indies, for more than two weeks (between 1 November and 17 November), no JN-25 message not relating to that expected operation was even examined for intelligence value.Parker, p.40. Found here (retrieved 16 May 2018). Japanese intelligence Japanese espionage against Pearl Harbor involved at least two Abwehr agents. One of them, Otto Kuhn, was a sleeper agent living in Hawaii with his family. Kuhn was incompetent and there is no evidence he provided information of value. The other, Yugoslavian businessman Du≈°ko Popov, was a double agent, working for the XX Committee of MI5. In August 1941, he was sent by the Abwehr to the U.S., with an assignment list that included specific questions about military facilities in Oahu, including Pearl Harbor.Masterman, J. C., The Double-Cross System, appendix II. Although British Security Coordination introduced Popov to the FBI, the Americans seem to have paid little attention. It is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence contributed to J. Edgar Hoover's dismissing Popov's interest in Pearl Harbor as unimportant. There is nothing to show his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence, nor was he allowed to visit Hawaii. Popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack, ignored by the bungling FBI. The questions in his list were rambling and general, and in no way pointed to air attack on Pearl Harbor. Prange considered Popov's claim overblown, and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of Abwehr thoroughness. Furthermore, the Japanese did not need Abwehr assistance, having a consulate in Hawaii which had on its staff an undercover IJN intelligence officer, Takeo Yoshikawa.Stinnett insists on using his covername, for reasons that are not clear. The consulate had reported to IJN Intelligence for years, and Yoshikawa increased the rate of reports after his arrival. (Sometimes called a \\"master spy\\", he was in fact quite young, and his reports not infrequently contained errors.) Pearl Harbor base security was so lax Yoshikawa had no difficulty obtaining access, even taking the Navy's own harbor tourboat. (Even had he not, hills overlooking the Harbor were perfect for observation or photography, and were freely accessible.) Some of his information, and presumably other material from the Consulate, was hand-delivered to IJN intelligence officers aboard Japanese commercial vessels calling at Hawaii prior to the War; at least one is known to have been deliberately routed to Hawaii for this purpose during the summer. Most, however, seem to have been transmitted to Tokyo, almost certainly via cable (the usual communication method with Tokyo). Many of those messages were intercepted and decrypted by the U.S.; most were evaluated as routine intelligence gathering all nations do about potential opponents, rather than evidence of an active attack plan. None of those currently known, including those decrypted after the attack when there was finally time to return to those remaining undecrypted, explicitly stated anything about an attack on Pearl Harbor. In November 1941, advertisements for a new board game called \\"The Deadly Double\\" appeared in American magazines. These ads later drew suspicion for possibly containing coded messages, for unknown agents, giving advance notice of the Pearl Harbor attack. The ads were headlined \\"Achtung, Warning, Alerte!\\" and showed an air raid shelter and a pair of white and black dice which, despite being six-sided, carried the figures 12, 24, and XX, and 5, 7, and 0, respectively. It was suggested that these could possibly be interpreted as giving warning of an air raid on day \\"7\\" of month \\"12\\" at approximate latitude coordinate \\"20\\" (Roman numeral \\"XX\\").  Detection of Japanese radio transmissions en route  = Alleged detection by SS Lurline = There are claims that, as the Kido Butai (the Striking Force) steamed toward Hawaii, radio signals were detected that alerted U.S. intelligence to the imminent attack. For instance, the Matson liner , heading from San Francisco to Hawaii on its regular route, is said to have heard and plotted, via \\"relative bearings\\", unusual radio traffic in a telegraphic code very different from International MorseThe ARRL Handbook for the Radio Amateur, American Radio Relay League, Newington, CT. which persisted for several days, and came from signal source(s) moving in an easterly direction, not from shore stations‚Äîpossibly the approaching Japanese fleet. There are numerous Morse Code standards including those for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Greek. To the experienced radio operator, each has a unique and identifiable pattern. For example, kana, International Morse, and \\"Continental\\" Morse all have a specific rhythmic sound to the \\"dit\\" and \\"dah\\" combinations. This is how Lurlines radiomen, Leslie Grogan, a U.S. Navy reserve officer in naval communications, and with decades of maritime service in the PacificFarago, The Broken Seal: \\"Operation MAGIC\\" ‚Äì And the Road to Pearl Harbor, Bantam Books Paperback Edition, NY, 1968, Postscript \\"New Lights on the Pearl Harbor Attack\\", pages 379‚Äì402. identified the mooted signal source as Japanese and not, say, Russian. There are several problems with this analysis. Surviving officers from the Japanese ships state there was no radio traffic to have been overheard by anyone: their radio operators had been left in Japan to send fake traffic, and all radio transmitters aboard the ships (even those in the airplanes) were physically disabled to prevent any inadvertent or unauthorized broadcast.Prange et al, Pearl Harbor Papers; Dai Toa Senso Senkun [Koku][Hawai Kaisen no Bu] Dai Ichi Hen, Battle Lesson of Hawaii (a 1942 document) appendix in volume, Senshi S≈çsh≈ç: Hawai Sakusen, Tokyo: Boeicho Kenshujo Senshishitsu; 1967; David Kahn, The Code Breakers, p. 33. The Kido Butai was constantly receiving intelligence and diplomatic updates.This is stated in the second edition of Prange, Goldstein, and Dillon's Pear Harbor: The Verdict of History. The following analysis, based on his writings, is not universally conceded, eg by Goldstein. Regardless of whether the Kido Butai broke radio silence and transmitted, there was a great deal of radio traffic picked up by its antennas. In that time period, it was known for a radio signal to reflect from the ionosphere (an atmospheric layer); ionospheric skip could result in its reception hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Receiving antennas were sometimes detected passively 'rebroadcasting' signals that reached them (at much lower amplitudes, sufficiently low that the phenomenon was not of practical importance, nor even of much significance. Some have argued that, since the Kido Butai contained a large number of possible receiving antennas, it is conceivable the task force did not break radio silence but was detected anyway. Such detection would not have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.)Holmes, Double-Edged Secrets. To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close to one another in time. To plot the task force's course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time- pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the Kido Butai was detected, it was not tracked. The original records of Lurline surrendered to Lt. Cmdr. George W. Pease, 14th Naval District in Honolulu, have disappeared. Neither Lurlines log, nor the reports to the Navy or Coast Guard by Grogan in Hawaii have been found. Thus no contemporaneously written evidence of what was recorded aboard Lurline is now available. Grogan commented on a signal source \\"moving\\" eastward in the North Pacific over several days as shown via \\"relative bearings\\" which then \\"bunched up\\" and stopped moving.The Broken Seal: OPERATION MAGIC and the Secret Road to Pearl Harbor written by Ladislas Farago, Bantam Books edition 1968, \\"POSTSCRIPT ‚Äì New Lights on the Pearl Harbor Attack,\\" pp. 379‚Äì389.\\"Warning at Pearl Harbor: Leslie Grogan and the Tracking of the Kido Butai\\" by Brian Villa and Timothy Wilford, The Northern Mariners/Le Marin du nord, Volume 11, Number 2 (April 2001), pages 1‚Äì17. However, the directions given by Grogan in a recreation of the logbook for the Matson Line were 18 and 44¬∞ off from known strike force positions and instead pointed towards Japan. According to author Jacobsen, Japanese commercial shipping vessels are the likely source. A re-discovered personal report written by Grogan after the radio log had been passed to the 13th Naval District, dated 10 December 1941 and titled \\"Record for Posterity\\", also does not support claims of Kido Butai broadcasting.Jacobsen, Philip H. \\"Pearl Harbor: Radio Officer Leslie Grogan of the SS Lurline and his Misidentified Signals\\", Cryptologia, April 2005. = Other alleged detections = The contention that \\"low-powered\\" radio (such as VHF or what the U.S. Navy called TBS, or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involvedPrange et al., At Dawn We Slept, p. 743. and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used.Wohlstetter, Roberta. Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1965), p. 42. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting.Wilford, Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941, University Press of America, 2001, p. 37, n. 72, p. 73, n. 146, and p. 107, n. 103. \\"A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction finder bearing, much less any locating \\"fix,\\" was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards.\\"Jacobsen, 2005, p. 142. One suggested example of a Kido Butai transmission is the November 30, 1941, COMSUM14 report in which Rochefort mentioned a \\"tactical\\" circuit heard calling \\"marus\\".SRN-116476 (a term often used for commercial vessels or non-combat units). Further, the perspective of U.S. naval intelligence at the time was, \\"... The significance of the term, 'tactical circuit' is that the vessel itself, that is Akagi, was using its own radio to call up the other vessels directly rather than work them through shore stations via the broadcast method which was the common practice in Japanese communications. The working of the Akagi with the Marus, indicated that she was making arrangements for fuel or some administrative function, since a carrier would rarely address a maru.\\"Proceedings of the Hewitt Inquiry, p. 515. = Japanese radio silence = According to a 1942 Japanese after action report,\\"Dai Toa Senso Senkun [Koku][Hawai Kaisen no Bu] Dai Ichi Hen, Battle Lesson of Hawaii (a 1942 document) appendix in volume, Senshi S≈çsh≈ç: Hawai Sakusen, Tokyo: Boeicho Kenshujo Senshishitsu; 1967. \\"In order to keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was perfectly carried out... The Kido Butai used the radio instruments for the first time on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board to keep the strictest radio silence...\\" Commander Genda, who helped plan the attack, stated, \\"We kept absolute Radio Silence.\\" For two weeks before the attack, the ships of Kido Butai used flag and light signals (semaphore and blinker), which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time. Kazuiyoshi Koichi, the Communications Officer for , dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent Hiei from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced.David Kahn, The Code Breakers, p. 33. Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshoka, communications officer of the flagship, Akagi, said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack.Layton, E. T., 1985, And I was there, p. 547, n. 15. Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the Kido Butais three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent Kido Butai.Jacobsen, P. H. (Burke, C. editor) (2007), p. 227. Vice Admiral Ry≈´nosuke Kusaka stated, \\"It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was easy to say, but not so easy to maintain.\\" There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack. Kusaka worried about this when it was briefly broken on the way home.Goldstein and Dillon, The Pearl Harbor Papers, pp. 136 and 143. The appendix to the war- initiating operational order is also often debated. The message of 25 November 1941 from CinC Combined Fleet (Yamamoto) to All Flagships stated, \\"Ships of the Combined Fleet will observe radio communications procedure as follows: 1. Except in extreme emergency the Main Force and its attached force will cease communicating. 2. Other forces are at the discretion of their respective commanders. 3. Supply ships, repair ships, hospital ships, etc., will report directly to parties concerned.\\" Furthermore, \\"In accordance with this Imperial Operational Order, the CinC of the Combined Fleet issued his operational order ... The Task Force then drew up its own operational order, which was given for the first time to the whole force at Hitokappu Bay... In paragraph four of the appendix to that document, the especially secret Strike Force was specifically directed to 'maintain strict radio silence from the time of their departure from the Inland Sea. Their communications will be handled entirely on the general broadcast communications net.'\\"Goldstein and Dillon, eds. The Pearl Harbor Papers: Inside the Japanese Plans, p. 149, \\"Operational Plan Given to Whole Fleet at Hitokappu Bay.\\"P. Jacobsen, p. 14, \\"Pearl Harbor: Who Deceived Whom?\\" letter section, Naval History 2/05. In addition, Genda recalled, in a 1947 interview, Kido Butais communications officer issuing this order, with the task force to rely (as might be expected) on flag and blinker.Prange et al., At Dawn we Slept, pp. 377 & 784, n. 14.  Radio deception measures  The Japanese practiced radio deception. Susumu Ishiguru, intelligence and communications officer for Carrier Division Two, stated, \\"Every day false communications emanated from Kyushu at the same time and same wavelength as during the training period.\\" Because of this, Commander Joseph Rochefort of Hawaii Signals Intelligence concluded that the First Air Fleet remained in home waters for routine training. The ships left their own regular wireless operators behind to carry on \\"routine\\" radio traffic. Captain Sadatoshi Tomioka stated, \\"The main force in the Inland Sea and the land-based air units carried out deceptive communications to indicate the carriers were training in the Kyushu area.\\" The main Japanese naval bases (Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo) all engaged in considerable radio deception. Analysis of the bearings from Navy DF stations account for claimed breaks of radio silence, and when plotted, the bearings point to Japanese naval bases, not where the Kido Butai actually was.Jacobsen, \\"Pearl Harbor: Who Deceived Whom?\\", Naval History Magazine December 2003. On 26 November, CAST reported all Japan's aircraft carriers were at their home bases.Parker, Frederick D. Pearl Harbor Revisited: U.S. Navy Communications Intelligence 1928-1941. (Ft. Meade, MD, undated PDF), p.42. Found here (retrieved 16 May 2018).

When asked after the attack just how he knew where Akagi was, RochefortIbid, p. 317. (who commanded HYPO at the time) said he recognized her \\"same ham-fisted\\" radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind as part of the deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from CAST,Wilford, T. (2001) Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941, pp. 68‚Äì69. or CAST's report Akagi was off Okinawa on 8 December 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated.Jacobsen, P. H. Burke C. (2007) Radio Silence of the Pearl Harbor Strike Force Confirmed Again: The Saga of Secret Message Serial (SMS) Numbers, p. 226.  U.S. contact with Japanese submarines  Additionally, Japanese submarines were sighted and attacked (by the destroyer ) outside the harbor entrance a few hours before the attack commenced, and at least one was sunk‚Äîall before the planes began launching. This might have provided enough notice to disperse aircraft and fly off reconnaissance, except, yet again, reactions of the duty officers were tardy. It has been argued that failure to follow up on DF bearings saved . If she had been correctly directed, she might have run into the six carrier Japanese strike force. After the attack, the search for the attack force was concentrated south of Pearl Harbor, continuing the confusion and ineffectiveness of the American response. Allied intelligence Locally, Naval Intelligence in Hawaii had been tapping telephones at the Japanese Consulate before the 7th. Among much routine traffic was overheard a most peculiar discussion of flowers in a call to Tokyo (the significance of which is still publicly opaque and which was discounted in Hawaii at the time), but the Navy's tap was discovered and removed in the first week of December. The local FBI field office was informed of neither the tap nor its removal; the local FBI Agent in charge later claimed he would have had installed one of his own had he known the Navy's had been disconnected. Throughout 1941, the U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands collected considerable evidence suggesting Japan was planning some new military adventure. The Japanese attack on the U.S. in December was essentially a side operation to the main Japanese thrust to the South against Malaya and the Philippines--many more resources, especially Imperial Army resources, were devoted to these attacks as compared to Pearl Harbor. Many in the Japanese military (both Army and Navy) had disagreed with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's idea of attacking the U.S. Fleet at Pearl Harbor when it was first proposed in early 1941, and remained reluctant after the Navy approved planning and training for an attack beginning in spring 1941, and through the highest level Imperial Conferences in September and November which first approved it as policy (allocation of resources, preparation for execution), and then authorized the attack. The Japanese focus on Southeast Asia was quite accurately reflected in U.S. intelligence assessments; there were warnings of attacks against Thailand (the Kra Peninsula), Malaya, French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies (Davao-Weigo Line), the Philippines, even Russia. Pearl Harbor was not mentioned. In fact, when the final part of the \\"14-Part Message\\" (also called the \\"one o'clock message\\") crossed Kramer's desk, he cross-referenced the time (per usual practice, not the brainwave often portrayed) and tried to connect the timing to a Japanese convoy (the Thai invasion force) recently detected by Admiral Hart in the Philippines.Prange, Gordon W., et al. December 7, 1941 (McGraw-Hill, 1988), pp. 60 and 62. The U.S. Navy was aware of the traditional planning of the Imperial Japanese Navy for war with the U.S., as maintained throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s. The Japanese made no secret of it, and in the 1930s American radio intelligence gave U.S. war planners considerable insight in Japanese naval exercises.Prados, Combined Fleet Decoded, pp. 61 and 87. These plans presumed there would be a large decisive battle between Japanese and U.S. battleships, but this would be fought near Japan, after the numerical superiority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (assured by the Washington Naval Treaty, and still taken as given) was whittled down by primarily night attacks by light forces, such as destroyers and submarines.Evans and Peattie, Kaigun, pp. 286‚Äì291. This strategy expected the Japanese fleet to take a defensive posture, awaiting U.S. attack, and it was confirmed by the Japanese Navy staff only three weeks before Pearl Harbor.Evans and Peattie, Kaigun, p. 482. In the 1920s, the decisive battle was supposed to happen near the Ryukyu islands; in 1940 it was expected to occur in the central Pacific, near the Marshall islands. War Plan Orange reflected this in its own planning for an advance across the Pacific.Prados, Combined Fleet Decoded, p. 87. Yamamoto's decision to shift the focus of the confrontation with the U.S. as far east as Pearl Harbor, and to use his aircraft carriers to cripple the American battleships, was a radical enough departure from previous doctrine to leave analysts in the dark. There had been a specific claim of a plan for an attack on Pearl Harbor from the Peruvian Ambassador to Japan in early 1941. (The source of this intelligence was traced to the Ambassador's Japanese cook. It was treated with skepticism, and properly so, given the nascent state of planning for the attack at the time and the unreliability of the source.) Since Yamamoto had not yet decided to even argue for an attack on Pearl Harbor, discounting Ambassador Grew's report to Washington in early 1941 was quite sensible. Later reports from a Korean labor organization also seem to have been regarded as unlikely, though they may have had better grounding in actual IJN actions. In August 1941, British Intelligence, MI6, dispatched its agent Du≈°ko Popov, code name Tricycle, to Washington to alert the FBI about German requests for detailed intelligence about defenses at Pearl Harbor, indicating that the request had come from Japan. Popov(Spy/Counterspy) further revealed that the Japanese had requested detailed information about the British attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto. For whatever reason, the FBI took no action. = British advance knowledge and withholding claims = Several authors have controversially claimed that Winston Churchill had significant advance knowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor but intentionally chose not to share this information with the Americans in order to secure their participation in the war. These authors allege that Churchill knew that the Japanese were planning an imminent attack against the United States by mid-November 1941. They furthermore claim that Churchill knew that the Japanese fleet was leaving port on November 26, 1941 to an unknown destination. Finally, they claim that on December 2, British intelligence intercepted Admiral Yamamoto's signal indicating December 7 as the day of an attack. One story from author Constantine Fitzgibbon claimed that a letter received from Victor Cavendish- Bentinck stated that Britain's JIC met and discussed at length the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. From a Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee session of 5 December 1941Fitzgibbon, Secret Intelligence in the Twentieth Century (Hart-Davis, 1976), p. 255. it was stated \\"We knew that they changed course. I remember presiding over a J.I.C. meeting and being told that a Japanese fleet was sailing in the direction of Hawaii, asking 'Have we informed our transatlantic brethren?' and receiving an affirmative reply.\\" However the author was incorrect. There was no session on 5 December nor was Pearl Harbor discussed when they did meet on 3 December.Aldrich, Richard J. Intelligence and the War Against Japan: Britain, America and the Politics of Secret Service. Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 87. Official U.S. war warnings In late November 1941, both the U.S. Navy and Army sent explicit warnings of war with Japan to all Pacific commands. Although these plainly stated the high probability of imminent war with Japan, and instructed recipients to be accordingly on alert for war, they did not mention the likelihood of an attack on Pearl Harbor itself, instead focusing on the Far East. Washington forwarded none of the raw intelligence it had, and little of its intelligence estimates (after analysis), to Hawaiian commanders, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. Short. Washington did not solicit their views about likelihood of war or Hawaiian special concerns. Washington's war warning messages have also been criticised by some (e.g., the U.S. Army Pearl Harbor Board ‚Äì \\"Do/Don't Messages\\") as containing \\"conflicting and imprecise\\" language. Since the Army was officially responsible for the security of the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy's ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short's main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack),Stefan, John J. Hawaii Under the Rising Sun (Honolulu : University of Hawaii Press, 1984.), pp. 55‚Äì62. which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together near the center of the airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet.Prange, Gordon W., Goldstein, Donald M., & Dillon, Katherine V. December 7, 1941 (New York : McGraw-Hill, 1988). In Short's defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority (he wanted at least 180 heavy bombers, but already had 35 B-17s, and was getting 12 more).Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941‚Äì1945. pp. 138,651 Little was done to prepare for air attack. Inter- service rivalries between Kimmel and Short did not improve the situation. Particularly, most intelligence information was sent to Kimmel, assuming he would relay it to Short, and vice versa; this assumption was honored mostly in the breach. Hawaii did not have a Purple cipher machine (although, by agreement at the highest levels between U.S. and UK cryptographic establishments, four had been delivered to the British by October 1941), so Hawaii remained dependent on Washington for intelligence from that (militarily limited) source. However, since Short had no liaison with Kimmel's intelligence staff, he was usually left out of the loop. Henry Clausen reported the war warnings could not be more precise because Washington could not risk Japan guessing the U.S. was reading important parts of their traffic (most importantly Purple), as well as because neither was cleared to receive Purple. Clausen does not answer why Washington could not have said \\"an exceptionally reliable source\\" was involved, with very strong instructions to pay attention. Additionally, Clausen claims military men of Kimmel and Short's seniority and background should have understood the significance of the warnings, and should have been more vigilant than they were, as for instance in scouting plane flights from Hawaii, which were partial at best in the period just before the attack. All other Pacific commands took appropriate measures for their situations. Like most commentators, Clausen ignores what the \\"war warnings\\" (and their context) explicitly warn, though indistinctly, against. Washington, with more complete intelligence than any field command, expected an attack anywhere on a list of possible locations (Pearl Harbor not among them), and since the Japanese were already committed to Thailand, it seems to have been expected another major operation by them was impossible. Clausen, like most, also ignores what actions Kimmel, Short, and Admiral Claude C. Bloch (Commander, Fourteenth Naval District, responsible for naval facilities in Hawaii) actually took. They took precautions against sabotage, widely expected as a precursor to war, and reported their preparations. The Hawaii commanders did not anticipate an air attack; no one did so explicitly. Indeed, the prevailing view at the time was Japan could not execute two major naval operations at once, so with the Thailand invasion convoy known to be at sea, the Hawaii commanders had good reason to feel safe. One major point often omitted from the debate (though Costello covers it thoroughly)Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941‚Äì1945. pp. 141-2,651-2 is the Philippines, where MacArthur, unlike Kimmel or Short, had complete access to all decrypted Purple and JN-25 traffic CAST could provide (indeed, Stinnet quotes Whitlock to that effect),Stinnet, note 8 to Chapter 2. and was nonetheless caught unprepared and with all planes on the ground nevertheless, nine hours after the Pearl Harbor attack. Caidin and Blair also raise the issue. Although it has been argued that there was sufficient intelligence at the time to give commanders at Pearl Harbor a greater level of alert, some factors may take on unambiguous meaning not clear at the time, lost in what Roberta Wohlstetter in her masterful examination of the situation called \\"noise\\",Wohlstetter, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision. \\"scattered amid the dross of many thousands of other intelligence bits, some of which just as convincingly pointed to a Japanese attack on the Panama Canal.\\" Role of American carriers None of the three U.S. Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers were in Pearl Harbor when the attack came. This has been alleged by some to be evidence of advance knowledge of the attack by those in charge of their disposition; the carriers were supposedly away so as to save them (the most valuable ships) from attack. In fact, the two carriers then operating with the Pacific Fleet, Enterprise and Lexington, were on missions to deliver fighters to Wake and Midway Islands, which were intended in part to protect the route used by planes (including B-17s) bound for the Philippines (the third, Saratoga, was in routine refit in Puget Sound, at the Bremerton shipyard). At the time of the attack, Enterprise was about west of Pearl Harbor, heading back. In fact, Enterprise had been scheduled to be back on December 6, but was delayed by weather. A new arrival estimate put her arrival at Pearl around 07:00, almost an hour before the attack, but she was also unable to make that schedule. Furthermore, at the time, aircraft carriers were classified as fleet scouting elements, and hence relatively expendable.Wilmott, Empires in the Balance and The Barrier and the Javelin (USNIPress, 1982 and 1983); Peattie & Evans, Kaigun (USNIPress, 1997); Holmes, Undersea Victory (1966); Miller, War Plan Orange (USNIPress, 1991); Humble, Japanese High Seas Fleet (Ballantine, 1973); Mahan, Influence of Sea Power on History (Little Brown, n.d.); Blair, Silent Victory (Lippincott, 1975)?; Morison's 14 volume history of USN ops in WW2. They were not capital ships. The most important vessels in naval planning even as late as Pearl Harbor were battleships (per the Mahan doctrine followed by both the U.S. and Japanese navies at the time).Wilmott, Empires in the Balance and Barrier & the Javelin (USNIPress, 1982 & 1983); Peattie & Evans, Kaigun (USNIPress, 1997); Holmes, Undersea Victory (1966); Miller, War Plan Orange (USNIPress, 1991); Humble, Japanese High Seas Fleet (Ballantine, 1973); Mahan, Influence of Sea Power on History (Little Brown, n.d.); Blair, Silent Victory (Lippincott, 1975)?; Morison's 14 volume history of USN ops in WW2. Carriers became the Navy's most important ships only following the attack. At the time, naval establishments all over the world regarded battleships, not carriers, as the most powerful and significant elements of naval power. Had the U.S. wanted to preserve its key assets from attack, it would almost certainly have focused on protecting battleships. It was the attack on Pearl Harbor itself that first helped vault the carrier ahead of the battleship in importance. The attack demonstrated the carrier's unprecedented ability to attack the enemy at a great distance, with great force and surprise. The U.S. would turn this ability against Japan. Elimination of battleships from the Pacific Fleet forced the Americans to rely on carriers for offensive operations.  Lack of court-martial  Another issue in the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial. It is alleged this was to avoid disclosing information showing the U.S. had advanced knowledge of the attack. When asked, \\"Will historians know more later?\\", Kimmel replied, \\"' ... I'll tell you what I believe. I think that most of the incriminating records have been destroyed. ... I doubt if the truth will ever emerge.' ...\\"Brownlow, op. cit., pp. 178‚Äì179. From Vice Admiral Libby, \\"I will go to my grave convinced that FDR ordered Pearl Harbor to let happen. He must have known.\\"United States Naval Institute (USNI), Oral History Series, Vice Admiral Ruthven E. Libby (Admiral King's staff), No. 4-230, Annapolis, MD, 1984. (Etta-Belle Kitchen conducted the interviews of VADM Libby during the period February‚ÄìJune 1970). It is equally likely this was done to avoid disclosing the fact that Japanese codes were being read, given that there was a war on. Unreleased classified information Part of the controversy of the debate centers on the state of documents pertaining to the attack. There are some related to Pearl Harbor which have not yet been made public. Some may no longer exist, as many documents were destroyed early during the war due to fears of an impending Japanese invasion of Hawaii. Still others are partial and mutilated.Conclusions Section, from \\"Signals Intelligence and Pearl Harbor: The State of the Question\\" appearing in Intelligence and National Security, Prof. Villa and Dr. Wilford, Volume 21, Number 4, August 2006, pp. 520‚Äì556. Information that is still currently classified includes key reports in Churchill's records, including the PREM 3 file in the UK's Public Records Office, which contains Churchill's most secret wartime intelligence briefs. In it, the 252 group dealing with the Japanese situation in 1941 is open, save for the omission of Section 5, dealing with events from November 1941 through March 1942, and is marked with official finality as \\"closed for 75 years.\\"Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941‚Äì1945. p. 634 Unlike the Magic intelligence files released by the United States, none of the Ultra intelligence files pertaining to Japan have been released by the British government.Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941‚Äì1945. p. 658 Conflicting stories regarding FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests for the source materials used, e.g., Sheet Number 94644, or materials available at the National Archives are also common among the debate. However, much information has been said to have been automatically destroyed under a destruction of classified information policy during the war itself. Various authors have nevertheless continued to bring classified Pearl Harbor materials to light via FOIA. For instance, Sheet No. 94644 derives from its reference in the FOIA- released Japanese Navy Movement Reports of Station H in November 1941. Entries for 28 November 1941 have several more items of interest, each being a \\"movement code\\" message (indicating ship movements or movement orders), with specific details given by associated Sheet Numbers. Examples are: Sheet No. 94069 has information on \\"KASUGA MARU\\" ‚Äì this being hand-written (Kasuga Maru was later converted to CVE Taiyo); Sheet No. 94630 is associated with IJN oiler Shiriya (detailed to the Midway Neutralization Force, with destroyers Ushio and Sazanami, not the Kido Butai);Prange et al., At Dawn We Slept, pp. 435‚Äì6. and finally for Sheet No. 94644 there is another hand-written remark \\"FAF using Akagi xtmr\\" (First Air Fleet using Akagi's transmitter). It is known that the movement reports were largely readable at the time.Pelletier, Cryptolog, Summer 1992, p. 5. These three documents (Sheet Numbers 94069, 94630, and 94644) are examples of materials which yet, even after decades and numerous specific FOIA requests, have not been declassified fully and made available to the public. Sheet Number 94644, for example, noted as coming from Akagi's transmitter and as being a \\"movement code\\" report, would have likely contained a reported position.For an FOIA-released copy of this 28 November 1941 document, see Timothy Wilford's MA Thesis in History, University of Ottawa, Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941, copyright Canada 2001, Appendix II, p. 154. = Forgeries = A purported transcript of a conversation between Roosevelt and Churchill in late November 1941 was analyzed and determined to be fake.A Diplomatic Analysis of a Document Purported to Prove Prior Knowledge of the Pearl Harbor Attack, by Srivastava, Kushner, and Kimmel, from Intelligence and National Security, Volume 24, Number 4, August 2009, pp. 586‚Äì611. There are claims about these conversations; much of this is based on fictional documents, often cited as \\"Roll T-175\\" at the National Archives. There is no Roll T-175; NARA does not use that terminology.See also: THE CHURCHILL-ROOSEVELT FORGERIES at American Heritage magazine.

Larsen was born on a small island, Herf√∏l, south of Fredrikstad in Norway. Like his hero, Roald Amundsen, he became a seaman. Larsen immigrated to Canada, and became a British subjectAt the time, British citizenship applied. In 1947, the Canadian Citizenship Act 1946 came into effect. in 1927 (Canadian citizen in 1947). In 1928, he joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).  RCMP service  In 1928 the RCMP commissioned for Arctic service. During its first voyage into the Arctic, Larsen served as mate under a captain that the RCMP hired, but, once in the Arctic, Larsen was appointed captain. Larsen commanded St. Roch for most of the next two decades, rising to the rank of sergeant. In the final years of Larsen's career, he was the senior RCMP officer in the Arctic. Following his command of St. Roch, Larsen was promoted to inspector with responsibility for all Arctic detachments. For the first 12 years that the ship was in commission, Larsen and his crew took supplies to scattered RCMP posts in Canada's far north. St. Roch was specially constructed to be able to survive being frozen-in all winter. During the winter, the RCMP officers who formed her crew used dog sleds to turn St. Roch into a floating RCMP outpost. During this time, St. Roch was the only Canadian presence in the far north, carrying out various governmental duties.  Exploring the Northwest Passage  =1940-1942: west to east= This journey was the second ship crossing of the Northwest Passage and the first from west to east. The route was nearly the same as Roald Amundsen's 1903 coast-hugging east-west crossing except that Larsen used the Bellot Strait. Documents found in the RCMP archives in the 1990s show that the voyage was somehow connected to a Canadian plan to occupy Greenland after the German invasion of Denmark. The Germans could have occupied the island, seized the cryolite mine and used the island as a U-boat base. The Canadian plan was blocked by the United States but Larsen's voyage went ahead anyway. St. Roch left Vancouver in June 1940. After trouble with ice east of Point Barrow he decided to winter at Walker Bay (Northwest Territories) on the west coast of Victoria Island at the entrance to Prince of Wales Strait. In July 1941 the ship was released from the ice and Larsen followed the coast east and reached Amundsen's Gjoa Haven by the end of August. Turning north up the channel he was struck by the full force of the ice just north of King William Island. In early September he found refuge at Paisley Bay on the west coast of the Boothia Peninsula near the North Magnetic Pole. In August 1942 he forced his way out of the ice, went north and with difficulty passed the Bellot Strait. At the other end he found civilization of a sort at the Hudson's Bay Company post at Fort Ross. He then continued through Prince Regent Inlet, Lancaster Sound and Davis Strait, reaching Halifax on 11 October 1942.Univ of Calgary: Across the Northwest Passage: The Larsen Expeditions =1944: east to west= This was the third ship crossing of the Northwest Passage, the second east-west crossing and the first to be made in one season (7,295 miles in 86 days). Instead of the standard route along the coast he used the Parry Channel and Prince of Wales Strait. Fitted with a more powerful engine, St. Roch left Halifax on 25 July 1944 and by 20 August was at Beechey Island. Continuing west he reached William Edward Parry's Winter Harbour on Melville Island. As usual for explorers at this place, he tried to enter McClure Strait to the northwest and, as usual, was blocked by ice. Next he turned southwest and passed through the Prince of Wales Strait, apparently the first ship to do so . Passing Walker Bay where he had wintered four years previously on 4 September he reached the Hudson's Bay Company post at Holman Island. Just one day before this post had been supplied by Fort Ross which had sailed from Halifax and through the Panama Canal and Bering Strait. With about a month left before the ice would probably close in, he hurried west, passed through the Bering Strait and reached Vancouver on 16 October. = Larsen's explorations and Canadian sovereignty = Some believe the real purpose of the voyages of discovery was not to patrol the Arctic searching for evidence of German infiltrators, but rather to protect Canadian interests from her American allies. There were difficulties in the American/Canadian alliance during World War II, manifested during the construction of the Alaska Highway. Legacy St. John's Harbour, 2010 In 1946 he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Gold Medal for his achievements. In 1959, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society awarded him their first Massey Medal.Vancouver Maritime Museum Larsen Sound, a body of water located in the Arctic to the west of Boothia Peninsula and north of Victoria Strait, was named for him. In 2000, as a millennium project, the RCMP renamed one of its vessels the St. Roch II, and sent it to recreate Larsen's first voyage. The St. Roch is currently located in the Vancouver Maritime Museum, where visitors can view and board the ship. The Canadian Coast Guard also named an icebreaker to honour him. In the Stan Rogers song \\"Take It from Day to Day\\" a crew member aboard St. Roch laments of how \\"Larsen's got us under his thumb.\\" There is a public elementary school in Ottawa named in his honour. It was opened in 1987.

However, despite its structural similarity to DMT, its activity is induced by an oral dose of around 50‚Äì100 mg, without the aid of MAO inhibitors, and the effects last for about 2‚Äì4 hours. Chemistry DET is an analogue of the common tryptamine hallucinogen N,N-Dimethyltryptamine or DMT. Pharmacology The mechanism of action is thought to be serotonin receptor agonism, much like other classic psychedelics. DET is sometimes preferred over DMT because it can be taken orally, whereas DMT cannot. This is because the enzyme monoamine oxidase degrades DMT into an inactive compound before it is absorbed. To overcome this, it must be administered in a different manner, i.e. intravenously, intramuscularly, by inhalation, by insufflation, rectally, or ingested along with an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because DET has ethyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom, monoamine oxidase is unable to degrade it. This is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents. Biochemistry Although DET is a synthetic compound with no known natural sources, it has been used in conjunction with the mycelium of Psilocybe cubensis to produce the synthetic chemicals 4-PO-DET (Ethocybin) and 4-HO-DET (Ethocin), as opposed to the naturally occurring 4-PO-DMT (Psilocybin) and 4-HO-DMT (Psilocin). Isolation of the alkaloids resulted in 3.3% 4-HO-DET and 0.01-0.8% 4-PO-DET. Psychosis model Early studies of DET as well as other psychedelics were mainly focused on their presumed psychotomimetic properties. Researchers theorized that abnormal metabolites of endogenous chemicals such as tryptamine, serotonin, and tryptophan could be the explanation for mental disorders such as schizophrenia, or psychosis. With the progression of science and pharmacological understanding, this belief has been dismissed by most researchers. Legal status Internationally DET is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. =Australia= DET is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

He was born in the United States, at Hudson, New Hampshire to Enoch Sawyer March and Margaret Whittier. Marsh spent his youth in Nashua, New Hampshire, attending the public schools, and starting his working career there. As a young man, he served with the 30th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment and was a part of the Dakota Territory Indian campaigns. By 1876 Marsh was managing a small general store in Fort Benton, Montana, after which he joined the Fort Benton firm T. C. Power and Bro and in 1876 moved to Fort Walsh (in Saskatchewan) to manage their store, remaining at that post until 1883. As the Canadian Pacific Railway moved west, Marsh saw the opportunity to open up new stores for the company; he opened a store in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan in 1883, and opened a Calgary branch in 1884, remaining as manager of that post until 1893. He arranged for his nephew, Horace A. Greeley, to manage the store in Maple Creek. Marsh became a prominent moneylender soon after his arrival in Calgary. In 1887 he married Julia Wood Shurtliff, the widow of North-West Mounted Police superintendent Albert Shurtliff. They had one daughter. T. C. Power and Bro. sold the Calgary store to Marsh in 1893, and he continued operating it until 1901. Marsh served one term as mayor of the town of Calgary, winning by acclamation in the 1889 election and serving from January 21, 1889, to January 20, 1890. Upon his death in Calgary, his estate was appraised at $351,000. The majority of his estate was left to Julia, who died two years later.

Biography Barry Lamb 2011 Barry Lamb is an English composer, author and musician. He was born in South Shields, but lived in Holland On Sea during his secondary school years. He attended Clacton County High School where he first met his long time musical collaborator Peter Ashby. It was during his high school years that he formed Frenzid Melon with Ashby and they began experimenting with music inspired by the immediacy and DIY ethic of punk. Lamb also began making his own experimental music using simple tape manipulation techniques and they began to release their music on cassette. This marked the beginning of what has become known as cassette culture. During this period Ashby & Lamb founded Falling A Records.Record Collector Magazine Oct 2011 no 393 page 54 as one of the early cassette labels and later an independent record label. Falling A also opened a shop in Clacton on sea and acted as a distribution service for other cassette culture artists, labels and fanzines. They became one of the most connected limbs of the diy cassette movement. Lamb's solo career coexisted with his collaborations with Ashby. Most of his solo albums are avant-garde / electronic / industrial in nature. The album Dusk is perhaps his best-known solo work. During his most prolific period, Lamb had regular correspondence with fellow contemporaries Bryn Jones of Muslimgauze, members of Attrition, and the Third Mind record label. Much of this appeared to shape his thinking about music. Sometime during the course of 1981/82 Frenzid Melon disbanded but Ashby and Lamb quickly re emerged having added Owen Turley to the line up and morphing into a new band the insane picnic. Whilst Frenzid Melon had been heavily influenced by punk, the insane picnic had more of a post punk feel to them. Their debut release in the autumn of 1982 was the critically acclaimed \\"Four Days in April\\" EP. This received a glowing review by Ian Pye in Melody Maker \\"A twisted cross between Echo and the Bunnymen & the Fall. The Insane Picnic succeed where most others fail by creating an atmosphere that may not be unique but is at least threateningly distanced from the obvious possibilities..\\"Melody Maker, 25 September 1982, p. 14 the insane picnic enjoyed further favourable reviews in the mainstream music press but were unable to capitalise on the momentum due to internal struggles and the inability to engage a permanent drummer for regular live performances. A planned album in 1984 did not advance beyond the demo stage. The demo tapes were eventually released on CD in 2004 under the name \\"this is the winter darkness\\". the insane picnic continued in a stop start fashion until 1989 with occasional releases and live performances. Their biggest success during this period was the \\"Magistrates & Saints\\" 12\\" EP. The closure of the Falling A shop in 1985 sparked the relocation of the headquarters to Reading.Music Week directory of UK record labels, 1985 In 1989 following the demise of the insane picnic, Lamb moved to Braintree, Essex and recorded a progressive rock album with Ashby under the name of Ermin Grud. The resulting album \\"the narrow path\\" was released as a private pressing in a deliberately obscure manner with no clues as to the source of the recording or musicians involved. There are fewer than 100 copies in existence. The album is saturated with the sound of the mellotron and Hammond organ in an attempt to pass it off as an authentic early 1970s private pressing. In the late 1990s his output was minimal, and apart from an appearance on the WMTID album Pale Saint he seemed along with many of his cassette culture contemporaries to have disappeared without a trace. Midway through 2005 though, he re-emerged with an appearance on the Jasun Martz (former member of Frank Zappa's band) album The Pillory / The Battle playing mellotron and wind synth as well as releasing a brand new album entitled It's All About Purpose on the Six Armed Man label. 2006 saw another flurry of activity with several contributions to various Six Armed Man releases and another album of new material entitled Observations of Istanbul. In 2007 he released an album of new material called ...this is which has received critical acclaim in the underground music network. Lamb's continued partnership with former insane picnic and Frenzid Melon member Peter Ashby continues to bear fruit as they work together. Other collaborations include Lamb playing saxophone on Peter Ashby's Disturbances in the ether album, working with up and coming urban hip hop artist Tor Cesay, collaborating with Keith Levene, being covered by Swiss chanteuse Hilda Garman and recording with Wavis O'Shave. Following another hiatus in 2016, the Ashby & Lamb partnership reconvened under the name of The Two Headed Emperor.

It is situated in the northern dock system in Bootle, connected to Alexandra Dock to the north and Brocklebank Dock to the south. Langton Dock locks provide a working connection to the river; one of the two remaining operational river entrances in the northern dock system. History The dock was built by George Fosbery Lyster, and officially opened along with Alexandra Dock in 1881. The dock had been partially in use since 1879. It was named after William Langton, a member of the dock committee, and a former Chairman of the Bank of Liverpool. As originally built, Langton Dock consisted of a basin adjoining the river wall, with a branch dock and two graving docks to the east. Access from the river was initially via Canada Basin. The dock was intended for very large vessels of the time and was used for trading in the Mediterranean. Shipping companies, which used the dock, included Ellerman Lines and John Glynn. Subsequent modifications were made to Langton Dock and the surrounding basins during the twentieth century to improve access. Between 1949-62, this included the construction of the Langton River Entrance, which was eventually opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 December 1962, after being delayed by a series of problems. The branch dock and graving docks were filled in, providing parking spaces for vehicles using the former Brocklebank Dock ferry terminal to Belfast, Northern Ireland. On the closure of the Pier Head's Princes Landing Stage, the remaining dock basin was occasionally used as terminal for the start of cruises, accommodating cruise ships. However, since the opening of the Liverpool cruise liner terminal in 2013, Langton Dock has ceased to berth cruise liners. The Langton Dock Pump House is on the Victorian Society's list of endangered buildings.

On the night of 28 February ‚Äì 1 March 1942, the Australian light cruiser and the American heavy cruiser faced a major Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) task force. After a fierce battle of several hours' duration, both Allied ships were sunk. Five Japanese ships were sunk, three of them by friendly fire. Background In late February 1942, Japanese amphibious forces were preparing to invade Java, in the Dutch East Indies. On 27 February, the main American-British-Dutch- Australian Command (ABDACOM) naval force, under Admiral Karel Doorman‚Äìa Dutch officer‚Äìsteamed northeast from Surabaya to intercept an Imperial Japanese navy invasion fleet. This part of the ABDA force consisted of two heavy cruisers, including under the command of Captain Albert H. Rooks, three light cruisers, including under Captain Hector Waller, and nine destroyers. Only six out of nine of USS Houstons 8-inch (203-millimeter) heavy guns were operational because her aft gun turret had been knocked out in an earlier Japanese air raid. The ABDA force engaged the Japanese force in the Battle of the Java Sea. The Allied ships were all sunk or dispersed. Houston and Perth both retreated to Tanjung Priok, Java, the main port of Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where they arrived at 13:30 on 28 February. Prelude In the early evening on 28 February, Houston, Perth and the Dutch destroyer received orders to depart Tanjung Priok and head through Sunda Strait to Tjilatjap, on the south coast of Java. Waller, who had seniority, was de facto commander of this force. The only ships they expected to encounter were Australian corvettes on patrol, in and around the strait itself. While Houston and Perth left at 19:00, Evertsen was not ready and followed the cruisers two hours later. By chance, just after 22:00, a Japanese invasion convoy bound for West Java ‚Äî including the entire Sixteenth Army, under Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura, in over 50 transport ships ‚Äî was entering Bantam Bay, near the north-west tip of Java. The Japanese troop transports were escorted by the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, led by Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara, and the 7th Cruiser Division, under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita. Light cruiser (with Admiral Hara aboard), with the destroyers , , , , , , , and were closest to the convoy. Flanking the bay to the north were the heavy cruisers and , accompanied by the destroyer . Slightly further north, though not involved in the action, was the aircraft carrier , with the heavy cruisers and (with Admiral Kurita aboard), along with the seaplane tender , and the destroyers and . Some time around 23:15, the Allied ships were sighted by the patrolling Fubuki, which followed them surreptitiously. At 23:06, when they were about halfway across the mouth of Bantam Bay, Perth sighted a ship about ahead, near Saint Nicolaas Point. It was thought at first that the ship was an Australian corvette, but when challenged, she made an unintelligible reply, with a lamp which was the wrong color, fired her nine Long Lance (Type 93) torpedoes from about and then turned away, making smoke. The ship was soon identified as a Japanese destroyer (probably Harukaze). Waller reported the contact and ordered his forward turrets to open fire. Main action During a ferocious night action, the Allied cruisers were surrounded. Following severe damage from torpedo and shell impacts, Perth and Houston were abandoned after midnight and sank. About four Japanese transports and a minesweeper were sunk by friendly torpedoes that had missed their target. (Two of these transports were later refloated.) One of the Japanese transports sunk was Ryujo Maru, carrying Lt. Gen. Imamura, who had to jump overboard. He was later rescued by the crew of a small boat and taken ashore.  Destroyer action  Meanwhile, as Evertsen was trying to catch up with Houston and Perth, her crew spotted the tracers and intense shellfire of the main action. Her captain ordered a course northwest towards Pulau Mundu island, off the west coast of Sumatra, then hugged the Sumatran coast as Evertsen turned south to head through Sunda Strait. However, Evertsen was spotted by Murakumo and Shirakumo, looking for more escaping Allied ships. Both immediately illuminated Evertsen with their searchlights and took her under fire. Evertsen attempted to evade by turning west, but after turning southward again, the Dutch destroyer again encountered the Japanese destroyers. Evertsen was hit repeatedly, but temporarily disengaged under a smokescreen. By then, however, Evertsen's stern was on fire. Still taking Japanese fire, the captain ordered his crew to ground Evertsen on a coastal reef. Firing all her torpedoes, the remaining crew escaped ashore before the fire reached the aft magazine, causing an explosion which blew off most of the stern. Aftermath Commemorative plaque for HMAS Perth and USS Houston at Rockingham Naval Memorial Park in Rockingham, Western Australia. Officially the Allied personnel killed during the battle included 696 members of the crew of Houston and 375 from Perth, including the captains of both vessels, Rooks and Waller. The survivors were picked up by Japanese vessels and taken prisoner, included 368 from Houston and 307 from Perth. Rooks was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. The majority of Evertsens crew was taken prisoner on 9‚Äì10 March 1942 and were held by the Japanese for three and a half years. The crew of the Japanese cruiser Mikuma suffered six killed and 11 wounded, as a result of damage caused by Houston. A direct shell hit to the bridge of the destroyer Shirayuki killed one crew member and wounded 11; Harukaze suffered hits to her bridge, engine room and rudder, killing three and wounding more than 15 others.

History Known as Canada Half Tide Dock when opened in 1862, it had two branch docks to the east which were known as North and South Carriers' Docks.

XB-29 : Section source: Baugher Baugher's Encyclopedia XB-29 Boeing XB-29-BO (S/N 41-002, the first XB-29 built) The XB-29, Boeing Model 345, was the first accepted prototype or experimental model delivered to the Army Air Corps, incorporating a number of improvements on the design originally submitted, including more and larger guns and self-sealing fuel tanks. Two aircraft were ordered in August 1940, and a third was ordered in December. A mockup was completed in the spring of 1941, and it first flew on September 21, 1942. Testing continued until February 18, 1943, when the second prototype crashed. Flown by Boeing's chief test pilot, Edmund T. \\"Eddie\\" Allen on a two-hour powerplant performance test, leaking fuel from a filler cap in the wing leading edge ran down inside the leading-edge and ignited, spreading to the engines. Due to the much reduced power, the aircraft, unable to climb, crashed into the Frye meat-packing plant, demolishing the majority of the packing plant and killing all eleven crew, 22 employees at the plant and one fireman.'Slaughterhouse Dive',Flypast Magazine June 2009 page 44 The crash killed many √©lite Boeing personnel involved in the design; the pilot, Allen, was chief of the Research Division. After the crash, the United States Army Air Forces and a congressional committee headed by then-Senator Harry S. Truman investigated the B-29 program, issuing a scathing report, prompting the Army Air Forces to take control of the program. YB-29 Boeing YB-29-BO (S/N 41-36957). Note the nose has an Erco ball turret with twin .50-cal. machine guns, and the fuselage package guns just below and aft of the cockpit have twin .50-cal. machine guns mounted. The YB-29 was an improved XB-29 and 14 were built for service testing. Testing began in the summer of 1943, and dozens of modifications were made to the planes. The engines were upgraded from Wright R-3350-13s to R-3350-21s. Where the XB-29 had three-bladed props, the YB-29 had four-bladed propellers. Various alternatives to the remote-controlled defensive systems were tested on a number of them, particularly the fourth one delivered. After alternative arrangements had been fully tested, defensive armament was standardised at ten .50-calibre machine guns in turret-mounted pairs. The YB-29 also featured a better fire control system. Baugher's Encyclopedia YB-29 B-29 The B-29 was the original production version of the Superfortress. Since the new bomber was urgently needed, the production design was developed in tandem with the service testing. In fact, the first B-29 was completed only two months after the delivery of the first YB-29. Forty-six B-29s of this variant, built by the Glenn L. Martin Company at its Omaha plant, were used as the aircraft for the atomic bomb missions, modified to Silverplate specifications. Some 2,513 B-29s were manufactured by Boeing-Wichita (1,620), Bell-Atlanta (357), and Martin-Omaha (536). Baugher's Encyclopedia B-29 B-29A : Section source: Baugher Baugher's Encyclopedia B-29A Boeing B-29A-70-BN (S/N 44-62305). Note the streamlined top turret added on block 40 A models and later. The B-29A was an improved version of the original B-29 production model. This is the definitive wartime variant of the B-29. All 1,119 B-29A's were built at the Boeing plant in Renton, Washington, formerly used by the United States Navy. Enhancements made in the B-29A included a better wing design and defensive modifications. Due to a demonstrated weakness to head-on fighter attacks, the number of machine guns in the forward dorsal turrets was doubled to four. Where the wings of previous models had been made by the sub-assembly of two sections, the B-29A wing was built up from three. This made construction easier, and increased the strength of the airframe. The B-29A was produced until May 1946, when the last aircraft was completed. It was much used during the Korean War, but was quickly phased out when the jet bomber (B-47 Stratojet) became operational. Washington B Mk 1 ‚Äì This was the service name given to 88 B-29As supplied to the Royal Air Force. B-29B Boeing B-29B-60-BA (S/N 44-84061) \\"Pacusan Dreamboat\\" :Section source: Baugher's Encyclopedia & National Museum of the USAF The B-29B was a modification used for low-level raids, designed with the intent of firebombing Japan. Since fighter opposition was minimal over Japan in late 1944, many of the Army Air Force leadership ‚Äî most notably Curtis LeMay, commander of the XXI Bomber Command ‚Äî felt that a (lighter) faster bomber would better evade Japanese flak. In the B-29B, as with the atomic raid-dedicated Silverplate versions earlier, all defensive armament was removed except for that in the tail turret. Initially the armament was two .50 in AN/M2 machine guns and one 20 mm M2 cannon which was soon changed to three .50 in AN/M2s. The weight saved by removing the guns increased the top speed from 357 mph to 364 mph (575 km/h to 586 km/h). Also incorporated on this version was an improved APQ-7 \\"Eagle\\" bombing-through-overcast radar that was fitted in an airfoil- shaped radome under the fuselage. History of 315 BG. Retrieved 19 June 2008 All 311 B-29Bs were built at the Bell plant in Marietta, Georgia (\\"Bell- Atlanta\\"). B-29C The B-29C was a modification of the B-29A re-engined with improved Wright R-3350 engines. The Army Air Force originally ordered 5,000, but cancelled its request when World War II ended and none were built. Baugher's Encyclopedia B-29C B-29D (XB-44) :Section source: Baugher Baugher's Encyclopedia B-29D/XB-44 The B-29D was an improved version of the original B-29 design, featuring 28-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-4360-35 Wasp Major engines of 3500 hp (2600 kW) each ‚Äî nearly 60% more powerful than the usual Duplex-Cyclone. It also had a taller vertical stabilizer and a strengthened wing. The XB-44 was the testbed designation for the D model. When World War II ended, the B-29D was given the quartet of Wasp Major engines to become the B-50, which served throughout the 1950s in the U.S. bomber fleet. Test beds A number of B-29s were converted to serve as test beds for new systems. These all received variant designation, even though many existed only as a single converted aircraft. =XB-29E= The XB-29E for fire-control systems (one converted) was a model B-29-45-BW. Baugher's Encyclopedia XB-29E =XB-29F= The B-29F for cold-weather operation in Alaska were six converted B-29-BWs. Baugher's Encyclopedia XB-29F =XB-29G= The B-29 was used in the development of jet engines. Stripped of armament, a converted B-29B-55-BA (44-84043)(Bell) designated the XB-29G carried experimental jet engines in its bomb bay, which were extended into the airstream for testing during flight. This plane was used to test the Allison J35, General Electric J47 and J73 jet engines. Baugher's Encyclopedia XB-29G =XB-29H= The XB-29H to test armament configurations was a converted B-29A. Baugher's Encyclopedia XB-29H =YB-29J, YKB-29J, RB-29J= Experimentation in piston engines continued. Six B-29s (redesignated YB-29J) Baugher's Encyclopedia YB-29J of various designation were upgraded to R-3350-79 engines. Other engine-associated items were also upgraded, including new Curtiss propellers, and 'Andy Gump' cowlings, in which the oil coolers have separate air intakes. Two were later converted to aerial refueling tanker prototypes, and redesignated YKB-29J. The remainder were used for reconnaissance, and designated RB-29J. KB-29 Tanker Development EB-29 McDonnell XF-85 Goblin and EB-29 mothership. :Section source: Baugher Baugher's Encyclopedia EB-29 The EB-29 (E stands for exempt), was used as a carrier aircraft in which the bomb bay was modified to accept and launch experimental aircraft. They were converted in the years following World War II. One EB-29 was converted to carry the famous Bell X-1 until it was replaced by a B-50. Another was used to carry and test the XF-85 'parasite fighter'. This fighter was intended to be carried by the Convair B-36 on long- range missions to protect it from Soviet fighters. Another EB-29 was used to carry two EF-84B Thunderjet fighters as part of Project Tom-Tom. All three Tom-Tom aircraft (the B-29 and the two jet fighters) and their crews were lost in a crash on April 24, 1953.\\"Earlier wingtip towing tests using an ETB-29B, serial 44-62093, and a pair of straight winged EF-84B Thunderjets, serials 46-641 and 46-661, ended when a failure of the automatic flight control system caused one of the fighters to flip over and smash upside down on the wing of the ETB-29B, bringing down the two airplanes and their crews on April 24, 1953.\\" (http://www.456fis.org/PROJECT_TOM-TOM.htm) RB-29J (RB-29, FB-29J, F-13, F-13A) An F-13 Superfortress : Section source: see Baugher Baugher's Encyclopedia F-13 Early B-29/B-29As that were modified for photo reconnaissance carried the F-13/F-13A designations, with \\"F\\" meaning 'photo'. The aircraft (118 modified B-29BWs and B-29As) carried three K-17B, two K-22 and one K-18 cameras. Between the end of World War II (1945) and 1948 the designation was changed to FB-29J. In 1948, the F-13/FB-29s were redesignated RB-29 and RB-29A. Six B-29A/F-13As were modified with the Wright R-3350-CA-2 fuel injected engines and designated at YB-29Js. These were then converted to RB-29Js. Baugher's Encyclopedia YB-24J/RB-24J In January 1949, RB-29s were assigned to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and moved to Yokota AB, Japan in December 1950; to provide support to the Korean War and attached to the 15th Air Force, Far East Air Force. SB-29 SB-29 :Section source:Birdsall The SB-29 'Super Dumbo' was a version of the B-29 adapted for air-sea rescue duty after World War II. Sixteen B-29s were modified to carry a droppable A-3 lifeboat under the fuselage; redesignated SB-29, they were used mainly as rescue support for air units that flew long distances over water. The first SB-29s were received by the Air Rescue Service in February 1947. With the exception of the forward lower gun turret, all defensive armament was retained; the aircraft additionally carried a variety of radio equipment, provisions, survival kits, and extra crew. The SB-29 was used operationally throughout the Korean War into the mid-1950s. It received its nickname from Dumbo, the Disney character, whose name was given to the aircraft used in previous missions to pick airmen up when they crashed at sea. TB-29 The TB-29 was a trainer conversion of B-29 used to train crew for bombing missions; some were also used to tow targets, and the designation included B-29s modified solely for that purpose. Their most important role was serving as radar targets in the 1950s when the United States Air Force was developing intercept tactics for its fighters. WB-29 Boeing WB-29A of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1954 : The WB-29s were production aircraft modified to perform weather monitoring missions. An observation position was fitted above the central fuselage section. They conducted standard data-gathering flights, including from the UK over the Atlantic. They were also used to fly into the eye of a hurricane or typhoon to gather information. Following nuclear weapons tests, some WB-29s used air sampling scoops to test radiation levels. On 3 September 1949, a WB-29 returning from Yokota AB, Japan, to Eielson AFB, Alaska, recovered radioactive debris in air sampling scoops from the cloud generated by the first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union on 29 August. Airborne Early Warning In 1951, three B-29s were modified for use in the Airborne Early Warning programme. The upper section of the forward fuselage was extensively modified to house an AN/APS-20C search radar, and the interior was modified to house radar and Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) equipment. This development led to production radar picket aircraft, including the EC-121 Warning Star. (√ó3, converted) A Soviet-built copy of the B-29, the Tu-4, was used as the platform for a Chinese experimental airborne early warning aircraft, the KJ-1 AEWC, in the 1970s. MX-767 Banshee A study for the conversion of B-29s to long-range cruise missiles was conducted by the Air Material Command between 1946 and 1950; given the designation MX-767, it was given the codename Project Banshee. Flight tests were conducted, however no full conversions were carried out before the project was abandoned. Navy P2B patrol bomber :Section source: Baugher Baugher Encyclopedia P2B The U.S. Navy acquired four B-29-BWs from the U.S. Army Air Forces on March 14, 1947. These aircraft were modified for long-range patrol missions and given the designation P2B-1S with Navy Bureau Numbers (BuNo) 84028, 84029, 84030 and 84031. BuNo 84029, previously AAF Ser. No. 45-21787,https://groups.yahoo.com/group/OaklandAirport/message/538 later went through modifications to carry the Navy's Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket high-speed rocket-powered research aircraft. The bomb bay was modified to carry the Skyrocket II under the belly and dropped for supersonic speed testing. The first Skyrocket test flight occurred on September 8, 1950 with test pilot William B. Bridgeman, and George Jansen flying the B-29. Scott Crossfield later broke Mach 2 with the Skyrocket on November 20, 1953; the last Skyrocket flight was in December 1956. The P2B-1S \\"mother-ship\\" was nicknamed Fertile Myrtle and was assigned the NACA number 137. As of May 2013, this aircraft was in the collection of Kermit Weeks at his Fantasy of Flight aviation museum in Polk City, Florida. The forward fuselage section was restored and briefly displayed at the Florida Air Museum in Lakeland, Florida. It has since been relocated to Fantasy of Flight's \\"Golden Hill\\" storage facility along with the remainder of the disassembled aircraft and is awaiting full restoration to airworthy flying status at a future date.Fantasy of Flight#Collectionhttp://www.fantasyofflight.com/ BuNo 84030 and 84031 were later modified into anti-submarine patrol bombers and redesignated P2B-2S.Boeing P2B-2S 'Superfortress' ‚Äì Aviation Enthusiast Corner XB-39 Superfortress : Section source: see Baugher Baugher's Encyclopedia XB-39 The XB-39 Superfortress was a single YB-29 modified to use water-cooled Allison V-3420-17 Vee type engines. Since the Army Air Force was concerned that problems might develop with their first choice of engine, the Wright R-3350, they contracted General Motors to test a modified aircraft to show that it could still be used if the R-3350 development was not successful. Since the R-3350 did not have significant enough problems to prevent its use, no XB-39s were ordered. Tupolev Tu-4 Tupolev Tu-4 at Monino KJ-1 at the China Aviation Museum In 1945, three B-29s were forced to land in Soviet territory after a bombing raid on Japan because of lack of fuel. Since the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan at the time, the aircraft and crew were interned. Eventually, the B-29 crew members were returned, but the aircraft remained in Russian hands. Seeking a modern long-range bomber, Joseph Stalin ordered the Tupolev OKB to reverse-engineer the Superfortress. The resulting aircraft first flew on May 19, 1947 and immediately began series production, totalling 847 Tu-4s. Although largely identical in appearance to American B-29s, the Tu-4 (NATO reporting name: \\"Bull\\"), had Soviet-designed defensive guns and had been re-engineered to suit production using material of metric thicknesses, resulting in an aircraft that was slightly heavier and slower than the B-29. The Tu-4 presented a significant leap forward in Soviet strategic bombing. Not only did the Soviet Air Forces have the means to deliver nuclear weapons, but the Tu-4 had sufficient range to reach the United States on a one-way trip. On October 18, 1951, a Tu-4 was used in the first air-drop test of a Soviet atomic bomb. The Tu-4 had been phased out of Soviet service by the early 1960s, being replaced by more modern aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-95. Although the Tu-4 had never delivered any explosive payload with offensive intent, it influenced Soviet aircraft technology, particularly airframe construction and onboard systems. Advanced transport and bomber variants of the Tu-4 design such as the Tu-70, Tu-75, Tu-80, and Tu-85, were developed and built, but none of these achieved series production. The People's Liberation Army Air Force of China attempted to use the Tu-4 airframe in KJ-1AWACS aircraft. \\"Chinese Airborne Early Warning (AEW).\\" fas.org. Retrieved 29 December 2009.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has described her as an anti-Arab and anti-Muslim activist. She is the author of four books: Now They Call Me Infidel: Why I Renounced Jihad for America, Israel, and the War on Terror, Cruel and Usual Punishment: The Terrifying Global Implications of Islamic Law, The Devil We Don't Know: The Dark Side of Revolutions in the Middle East, and Wholly Different: Why I Chose Biblical Values Over Islamic Values. Born in Egypt, Darwish is the daughter of an Egyptian Army lieutenant general, who was called a \\"shahid\\" by the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, after being killed in a targeted killing by the Israel Defense Forces in 1956. Darwish blames \\"the Middle Eastern Islamic culture and the propaganda of hatred taught to children from birth\\" for his death. In 1978, she moved with her husband to the United States, and converted to Christianity there. In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, she has written on Islam-related topics. She has been accused of operating as part of a \\"shariah scare industry\\". Biography Nonie Darwish was born in 1949 in Cairo, Egypt.Blake Boldt, 'Nashville presentation focuses on homosexuality and the Islamic culture', in Out & About Newspaper, 4 October 2011 Her father, Colonel Mustafa Hafez, was paternally of Turkish ancestry. In the 1950s her family moved to Gaza when her father was sent by Gamal Abdel Nasser to serve as commander of the Egyptian Army Intelligence in Gaza, which was under supervision of Egypt. Hafez founded the fedayeen who launched raids across Israel's southern border, that between 1951 and 1956, killed many Israelis, the majority civilians. In July 1956 when Nonie was six years old, her father was killed by a mail bomb in an operation by the Israeli Defense Forces. The assassination was a response to Fedayeen's attacks, making Darwish's father a shahid.Gray, Alan \\"Mothers for Peace Challenge The Brainwashing of Middle East Children\\", News Blaze, 16 February 2006. The assassination was planned by Yehoshafat Harkabi. During his speech announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal, Nasser vowed that all of Egypt would take revenge for Hafez's death. Darwish claims that Nasser asked her and her siblings, \\"Which one of you will avenge your father's death by killing Jews?\\"Interview with Daily Telegraph; \\"We were brought up to hate and we do.\\" 12 February 2006 Darwish explains: Asked what can be done to encourage more moderate Muslims to speak out, Darwish answers: Darwish was the founder of a group called \\"Former Muslims United\\", a group that has been described as \\"fringe\\". The group was a project of American Freedom Defense Initiative, run by anti-Muslim activist Pamela Geller. In a letter sent from that organization to Muslim leaders, Darwish said: Darwish is a strong supporter of Israel, and has founded the group Arabs for Israel. She says, \\"Just because I am pro- Israel does not mean I am anti- Arab, its just that my culture is in desperate need for reformation which must come from within\\". Darwish denies that she is the author of an essay entitled \\"Joys of Muslim Women\\" circulating on the internet although she considers it accurate to a large extent.Urban legends Views on Islam Darwish believes Islam is an authoritarian ideology that is attempting to impose on the world the norms of seventh-century culture of the Arabian Peninsula. She writes that Islam is a \\"sinister force\\" that must be resisted and contained. She remarks that it is hard to \\"comprehend that an entire religion and its culture believes God orders the killing of unbelievers.\\" She claims that Islam and Sharia form a retrograde ideology that adds greatly to the world's stock of misery. She claims the Qur'an is a text that is \\"violent, incendiary, and disrespectful\\" and says that brutalization of women, the persecution of homosexuals, honor killings, the beheading of apostates and the stoning of adulterers come directly out of Islamic texts. In her book Now They Call Me Infidel, Darwish calls upon America to \\"get tougher\\", impose stricter immigration laws especially on Muslim and Arab immigrants, endorse assimilation, and stop \\"multiculturalism and cultural relativism\\". She has also called for non-Muslim Americans to be wary of interfaith marriages particularly those where Muslims marry Jewish or Christian women.  Criticism  In a 2008 article, Max Blumenthal wrote that Darwish has described Barack Obama as a \\"political muslim\\" and stated that Islam \\"was not a true religion\\". At a 2011 hearing on terrorism in New York Darwish suggested that ‚ÄúThe education of Arab children is to make killing of certain groups of people not only good, it‚Äôs holy,‚Äù and was accused by then New York State Senator Eric Adams of ‚Äúbringing hate and poison\\". In 2012, the Southern Poverty Law Center described Darwish as being part of a group of \\"rabid Islamophobes who promote an array of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and propaganda\\". In 2017 the SPLC said Darwish had \\"made insidious claims including saying Linda Sarsour ‚Äúwants‚Äù to give up her children ‚Äúto die killing Jews‚Äù and that, ‚Äúshe wants to bring Sharia to America.‚Äù\\". In a 2018 journal article, Steven Fink accused Darwish of using her ‚Äúex-Muslim insider‚Äù status to give herself credibility, as well criticising her for stating that ‚ÄúTo be a Muslim is to take an oath of submission to the Sharia state, and that oath prevents you from claiming the human rights that are the priority of any true religion. That is why Islam‚Äôs greatest enemies are Christianity and Judaism and nations that are founded on their values‚Äù and suggesing Muslims ‚Äúare incapable of feeling compassion toward non-Muslims. Acknowledging compassion to non-Muslim oppressed minorities is grounds for apostasy. A Muslim must stay hardened and unyielding‚Äù with Fink writing: \\"Worlds apart from acknowledging Muslim Americans as compatriots or fellow human beings, Darwish‚Äôs shariah scare industry portrayal transforms Muslims into anti-American automatons.\\" Published works  * See also *Former Muslims United *Muslim supporters of Israel References External links *Personal website *Arabs for Israel website *Articles by Nonie Darwish at FrontPage Magazine * ;Interviews CI Centre Interview *National Review *FrontPageMag.com *Reform Judaism Magazine *The Observer Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Egyptian people of Turkish descent Category:American Christian Zionists Category:American Protestants Category:Arab Zionists Category:Converts to Protestantism from Islam Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:Egyptian Protestants Category:Egyptian emigrants to the United States Category:American former Muslims Category:Egyptian former Muslims Category:Critics of multiculturalism Category:American critics of Islam Category:Opposition to Islam in the United States ","title":"Nonie Darwish"},{"id":"1130228","text":"A harness is a looped restraint or support.

It takes place within his NASA series. Plot summary Moonseed is an exploration of what could possibly happen when rock is returned from the Apollo 18 mission (which was actually cancelled in 1970).Moonseed (review) In the book, the rock contain a mysterious substance called \\"moonseed\\" (a form of grey goo, whether nanobots, an alien virus or something else) that starts to change all inorganic matter on Earth into more moonseed. It also gets transferred by a NASA probe to Venus, and the explosion of Venus is the first clue as to what has been happening. Stephen Baxter combines a host of disciplines (space travel, geology and disaster theory) to tell a tale where the rocks are literally swept from under the feet of humanity. During the course of the novel, in which Edinburgh is the focus for much of the action, Venus is destroyed by an unknown cosmic event that showers the Earth with radiation that somehow stirs the moonseed on Earth. When Moon-dust containing the moonseed is dropped onto the streets of Edinburgh by a lab assistant of the main character, Earth's fate is sealed. The moonseed begins to disintegrate the planet from the inside-out as the core heats up exponentially, while on the surface, nuclear power stations catastrophically fail, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are abundant, and billions of people die as cities and continents vanish. Over the course of the cataclysmic erosion of Earth, a collective of scientists and engineers in space agencies from around the world desperately try to terraform the Moon for colonisation, to provide a safe haven for some surviving humans before Earth eventually disintegrates into nothingness along with human civilisation. This novel also presents numerous theories and ideas about the space-faring future of humanity, albeit in an alternate dimension where we are forced into space by an eroding Earth. It is also, in many stages, critical of NASA's performance over the last thirty years, as well as the United Kingdom's disaster programs.

The King Rising was the first original magic effect to be released by the company, paving the way for many inventors to come. Some consider it to be a variation of the Balducci levitation. Effect The performer is viewed from the side. The performer's legs may be covered (commonly with a jacket) at the beginning of the effect. At this point the performer may patter, saying something like, ‚ÄúYou may have seen other magicians levitate behind a jacket...\\". This is a reference to the Superman levitation. The obstruction (jacket, etc.) would then be removed. The performer's whole body is clearly visible. The performer suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. Both feet are clearly seen to be in the air. The levitation usually lasts just a few seconds. When both feet return to the ground, the performer's legs may again be momentarily obscured. The performer may again make a comparative reference to the Superman levitation. Immediately afterwards the effect is complete, and the performer (particularly the performer's clothing) and the area around the performer can be thoroughly examined. The King Rising levitation being performed The biggest advantage of this levitation effect is that it is (like the Balducci levitation) impromptu. It can be performed anytime, anywhere, as long as the performer is wearing pants and shoes. It is more believable than the Balducci levitation because both feet are clearly seen in the air. However, it does require a small set-up that must be done under some kind of cover (an obstruction or misdirection). It is also considerably more difficult to perform than the Balducci levitation. Method The performer stands so as to be viewed from the side. Under cover, the performer removes his or her foot from the far shoe and positions it at a right angle to that shoe, with the heel of the foot placed against the side of the shoe. After the obstruction is removed, the front of the performer's body can be seen. From the spectator's perspective it is impossible to tell that the performer's foot is out, because it is hidden by the leg closest to the viewers. The performer's weight is shifted to the leg, and the empty shoe is pinched between the angled foot and the shoe closest to the audience. The performer stands on the tip of the foot. Again, the foot remains hidden behind the shoes, which are both physically in the air, creating the genuine levitation. To end the effect the process is simply reversed. The key to this illusion is that the spectators assume that there is a foot inside of the shoe, which is only natural. When both shoes are seen above the ground, it is then assumed that both feet are above the ground, and the performer is levitating. An obstruction is generally used to hide the performer's action of removing, and replacing the foot in its shoe. It is possible however to perform the effect without ever covering the legs, by using misdirection.

SAC members have made, besides ANSI and ASCII art, VGA bitmap graphics, tracker music, and a variety of other works. SAC's character graphics have also been used in bottles and FTP servers. Origin and brief history SAC originated as a German-based art group, founded in December 1994 by six members: Dream Design, Kaethe, Raiser, Toxic Trancer and the two artists HeteroHetero, un coder pas comme les autres (translated: Hetero, not a common coder) written by Line de Norvege (Line from Norway) PC Team Magazine (France), Issue #42, 01/1999, ISSN 1264-935X and Roy, with Roy acting as the primary organizer of the group. The first SAC Art Pack was released the same month at \\"The Party\\" Demo Party in Herning, Denmark. During the mid to late 1990s most of the notable ANSI artscene groups had distanced themselves from the warez scene, rather creating art for the sake of art, or for bulletin boards that were purely artscene related. Seizing this opportunity, SAC moved into this vacant territory and quickly became recognized as the leading group of warez scene artists.Announcement of the release of SAC Pack #17 , mentioning Hetero, Dream Design and Roy and the group channel #SAC at the EFnet. PC Team Magazine (France), Issue #42, 01/1999, ISSN 1264-935X SAC was also able to establish credibility and respect from non-warez art groups and also demogroups of the broad and diverse computer art scene that was already established at the time. SAC organizational structure From the very beginning SAC had a very loose group structure. Members worked mostly independently with little if any direction from the group leaders. Every member has the freedom to decide for himself which art requests he is willing to fulfill and which not. Seniority was achieved by being an active member for an extended period of time. Exceptions were made occasionally for outstanding contributions to the Group. New member applications were accepted or rejected by a simple majority vote of the existing members. It was never the decision of a single person (regardless of the status of that member). All new member applications and artwork samples were published in designated member-only areas at the SAC World Headquarter BBS \\"Closed Society\\" which was located in Berlin, Germany. The applications were also made available on the Internet at SAC's IRC Channel #SAC on the EFnet and SAC FTP Server HQ's. =The role of the leader= The role of the leader was primarily the task (which wasn't always simple) of collecting the new artwork produced by members and assembling the new SAC Art Pack, updating the group's NFO file and releasing the Pack. This was not a problem because the leader of SAC Roy/SAC was also the SysOp of the SAC World headquarter BBS called \\"Closed Society\\". =The job of the artists, musicians and coders= * SAC artists created and still create today ASCII & ANSI Text art (.NFO release info file logos, file_id.diz logos, BBS artwork) and VGA pixel art for other computer groups, BBS's (bulletin board systems) and FTP sites, websites and more. * SAC musicians created \\"MOD\\" and later also MP3 music; just as a standalone piece of art or to be used in \\"Intros\\", Demo and other programs such as \\"Installers\\". * SAC \\"coders\\" or programmers programmed BBS ads, Cracktros and Intros using most of the time graphics and music created by fellow SAC Members. SAC/PPE For a brief period, SAC also had a PPE (PCBoard Programming Executable) section; this was eventually separated out from SAC and became the PPE Group \\"Peanuts\\" (Abbreviation: PNS). PPE's are programs written in the proprietary PCBoard Script Language PPL (PCBoard Programming Language). They could only be used for PCBoard and no other BBS Software. PCBoard was very popular at the time and was used by over 90% of the warez BBS systems that were running on a PC. The introduction of PPL in PCBoard Version 15.0 boosted the popularity of the until then fairly unknown BBS software by Clark Development. Up to this time the PC (warez) scene did not have a powerful BBS software that could compete with the Amiga BBS software Ami-Express (Short: Ami-X or simply /X). Almost all warez BBS systems running on Amigas used /X. The PC adaptation of /X called PC Express saw a brief period of widespread use but was soon replaced by PCBoard 15.x. All SAC PPE's and SAC Art Packs are available for download at the SAC founder's website. The official SAC website is currently under development. SAC today and tomorrow Towards the late 1990s, a good majority of NFO file ASCII art was created by various members of SAC. In 1999, lead ASCII artist ferrex ascended to the role of senior staff and leader, continuing to control the group to this day. Now a globally operating organization, SAC employs approximately 40 artists and programmers worldwide and continues to be one of the groups creating art for the warez scene.

Formerly known as W963, during the years when broadcasts were conducted via an induction loop around the university campus on 963 kHz AM, RAW now broadcasts from inside the Students' Union HQ building on 1251 kHz AM to the campus and previously on FM for four weeks of the year to Coventry, Kenilworth and surrounding areas. RAW also streams all its output online. History RAW began life as University Radio Warwick in the 1970-71 academic year by students who spent their summer vacation installing an induction loop transmission system in the Rootes residence buildings. (One of these students was David Davis, who would later go on to become a Conservative MP and serve as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.) The studios consisted of a wooden hut behind Rootes M (Meriden House) and broadcast at 312 metres (963 kHz). The station was soon rebranded to URW312. In 1977, the station was moved into the newly constructed social building (which would eventually become the Students' Union Building). On 30 January 1999, W963 rebranded itself as RaW and on 30 September 1999, the station began broadcasting on 1251 kHz AM, discarding the then obsolete induction loop system. RAW moved across the University of Warwick campus to University House in the Summer of 2008 as the Students' Union was refurbished. For the subsequent year RAW dropped its FM broadcast due to inability to use the FM antenna, resuming the annual broadcast for 2010. In the Summer of 2010, RAW returned to the Students' Union, and is now based on the second floor of SUHQ (previously known as Union North). Activities RAW provided a special broadcast service for the International Children's Games held in Coventry in July 2005, and was named the official broadcaster for this period. In late 2005, David Davis, the Shadow Home Secretary, launched his bid for the Conservative Party leadership with a visit to RAW, the station which he helped to found. Following an interview in the studio (surrounded by around 20 journalists), Davis held a Press Conference in the Rootes Social Building Panorama Room, which symbolised the beginning of his campaign. His interview in the studio was later syndicated by BBC Radio 4 and the trip to the station reported on a number of media outlets. 2006 saw a large amount of work done to the station. Studio 1 saw the installation of a bespoke digital playout system ('Digiplay') as well as redecoration, and a new office was built in the foyer of the station allowing DJs to work undisturbed. In 2011 four members of the station embarked on a charity fundraiser named \\"RAW on Tour\\". The tour consisted of a visit to 52 SRA affiliated student radio stations in England within one week. Over ¬£1,000 was raised for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and the station was announced winner of the Charity Champion prize at the I Love Student Radio Awards later that year. In May 2012 the station received recognition from notable industry website Media UK for an impressive set of audience figures which, in some areas of analysis, eclipsed a number of national radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and the Absolute Radio Network. In 2013, RAW began its MaRaWthon Outside Broadcast that raised over ¬£1500 for the charity Coventry Cyrenians by broadcasting for 100 hours, day and night, on the Piazza at Warwick University, as well as winning 4 Student Radio Awards for the previous years broadcasting in the categories Best Newcomer (Gold), Best Live Event (Gold), Best Speech (Silver), and Best Entertainment (Bronze). In 2017, RAW launched a 50 Hour Broadcast in aid of Parkinson's UK. With the help of The Cheeky Girls & John Stapleton (patrons of the charity), as well as LBC's Steve Allen and Darren Adam, and BBC's Chris Stark they managed to raise just under ¬£3,000 for the charity. Awards RAW has twice been named the Student Radio Association's Station of the Year, in 2000 and 2003, along with other gold awards in both on and off air categories.

It was part of the medieval commote (Welsh: cwmwd) of Tir Iarll. History and amenities The village is the site of Llangynwyd parish church, the ruins of Llangynwyd Castle and one of the oldest pubs in Wales (the Old House, dating from 1147.) The place name Llangynwyd refers to the hilltop village with a church dedicated to St Cynwyd, son of Cynfelyn. The church was founded by St Cynwyd in the 6th century. All that remains of the original structure is the stone socket of a wooden cross, which can be seen in the wall above the entrance. The church was rebuilt in the 13th century and has since been restored several times. The square tower dates from the 15th century and was completely restored in 1893. The church has the biggest private cemetery in Europe. The old village of Llangynwyd, \\"Top Llan\\", was the home of the legendary Maid of Cefn Ydfa, featured in the song \\"Bugeilio'r Gwenith Gwyn\\". It was also the home of the poet Wil Hopcyn, said to have written it. The antiquary T. C. Evans was born in the parish, as was the poet Evan Bevan. The village still celebrates the New Year, or Calennig, with the Mari Lwyd: a horse's skull draped in a white sheet with flowers. Today the \\"old\\" village of Llangynwyd is commonly referred to as \\"Top Llan\\" and the more recent and much larger adjoining village is simply called \\"Llangynwyd\\" Education The village is home to Llangynwyd Primary School, built in 1911, and to Bridgend's first Welsh-language comprehensive school, Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Llangynwyd, which takes pupils from the county borough's four primary schools that teach in Welsh: Ysgol Cynwyd Sant, Ysgol Bro Ogwr, Ysgol y Ferch o'r Sg√™r and Ysgol Cwm Garw. Ward Llangynwyd is also the name of the electoral ward which covers the village. The ward is coterminous with the community of Llangynwyd Middle. The ward elects one county councillor to Bridgend County Borough Council.

History  = 1994-1995 = Pridebowl was created by Aaron Goulding (vocalist and writer from Newport Beach, California), Henrik Nilsson, Stefan Glendell, Oskar Andersson and Martin Bodin who are all from Varberg, Sweden. The band took form by the end of September 1994 and within a couple of months their demo tape, titled Ambitious Ways was completed. Pridebowl's vocalist Aaron left for home on December 29. Just before Pridebowl split up many record labels received a copy of the demo tape. Lost & Found Records from Germany was soon to take interest and promised a seven-inch of the Pridebowl demo and scattered exposure. This never happened though. Through Satanic Surfers (who Pridebowl had played with just before Christmas) a demo found its way to the Bad Taste Records headquarters where everyone was very impressed with this young quintet. In March Aaron was flown back to Sweden to start rehearsing and later on recording the first Pridebowl EP Long-Distance (btr 4). = 1995-1996 = The sound of Pridebowl can be said to be speedy, melodic punk rock with serious, explosive lyrics and catchy rhythms. Pridebowl simply means to roll with your pride, no matter what tries to bring you down. Basically, keep your chin up, the bad never lasts as long as the good and value yourself or no one else will. A number of compilation albums, surfing, and bodyboarding videos followed and in January 1996 the band was back in the studio again. This time they recorded at Studio Underground (where Satanic Surfers and No Fun at All had previously recorded) and the 12 tracks were released as Dripping of the Past late February the same year. This was followed by a CD-single in March and a video of the title track, The Soft Song in May. The video was shot by Apollon Bild & Film who had previously made videos by Millencolin, Roxette and E-Type to name but a few. In June/July 1996 Pridebowl played nine shows in California with bands like Strung Out, Good Riddance, Home Grown and Falling Sickness. In September/October they toured Sweden with Adhesive followed by Europe in February together with labelmates Intensity and Astream. Before leaving on this tour though they once again went to V√§ster√•s to record their second full length, Where You Put Your Trust\\". The sales of the album quickly exceeded Drippings‚Ä¶ and it was also licensed to Shock Records in Australia. = 1997-1998 = In the last week of March 1997 the band embarked on the first (and only) Canadian tour. It was the third annual Sno Jam tour and Pridebowl played approximately a dozen shows together with Snfu, Good Riddance, Satanic Surfers & Diesel Boy. During the remainder of spring, Pridebowl played a few shows in Sweden on their own or supporting bigger bands such as The Misfits for example. Late June, they went out on a one-week tour, playing three shows in France, a skate festival in Italy and a couple of shows in Belgium. Summer ended with them performing at a festival in Emmaboda. Henrik and Stefan quit the band shortly hereafter and Patrik Sundin and Mattias Jagborn took their places. The first recording they did together was in September when six tracks where recorded at the studio in Varberg, Recordia. Three of these tracks ended up the Adhesive split No Better, No Worse released in November 1997 and the other three are available on the final album Yesterday‚Äôs End. In October they went on a full European tour together with Turtlehead and this was immediately followed by a tour of Asia and Australia in Nov/Dec! The first show was in Hong Kong and the band went from here up to Beijing where another couple of shows were played. After touring China (as the first foreign punk band ever) and basically risking their lives considering the contents of their lyrics, they played four shows in Japan and then flew over to Australia for the last two weeks on this tour. In Australia they played with Frenzal Rhomb which is one of the biggest punk bands around attracting up to 5 thousand (people) at their shows. They returned from Australia at the end of 1997 and when Aaron went to the US for a month in January, the other members more or less decided to put an end to the band. Things had gotten worse and worse between them during the different tours and they all felt (Aaron included) that they couldn't go on anymore. Three final songs were recorded before Aaron went back to the U.S. for good and Yesterday's End (containing mostly unreleased, but also some out of print material) was released late September 1998 and can be seen as the band's farewell album to all their fans. = 2003-now = Pridebowl reformed in California in 2003 with an all-American line-up, followed by a two-week tour of Eastern Canada. Aaron Goulding on vocals, Cory Waterhouse and Paul Peterson on guitars, Todd Daigle on bass, and Dan Achin playing drums. Later Paul was replaced by Wayne Carter, and Dan was replaced by Matt Reynolds. A six-song EP, titled Tired was recorded in June 2004 and released on Canada's Freedumb Records the following September.

It persists during the transition of sleep to wakefulness, where an individual will experience feelings of drowsiness, disorientation and a decline in motor dexterity. Impairment from sleep inertia may take several hours to dissipate. In the majority of cases, morning sleep inertia is experienced for 15 to 30 minutes after waking. Sleep inertia is of concern when decision-making abilities, safety-critical tasks and the ability to operate efficiently are important soon after awakening. In these situations, it poses an occupational hazard due to the cognitive and motor deficits that may be present. Symptoms * \\"Grogginess\\", as defined by a drowsy or disoriented state in which there is a dampening of sensory acuity and mental processing. * Impaired motor dexterity and decrease in cognitive ability. These gross impairments may be responsible for the associated increase in reaction time and drop in attentiveness. * Deficits in spatial memory * Reports of heightened subjective fatigue These symptoms are expressed with the greatest intensity immediately after waking, and dissipate following a period of extended wakefulness. The duration of symptoms varies on a conditional basis, with primary expression during the first 15‚Äì60 minutes after waking and potentially extending for several hours. Tasks that require more complex cognitive operations will feature greater deficits as compared to a simple motor task; the accuracy of sensory and motor functioning is more impaired by sleep inertia as compared to sheer speed. In order to measure the cognitive and motor deficiencies associated with sleep inertia, a battery of tests may be utilized including psychomotor vigilance task, descending subtraction task, auditory reaction time task, and the finger tapping task. Causes * Studies have shown that abrupt awakening during stage 3 sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), produces more sleep inertia than awakening during sleep stages 1, 2 or REM sleep * Prior sleep deprivation increases the percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Therefore, an individual who was previously sleep deprived will have a greater chance of experiencing sleep inertia. * Adenosine levels in the brain progressively increase with sleep deprivation, and return to normal during sleep. Upon awakening with sleep deprivation, high amounts of adenosine will be bound to receptors in the brain, neural activity slows down, and a feeling of tiredness will result * Studies show that individuals express a lack of blood flow to the brain upon awakening. Levels of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) will take up to 30 minutes to increase and reach daytime levels. Studies using advanced imaging have shown that cerebral blood flow will return to waking levels in the brainstem and thalamus first. Then, after 15 minutes, the brain's anterior cortical regions receive normal daytime blood flow. This 15 minute time period corresponds to the sleep inertia period.  Treatments / countermeasures  There has been a great deal of research into potential methods to relieve the effects of sleep inertia. The demand for remedies is driven by the occupational hazards of sleep inertia for employees who work extended shifts such as medical professionals, emergency responders, or military personnel. The motor functioning and cognitive ability of these professionals who must immediately respond to a call can pose a safety hazard in the workplace. Below are some of the various methods that have been suggested to combat sleep inertia. = Napping = When a person is sleep deprived, re-entering sleep may provide a viable route to reduce mental and physical fatigue but it can also induce sleep inertia. In order to limit sleep inertia, one should avoid waking from the deeper stages of slow-wave sleep. The onset of slow-wave sleep occurs approximately 30 minutes after falling asleep, therefore a nap should be limited to under 30 minutes to prevent waking during slow-wave sleep and enhancing sleep inertia. Furthermore, self-awakening from a short nap was shown to relieve disorientation of sleep inertia as opposed to a forced awakening but these results may warrant more research into the nature of arousal after sleep periods. = Caffeine = Caffeine is a xanthine derivative that can cross the blood-brain barrier. The caffeine present in coffee or tea exerts its stimulating action by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. By antagonizing the adenosine receptors caffeine limits the effects of adenosine buildup in the brain and increases alertness and attentiveness. Previous research has shown that coupled with a short nap, consuming caffeine prior to the nap can alleviate the effects of sleep inertia. Nonetheless, individual degree of consumption and tolerance to caffeine may be responsible for variation in its efficacy to reduce sleep inertia symptoms. = Light = The natural light provided by the sunrise may contribute to a reduction in sleep inertia effects. Research simulating increase of light at dawn was shown to potentiate the cortisol awakening response (CAR). The CAR is a spike in blood cortisol levels following awakening, and is associated with the return to an alert cognitive state. = Other = Some other interventions that could potentially minimize the effects of sleep inertia are sound and temperature. There is moderate evidence that the presence of mild sounds and a sharp decrease in the temperature of the extremities may independently reverse sleep inertia symptoms. Noise, especially music, is thought to increase attentiveness and decrease one's subjective feeling of sleepiness upon awakening. A drop in temperature of the extremities may prevent heat loss upon awakening, facilitating the return of core body temperature to homeostatic daytime levels.

Commissioned by the Crown to drain Hatfield Chase in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire, Vermuyden was knighted in 1629 for his work and became an English citizen in 1633. In the 1650s, he directed major projects to drain The Fens of East Anglia, introducing the innovation of constructing washes, to allow periodic flooding of the area by excess waters. Early life and education Cornelius was the son of Giles Vermuyden and Sarah Werkendet. He was born in 1595 in Sint-Maartensdijk on the Isle of Tholen in Zeeland, Netherlands. He trained in the Netherlands as an engineer, learning Dutch techniques for controlling water and draining marshland. Career in England By the period of 1621 to 1623, Vermuyden was working in England, where his first projects were on the River Thames, repairing a sea wall at Dagenham and working to reclaim Canvey Island, Essex. The latter project was financed by Joas Croppenburg, a Dutch haberdasher to whom Vermuyden was related by marriage.Reclamation of Canvey Island , Castle Point website This, or perhaps work at Windsor, brought him to the notice of Charles I, who commissioned him in 1626 to drain Hatfield Chase in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire. The King was Lord of the four principal manors there: Hatfield, Epworth, Crowle and Misterton, as well as 13 of the adjacent manors, and he wanted to expand the cultivable area. Vermuyden was to receive one third of the drained land, most of which had previously been commons, as recompense for his investment. To finance the drainage project, he sold shares in this land to other investors, including some fellow Dutchmen. Some French and Walloon Protestant refugees also settled in the area as landowners or tenants. The King intended to enclose one third of the common fen in his right of \\"improvement\\" as the Lord of the Manor, leaving one-third for those local residents who had common rights of pasturage in the fens. The local people were upset by the project, particularly those of the Manor of Epworth, whose lord had already enclosed part of the commons in the 14th century. He had later signed a legal document giving up all subsequent rights of enclosure within the manor. As with other fen drainage schemes at the time, the locals did not oppose drainage per se, but were outraged about the large enclosures of their common pasture and turbary fens. This threatened their commons rights and livelihoods, as they depended on the fens for pasturage and for peat for burning as fuel. From 1627, the richer members of the community challenged the project in court by lawsuits, even as large groups of commoners (not necessarily poor people, but including some substantial farmers) rioted against the works and the enclosures. Because the legal position of the commoners of Epworth was unique, the legal debate over the drainage and enclosures lasted into the eighteenth century. Vermuyden was knighted in 1629 for his work, and became a British citizen in 1633. In 1631 he built the Horseshoe Sluice on the tidal river at Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire at a cost of ¬£8,000, by a \\"little Army of Articifers Venting, contriving and acting outlandish devises\\" The work on Hatfield Chase was only partially successful: the straightening of the river Don and outlet into the Aire caused flooding in Fishlake, Sykehouse and Snaith. As a result of a lawsuit in 1633, Vermuyden dug the Dutch River, which provided a direct route from the Don to the River Ouse at Goole. It required him to deplete most of the land that he had acquired in the Chase. The same year he bought of land in Sedgemoor on the Somerset Levels and Malvern Chase in Worcestershire; he also entered into a partnership in the lead mines in Wirksworth, which he drained by means of a sough. The Fens in eastern England Contrary to popular belief, Vermuyden was not involved with the draining of the \\"Great Fen\\" in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk in the 1630s. He did not participate until the second phase of construction in the 1650s. This area of marshland was naturally drained by a labyrinth of rivers. It had been inadequately maintained since before the dissolution of the monasteries in 1537 during the English Reformation, as the monasteries had been chiefly responsible in the region for keeping the channels clear. The initial plan for the drainage was based on a proposal by John Hunt in 1604 - 1605, to construct a new river long from Earith to Denver, shortening the length of the River Great Ouse by many miles. It was eventually named the Bedford River (subsequently Old Bedford River) after Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, who was the chief Adventurer and financier. The project created or improved eight other channels. The operation was judged as substantially complete in 1637. It was criticized for its limited goal to provide \\"summer lands\\", leaving the land subject to winter flooding. The Merchant Adventurers had been offered by the Crown as the reward for their work. This settlement was disrupted: first by the riots, which erupted against the enclosures (and that occurred periodically into the 1650s), and second, by the King. He reversed the granting of Bedford's contract and declared himself as the principal in the project, taking and leaving the other parties with only . At this time, Vermuyden was recruited to participate in the Great Level, as in 1637 he wrote a \\"Discourse Touching the Draining of the Great Fennes\\" for the King (it was not published until 1642). In it, he proposed two innovations to the drainage scheme: washes - areas of land allowed to flood in periods of bad weather to absorb the extra water that cannot drain to the sea - and a catchdrain around the eastern edge of the fen. The washes were constructed as part of the second phase of drainage in the 1650s, but the catchdrain was not developed until the early 1960s. This catchdrain follows the contours of the western edge of the hilly brecklands where they rise above the fen, commencing in the south at Mildenhall through Hockwold Cum Wilton northwards to Denver Sluice. At the latter village the River Little Ouse flows westwards off the brecks from Brandon enclosed within high embankments, over an aqueduct many feet higher than the catchment drain and surrounding farmland. Thus illustrating many of the anachronistic but brilliant features (in engineering terms), the work of Vermuyden commenced. Charles I appointed Vermuyden as his agent for the draining on 19 September 1639, but his government did not approve the plan until 5 August. In a precarious position with all three of its kingdoms, the Crown lacked both sufficient funds and attention to pay for the works in the Great Level, but it authorized Vermuyden to start. He widened the River Nene below Horseshoe Sluice, banking the north side of Morton's Leam. Beginning on the south, he set a new sluice, known as Shire Drain, and cut a new channel at the mouth of the Nene through the salt marshes to the sea. Vermuyden was still working in the Great Level as of May 1642, but was by then responding to the House of Lords, rather than the beleaguered King. Having received perhaps less than ¬£5000, the engineer was continually in arrears for the wages of his workmen. During the Civil War, the drainage project was halted by the chaos of war. The original financiers - now headed by Bedford's heir William - began to seek an Act of Parliament to overturn the King's takeover of their project and to gain restoration of all of the first awarded in January 1630/31. By 29 May 1649, a few months after the King's execution, they had succeeded; an Act of Parliament (later known as \\"The Pretended Act\\") restored them to the undertaking and gave their claim to the enclosures the force of law. Before this time, Vermuyden's activities are not clear; there is some inconclusive evidence that one of his nephews may have acted as a colonel of horse in the parliamentary army, alongside Oliver Cromwell in the Eastern Association army.A Parliamentarian \\"Colonel Vermunden\\" was mentioned by the newsbook Mercurius Civicus in July 1644 (Issue 62, British Library Thomason Tracts E.4[3]) But with the beginning of the second phase of Bedford-led construction, Vermuyden was again appointed as the director of the works in January 1649/50. This second phase included continuing the work of both the first and the King's (1.5 phase). In addition, he dredged the New Bedford River (with a large area of wash between it and the Bedford River) and the Forty Foot Drain. He established Denver Sluice to stop tides and flood water from depositing silt into the Great Ouse to the east of Ely. The work did not include his projected \\"cutoff channel,\\" which was designed to take flood water from the southern rivers, the Wissey, Little Ouse and Lark, away from Denver. As a result, the area suffered continued flooding, which was not controlled until a project of the early 1960s. Due to the high cost of labour, and the continuing unpopularity of the project among the local inhabitants, the government provided Vermuyden with Scottish and Dutch prisoners of war (after the Battle of Dunbar (1650) and the start of the war with the Dutch respectively) as labourers in this phase of construction. Vermuyden's relationship with the other adventurers was never easy and, by 1655, they had parted company altogether. Several other of his initiatives failed, including a proposal for a treaty between England and the States-General of the Netherlands which he made to Cromwell. In addition, Vermuyden was unable to gain support to drain his areas of Sedgemoor and Malvern Chase. Marriage and family Vermuyden married Katherine Lapps. One son Cornelius Vermuyden became an Original Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663 and the Royal African Company, established to explore Africa and report on its resources, other children included Charles, Deborah, Elizabeth, John and four others. His second wife was Dionysia Stonhouse. Vermuyden lived in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden in 1647 and had a home in Kelfield , North Lincolnshire. Reclamation results Despite the initial success of the reclamation, the engineers did not understand enough about the ecology of the fens. The drying of the land caused the peat to shrink greatly, lowering the remaining land below the height of the drainage channels and rivers. This caused the reclaimed farmland to become vulnerable again to flooding. By the end of the 17th century, much of the reclaimed land was regularly flooded. This continued until the development of steam-powered pumps in the early 19th century. The drop in the land level can be seen at the pumps near Ramsey Forty Foot, where animal-powered pumps, steam pumps and now fossil-fuel pumps are all co-located, at different heights. They demonstrate both the development of technology and the resulting decline in land levels. Prickwillow Museum has a large pumping engine in working order, but not actively used.

She was purchased from Norway at the beginning of the First World War, but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched over three years earlier. She engaged targets in Occupied Flanders for the last several months of the war and fired the last shots of the war against such targets on 15 October 1918. She was used as a target ship after several attempts to sell her had fallen through before being sold for scrap in 1928. Background Nidaros was ordered by Norway in 1913 to supplement the older and classes of coastal defense ships. She would have been known in Norway as P/S Nidaros; P/S stands for Panserskip (\\"armoured ship\\"), while Nidaros was the old name for the Norwegian city of Trondheim. However, when the First World War broke out, the Royal Navy requisitioned most warships under construction in Britain for foreign powers and refunded the two-thirds of the Bj√∏rgvins ¬£370,000 purchase price already paid by the Norwegians.Buxton, p. 107 Construction and description Nidaros was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick on 11 June 1913 and launched on 9 June 1914. She was renamed as Gorgon, after an earlier breastwork monitor of 1871. Her completion was greatly delayed by the modifications made by the British, which included modifying the boilers to use both oil and coal and conversion of 12 double-bottom tanks to carry oil. This work began on 9 January 1915, but was suspended the following May, when it was estimated that only another 10‚Äì12 months of work remained, to allow for faster progress to be made on the large light cruisers and that were building in Armstrong's Naval Yard downriver. In September 1917, work was resumed on a new design that added a large anti- torpedo bulge along about 75% of the hull's length, suppression of the torpedo tubes and the guns planned by the Norwegians, and a large tripod mast was fitted behind the single funnel to carry the directors for both the and guns. Both of these guns had to be relined to use standard British ammunition and the mount for the 9.2-inch gun was modified to give a maximum elevation of 40¬∞ which gave the gun a maximum range of . Addition of the bulges cost in speed, but prevented the extra weight resulting from all of these changes from deepening her draft. She was finally completed on 4 June 1918.Buxton, pp. 107, 113 Gorgon displaced at deep load as built, with a length of , a beam of at maximum, although her main hull only had a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines, which developed a total of from four Yarrow watertube boilers and gave a maximum speed of .Buxton, p. 113 She was armed with two 9.2-inch guns arranged in two single- gun turrets, one turret each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of four six-inch guns, also in single gun turrets, two of which superfired over the 9.2-inch turrets and the others were positioned on each side of the superstructure. One anti-aircraft gun was mounted on each center-line six-inch turret. She also carried four 3-pounder and four 2-pounder guns on high-angle mounts. Service Gorgon arrived at Dover on 6 June 1918 where she spent the next five weeks working up. Her first engagement was on 26 July when she fired eight rounds at a range of at a German howitzer battery to calibrate her guns and fire control system, which provoked a response from the German gun of Batterie Pommern south of Ostende. Three days later, she accompanied on a bombardment of Batterie \\"Tirpitz\\". She spent the next month and a half either out on patrol in the English Channel or preparing for the bombardment scheduled for the end of September in support of a major offensive along the coast.Buxton, p. 109 At daybreak on 28 September 1918, Gorgon, in company with , anchored about off De Panne, Belgium and opened fire about 7:15 on a bridge at Snaeskerke, Belgium at a range of . Conditions were not good as both wind and tide were against her. Gorgons stern anchor cable parted and she swung around on her bow anchor so that only her rear turret could bear on the target. No aircraft were made available to spot for her so there was little chance of a hit and she only fired eleven rounds. She, and the other monitors, were attacked several times during the day by German aircraft with little effect and several coast defense batteries attempted to engage them through the smokescreen put up by the motor launches supporting the operation. She fired thirteen shells the next day in another attempt to destroy the bridge and claimed one hit although this was not confirmed by subsequent observations. On 14 October, she repeated the experience, except that her target was now the Middelkerke batteries. She fired 41 rounds during the morning at a range of , but she accompanied Vice-Admiral Keyes in the destroyer in a reconnaissance mission to see if the Germans were still holding the coast in strength. The fire of the Tirpitz and Raversyde Batteries soon disabused them of any notions to the contrary and Gorgon was forced to turn away at maximum speed (), which was faster than she'd made on trials, when they straddled her and hit her with splinters from the near-misses. The following day she returned to her original target and fired 30 rounds in 20 minutes. These were the last shots of the war fired against German batteries on the Belgian coast.Buxton, pp. 109‚Äì10 She was sent to Portsmouth after the end of the war where she was made available to investigate the cause of her sister ship Glattons magazine explosion.Conway's, p. 47 She was moved to Devonport as a temporary tender to the stone frigate Vivid in April 1919. She was paid off on 31 August and joined the Reserve Fleet in September. She was offered back to the Norwegians, but they rejected her as unsuitable to their requirements, especially since she was now too broad for their dock at Horten. Several attempts were made to sell her, but she was disarmed in 1922 and used as a target ship to evaluate the effects of bombs bursting underwater near a ship and the effects of six-inch gunfire. She was finally sold for scrap on 26 August 1928 and broken up at the former naval dockyard at Pembroke.

The contract granted exclusive rights to Britain to sell slaves in the Spanish Indies. The Asiento de Negros was a monopoly contract between the Spanish Crown and various merchants for the right to provide African slaves to colonies in the Spanish Americas. The Spanish Empire rarely engaged in the trans-Atlantic slave trade directly from Africa itself, choosing instead to contract out the importation to foreign merchants from nations more prominent in that part of the world; typically Portuguese and Genovese, but later the Dutch, French and British. The asiento specified the places of importation and the points of delivery, as well as navigation routes. The contract was usually obtained by foreign merchant banks who cooperated with local or foreign traders, specialized in shipping. Different organisations and individuals would bid for the right to hold the asiento. The original impetus to import enslaved Africans was to relieve the indigenous inhabitants of the colonies from the labor demands of the Spanish colonists.Haring, Clarence. The Spanish Empire in America, New York: Oxford University Press 1947, p. 219. The enslavement of Amerindians had been halted by the influence of Dominicans such as Bartolom√© de las Casas. Spain gave individual asientos to Portuguese merchants to bring slaves to South America. In 1575 the decree of bankruptcy ruined almost all the Spanish \\"asentistas\\".

Between the early 16th and the mid-18th century, asientos were used by the Spanish treasurer to adjust short- term imbalances between revenues and expenditures. The sovereign promised to repay the principal of the loan plus high interest. The participant bankers in Seville, Lisbon, Genoa and Amsterdam, in turn, drew on the profits and direct investments obtained from a large number of Atlantic merchants.A Nation upon the Ocean Sea: Portugal's Atlantic Diaspora and the Crisis of ... by Daviken Studnicki-Gizbert, pp. 112‚Äì113 In exchange for a set of scheduled payments, merchants and financiers were given the right to collect relevant taxes or oversee the trade in those commodities that fell under the monarch's prerogative.

In a commercial context it means \\"contract, trading agreement\\". In the words of Georges Scelle, it was \\"a term in Spanish public law which designates every contract made for the purpose of public utility...between the Spanish government and private individuals.\\"Postma, Johannes, The Dutch in the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1600-1815 (Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 29. The asiento system was established following Spanish settlement in the Caribbean, when the indigenous population was undergoing demographic collapse and the Spanish needed another source of labor. Initially a few Christian Africans born in Iberia were transported to the Caribbean. But as the indigenous demographic collapse was ongoing and opponents of Spanish exploitation of indigenous labor grew, including that of Bartolom√© de Las Casas, the young Habsburg king Charles I of Spain allowed for the direct importation of slaves from Africa (bozales) to the Caribbean. The first asiento for selling slaves was drawn up in August 1518, granting a Flemish favorite of Charles, :es:Laurent de Gouvenot, a monopoly on importing enslaved Africans for eight years with a maximum of 4,000. Gouvenot promptly sold his licence to the treasurer of the Casa de la Contrataci√≥n de Indias and three subcontractors, Genoese merchants in Andalusia, for 25,000 ducats.Grete Klingenstein, Heinrich Lutz, Gerald Stourzh, EUROP√ÑISIERUNG DER ERDE?

The Casa de Contrataci√≥n in Seville controlled both trade and immigration to the New World, excluding Jews, conversos, Muslims, and foreigners. African slaves were considered merchandise, and their import regulated by the crown.Blackburn, The Making of New World Slavery, p. 135. The Spanish crown collected a duty on each \\"pieza\\", and not on each individual slave delivered.The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History, Volume 5 by Oxford University Press Spain had neither direct access to the African sources of slaves nor the ability to transport them, so the asiento system was a way to ensure a legal supply of Africans to the New World, which brought revenue to the Spanish crown.Shelly, Cara. \\"Asiento\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 218. New York: Charles Scribner's and Sons 1996, p. 218. =Portuguese and Sephardic monopoly= For the Spanish crown, the asiento was a source of profit. Haring says, \\"The asiento remained the settled policy of the Spanish government for controlling and profiting from the slave trade.\\" In Habsburg Spain, asientos were a basic method of financing state expenditures: \\"Borrowing took two forms ‚Äì long-term debt in the form of perpetual bonds (juros), and short-term loan contracts provided by bankers (asientos). Many asientos were eventually converted or refinanced through juros.\\"Mauricio Drelichman and Hans-Joachim Voth, \\"Lending to the Borrower from Hell: Debt and Default in the Age of Phillip II, 1566-1598\\", p. 6. Initially, since Portugal had unimpeded rights in West Africa via its 1494 treaty it dominated the European slave trade of Africans. Before the onset of the official asiento in 1595, when the Spanish monarch also ruled Portugal in the Iberian Union (1580‚Äì1640), the Spanish fiscal authorities gave individual asientos to merchants, primarily from Portugal, to bring slaves to the Americas. For the 1560s most of these slaves were obtained in the Upper Guinea area, especially in the Sierra Leone region where there were many wars associated with the Mand√© invasions. San Felipe, Spanish fort in Cartagena (Colombia). Following the establishment of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1575, and the gradual replacement of S√£o Tom√© by Brazil as the primary producer of sugar, Angolan interests came to dominate the trade, and it was Portuguese financiers and merchants who obtained the larger-scale, comprehensive asiento that was established in 1595 during the period of the Iberian Union. The asiento was extended to importation of African slaves to Brazil, with those holding asientos for the Brazilian slave trade often also trading slaves in Spanish America. Spanish America was a major market for African slaves, including many of whom exceeded the quota of the asiento licence and illegally sold. Till 1622 half of the slaves were destined for Mexico.The Transatlantic Slave Trade: A History by James A. Rawley, Stephen D. Behrendt, p. 63 Most smuggled slaves were not brought by freelance traders.Blackburn, The Making of New World Slavery, p. 181. Angolan dominance of the trade was pronounced after 1615 when the governors of Angola, starting with Bento Banha Cardoso, made alliance with Imbangala mercenaries to wreak havoc on the local African powers. Many of these governors also held the contract of Angola as well as the asiento, thus insuring their interests. Shipping registers from Vera Cruz and Cartagena show that as many as 85% of the slaves arriving in Spanish ports were from Angola, brought by Portuguese ships. In 1637 the Dutch West India Company employed Portuguese merchants in the trade.Postma, Johannes, The Dutch in the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1600-1815(Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 21. The earlier asiento period came to an end in 1640 when Portugal revolted against Spain, though even then the Portuguese continued to supply Spanish colonies. =Dutch, French and British competition= Main Spanish trade routes (white), showing the location of Seville, Havana, Portobelo, Cartagena and Veracruz. In the 1650s after Portugal achieved its independence from Spain, Spain denied the asiento to the Portuguese, whom it considered rebels.Shelly, \\"Asiento\\", p. 218. Spain sought to enter the slave trade directly, sending ships to Angola to purchase slaves. It also toyed with the idea of a military alliance with Kongo, the powerful African kingdom north of Angola. But these ideas were abandoned and the Spanish returned to Portuguese and then Dutch interests to supply slaves. (Captain Holmes's expedition captured or destroyed all the Dutch settlements on Ghana's coast.) The Spanish awarded large contracts for the asiento to the Dutch West India Company in 1675 rather than Portuguese merchants in the 1670s and 1680s.Blackburn, The Making of New World Slavery, p. 203. However, this same time period saw a resurgence of piracy In 1700, with the death of the last Habsburg monarch, Charles II of Spain, his will named the House of Bourbon in the form of Philip V of Spain as the successor to the Spanish throne. The Bourbon family were also Kings of France and so the asiento was granted in 1702 to the French Guinea Company, for the importation of 48,000 African slaves over a decade. The Africans were transported to French Caribbean colonies of Martinique and Saint Domingue. As part of their strategy of maintaining a balance of power in Europe, Great Britain and her allies, including the Dutch and the Portuguese, disputed the Bourbon inheritance of the Spanish throne and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession against Bourbon hegemony. Although Britain did not prevail, it did receive the asiento as part of the Peace of Utrecht.Similar patents in the British system were the Virginia Company, the Levant Company and the Merchant Adventurers' patent of trade with the United Provinces (essentially concurrent with the modern day Netherlands). An overview of the British system from a Marxist perspective is given by Robert Brenner, on the editorial board of the New Left Review, in \\"Merchants and Revolution\\". This granted Britain a thirty-year asiento to send one merchant ship to the Spanish port of Portobelo, furnishing 4800 slaves to the Spanish colonies. The asiento became a conduit for British contraband and smugglers of all kinds, which undermined Spain's attempts to keep a protectionist trading system with its American colonies.Shelly, \\"Asiento\\", p. 218 Disputes connected with it led to the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739).Haring, The Spanish Empire in America, p. 333. Britain gave up its rights to the asiento after the war, in the Treaty of Madrid of 1750, as Spain was implementing a number of administrative and economic reforms. The Spanish Crown bought out the South Sea Company's right to the asiento that year. The Spanish Crown sought another way to supply African slaves, attempting to liberalize its traffic, trying to shift to a system of the free trade in slaves by Spaniards and foreigners in particular colonial locations. These were Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, and Caracas, all of which used African slaves in large numbers.Haring, The Spanish Empire in America, p. 220-21  Holders of the Asiento  =Early: 1518‚Äì1595= * 1518‚Äì1527: Laurent de Gouvenot (aka Lorenzo de Gorrevod or Garrebod), Governor of Bresse and majordomo of Charles I of Spain.Thomas, Hugh (1997) The Slave Trade.

In March 1659 the Danish Africa Company was started by the Finnish Hendrik Carloff and two Dutchmen. Their mandate included trade with the Danish Gold Coast. Their goal was to compete with the Dutch, the Swedish Africa Company and the Portuguese. The Dutch competed with the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa founded in 1660. Both of these slaving powers had a strong presence on the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin; many slaves came from Cross River (Nigeria) in the Bight of Biafra and West Central Africa. The Dutch and Portuguese signed a new Treaty of The Hague (1661). Matthias Beck, who had left Dutch Brazil in 1654, was appointed by the WIC as governor of Cura√ßao, that, from 1662 to 1728 and intermittently thereafter, functioned as an entrep√¥t through which captives on Dutch transatlantic ships reached Spanish colonies.

In 1701, the French King granted the Guinea Company the Spanish Asiento and the company reorganised. Unlike any other chartered company before it, it included both the Spanish King and the French King as shareholders, for one quarter of the total capital each, which amounted to 100,000 livres. Because of commercial competition paying the French and Spanish for the Asiento was a prominent issue during the Spanish War of Succession.Colonial Legacies: The Problem of Persistence in Latin American History edited by Jeremy Adelman The Portuguese who apparently had trouble letting go of their Asiento rights ... were understood as a French privilege and indeed a marker of superior status of the French abroad.The Sun King's Atlantic: Drugs, Demons and Dyestuffs in the Atlantic World ...by Jutta Wimmler, p. 149 The Asiento did not concern French Caribbean but Spanish America. * December 2, 1711, Jacques Cassard obtained from the French king the command of a squadron of eight vessels and embarked on an expedition during which he plundered the Portuguese colony Cape Verde. He seized in particular fort Praia on Santiago, Cape Verde, the storehouse of the commerce. Then he set of to Montserrat and Antigua in the Caribbean before heading to the possessions of the Dutch. On 10 October 1712, Cassard attacked Suriname and Berbice, where demanded an amount of 300,000 guilders, which was paid in bills of exchange, slaves and goods. The negotiations with Suriname started, and on 27 October Cassard left with ∆í 747,350 (‚Ç¨8.1 million in 2018). Cassard returned to Martinique and set sail towards Sint Eustatius. Cura√ßao was occupied by Cassard from February 18 to 27, 1713, more substantial and richer than the previous ones, but it's also much better defended. * The King abolished the Asiento Company's monopoly in 1713 and opened the trade south of the Sierra Leone River to French private traders from five specific port towns: Nantes, Bordeaux, La Rochelle, Le Havre and Saint Malo.

In addition, the company was allowed to send one ship of 500 tons annually to Portobello to engage in normal trade to avoid contraband. The Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 granted Britain an Asiento lasting 30 years to supply the Spanish colonies with 4,800 slaves per year. Britain was permitted to open offices in Buenos Aires, Caracas, Cartagena, Havana, Panama, Portobello and Vera Cruz to arrange the Atlantic slave trade. An extra legal clause was added; one ship of no more than 500 tons could be sent to one of these places each year (the Nav√≠o de Permiso) with general trade goods. (Two ships were in addition to the annual ships, but were not part of the asiento contract.) One quarter of the profits were to be reserved for the King of Spain. The Asiento was granted in the name of Queen Anne and then contracted to the company.Carswell p. 64-66 It was provided that the same reporting procedure might take place at subsequent five year intervals. At the end of the contract the Assentistas were permitted three years to remove their effects from the Indies, adjust their accounts and ‚Äò‚Äòmake up a balance of the whole‚Äù.(A Collection of all the Treaties, 1785; AGI.

Walker, p. 259 By July the South Sea Company had arranged contracts with the Royal African Company to supply the necessary African slaves to Jamaica. Ten pounds was paid for a slave aged over 16, ¬£8 for one under 16 but over 10. Two-thirds were to be male, and 90% adult. The company trans-shipped 1,230 slaves from Jamaica to America in the first year, plus any that might have been added (against standing instructions) by the ship's captains on their own behalf. On arrival of the first cargoes, the local authorities refused to accept the Asiento, which had still not been officially confirmed there by the Spanish authorities. The slaves were eventually sold at a loss in the West Indies.Carswell p. 65-66 In 1714 the government announced that a quarter of profits would be reserved for Queen Anne and a further 7.5% for a financial advisor, Manuel Manasses Gilligan, an English colonist, who operated from the (neutral) Danish West Indies.Empire at the Periphery: British Colonists, Anglo-Dutch Trade, and the ... by Christian J.

Anne had secretly negotiated with France to get its approval regarding the asiento.Edward Gregg. Queen Anne (2001), pp. 341, 361. She boasted to Parliament of her success in taking the asiento away from France and London celebrated her economic coup. In 1714 2,680 slaves were carried, and for 1716‚Äì17, 13,000 more, but the trade continued to be unprofitable. As the French previously discovered, high costs meant the real profits from the slave trade asiento were in smuggling contraband goods, which evaded import duties and deprived the authorities of much needed revenue. An import duty of 33 pieces of eight was charged on each slave (although for this purpose two children were counted as one adult slave). In 1718 a declaration of war between England and Spain halted operations under the Asiento until 1721. Similar conflicts interrupted the contract from 1727 to 1729 and 1739 to 1748. Increasing knowledge of illicit trading by the SSC resulted in the Spanish tightening on-site monitoring in the Americas during the 1730s.Sugar and Slavery: An Economic History of the British West Indies, 1623-1775 By Richard B. Sheridan, p. 427 The Spanish then proceeded to seek recompense for clandestine trade carried on by the SSC and others under the veil of the supply of Negroes and the annual ship. Thus a key feature of the depredations crisis was the ongoing failure by the SSC to account and report in a transparent manner.Accounting and international relations: Britain, Spain and the Asiento treaty Salvador Carmona, Rafael Donoso, Stephen P. Walker, p. 258-259, 261, 263, 265 Spain having raised objections to the Asiento clauses, the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) was supplemented by the Treaty of Madrid (5 October 1750). The matter of the asiento was not even mentioned in the treaty, as it had lessened in importance to both nations, although both parties had agreed to resolve outstanding concerns at a \\"proper time and place\\"., p. 277.

In 1752 the African Company of Merchants was founded. It has been estimated that the company transported over 34,000 slaves with deaths comparable to its competitors, which was taken as competence in this area of work at the time. Meanwhile, it became a business for privately owned enterprises; the Dutch West India Company began to outsource the slave trade since 1730s?

By the middle of the 18th century, British Jamaica and French Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) had become the largest slave societies of the region. As of 1778, the French were importing approximately 13,000 Africans for enslavement to the French West Indies each year. * In 1762, the British imported more than 10,000 African slaves to Havana. They used it as a base to supply the Caribbean and the lower Thirteen Colonies.Rogozinsky, Jan. A Brief History of the Caribbean. Plume. 1999. In response to the short British occupation of Havana (1762‚Äì1763), when the British disembarked 3,500 slaves in ten months, the Spanish crown made determined efforts to revive their own transatlantic slave- trading role. Spain theoretically allowed no foreigners to share directly in the colonial trade, the effect of which was to starve the colonies of necessary imports and to encourage smuggling.https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/The-reign-of-Charles- III-1759-88 =Spanish: 1765‚Äì1779= The asiento was given to a group of Basques from 1765 to 1779. *1765‚Äì1772: Miguel de Uriarte in name of Aguirre, Aristegui, J.M.

A severe economic crisis in 1772 forced the Cliffords and a number of other bankers and their firms, such as Pels & Zonen going bankrupt. In 1773 many planters in Surinam came into financial trouble and the Dutch slave trade dropped. During the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War the English seized a few Dutch slave ships. An attempt to capture the Dutch castle at Elmina on the Africa's Gold Coast (modern Ghana) failed in 1782. While many Dutch territories in the West Indies were taken by the British, some, like Cura√ßao, were not attacked due to their defensive strength. In 1784, the Spanish crown contracted with the large Liverpool firm to bring slaves to Venezuela and Cuba between 1786‚Äì1789.Atlantic History and the Slave Trade to Spanish America ALEX BORUCKI, DAVID ELTIS, AND DAVID WHEAT, p. 450 In March 1795 the Batavian Republic did not accept all citizens on equal footing;S. Schama, p. 260-262 but the Dutch slave trade stopped till the Treaty of Amiens. Spain's connection to the slave trade with Africa was minor, after the Portuguese, the English, the French and Dutch, estimated at only 185 voyages and 276,885 slaves who embarked from 1500 to 1800. This compares to almost 25,000 voyages and over 7,331,831 slaves who disembarked in total by those nations from 1500 to 1800.https://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates Of the total number slaves, nearly half went to the Caribbean islands and the Guianas, almost 40 percent to Brazil, and some 6 percent to mainland Spanish America. Most of them arrived between 1601 and 1625, but the number dropped to its lowest between 1676-1700.https://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates Surprisingly enough, under 5 percent of the slaves went to North America.

They were part of the German metal scene to emerge in the early to mid-1980s. Over the course of their career, they have released sixteen studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. Although their earlier releases contained Satanic themes and imagery, from the third album on (Under Jolly Roger), the band's primary subject matter centered around pirates, sailing, and other historical events. In 1987, the band released the album Under Jolly Roger, which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes, creating and influencing the later named pirate metal subgenre of heavy metal in the 2000s in the process. While the historical lyrics were very superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched, by Rolf Kasparek in particular. After this album, from 1988 to 1992 (for the albums Port Royal, Death or Glory, Blazon Stone and Pile of Skulls), Running Wild mainly wrote historically based lyrics. In addition to lyrics about pirates like Calico Jack, Klaus St√∂rtebeker, or the little- known Henry Jennings, the band also addressed subjects like the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Waterloo, or the colonization of the New World by the Conquistadors. On 17 April 2009 Rolf announced that Running Wild had split up. Their intended last show was at Wacken Open Air on July 30, 2009. It was recorded for CD and DVD release and appeared as The Final Jolly Roger on June 24, 2011. The split would prove temporary as they reunited in 2012. Running Wild played live for the Wacken Open Air festival in July 2015. As of 2016, the band have released 16 studio albums, with their most recent being Rapid Foray. Early years and first albums The band formed in 1976 under the name Granite Heart, but they would change their name in 1979 to Running Wild after the Judas Priest song of the same name. The band recorded their first demo in 1981 and featured the songs \\"Hallow the Hell\\", \\"War Child\\" and \\"King of the Midnight Fire\\". The first two of these tracks appeared on the compilation album \\"Debut No. 1\\" on the Raubbau Label. In June 1984, the band started work on their debut album Gates to Purgatory, which was released by Noise Records, featuring satanic lyrics. The album proved to be a success, and the band quickly gained a cult following. Guitarist Gerald \\"Preacher\\" Warnecke left the band soon after the album's release. (Gerald \\"Preacher\\" Warnecke was studying theology at the time and is now a pastor in Cologne.) The band soon recruited Majk Moti to take his place, and soon recorded their follow up Branded and Exiled in 1985. The album sold 250,000 copies, expanding the group's fan base. This album would prove to be the final release of the band with satanic imagery in their music.  Rise in popularity, success and later albums  For the following release, the band shifted their sound and image and adopted a pirate theme. The band released Under Jolly Roger in 1987. This would prove a significant change because the band would be more known as a \\"pirate metal\\" band, with lyrics dealing with pirates and historical events. With this album, the band found their identity, and the pirate theme would be prominent on their future releases. Their 1988 follow-up release Port Royal featured a more mature style of songwriting and expanded on the pirate theme explored on their previous album. The album featured one of the band's first epics, Calico Jack. In 1989, the release of the band's fifth studio recording Death or Glory, proved to be the band's most successful album to date. The tour was also a success and a concert during the tour was filmed and was released as Death or Glory Tour. This album and tour would be the final release to feature guitarist Majk Moti and drummer Ian Finlay. Upon the departure of Moti and Finlay, Kasparek recruited guitarist Axel Morgan and drummer Rudiger Dreffein (better known as \\"AC\\") to record the band's first album in two years, Blazon Stone, released in 1991. The album continued the band's trend of writing about historical themes, and according to band leader, Rolf Kasparek, it was to be the band's best-selling album of the 1990s. The album proved to be a slight shift in their overall sound, as the band brought a more speed metal approach to their songs, which would be prevalent throughout their releases during the decade. In 1992, the band began work on Pile of Skulls which was regarded by many as one of the band's strongest efforts. Around this time, Kasparek started becoming more interested in conspiracy theories, becoming the basis of the next album, 1994's Black Hand Inn. 1995's Masquerade was the first in a trilogy of albums dealing with a specific theme. The album would go on to be one of Running Wild's worst selling albums up to that point. The second album followed with the 1998 album The Rivalry under their new label GUN Records with the conclusion of the trilogy culminating with 2000's Victory. It would be the final album featuring drummer J√∂rg Michael. With so many line-up changes, Running Wild was considered a solo project due to the fact that guitarist and main songwriter Rolf Kasparek remained the sole constant member of the band. The album The Brotherhood was released in 2002. It was to be another three years before Running Wild released another album Rogues en Vogue in 2005. The Final Jolly Roger, hiatus and reunion On 17 April 2009, Rolf Kasparek announced the disbandment of Running Wild. The band performed their final show at Wacken Open Air on 30 July 2009, which would be recorded for a future DVD release. The resulting effort The Final Jolly Roger was released on 24 June 2011 on CD and DVD format. In May 2011, Kasparek explained that he did not want the band to return due to other desires of his own. A biography, titled Death and Glory: The Story of a Heavy Metal Legend, was announced in June 2011 that was tentatively scheduled for release in 2013 or 2014, but no more information was given since then. In October 2011, Running Wild reformed and announced that they would record a new album titled Shadowmaker, which was released on 20 April 2012 via Steamhammer Records. In November 2012, Kasparek and guitarist Peter Jordan formed a side project called Giant X, releasing an album titled I in January 2013. The next album Resilient was released on 4 October 2013. The band made their return appearance at the 2015 edition of Wacken and included a brand new song from an upcoming album. The sixteenth album Rapid Foray was released on 26 August 2016. On 6 December 2019, an EP titled Crossing the Blades was released, which spawned the single \\"Ride on the Wild Side\\".

It is in the suburbs of the city of Paris, from the center of Paris. The centre of Courbevoie is situated 2 kilometres from the city limits of Paris. La D√©fense, a business district hosting the tallest buildings in the metropolitan area, spreads over the southern part of Courbevoie (as well as parts of Puteaux and Nanterre). Name The name Courbevoie comes from Latin Curva Via and means \\"curved highway\\", allegedly in reference to a Roman road from Paris to Normandy which made a sharp turn to climb the hill over which Courbevoie was built. Administration Courbevoie is divided into two cantons: Canton of Courbevoie-1 and Canton of Courbevoie-2. History A wooden bridge was built crossing the Seine at Courbevoie by order of King Henry IV when in 1606 his royal coach fell into the river while being transported by ferry. Rebuilt in stone during the eighteenth century, this was replaced by a metal bridge in 1946. The Convent of the Penitents founded in 1658 by Jean-Baptiste Forne was located in Courbevoie until the Revolution of 1789. Also located in the town was the barracks of the Swiss Guard of the monarchy. Transport Courbevoie is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris ‚Äì Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: Courbevoie and B√©con-les-Bruy√®res. Courbevoie is also served by Esplanade de La D√©fense station on Paris M√©tro Line 1, in the business district of La D√©fense. There are also a large number of city buses that come through the bustling La D√©fense station. When it comes to air transportation, Courbevoie can be served by Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport as well as Paris-Orly to the south and Beauvais Airport to the north. Education Courbevoie has multiple preschools and elementary schools. Junior high schools include:\\"Annuaire des √©tablissements / √©quipements .\\" Ville de Courbevoie.

Technically, the two justices were referred to as citra and ultra Trent (on the same side or across the River Trent), depending on where the royal court was held at the time, but are usually referred to in absolute geographical terms north and south. A holder was earlier usually referred to as a \\"justice of the forest\\" until the reign of Henry VIII, when the title of \\"justice in eyre\\" prevailed, except from 1311 to 1397, when they were usually styled \\"warden of the forest\\". However, they were \\"justices in eyre\\" in the Treason Act 1351 (under which it was high treason to kill them in the execution of their office). In 1397, the Commons plea that the Articles be pardoned except for pleas of land, quo warranto, treason, robbery, or other felonies. Henry de Bracton says that it was the practice of the justices to retire and confer with the busones of the county. In these busones we can see the persons whose names appear in the commissions of gaol delivery, oyer, and terminer, and who were in later days, as justices of the peace, to rule the county. With the decay of forest law and the lapse of the court of justice-seat, the post became a sinecure. A statute of 1817 abolished it after the decease of the current holders.57 Geo.

The dish is often part of a packed meal, or dosirak, to be eaten at picnics and outdoor events, and can serve as a light lunch along with takuan (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi. It is a popular take-out food in South Korea and abroad, and is known as a convenient food because of its portability. It is usually well wrapped (traditionally with aluminium foil, but now sometimes in paper) and does not have any liquid ingredients. Etymology  Gim () refers to edible seaweed in the genus Porphyra and Pyropia. Bap () broadly refers to \\"cooked rice\\". The compound term gimbap is a neologism; it was not a part of the Korean language until late modern period. The term gimbap was used in a 1935 Korean newspaper article,.  History  Gimbap was derived from norimaki, which is a type of sushi. Norimaki was invented in Edo period and noted in 1750. Japan introduced the norimaki to Korea during the Korea under Japanese rule. ÊñáÂåñ‰ΩìËÇ≤Ë¶≥ÂÖâÈÉ® ÊñáÂåñ„Çπ„Éà„Éº„É™„Éº„ÉÜ„É™„É≥„Ç∞ ÍπÄÎ∞•(Sources needed. Sources [6] and [7] does not exist.

However, the name Norimaki remained commonly used until the 1990s, so the Ministry of Culture and Tourism published \\"A Collection of Japanese Language Mellowing Materials\\" in 1995 and \\"A Collection of Japanese Language Mellowing Materials in Life\\" in 1996 by the National Institute of Korean Language, which promoted the replacement of Norimaki with Gimbap as one of the Japanese words that remain in the language of everyday life, and since then the name \\"Gimbap\\" has become established.Ë≤°Âõ£Ê≥ï‰∫∫Ëá™Ê≤ª‰ΩìÂõΩÈöõÂåñÂçî‰ºö„ÄåÂõΩË™ûÁ¥îÂåñÈÅãÂãï„Äç2009Âπ¥3Êúà17Êó• PRESSian1995Âπ¥Áô∫Ë°å„ÄåÊó•Êú¨Ë™ûÂºèÁîüÊ¥ªÁî®Ë™ûÁ¥îÂåñÈõÜ„ÄçÁ¥π‰ªãË®ò‰∫ãÔºàÊúùÈÆÆË™ûÔºâ(Sources needed to prove publication of aforementioned guides by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.) =North Korean Gimbap= North Korea also has a thin roll of Gimbap, which is a norimaki popularized by returnees from a program of returning Koreans in Japan that began in 1959.ÔºúÎ∂ÅÌïúÏÇ¨ÏßÑÎ≥¥Í≥†Ôºû ÏùòÏô∏Î°ú Îã§ÏñëÌïú Î∂ÅÌïú ÏÑúÎØºÏùò ÏãùÏÇ¨(3) Í≤ÄÍ≥† Í∏¥ Ïù¥ ÏùåÏãùÏùÄ Î¨¥Ïóá?

Link needed.)  Ingredients and preparation  Gim and bap are the two basic components of gimbap. While short-grain white rice is most commonly used, short-grain brown rice, black rice, or other grains may also serve as the filling. Some varieties of gimbap include cheese, spicy cooked squid, kimchi, luncheon meat, or spicy tuna. The gim may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In one variation, sliced pieces of gimbap may be lightly fried with an egg coating. Fillings vary, often with vegetarian and vegan options. Popular ingredients include danmuji (yellow pickled radish), ham, beef, imitation crab meat, egg strips, kimchi, bulgogi, spinach, carrot, burdock root, cucumber, canned tuna, and kkaennip (perilla leaves). To make the dish, gim sheets are toasted over a low heat, cooked rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil, and vegetable and meat ingredients are seasoned and stir-fried or pan- fried. The toasted gim is then laid on a gimbal‚Äîa bamboo gimbap roller‚Äîwith a thin layer of cooked rice placed evenly on top. Other ingredients are placed on the rice and rolled into a cylindrical shape, typically in diameter. The rolled gimbap is then sliced into bite-sized pieces.  Variants  Chungmu- gimbap * Chungmu-gimbap () ‚Äì Originating from the seaside city of Chungmu (currently Tongyeong), the dish features thinner rolls with an unseasoned surface and only rice as the filler ingredient. It is served with spicy ojingeo-muchim (squid salad) and seokbakji (radish kimchi). * Mayak-gimbap () ‚Äì A specialty of Gwangjang Market in Seoul. Mayak translates as \\"drug\\", a reference to its allegedly addictive and concentrated flavour. Small gimbap filled with carrots, spinach, and danmuji (yellow pickled radish) is sprinkled with ground sesame seeds and dipped in its pairing sauce made from soy sauce and mustard. * Samgak-gimbap () ‚Äì Literally \\"triangle gimbap\\". This variety is similar to Japanese onigiri, and is sold in convenience stores in South Korea. Fillings vary greatly. The expiration date is 1 day, and has a calorific value of between 140 and 200 kilo calories usually. *nude gimbap ‚Äì Unlike ordinary gimbap, the ingredients of the gimbap go inwards, and the rice comes out and covers the entire area. It is similar to Japanese style rolls, but uses ingredients used in Korean-style kimbap (hams, meat fillets, pickled radish, spinach, etc.) and is also served with cheese or sauce.  Restaurant franchises  Many South Korean fast food restaurant franchises specialize in gimbap and noodles. Among the chains are Gimbap Cheonguk (), Kobongmin Gimbabin (), Chungmu Gimbab Matjuk (), Teacher Kim (), Gimbap Nara (), Gimgane (), Gobong Gimbap (), Jongro Gimbap (), Rolling Rice, Gimbap King ( King), and Charles Sutbul Gimbap (). Some of these restaurants also serve other dishes, including dongaseu (pork cutlet), ramyeon (instant noodles), udong (thick noodle soup), naengmyeon (cold noodles), bibimbap, and stews such as kimchi- jjigae (kimchi stew), doenjang-jjigae (soybean paste stew), sundubu-jjigae (soft tofu stew), and omurice.  Cultural signifier of poverty  Gimbap is generally sold, pre-cut, in restaurants. However, due to the negative stigma surrounding begging, unskilled public busking and prostitution (both illegal in South Korea), selling whole gimbap as a street vendor is seen as the final noble and dignified form of busking that an otherwise able person, or family members of affected people, can do to get out of poverty. This is because virtually everybody can make this, and it is much more cost and time effective, and less labour-intensive, than making kimchi or preserved fruits. Vendors often sell and eat gimbap as an entire log, even after they are out of poverty or emergency. Selling whole also extends shelf life, and signifies longevity.

Early life Robert LeFevre in U.S. military uniform, 1944 LeFevre was born in Gooding, Idaho, on October 13, 1911, but when he was a child LeFevre's family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. LeFevre attended Hamline University studying English and drama. He then worked at a variety of jobs during the Great Depression, such as acting and radio announcing. For a short time, LeFevre was a Shakespearean actor. LeFevre was a follower of the \\"I AM\\" movement from 1936 to 1940 or so. He and one Pearl Diehl wrote a book in 1940 of their experiences in the organization called \\"I AM\\" ‚Äì America's Destiny (Twin City House, St. Paul, Minnesota). LeFevre told how one day, when he was in the radio station studio, he was struck by the Great I AM presence, who spoke to him personally. LeFevre also claimed a number of supernatural experiences: driving a car while asleep for over twenty miles without an accident (this was accomplished with the help of his \\"Higher Mental Body\\"), leaving his physical body for a trip through the air to Mount Shasta, and seeing Jesus. In 1940, I AM leaders Edna Ballard and her son Donald were indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles for use of the mails to defraud. Twenty-four other I AM leaders were also named in the first indictment; a supplemental indictment named LeFevre and Diehl as being defendants. During World War II, LeFevre served as an officer in the education and orientation division of the Army Air Corps before being discharged in 1945 after spending a year in Europe and being injured in an accident. Soon after, he and his wife went on a cross-country lecture tour \\"in a pilgrimage for world peace.\\" Their tour was bankrolled by the Falcon Lair Foundation, a nonprofit group interested in religion, philosophy and government whose headquarters were Falcon Lair, Beverly Hills, California (the former home of actor Rudolph Valentino). After the war, LeFevre went to California and worked in the real estate business and unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the Republican primary of 1950. He then became radio and television broadcaster becoming involved in anti-leftist causes, including work for an anti-union organization named the Wage Earners Committee. A year later the committee was sued by two movie producers, Stanley Kramer and Dore Schary, for picketing and libeling their films as being pro-Soviet. LeFevre and Ruth Dazey were among the defendants, but the case died when the Wage Earners Committee disintegrated. http://nwda- db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv29769 A few years later he became vice-president of Merwin K. Hart's National Economic Council; a director of the Congress of Freedom; a director of the U.S. (sometimes United States) Day Committee‚Äîwhose purpose it was to diminish in importance the observation of October 23 as United Nations Day‚Äîand an adviser to Harry Everingham's \\"We, The People!\\". The U.S. Day Committee made headlines in 1954 when LeFevre led an attack on the Girl Scout Handbook as having too many references to the United Nations. The Scouts retreated, reporting that more than forty changes had been made‚Äîabout half of which were due to LeFevre's protests. That same year LeFevre relocated to Colorado Springs and started to write editorials for R. C. Hoiles' Gazette-Telegraph. Two years later he founded the Freedom School. What animated LeFevre personally and the Freedom School ideologically‚Äîindeed, forms the bedrock upon which all courses were based‚Äîis a complicated philosophy that, in essence, rejects all government of modern times. Freedom School In 1956, LeFevre founded the Freedom School, which he ran until 1973, in Larkspur, Colorado. In 1965, after a flood devastated the campus, the school and college moved to Santa Ana, California. The Freedom School was designed to educate people in LeFevre's philosophy about the meaning of freedom and free-market economic policy. LeFevre added Rampart College, an unaccredited four-year school, in 1963. Both institutions shared the same campus, and had a press, The Pine Tree Press, which published works for both, including a newsletter for the Freedom School, the Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought (1965‚Äì68), and a tabloid for the Press itself.The Free Market, July 2001, Volume 19, Number 7 After Rampart College's closure in 1975, LeFevre carried on his work in South Carolina under the patronage of business giant Roger Milliken, and he also published Lefevre's Journal from 1974 to 1978. In 1979, LeFevre selected Freedom School graduate Kevin Cullinane to take over the teaching of Freedom School Seminars, including the Milliken Contract. Cullinane, who taught the principles of LeFevre's philosophy to students at Academy of the Rockies, which he had founded in 1972, taught Freedom School from 1979 until 2005 as part of Milliken's management training. He expanded its reach to include Sherman College, Wofford College, and individual seminars from coast to coast. Freedom School continues today from Tennessee, where Cullinane moved in 2000 to found Freedom Mountain Academy. Notable teachers at the Freedom School or Rampart College include Rose Wilder Lane, Milton Friedman, F.A. Harper, Frank Chodorov, Leonard Read, Gordon Tullock, G. Warren Nutter, Bruno Leoni, James J. Martin, and Ludwig von Mises. Notable graduates include Roy Childs, Kerry Thornley, and Roger MacBride. Rampart Institute In the late 1970s, LeFevre became involved with the Rampart Institute in Santa Ana, California. Along with Lawrence Samuels and Richard Deyo, LeFevre was one of the driving forces to found the institution, presenting two speeches that were turned into booklets: \\"Good Government: Hope or Illusion?\\" and \\"Does Government Protection Protect?\\" Not long after receiving its non-profit, tax-deductible status, Rampart Institute was officially launched at The Future of Freedom Conference banquet on April 19, 1980 at Cypress College. From that event came the \\"Liberty Book Project,\\" which sought to edit and publish LeFevre's 52-week audio home study-course called \\"The Fundamentals of Liberty\\". The hardback book was published posthumously in 1988, two years after LeFevre's death. Views LeFevre believed that natural law is above the law of the state and that for American society to prosper economically, free-market reforms were essential. He also believed that bestowing the good deeds of society on its government was no different from rewarding criminals for abstaining from illegal activity. All government consists of and that control our lives by stealing our property, restricting our freedom, and endangering our lives with the rationale of protecting us from ourselves. To this end, he adopted the term Autarchism to represent the idea of ruling over your own life, being responsible for yourself, your needs, and the consequences of your choices and actions. In a speech in 1977 and published the next year in the book Good Government: Hope or Illusion?, he said: =Pacifism= LeFevre was also famously a pacifist, and taught his brand of libertarianism during the 1960s at the Freedom School, later Rampart College. Given his dedication to pacifism, LeFevre also spoke out against war as a product of the state. He once gave a speech called \\"Prelude to Hell\\" to a local Lions Club about what it would be like for a typical American city to get nuked as a result of \\"those mighty, terrible, pointless conflicts that the modern state inevitably creates.\\" According to Doherty, LeFevre was \\"capable of facing down angry lieutenant colonels, who raged at his pacifistic refusal to fight for the flag, and explaining his theory of human rights so patiently, so guilelessly, that in the end the crusty colonel had to admit that LeFevre was right to stand his ground.\\" According to Robert Smith, LeFevre became convinced of the power of non- violent resistance after a run-in with a union. \\"I remember him telling the story,\\" says Smith, \\"of union goons busting into a radio station he worked at. And he just fell flat on the ground and lay there. They were so nonplussed they walked out without beating the shit out of him. That convinced him of the principles of nonviolence.\\" In popular culture * Some such as Brian Doherty claim that LeFevre's movement was a basis for Robert A. Heinlein's book The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and that LeFevre was the basis for the character Professor Bernardo de la Paz, organizer of the Lunar revolution. (published posthumously) * In the alternate history novel The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith as part of the North American Confederacy Series in which the United States becomes a libertarian state in 1794 after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, LeFevre served as the 23rd President of the North American Confederacy from 1960 to 1968.

Established in 1867, it was incorporated in 2004 in an effort to enable local land use decision-making control by the community. It was disincorporated July 18, 2016 under a special Oregon Legislature-directed election process where a majority of those voting voted for the dissolution of the city on May 17, 2016. This vote was found to be against statute and was overturned by the Oregon Appellate Court on May 1, 2019. Damascus is located east of Happy Valley and Interstate 205 and west of Boring. The area that later became the city had a population of 9,022 in 2000. The population was 10,539 residents as of the 2010 census. History According to Oregon Geographic Names, Damascus can date its existence as a community back to 1867, when a post office by that name was established. That post office was closed in 1904. The original heart of the community is along Oregon Route 212, which as of 2004 served as part of the city's southern boundary. A 2000 decision by Metro to expand Portland's urban growth boundary into the area prompted some citizens of the community to submit Measure 3-138, a measure on the ballot for the 2004 general election in November. The initiative's passage resulted in the incorporation of the former unincorporated communities of Damascus and Carver into the City of Damascus, a step which prevents nearby cities from annexing the community. The city was the first new city in Oregon in 22 years. In a special election on September 21, 2005, a city charter was approved by 88% of its voters.September 2005 special election results from the county's official website Voters in eleven parcels of land between Damascus and Happy Valley were given the chance to vote on annexation to Damascus: six of the areas voted for annexation, four voted against, and in the eleventh no votes were cast. During a primary election in 2016 voters chose to disincorporate, shutting the City down and transferring assets to Clackamas County. The disincorporation vote was later nullified by a 2019 Appeal Court decision on May 1. The court held that the voter turnout did not reach the State's fifty percent threshold and therefore should have been invalidated back in 2016.https://pamplinmedia.com/go/42-news/427241-334233-court-ruling-confuses- status-of-damascus On September 3, 2020 the Oregon Supreme Court upheld State legislation that ratified the 2016 disincorporation vote. As a result, the City of Damascus was deemed disincorporated in July, 2016 and no longer exists as a municipal corporation. Geography Damascus sits above sea-level. Located in north-central part of Clackamas County, the former city's northern boundary was the Multnomah County line. Boring lies to the east, and Clackamas to the west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , of which, was land and was water. Demographics =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 10,539 people, 3,621 households, and 2,984 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,769 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 91.3% White, 0.6% African American, 0.6% Native American, 3.4% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 1.2% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.4% of the population. There were 3,621 households, of which 36.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.5% were married couples living together, 6.2% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.8% had a male householder with no wife present, and 17.6% were non-families. 12.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.90 and the average family size was 3.16. The median age in the city was 43.2 years. 25% of residents were under the age of 18; 6.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 20.6% were from 25 to 44; 34.2% were from 45 to 64; and 13.3% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 50.8% male and 49.2% female. Government Fire protection in the Damascus is provided by Clackamas County Fire District #1 (CCFD1). One fire station, Fire Station 19 - Damascus, is located in the community, with emergency response also from nearby CCFD1 Station 7 - Pleasant Valley and CCFD1 Fire Station 14 - Boring. Damascus is served by the North Clackamas, Oregon Trail, Estacada, Centennial, and Gresham-Barlow school districts. The latter is the second-largest employer in the community.http://www.yourroadmaptohome.com/neighborhoods_damascus_oregon.htm Controversy As a city, Damascus went through seven city managers in eight years, and generally had a contentious existence as a municipality. This included a vote to disincorporate the city and to recall the mayor in 2013. In the May 17, 2016 primary, the citizens of Damascus voted a second time on a proposal to disincorporate. This time, the proposal was approved, and the city ostensibly ceased to exist on July 18, 2016. However, the disincorporation was nullified by the Oregon Appellate Court on May 1, 2019. On September 3, 2020, the Oregon Supreme Court reinstated the disincorporation vote of May, 2016 and the city no longer exists. What was once the City of Damascus is now unincorporated territory in Clackamas County.

It is situated in the northern dock system in Kirkdale. Canada Dock consists of a main basin nearest the river wall with three branch docks and a graving dock to the east. It is connected to Brocklebank Dock to the north and Huskisson Dock to the south. History The dock was the last and biggest designed by Jesse Hartley, opening in 1859. In 1862, the Canada half-tide basin, which became Brocklebank Dock, was added by George Fosbery Lyster. Canada Dock dealt in timber being named after the main source of the trade, Canada. Fire was the greatest concern and the dock was initially kept isolated from the rest of the dock system for safety reasons. However, a fire did occur in 1893 causing ¬£50,000 of damage. The original river entrance also presented navigational difficulties, with the area affected by silting. Modifications to the basin took place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, creating the branch docks and graving dock. The removal of the problematic tidal basin only took place after World War II, following a complete rebuild. Further improvements took place during the 1950s and 1960s as the dock became a base for cargo liner companies such as Harrison Line. The dock was used as a ro-ro berth during the early 1990s. =Railway connections= The dock was connected to the national rail network by the Canada Dock Branch Line. The short branch line from Atlantic Junction, just west of Kirkdale railway station, into the dock was closed on 12 September 1982. The terminus was Canada Dock railway station. Although the branch line closed to passengers in 1941, it remained in use for goods. The Route Utilisation Strategy states that there should be no building on the short path of the old track in case it requires reinstating. From 1893, passenger services were also provided by the Liverpool Overhead Railway via Canada Dock (LOR) station until 1956. Present Canada Dock remains in use, handling general bulk cargoes and as a site for scrap metal processing and storage.

His scientific contributions include introducing his system of racial classification and founding the field of computational linguistics. Czekanowski is known for having played an important role in saving the Polish- Lithuanian branch of the Karaite people from Holocaust extermination. In 1942, he managed to convince German \\"race scientists\\" that the Karaites were of Turkic origin although professing Judaism and using Hebrew as a liturgical language. This helped the Karaites escape the tragic destiny of other European Jews and the Romas. Life Czekanowski attended school in Warsaw but was transferred to Latvia, where he finished his education in 1901. He then entered a university in Zurich in 1902; there, he studied anthropology, mathematics, anatomy, and ethnography as a pupil of Swiss anthropologist Rudolph Martin, author of the popular anthropology textbook Lehrbuch der Anthropologie. In 1907 Czekanowski defended his doctoral dissertation. For his dissertation research he traveled to the Royal Museum in Berlin and to Middle Africa from 1906 to 1907. While in Africa, he led a team into the Congo to collect ethnographic materials. While working on studying the societies of Africa, he developed various statistical methods and contributed to the field of taxonomy. The research he made in Africa has since been published in five volumes and sent in 1910, to Saint Petersburg ethnography. He then became a professor at the University of Lviv and University of Pozna≈Ñ. While working he introduced an innovative approach to mathematical statistics. He worked in these universities from 1913 to 1945 and in the period 1923-1924 he was a president of Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists. In addition, he worked at the University of Pozna≈Ñ from 1937-1946, where he researched the dynamics of evolution in human populations. He played numerous scientific roles at the University of Pozna≈Ñ, including vice-chairman of the Polish Social Statistic Company. Racial classification Czekanowski classified Europe into four pure races. The four pure races were the Nordic, Mediterranean (Ibero- Insular), Lapponoid and Armenoid. The Lapponoid included the central and eastern Europeans along Europe longitudely as well as the Sami people of Northern Europe. Czekanowski classified six subraces in Europe which were mixed types of the pure races. The six mixed racial subraces were: the Northwestern (Nordic and Mediterranean), the Subnordic (Nordic and Lapponoid), Alpine (Nordic and Armenoid), the Littoral (Mediterranean and Armenoid), Sublapponoid (Mediterranean and Lapponoid) and the Dinaric (Lapponoid and Armenoid). The Sublapponoid subrace (also called Pile Dwelling race) lived around the Swiss lakes.Coon, Carleton S. The Races of Europe. Racial Classification within the White Family. August 11, 2006. <.> The Greek letters which symbolise races and types could be capital or lower case. Linguistics Czekanowski introduced numerical taxonomy into comparative linguistics, thus founding the discipline of computational linguistics. He developed (1913) a still much-used index of similarity between two samples. He applied it to phonemes and words in text corpora of different languages. It was later introduced in analysis of ecological communities. Books * Forschungen im Nil-Kongo.

As distinct from the Western medical definition of kidneys, the TCM concept is more a way of describing a set of interrelated parts than an anatomical organ. In TCM the kidneys are associated with \\"the gate of Vitality\\" or \\"Ming Men\\". A famous Chinese doctor named Zhang Jie Bin (approximately 1563-1640) wrote \\"there are two kidneys, (kidney yin and yang), with the Gate of Vitality between them. The kidney is the organ of water and fire, the abode of yin and yang, the sea of essence, and it determines life and death.\\" TCM overview The kidney (Shen) is a Zang organ meaning it is a Yin organ. The other Yin, or Zang, organs are the lungs (Fei), liver (Gan), spleen (Pi), and heart (Xin). Sometimes the pericardium (Xin Bao) is included. Yin organs store, secrete, make, and transform essence, blood, spirit, Qi, and fluids. Kidney main functions The main functions of the kidney are: *storing essence (jing) and dominating human reproduction and development *dominating water metabolism and the reception of qi from the air (Kong Qi) *producing marrow to fill up the brain *dominating bone *manufacturing blood *manifesting in the hair (on the head) *opening into the ear and dominating the two lower yin (the anus and urethra) *dominating anterior and posterior orifices. *housing the Zhi (will-power) *fluid secretions are urine, semen, and vaginal fluids.Cheng, et al. 1987, p. 32-33 & Dong, 2006, p. 34 =Storing essence and dominating development and reproduction= The kidney's primary function is storing and controlling 'essence', or jing. Jing is the essence of qi and the basis for body matter and functional activities. There are two types of jing, congenital jing and acquired jing, which are stored in the kidney and known as kidney jing. Unlike qi, jing circulates in long cycles (seven years for females and eight years for males) governing developmental stages. The function of jing is to promote growth, development and reproduction, provide the basis for kidney qi, produce marrow, and provide the basis for jing, qi and shen (mind).Cheng, et al. 1987, p. 32; Maciocia, 2005, p. 46 & Yin, & Shuai, 1992, p. 34 Congenital jing comes from the parents and determines basic constitution; it cannot be altered, but it can be positively influenced by acquired jing. Acquired jing is produced from food by the spleen and stomach, stored in the kidney and circulated in the body. Congenital and acquired jing have a promoting/ controlling relationship with each other and their interaction produces kidney jing; all three play a part in determining growth and development, sexual maturation, reproduction, and aging.Cheng, et al. 1987, p. 32 & Maciocia, 2005, p. 46 Every new jing cycle prompts a new cycle of development. For example, congenital jing exists from conception, carrying on from the jing of the parents. Once a child is born, acquired jing is responsible for replenishing congenital jing and starting the first independent jing cycle which, for the next seven years in girls and eight years in boys, will control growth and development. When the child loses its baby teeth, its body begins the pre-adolescence cycle. The next jing cycle is adolescence, when kidney jing matures and causes the ren meridian to open and flow. At this time, part of the kidney jing transforms into tian gui, which develops and maintains reproductive function. In the next stage physical growth finishes, and eventually declining jing leads to exhaustion of tian gui, thus extinguishing reproductive ability. Inevitably, decline of jing leads to death.Cheng, et al. 1987, p. 32; Maciocia, 2005, p. 45-46 and Zhiya, Yanchi, Ruifu & Dong, 1995, p. 193-194) =Energy aspects= All of the four kidney energy aspects are essential in growth and development. These four aspects include kidney jing (essence), kidney yin (water), kidney yang (fire) and kidney qi. All of the body's functions rely on the heat provided by kidney qi and the gate of life (the space between the left and right kidneys).Maciocia, (2005), p. 49 Kidney jing is the foundation of the yin and yang of all the body's organs. Kidney yin and yang are the primordial yin and yang, and the root of yin and yang to the zang organs. Kidney yin moistens and nourishes, while kidney yang provides warmth and promotes organs and tissue.Yin, & Shuai, 1992, p. 34-35 kidney yang is the dynamic force necessary to start the system of balancing water metabolism, which also employs the spleen, lung, liver and san jiao.Zhiya, et al., 1995, p. 194 =Dominating water metabolism= The kidney is considered a water element. As the body's water gate, it regulates water metabolism and reception of qi. The foundation of yin fluid that nourishes and moistens the body is kidney yin. When the kidney receives fluid the qi of kidney yang divides it into two types, clear and turbid. Clear fluid is sent upward through San Jiao to moisten the lung and for the lung to distribute to the body, while turbid fluid is sent downward for expulsion by the bladder. The water gate is also responsible for regulating the opening and closing of drainage ducts, namely the bladder and anus, which rely on the activity of kidney qi. Also, while lung qi controls respiration, kidney qi coordinates inhalation.Cheng, et al. 1987, p. 32, 34; Dong, 2006, p. 34 & Zhiya, et al., 1995, p. 194 =Additional functions= The kidney is responsible for hair luster, production of bone and brain matter, correct functioning of the ears, and regulating the opening and closing of the bladder and anus. Mentally, its responsible for supporting memory, while emotionally it is linked to determination, or willpower (zhi).Dong, 2006, p. 29-30 & Maciocia, 2005, p. 93) Notes Bibliography * Cheng, X.-n., Deng, L., & Cheng, Y.

(See Zang Fu theory) The Bladder is a Yang (Fu) organ; its paired Yin (Zang) organ is the Kidney. Both are associated with the element of water and the emotion of fear. As opposed to western medicine, where the bladders function is the storage and excretion of urine, the bladder in traditional Chinese medicine has extended functions, including how fluids are transformed during urine production. Fluids are still sent from the small intestine to the bladder for storage, but the bladder's capabilities are dependent on the kidney yang. If the kidney is yang deficient, the bladder may not have the sufficient qi and heat to transform fluids properly into urine. This could result in overly clear urine that must be excreted more frequently.

The practice is a hobby officially supported and promoted by Disney. Cost Many thousands of unique pins have been created over the years. Pins are available for a limited time; the base price for a pin is US$9.99. Limited edition pins, and special pins (e.g. pins that have a dangle, pin-on-pin, flocking, lenticular, light-up, moving element, 3-D element, etc.) cost up to $17.99. Featured Artist and Jumbo Pins cost between $20 and $35 and Super Jumbo pins cost upwards of, and sometimes beyond, $125. Pins are frequently released at special events, movie premiers, pin trading events or to commemorate the opening day of a new attraction. Some pins have appreciated well on the secondary market and have reached prices of over US$2000 at venues such as eBay, though Disney fans debate the ethics of people who buy pins from the parks in bulk and then inflate the price to sell later on platforms like eBay . Most Disney pins are enamel or enamel cloisonn√© with a metal base. The backs of each pin are very sharp and should be used with care by young collectors. Pin trading history Pins have always been present at Disney parks, but it wasn't until 1999 as part of the Millennium Celebration that Disney Pin Trading at the Walt Disney World Resort was introduced. This was following an Odyssey of the Mind function at the resort in which pins were being traded, inspiring the pin trading idea. The next year, the craze spread to the Disneyland Resort, which has become the home of most Pin Trading events but is most popular in Disney World. Since then, Pin Trading has spread to Aulani, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disney Cruise Lines with each location creating their own pins and traditions. Although the trading of pins has been suspended in Tokyo Disney Resort due to pin traders and their pin display mats taking over the park , pins are still offered as prizes at carnival games, and a relatively small number of pins are available. Current pin trading In all Disney resorts, a large variety of pins are available for purchase and trade. Most merchandise cast members wear pins on lanyards around their necks, or on a pin display card or hip lanyard ‚Äì a piece of colored nylon fabric ‚Äì clipped to their belt. Additional cast members may wear lanyards if pin trading does not distract from their responsibilities; some managers choose to wear lanyards, but ride operators are not permitted. Some cast members wear a teal colored lanyard at Disneyland and a green lanyard at Walt Disney World with pins tradable to children and adults of all ages. Each lanyard contains around a dozen unique pins, and cast members must trade with guests if they are presented with an acceptable pin. The cast members may not decline a particular trade based on preference or rarity of the pin but may decline if the pin is not acceptable or pin trading rules are not being observed. Cast members may have differently colored lanyards that determine what age group can trade for those pins. For example, a green lanyard worn by a cast member means that children twelve years of age and younger only can trade for pins on the lanyard in Walt Disney World Florida. Other than this restriction, people of all ages can enjoy this activity . Each guest may only trade two pins with the same cast member in one day. If the cast member gives his or her lanyard to a different cast member, a guest may trade again with the new cast member even though the physical lanyard is the same. The specifics of what make a pin acceptable for trading varies from park to park. At Disneyland and California Adventure parks, the cast members are instructed not to accept pins that have a clasp or brooch- type backing (as with jewelry). This limitation is new as of 2008, and notable because it bars cast members from accepting pins that Disney specifically designed and made in the 1980s. The new rule about the pin backing type is printed on brochures and certain informational boards. In Disneyland Paris, the cast members are instructed not to accept pins with any of the following origins: Euro Disney, Kodak, Arthus-Bertrand, Disney Store, Spain (also called sedesma pins), or Germany (also called ProPins). This is a partial list of the Disneyland Paris cast member instructions; the full instructions are in French and worn on the cast members' trading lanyards. Pin collectors can customize displaying their pins because of the wide variety of pin products Disney produces. Lanyards are available in a wide variety of colors and designs as are lanyard medals. There are many ways to store and display a collector's pins: pin bags, notebooks, frames and cork boards. Collectors can be very creative in displaying their pins and are often easy to spot in the parks with their pin-covered vests, hats, lanyards and fanny packs. Pin etiquette Disney has published a pamphlet on how to trade pins, and tips on Pin Etiquette. Among these tips include: * To trade a pin with a Disney cast member, the pin must be made of metal and have a representation of a Disney character, park, attraction, icon, or other official affiliation. Additionally, the pin must have a Disney copyright on its back. * Guests must trade with Cast Members, one pin at a time, with the pin back in place (pins have functional sharp posts). * Guests can make up to two pin trades per cast member per day. * Refrain from touching another person's pins or lanyard, ask to see the pin so they can bring the pin into closer view. * The pin that is traded to the cast member cannot be a duplicate of any pin they already have on their lanyard. * No money can change hands on Disney property in exchange for a pin. Note that this pin etiquette pamphlet is only a partial list of restrictions, and restrictions as indicated in the above section \\"Current Pin Trading\\" also exist. Official Disney pin release locations Disney pin trading kiosk at Walt Disney World's Animal Kingdom There are many official locations where a guest can find Disney pins for purchase. * Disneyland Resort Anaheim (DLR) ** Disneyland ** Disney's California Adventure ** Downtown Disney Traders * Walt Disney World (WDW) ** Magic Kingdom ** Epcot ** Disney's Hollywood Studios ** Disney's Animal Kingdom ** Disney Springs * Disneyland Paris (DLP) ** Disneyland Park ** Walt Disney Studios Park ** Disney Village ** Hotels * Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (HKDLR) ** Hong Kong Disneyland * Tokyo Disney Resort * Disney Cruise Lines * Walt Disney Studios, Burbank * Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) * Disney Studio Store Hollywood (next to the El Capitan Theatre) Since 2008, trading pins are no longer sold in stores outside of those located at the theme parks, and are only available through ordering them at the online Disney Store. Disney Shopping has offered limited edition pins on their website since Disney Auctions was closed. Recently, some Disney stores have added open edition pins themed for their location. (Examples include Honolulu, Hawaii and San Francisco, California stores.) Note: Pin trading is not available in Tokyo Disney Resort. Visitors can only purchase pins in the resort and win them from games. Pin terms =General= *Artist Proof ‚Äì Artist Proof pins (or AP pins) are created during a manufacturing run to verify quality. AP pins have an AP stamped on their back. Generally 20‚Äì24 AP pins are made of each pin per run. Some collectors may value AP pins more than others. *Back Stamp ‚Äì A pin's back stamp contains information about the pin and can include copyright information and edition size. *Chaser ‚Äì A pin in a series that is rarer or more difficult to acquire. They can often be colour variants of a known pin. *Cloisonn√© ‚Äì A French word meaning \\"partitioned.\\" It refers to a style of pin in which the surface decoration is set in designated sections, one color at a time. Cloisonn√© also refers to a pin type in which crushed minerals and pigments are used to create coloring on a pin. *Dangle Pins ‚Äì Dangle pins have an extension to the base of the pin that dangles (hangs) from one or more small loops or chains. *Die Cast ‚Äì Die Cast pins are cast from brass zinc alloy using high-quality hand engraved dies which create an eye-catching, three-dimensional image. *Epoxy Coating ‚Äì Epoxy coating is a glassy, opaque substance used as a decorative or protective coating. When the coating dries, it forms a smooth, glossy surface. *Flocking ‚Äì A flocked pin has an area that is fuzzy. *Hard Enamel ‚Äì Hard Enamel is sometimes called the new cloisonn√©. It not only retains the characteristics of classic cloisonn√©, but also provides a much wider selection of colors. Just as with cloisonn√©, each pin is hand-crafted in a process that begins with a flat piece of brass which is die-struck and then filled with enamel colors. The surface is then hand polished to give it a smooth finish. *Lenticular ‚Äì A Lenticular pin has two or more images that can change when it is tilted back and forth. *Light-Up Pin ‚Äì A Light-up pin has lights in its design that flash when activated. The Light-up element has been used less in recent years due to difficulties in battery replacement and metal corrosion. *Pre Production/Prototype Pin ‚Äì Pre Production/Prototype pins (or PP Pins) are received by product developers prior to a pin being manufactured. These pins sometimes contain different coloring, fills or features than the final production pin. The number depends on what the final product will be, as these pins may be different in size, texture, color, etc. The developers use these \\"test\\" pins to determine what the final product will be. Pin from late 2007 - now will contain a PP stamp on the back. Pins prior to late 2007 may contain a Pro Products label signifying it is a pre production pin. Some pins may contain no identification that it is a pre-production pin at all. *Scrapper Pin ‚Äì A Scrapper pin is an unauthorized pin. Many of the molds Disney uses to make pins are not destroyed after the creation of its pin order, and bootlegs are created. This practice has flooded the Disney parks and secondary markets like eBay with cheap imitations, mostly of Cast lanyard pins and mystery release pins. Some are sold on eBay or found in the parks before the real pins are even released. *Slider Pin ‚Äì A Slider pin has a movable piece that slides back and forth across the base of a pin. *Spinner Pin ‚Äì A Spinner pin has a spinning mechanism that moves a piece of the pin 360 degrees. *Soft Enamel ‚Äì A soft enamel pin has the design stamped into the base metal. These pins are filled with enamel colors and baked for durability. A final clear epoxy dome is applied to protect the finish. Typically a thinner pin than cloisonn√© pins. =Exclusive to Disney pin trading= The following terms are specific, specialized terms relating to Disney pin trading: *Build-A-Pin ‚Äì The Build-A- Pin program was introduced in 2002 and retired in Summer 2004. Guests could personalize pins bases with character add-ons. After selecting their favorite base and add on, the pin was assembled with a special machine. *Continuing the Pin Trading Tradition Pin ‚Äì Also known as a CTT pin, these annual pins were created for guest recognition by cast members. Guests may be awarded a Continuing The Pin Trading Tradition pin for demonstrating positive Disney Pin Trading etiquette and promoting Disney Pin Trading. *Fantasy Pin ‚Äì A pin commissioned or produced by Disney pin collectors that contains similarities to Disney pins, but has not been created or endorsed by Disney. These pins are not allowed to be traded with cast members, although collectors may trade for these pins amongst themselves. From time to time, Disney will produce a pin that is very similar to a fantasy pin. *FREE-D ‚Äì Free-D stands for Fastened Rubber Element on a pin for Extra Dimension. Pins that feature Free-D elements sometimes have discoloring issues and extra precautions should be taken to make sure that the Free-D element is not dirtied. *GWP ‚Äì A GWP (Gift with Purchase) pin is a bonus pin given to guests who buy at least $25 of pin merchandise in one transaction. The Disneyland Resort designates the first Sunday of every month GWP Sunday, and has two collections each year of six pins each. The pins are often traded as lanyard fodder, and as a result they are not valuable initially. Walt Disney World has promotions where GWPs are available for $1 each with a $30 purchase. Their current promotion involves surplus Mystery Machine Pins. *HHG ‚Äì HHG, or the Hitchhiking Ghosts, are the most famous residents of the Haunted Mansion. *HM ‚Äì HM denotes either a Haunted Mansion or Hidden Mickey pin depending on the context. *Jumbo Pins ‚Äì Jumbo Pins are larger and often more intricately designed than a regular size pin; as such, the pins cost between US$20 and US$35. Featured Artist (Jumbo) Pins are currently released at DLR, while WDW released a monthly Jumbo Monorail Collection for 2008. Traditionally, Jumbo Pins were released monthly with an edition size of 750 and available for $25. Recently, Jumbo Pins have been sold in editions of 1000 for US$20 or, at the Disneyland Resort, in editions of 500 for US$35. *Limited Edition Pins ‚Äì Limited Edition pins are just that - limited. This means there will be a finite number of pins manufactured and sold. The \\"back stamp\\" (the text on the back of a pin) on the pin will list the edition size. Sometimes, a Limited Edition pin will be individually numbered meaning it will be #XXX of XXXX (depending upon edition size). *Mickey's Mystery Pin Machine ‚Äì Debuting at Mouse Gear in Epcot at WDW in late 2007, the machines were a modified Gravity Hill arcade machine that dispensed a pin regardless of outcome. The pins were part of small collections consisting of five pins each. Although the pins originally cost $5 and were distributed randomly, remaining pins were sold as GWP pins and the Machines have now been designated as inactive and removed. *Name Pins ‚Äì Name Pins are pins that have a name engraved on them, and may not be traded with cast members. *Piece of History (POH) ‚Äì A Piece of History pin from the 2005 set is considered to be one of the rarest series in Disney Pin Trading. Each pin contains a minuscule piece of a prop from a WDW attraction. The first pin in the series, the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea pin with a sliver of a porthole, has sold for over $275 on eBay. The success of the series has led to a 2006 and 2008 set and a 2009 and 2010 set for Disneyland Resort. *Pin Traders Delight (PTD) - The Pin Trader Delight is an ice cream sundae that comes with a limited edition pin as a gift with purchase. This sundae is only available at the Ghirardelli Studio Store located in Hollywood, California. Each pin depicts the featured character eating an ice cream sundae and is highly sought after as typically they have an edition size between 300 and 750. Sundaes are limited to 2 per person provided that the gift pins for each sundae are not the same. *Pin Trading Night (PTN) ‚Äì Pin Trading Nights are monthly meetings of Disney Pin Traders at DLR, WDW, or Disneyland Paris resorts. The Pin Trading Team provides pin games and gives traders the opportunity to trade and socialize. Often, an LE pin is released to commemorate the occasion. *Pin With Purchase/Purchase With Purchase (PWP) - Similar to GWP. except that the pin is not a \\"gift\\" but must be purchased. Typically for pins the pin price is $3.95 and a $30 purchase is required to qualify. At one time Cast Members occasionally allowed guests to combine multiple receipts (including those from Disney-owned restaurants at the resort) to reach the $30 requirement but as of 2016 this is no longer permitted; the pin must be purchased at the same time as the qualifying transaction. *Rack Pins ‚Äì Rack pins, also called Open Edition (OE) or core pins, are pins introduced and sold until they are discontinued or retired. These pins are re-ordered for up to several consecutive years. The starting retail price for these pins is typically $6.95 (for a flat pin). Depending upon the number of features on the pin (such as pin-on-pin), the retail price will increase to either $8.95 or $10.95. Some OE pins have a high secondary value, such as the Soda Pop Series pins which each go in the $20 range. *Retired Pins - Retired (or discontinued) pins are pins that are no longer in production. Disney periodically \\"retires\\" pins so they can introduce new pins. *RSP -The Random Selection Process is the method by which LE pins are distributed at the Pin Events. Each guest submits a form which has slots for the Limited Edition merchandise items offered. Each slot is filled in order based on pin availability. If 1000 forms were to be submitted and 50 forms had an LE 25 framed set in their first slot, the first 25 forms would be given the purchase, with the remaining 25 given the opportunity to purchase their second-slot pin. Typically, there are three rounds of the RSP process with the smaller editions being unavailable to purchase in a subsequent round. RSP forms only allow a style of pin to appear once on each RSP form so that there is a better, fairer chance of each person getting one pin. *Scrapper - An unauthorized Disney pin. These pins are literally scrap pins. Sometimes they are seconds from the factory runs, or sometimes they have errors in color, design, or the imprint on the back. Scrappers can also be the result of extra unauthorized production runs. These pins often make it onto the secondary market where they are sold, often in lots, at much lower than market price. Scrapper pins can then be traded with cast members, as cast members do not decline a trade based on suspected scrapper status. Recent Hidden Mickey pins, DLR pins especially, have flooded the market months before their initial introductions. *Surprise or Mystery Pins - These pins usually feature a low-Limited Edition size. Typically, the back stamp will include the words \\"Surprise Pin\\". The release of this pin happens randomly at various merchandise locations within the Disney Theme Parks and Resorts. Although Surprise pins have continued at the Disneyland Resort (as evidenced by their current Resort Sign set), WDW releases Surprise pins at PTNs rarely. Popular themes Because there are over 100,000 Disney Pins available, many themes and characters are collected: * Characters ** Mickey Mouse universe *** Mickey Mouse *** Minnie Mouse *** Donald Duck *** Daisy Duck *** Goofy *** Pluto *** Chip 'n Dale ** Pinocchio ** Jiminy Cricket ** Winnie the Pooh ** Lilo & Stitch characters *** Stitch *** Lilo Pelekai *** Angel (Experiment 624) ** Roger Rabbit ** Jessica Rabbit ** Figment (primarily at WDW) ** Tinker Bell * Films ** Aladdin ** Alice in Wonderland ** Cinderella ** Finding Nemo ** Beauty and the Beast ** Peter Pan ** Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ** Song of the South ** Tangled ** The Jungle Book ** The Little Mermaid ** The Princess and the Frog ** Toy Story * Attractions ** Space Mountain ** Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ** Splash Mountain ** Soarin' ** It's a Small World ** The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror ** Rock 'n' Roller Coaster starring Aerosmith ** The Haunted Mansion and the Hitchhiking Ghosts ** Pirates of the Caribbean ** Star Tours ‚Äì The Adventures Continue ** Disneyland or Walt Disney World Monorail * Series ** Cast lanyard (now known as Hidden Mickey series) ** Disney Auctions LE 100 (limited production run of only 100 pins) ** Piece of History Pins ** Soda Pop Series Cast lanyard and Hidden Mickey pins The WDW Cast Lanyard Collection was introduced in 1999 to encourage guests to trade pins with cast members. The first series of Lanyard pins consisted of just under 100 pins. Previews of the next year's Lanyard pins are at each September Event, with the pins officially distributed a few weeks later. \\"Disney's Cast Lanyard Collection\\" is on the back stamp of each pin in the first two series. Beginning with the third series, pin designers placed Hidden Mickeys on the pins after guests complained that it was difficult to discern Lanyard pins from the other pins on lanyards. In 2007, with the release of the fifth Lanyard series, the name of the series was officially changed to the Hidden Mickey Collection and a collection of 94 of the most popular earlier designs were reissued. When asked about the change the Pin Team responded, > \\"The name change is based on the current identifier found on Hidden Mickey > pins, a small Mickey Mouse icon. Those icons of Mickey Mouse, commonly > referred to as a Hidden Mickey, are also incorporated into many attractions > and locations at Disney Theme Parks and Resorts. We felt this change would > complement something fun many guests were already seeking.\\" In 2007, the second WDW Hidden Mickey set was released as a collection of 75 new designs, followed by the third Hidden Mickey set in late 2008. Disneyland Resort has had their own Lanyard Pin Series since 2002. DLR Lanyard Pin Collections have fewer styles than the WDW series, with most DLR series consisting of around 50 pins. Additionally, sets of 12 Hotel Lanyard Pins have been released biannually to DLR hotel guests who receive two pins at their time of check-in to trade. For the 2007 and 2008 Hidden Mickey Collections, pins have been released monthly by series. Scrappers of past DLR Hidden Mickey pins have appeared on the secondary market months before their official release dates. In an effort to combat this practice, designs for the 2008 and 2009 series, although previously shown at DLR Pin Trading Nights, have been released monthly. Pin events Pins have been available as merchandise at WDW and DLR hard ticket events since the late 1990s. After the Millennium Celebration, annual Pin Events were established to provide event-exclusive pins and opportunities for traders to socialize. The largest and most notable event is the September Event, held at Epcot annually. The 2008's event was Disney's Pin Celebration 2008 - Pin Trading University, which was held from September 5‚Äì7, 2008. Occasionally, special events are planned at the Walt Disney World Resort beyond the September Event. Expedition Pins allowed Pin Traders to take over Disney's Animal Kingdom after hours. Disneyland Resort offers pin events as well, although not as frequently. Their \\"Camp Pin-e-ha- ha\\" event was well received, and the Disney Day Campin' Event on June 21 was part of their annual summer-long Pin Festival. 2008 saw Mickey's Pin Odyssey and in 2009 Disneyland hosted the Haunted Mansion O'Pin House. Both events featured weekly releases of themed pins. Next up was the Disney Summer Pin Festival 2010 - Dateline: Disneyland. Disneyland Resort Paris also stages semiannual events including the DroPIN event to celebrate the opening of their Tower of Terror. All of the events feature pin games, exclusive pins and children's activities, and most have pin gifts to remember the event by. Each Resort also offers a monthly Pin Trading Nights with pin boards, games, and kid's areas. Hong Kong Disneyland introduced its first Pin Trading Fun Day in 2007. The park continues to organize the pin event once a year during a weekend in the Easter holiday period. The event features activities such as \\"Magical Moment\\", \\"Surprise Moment\\" and other games. Also, a special limited edition pin box set will be released as well during the event. Unofficial pin events take place regularly both inside and outside of the parks.

It is a functionally-defined entity and not equivalent to the anatomical organ of the same name. In the context of the zang-fu organs The Lung is a zang organ meaning it is a yin organ. Situated in the thorax, it communicates with the throat and opens into the nose. It occupies the uppermost position among the zang-fu organs, and is known as the \\"canopy\\" of the zang-fu organs. Its meridian connects with the large intestine, with which it is internally-externally related. The Lung and its paired organ are associated with the element of metal and the emotion of grief. The peak time for the Lungs is from 3‚Äì5 am.Cheng (1987) p. 36 Lung functions The Lung has five principle functions: *governing qi and controlling respiration. They take in clear and expel turbid Natural Air Qi (Kong Qi) *controlling disseminating and descending *regulating the water passages *controlling the skin and body hair *opening into the nose *housing the Po =Dominating qi and controlling respiration= Dominating qi has two aspects: dominating the qi of respiration and dominating the qi of the entire body. Dominating the qi of respiration means the lung is a respiratory organ through which the qi of the exterior and the qi from the interior are able to mingle. Via the lung, the body inhales clear qi from the natural environment and exhales waste qi from the interior of the body. Dominating qi of the entire body means that the function of the lung in respiration greatly influences the functional activities of the body, and is closely related to the formation of pectoral qi, which is formed from the combination of the essential qi of water and food, and the clear qi inhaled by the lung. When the lung's function of dominating qi is normal, the passage of qi will be unobstructed and respiration will be normal and smooth. Deficiency of lung qi may lead to general fatigue, feeble speech, weak respiration, shortness of breath and excessive perspiration. Lu, Henry (1994) p. 18 =Dominating descending and regulating the water passages= As a general rule, the upper zang-fu organs have the function of descending, and the lower zang-fu organs the function of ascending. Since the lung is the uppermost zang organ, its qi descends to promote the circulation of qi and body fluid through the body and to conduct them downwards. Dysfunction of the lung in descending may lead to upward perversion of lung qi with symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. Regulating the water passages means to regulate the pathways for the circulation and excretion of water. Circulation of body fluids is a function of many organs working together as a team, including the lungs. The role of the lung in promoting and maintaining water metabolism depends on the descending function of lung qi. Under normal circumstances, the lungs are capable of sending fluids downwards to the kidneys, which pass the fluids to the bladder for excretion. Dysfunction may result in dysuria, oliguria, and oedema.Cheng, X (1987) p. 43 Notes Bibliography *Cheng, X.-n., Deng, L., & Cheng, Y. (Eds.). (1987). Chinese Acupuncture And Moxibustion.

As distinct from the Western medical concept of large intestine, this concept from TCM is more a way of describing a set of interrelated parts than an anatomical organ. It is a functionally defined entity and not equivalent to the anatomical organ of the same name. Functions The large intestine meridian communicates with the lung (), with which it is externally-internally related. The two paired organs are associated with the metal element () and the emotion of grief. The main function of the large intestine is to receive the waste material sent down from the small intestine, absorb its fluid content, and form the remainder into faeces to be excreted. Pathological changes of the large intestine will lead to dysfunction in this transportation function, resulting in loose stools and constipation. The large intestine's function is said to be the strongest between 5am and 7am.Cheng (1987) p. 41 Large intestinal disease Large intestinal disease (d√† ch√°ng b√¨ng) is attributable to evils such as heat, cold, stagnation, dampness, and wind, or to vacuity.

The concept of political line - which goes back at least to the Communist Party of the 1930s - is somewhat similar to the 21st century concept of echo chamber.

Education and career Carswell was born in Irwinton, Wilkinson County, Georgia. He graduated from Duke University with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1941 and briefly attended the University of Georgia School of Law before joining the United States Navy at the beginning of World War II. Carswell did six months of postgraduate work at the United States Naval Academy and served in the Pacific aboard the heavy cruiser as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve; he was discharged in 1945 (when the war ended). Carswell graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University in 1948. Griffin B. Bell, 72nd Attorney General of the United States, was one of Carswell's classmates at Mercer. Carswell unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Georgia legislature in the fall of 1948. He then moved to Tallahassee, Florida, where he worked as a private attorney from 1948 to 1953. In 1953, he was appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida by President Dwight D. Eisenhower; Carswell served in this position until 1958. =Personal= Carswell married his wife Virginia (n√©e Simmons) in 1944. Federal judge Carswell was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 6, 1958, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida vacated by Judge Dozier A. DeVane. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 31, 1958, and received his commission on April 10, 1958. He served as Chief Judge from 1958 to 1969. His service terminated on June 27, 1969, due to his elevation to the Fifth Circuit. Carswell was nominated by President Richard Nixon on May 12, 1969, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 82 Stat. 184. He was confirmed by the Senate on June 19, 1969, and received his commission on June 20, 1969. His service terminated on April 20, 1970, due to his resignation. Supreme Court nomination On January 19, 1970, after Clement Haynsworth of South Carolina was rejected by the U.S. Senate for an appointment to the United States Supreme Court, President Nixon nominated Carswell to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to replace Justice Abe Fortas, an appointee of former U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events- of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title \\"Nixon's Nominations: 1970 Year in Review, UPI.com\\" Carswell was praised by Southern senators including Richard B. Russell, Jr., of Georgia, but he was also criticized by others for the high reversal rate (58 percent) of his decisions as a district court judge. Others questioned his civil rights record, citing his voiced support for racial segregation and white supremacy in a speech for the American Legion at Gordon, Georgia, during his unsuccessful Georgia legislative bid in 1948, during which he described the civil rights program as the \\"civil wrongs program\\": > I am a southerner by ancestry, birth, training, inclination, belief and > practice. I believe the segregation of the races is proper and the only > practical and correct way of life in our states. I have always so believed, > and I shall always so act. I shall be the last to submit to any attempt on > the part of anyone to break down and to weaken this firmly established > policy of our people. If my brother were to advocate such a program, I would > be compelled to take issue with and to oppose him to the limits of my > ability. I yield to no man as a fellow candidate, or as a fellow citizen, in > the firm, vigorous belief in the principles of white supremacy, and I shall > always be so governed. However, he would renounce these remarks.https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/22/archives/carswell- disavows-48-speech-backing-white-supremacy-judge-disavows.html Other criticism was raised over him being involved in turning a public golf course into a segregated private club in Tallahassee, Florida in 1956 and prolonging the duration of a school desegregation case from 1963 to 1967. Meanwhile, feminists accused him of being an opponent of women's rights. Various women, including U.S. Congresswoman Patsy Mink and Betty Friedan, testified before the Senate, opposed his nomination and contributed to his defeat. They described a case in which Judge Carswell refused a rehearing for a complainant who was the mother of preschool children. The NAACP, upon learning of Carswell's racist comments, opposed Carswell's nomination and asked that his appointment be rejected by the Senate. U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell, citing an extensive background check by the Justice Department, was willing to forgive, stating that it was unfair to criticize Carswell for \\"political remarks made 22 years ago\\". Senator George McGovern of South Dakota said of Carswell, \\"I find his record to be distinguished largely by two qualities: racism and mediocrity.\\" Responding to the charge that Carswell was mediocre, U.S. Senator Roman Hruska, a Nebraska Republican, stated: Hruska's remark was criticized by many as being antisemitic and further damaged Carswell's cause. On April 8, 1970, the United States Senate rejected Carswell's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. The vote was 45‚Äî51. Seventeen Democrats ‚Äì of whom only Alan Bible of Nevada represented a state outside the South ‚Äì and twenty- eight Republicans voted for Carswell. Thirteen Republicans, all but five from the Northeast, and thirty-eight Democrats voted against him. President Nixon accused Democrats of having an anti-Southern bias as a result saying, \\"After the Senate's action yesterday in rejecting Judge Carswell, I have reluctantly concluded that it is not possible to get confirmation for the judge on the Supreme Court of any man who believes in the strict construction of the Constitution as I do, if he happens to come from the South.\\" One week after Judge Carswell's nomination was rejected, Nixon then nominated Minnesota judge Harry Blackmun, subsequently the author of Roe v. Wade, to fill the Fortas vacancy. Blackmun was later confirmed in a 94‚Äî0 vote on May 12.Warren Weaver Jr., \\"Blackmun Approved, 94‚Äî0; Nixon Hails Vote by Senate\\", The New York Times, May 13, 1970, page 1. Alongside George Henry Williams and fellow Nixon nominee Herschel Friday, Carswell is one of three unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court to come from a state that has produced no successfully confirmed Justice. U.S. Senate campaign On April 20, 1970, Carswell resigned from his judicial position to run for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from Florida. His opponent was U.S. Representative William C. Cramer of St. Petersburg. Expecting to benefit politically in Florida from the rejection of Judge Carswell to the Supreme Court, aides of either Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr., or U.S. Senator Edward Gurney of Winter Park urged Carswell to resign from the bench to run for the Senate seat being vacated by the long-term Democrat Spessard Holland. Cramer claimed that Gurney had in a 1968 \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" agreed to support him for the seat. Gurney declined to discuss the \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" with Cramer but said that he and Cramer, who had been House colleagues, had \\"totally different opinions on this. That is ancient history, and I see no point in reviving things. ‚Ä¶ If I told my complete version of the matter, Cramer would not believe me, and I don't want Bill angry at me.\\"Billy Hathorn, \\"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970\\", Florida Historical Quarterly (April 1970), p. 411 Gurney claimed that he was unaware that Cramer had considered running for the Senate in 1968 and had deferred that year to Gurney, with the expectation that Cramer would seek the other Senate seat in 1970 with Gurney's backing.\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", p. 411 When Kirk and Gurney endorsed Carswell, Lieutenant Governor Ray C. Osborne, a Kirk appointee, abandoned his own primary challenge to Cramer. Years later, Kirk said that he \\"should have stuck with Osborne\\", later an attorney from Boca Raton, and not encouraged Carswell to run. Kirk also said that he had not \\"created\\" Carswell's candidacy, as the media had depicted.\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", p. 411 Carswell said that he ran for the Senate because he wanted to \\"confront the liberals who shot me down\\" but denied that Kirk took advantage of the failed confirmation to thwart Cramer. \\"... Neither then nor now did I feel used. ... What feud they had was their own.\\" Carswell said that he had no knowledge of a \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" between Gurney and Cramer and had considered running for the Senate even before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. Carswell instead blamed his loss on the \\"dark evil winds of liberalism\\" and the \\"northern press and its knee-jerking followers in the Senate\\".Miami Herald, September 4, 1970; U.S. News and World Report, September 7, 1970, pp. 34-35 Carswell reported that U.S. Representative Rogers Clark Ballard Morton of Maryland, who was also in 1970 the Republican national chairman, had told him that he believed Carswell was \\"clearly electable\\" and that Cramer should not risk the loss of a House seat that had been in Republican hands since 1955. Cramer, however, claimed that Morton had termed the intraparty machinations against Cramer the worst \\"double crosses\\" that Morton had ever witnessed in the party.\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", p. 412 President Nixon sat out the Carswell-Cramer primary even though in 1969 he had strongly urged Cramer to enter the race. Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Lee Warren said that Nixon had \\"no knowledge and no involvement\\" in Carswell's candidacy.The New York Times, April 21, 23, 29 and September 9, 1970 Gurney claimed that Harry S. Dent, Sr., a South Carolina political consultant with ties to Republican U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, had urged Carswell to run. Carswell further secured endorsements from actors John Wayne and Gene Autry and retained Richard Viguerie, the direct mail specialist from Falls Church, Virginia, to raise funds. Cramer defeated Carswell, 220,553 to 121,281. A third contender, businessman George Balmer, received the remaining 10,947 votes.State of Florida, U.S. Senate primary election returns, September 8, 1970 Thereafter, Cramer was defeated, 54%‚Äî46%, by the Democrat Lawton Chiles of Lakeland in a heavily Democratic year. Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who opposed Carswell's confirmation to the Supreme Court, said that Carswell \\"was asking for it, and he got what he deserved\\".Tallahassee Democrat, September 10, 1970 Later years In 1976, Carswell was convicted of battery for advances he made to an undercover police officer in a Tallahassee men's room.Joyce Murdoch, Deb Price, Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v. the Supreme Court (2002) p. 187. In September 1979, Carswell was attacked and beaten by a man whom he had invited to his Atlanta, Georgia, hotel room in similar circumstances. Because of these incidents, Keith Stern, author of Queers in History, alleges Carswell to have been the first homosexual or bisexual nominated to the Supreme Court.Keith Stern, Queers in History (2006), p. 84 (stating of Carswell, \\"He's the only known homosexual to have been nominated to the Supreme Court, though he was in the closet\\"); John Wesley Dean, The Rehnquist Choice: The Untold Story of the Nixon Appointment That Redefined the Supreme Court (2001) p. 20. Carswell subsequently returned to his private law practice before retiring. He died in 1992 of lung cancer; his wife, Virginia, died in 2009.

First broadcast in 1953, it is the world's longest-running news television programme. Panorama has been presented by many well known BBC presenters, including Richard Dimbleby, Robin Day, David Dimbleby and Jeremy Vine. , it still retains a peak time transmission slot on BBC One, but without a regular presenter. The programme also airs worldwide through BBC World News in many countries. History Panorama was launched on 11 November 1953 by the BBC; it emphasises investigative journalism. Daily Mail reporter Pat Murphy was the original presenter,BBC Radio 2, Steve Wright in the Afternoon 15 January 2006, Jeremy Vine interview who only lasted one episode after accidentally broadcasting a technical mishap. Max Robertson then took over for a year. The programme originally had a magazine format and included arts features. Richard Dimbleby took over in 1955 and presented the show until his death in 1965. His son, David Dimbleby, later presented the programme from 11 November 1974 ‚Äì the 21st anniversary of the show. Other past presenters include: Sir Robin Day, Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Sir Charles Wheeler and Jeremy Vine. On 13 December 2010, it was announced that the programme would be relaunched during the new year with no regular presenter. =International versions= Panorama set an example for the German magazine series of the same name,German Panorama which is produced by Norddeutscher Rundfunk, and broadcast by Das Erste. Panorama started there in 1961 and is one of the leading political magazine shows. =Theme music= The theme music is an adaptation of Francis Lai's \\"Aujourd'hui C'est Toi\\" (\\"Today It's You\\"), which has run since 1971. Prior to this, from 1968, Rachmaninov's Symphony No.1 in D Minor, 4th Movement, was used, and before that the theme was Robert Farnon's \\"Openings & Endings\\".

The resulting programme was never broadcast, though the footage and transcripts were later released. =Spaghetti tree= Panorama broadcast a famous hoax film about the harvesting of the spaghetti crop on April Fool's Day, 1957. =Salvador Dal√≠= Broadcast on 4 May 1955, Malcolm Muggeridge talked with Salvador Dal√≠, the Spanish surrealist artist. =Maggie's Militant Tendency= In January 1984, Panorama broadcast an episode which claimed that three Conservative MPs (Neil Hamilton, Harvey Proctor and Gerald Howarth) had links to far-right organisations both in Britain and on the Continent.Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 532. There was controversy over the editing of the programme: it juxtaposed shots of Howarth wearing a train driver's uniform at a steam railway enthusiasts' rally with the claim that he had attended a fascist meeting in Italy, falsely implying that the uniform he was wearing was a fascist one. Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 533. In response, Hamilton and Howarth sued the BBC. The Director- General, Alasdair Milne, told the governors that the BBC's defence was \\"fire- proof\\" but in late 1986 the acting chairman, Lord Barnett, realised that the programme would not withstand legal scrutiny. Hamilton and Howarth received around a million pounds in libel damages. Former Panorama producer Tom Bower, later stated that the programme had been \\"woefully misconceived\\" it had been \\"lunacy\\" to attempt to equate the trio \\"with the widespread Marxist infiltration of the Labour party\\". He cited the episode as the moment when Panorama \\"began to lose the plot\\". =Diana, Princess of Wales interview= Arguably the most famous Panorama programme of all was the 1995 interview of Diana, Princess of Wales by Martin Bashir, which occurred after her separation, when she openly discussed the rumours about her personal life. The programme's filming and planning was subject to extreme secrecy, with Richard James Ayre, the Controller of Editorial Policy, authorising a series of clandestine meetings between Bashir and Diana. =Omagh bombing= One of the most controversial broadcasts of recent time was the \\"Who bombed Omagh?\\" programme, which named those suspected of involvement in the Omagh bombing. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist unit SO13 said that the Real IRA attack on the BBC Television Centre could have been a revenge attack for the broadcast. =Scientology= In 1987, the Panorama programme Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom? for the first time exposed on broadcast television the secret upper-level doctrines of the Church of Scientology, and featured an animated retelling of the Xenu incident of Scientology doctrine. On 14 May 2007, an episode titled Scientology and Me was broadcast. The journalist John Sweeney presented the edition, showing how the Church reacted to his journalistic investigations, including its reaction when he stated to members that some people describe the organisation as a \\"cult\\". At one point during an interview, the presenter lost his temper with a member of the Church of Scientology; an edited portion of this incident was released subsequently by the Church on YouTube and DVD in an attempt to publicise it and raise controversy. However, the 2007 Scientology episode was Panorama's greatest audience since it moved to Monday evening. A follow-up programme, The Secrets of Scientology, was broadcast on 28 September 2010, presenting proof that the Church had harassed Sweeney during the making of the earlier documentary, with the specific intention of making him react in the way he eventually did, in addition to numerous interviews with former high-ranking members of the organisation who had been subject to harassment.John Sweeney revisits the Church of Scientology BBC News, 26 September 2010 =Panorama and Seroxat= Since 2002, Panorama has made four programmes about the anti- depressant Seroxat (paroxetine / Paxil): \\"The Secrets of Seroxat\\" (2002); \\"Seroxat: Emails from the Edge\\" (2003); \\"Taken on Trust\\" (2004) and \\"Secrets of the Drug Trials\\" (2007). \\"The Secrets of Seroxat\\" elicited a record response from the public as 65,000 people telephoned the BBC helpline and 1,300 people emailed Panorama directly. The major mental health charity Mind collaborated with Panorama in a survey of those who emailed the programme. Anonymous findings from the 239 responses were sent to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The second Panorama programme on Seroxat, \\"Emails from the Edge\\", included a report of the survey to which the 239 people responded. It showed widespread experiences of suicidal feelings and other severe reactions, very bad withdrawal symptoms and lack of warnings from doctors. After the broadcast users/survivors and Mind protested outside the offices of the MHRA. On 29 January 2007, the fourth documentary of the series about the drug Seroxat was broadcast. It focused on three GlaxoSmithKline paediatric clinical trials on depressed children and adolescents. Data from the trials show that Seroxat could not be proven to work for teenagers. Not only that, one clinical trial indicated that they were six times more likely to become suicidal after taking it. In the programme, Panorama revealed the secret trail of internal emails which show how GlaxoSmithKline manipulated the results of the trials for its own commercial gain. Access to the documents has been gained as GlaxoSmithKline fights a fraud trial in the US. Some of these previously secret Glaxo documents featured in the programme were leaked into the internet after the programme's broadcast. =Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets= On 19 September 2006 Panorama showed a documentary called \\"Undercover: Football's Dirty Secrets\\", which alleged payments in English football contrary to the rules of the Football Association, involving: * That Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce, and his agent son Craig were implicated for taking \\"bungs\\" (a bribe or kickback) from agents for signing certain players. Two agents, Teni Yerima and Peter Harrison, were secretly filmed, each claiming separately that they had paid Allardyce through his son. Allardyce denies ever taking, or asking for, a bung. The programme was aired on the same night that Bolton beat Walsall 3‚Äì1 in the Carling Cup, so Allardyce missed the original showing. * Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp is secretly filmed discussing the possibility of buying the Blackburn Rovers captain Andy Todd with agent Peter Harrison, which is against Football Association rules. * Then Portsmouth first-team coach Kevin Bond, who was first team coach of Newcastle United at the time of broadcast, is secretly recorded admitting he would consider discussing receiving payments from a proposed new agency involving agent Peter Harrison. Consequently, Bond was relieved of his duties at Newcastle. * Chelsea director of youth football Frank Arnesen is secretly filmed making an illegal approach or \\"tapping up\\" Middlesbrough's England youth star 15-year- old Nathan Porritt. Arnesen offers a fee of ¬£150,000 spread over three years as an incentive to relocate. Both of these allegations are against FA rules. * Agent Peter Harrison told the undercover reporter that, to secure transfer deals with Bolton, he bribed Sam Allardyce by offering to pay his son Craig. Harrison is a FIFA-listed agent who is based in the north-east of England. * That three different Bolton transfer signings involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce, some when he was contractually banned from doing any Bolton deals. Panorama alleged Bolton's transfer signings of defender Tal Ben Haim, midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata and goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce. Allardyce's son quit the agency business in summer 2006, and has admitted in newspaper interviews that his working as an agent might have cost his father the chance of becoming England manager. The Football Association has asked for any evidence as it tries to rid such action from football. =Sex Crimes and the Vatican= On 1 October 2006 Panorama broadcast an episode on Crimen Sollicitationis, a church \\"instruction\\" approved by Pope John XXIII in 1962, which establishes a procedure for dealing with child sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church. It was enforced for 20 years by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger before he became the Pope. It instructs bishops on how to deal with allegations of child abuse against priests. Critics claim the document has been used to evade prosecution for sex crimes. =Daylight Robbery= Panorama investigated claims that as much as $23 billion (¬£11.75 billion) may have been lost, stolen or not properly accounted for in Iraq. The United States Department of Justice has imposed gagging orders that prevent discussion of the allegations. US and other media have reported little on this issue.The BBC Uncovers Lost Iraq Billions ‚Äì Called ‚ÄòThe Largest War Profiteering in History‚Äô Disinformation, 11 June 2008 =Death in the Med= In a programme broadcast in 2010, Jane Corbin investigated what really happened on the ship MV Mavi Marmara, when Israeli commandos seized the ship as part of the blockade of Gaza. Abbas Al Lawati, a reporter for Gulf News, who was on the Mavi Marmara during the Gaza flotilla raid, criticised Panorama's reporting of the raid in the documentary, \\"Death in the Med\\", stating that it was either a result of \\"weak journalism\\" or \\"deep bias\\". Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire, who had also participated in the Free Gaza flotilla, has also accused the programme of a \\"lack of truth\\" and \\"bias\\" in a letter to the BBC, describing its effects on the families of those who died as a \\"grave injustice\\". \\"The BBC Trust has ruled that a Panorama documentary about the Israeli boarding of the Mavi Marmara was \\"accurate and impartial\\" overall...\\" = FIFA's Dirty Secrets = On 29 November 2010, three days before voting for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Panorama broadcast an investigation into bribes by senior FIFA officials. =Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed= On 31 May 2011 Panorama aired an investigation into physical and psychological abuse suffered by people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour at Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol. It showed a number of patients being repeatedly punched, kicked, slapped, pinned down and given cold punishment showers ‚Äì then left outside in near-zero degree temperatures. Local social services and the national regulator had received various warnings but the mistreatment continued. One senior nurse three times contacted the national regulator saying he wanted to talk about \\"abuse\\" ‚Äì but heard nothing back. The hospital was shut down. On 21 June 2011, 86 people and organisations wrote to the Prime Minister, David Cameron about the revelations, \\"We are aware of the various actions currently being taken within and outside government ‚Äì such as the DH review and CQC internal enquiry. We hope to make submissions to those both individually and collectively. However, on their own these will not be enough and a clear programme is needed to achieve change.\\" The prime minister responded saying he was \\"appalled\\" at the \\"catalogue of abuses\\" Panorama had revealed. In June 2011 the Association of Supported Living[30] issued a press statement, which was followed up in writing to every member of parliament in the United Kingdom, calling for community-based assisted living services to replace institutional services for people with learning disabilities. The national regulator, the CQC did a nationwide check on facilities owned by the same company ‚Äì as a result, three more institutions have been closed. The CQC also inspected 132 similar institutions and a Serious Case Review was commissioned ‚Äì some of the roughly ten local and national enquiries were carried out to examine what went wrong, including one by NHS Southwest which was one of the first to be published and list many of the others. The head of the Care Quality Commission resigned ahead of a critical government report, a report in which Winterbourne View was cited. Eleven people plead guilty to criminal offences of neglect or abuse as a result of evidence from Undercover Care and six of them were jailed. Immediately after the eleventh person pleaded guilty, the Serious Case Review was published, revealing hundreds of previous incidents at the hospital and missed warnings. Mencap published a report warning that similar abuse could be going on elsewhere and calling for the closure of all large institutions far from people's families. The film has also won a number of awards including the RTS Scoop of the year and a BAFTA. The Daily Telegraph said, \\"It is impossible to read the details of what went on at Winterbourne View, a care home for the severely disabled in Gloucestershire, without feeling repelled. In the wake of an expos√© from the BBC‚Äôs Panorama, 11 members of staff were convicted of almost 40 charges of neglect and ill-treatment of those in their care.\\" =Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate= Police in Warsaw on 12 June 2012 On 28 May 2012 Panorama examined the issues of racism, antisemitism and football hooliganism which it stated were prevalent among Polish and Ukrainian fans. The programme, titled \\"Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate\\", included recent footage of fans chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners. The documentary recorded antisemitism and monkey noise taunts of black players in Poland. In Ukraine, the documentary recorded Nazi salutes and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans violently assaulting a group of Asian students at the Metalist Oblast Sports Complex, one of the stadiums hosting matches in Ukraine. Panorama filmed former England defender Sol Campbell watching these clips, and then asked him whether he would recommend families go to the Championship. He responded: \\"Stay at home, watch it on TV. Don't even risk it‚Ä¶ because you could end up coming back in a coffin.\\" The report was then followed up by most of the British media, which published a large number of articles accusing Poles and Ukrainians of racism. The documentary was criticised as sensationalist, unbalanced and unethical. Jonathan Ornstein, Director of the Jewish Community Center in Krak√≥w, Poland, and who was interviewed for the film said: \\"I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience ‚Äì the British people ‚Äì by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism.\\" The BBC rejected Ornstein's criticism, however, saying: \\"The context of the programme was made clear to Mr Ornstein both before and during the interview which he kindly agreed to do with the programme makers. Panorama disagrees in the strongest terms that his interview was misrepresented.\\" The BBC reproduced the text of Ornstein's interview, including those parts which were not broadcast, and also pointed out that Ornstein \\"contacted the programme makers two days after it was broadcast in the UK on 28 May and immediately thereafter running on YouTube. He made none of the comments featured in his statement of Wednesday 6 June. We note that his statement was made following the programme's broadcast on Tuesday 5th June on Polish TV.\\" Another source used in the film, anti-racism campaigner Jacek Purski said: \\"The material prepared by the BBC is one-sided. It does not show the whole story of Polish preparations for the Euros. It does not show the Championship ran a lot of activities aimed at combating racism in the \\"Respect Diversity\\" campaign. For us the Euro is not only about matches. The event has become an opportunity to fight effectively against racism and promote multiculturalism. There is no country in Europe free from racism. These are the facts.\\" Black Polish MP John Godson said: \\"The documentary was biased, one-sided and rather sensational. I have received information that there were also interviews that were omitted by the BBC‚Äîfor example, interview with the Polish police.\\" A reporter from Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's most popular left- wing newspaper, questioned Panorama's practices and said: \\"I am becoming more and more surprised with what the BBC says. So far it has denied two situations I witnessed. I would not be surprised if the BBC prepared a statement saying that the Panorama crew has never been to Poland.\\" Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleh Voloshyn responded that the allegations were an \\"invented and mythical problem\\", and that \\"Nazi symbols can be seen at ... any match in England\\". Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated: \\"Nobody who comes to Poland will be in any danger because of his race. This is not our custom, as is not pointing out similar incidents in other countries.\\" The Guardian reported: \\"Other sources have come forward to say that an interview with a Jewish Israeli player was also cut from the programme because he failed to confirm Panorama's \\"anti-semitism\\" thesis. The BBC interviewed midfielder Aviram Baruchian, who plays for the Polish team Polonia Warsaw. One source who was present said the Panorama journalists had complained afterwards that the interview was \\"useless\\". Panorama strongly denies this. It says the interview was not used because Baruchian had only played in the Polish league since January. Panorama responded to the criticism, saying: \\"England Fans, the official England Supporters' Club, travelling to Euro 2012 called the programme unhelpful and some Poles in the UK have expressed concern that they have been labelled as racist. But amid all of these accusations against Panorama and the BBC, there is a real fear that the key issue has been missed ‚Äì the overt and frightening racist and anti-Semitic abuse and violence of the kind broadcast by Panorama is both wrong and deeply upsetting to those on its receiving end. That was the point of the programme. We set out to highlight a wrong. Were the beatings that the students from India sustained in Ukraine's Metalist stadium somehow \\"exaggerated\\"? Was the fact that they said the police were of \\"no use\\" as they walked off bruised and alone into the Ukrainian night somehow \\"made up\\"? Were the monkey chants hurled at the black players we filmed in Poland somehow \\"sensationalised\\"? British columnist Edward Lucas wrote: \\"Either the allegations against the BBC are a tissue of lies (and those who make them will be exposed), or the programme-makers have a lot of explaining to do. ...it rightly decried the use of \\"Jew\\" as an insult, but never mentioned that just the same ‚Äì deplorable ‚Äì language is used by rival fans against Ajax in the Netherlands or Tottenham Hotspur in Britain. It said ethnic minorities were \\"all but invisible\\" ‚Äì but did not mention that Poland has two black members of parliament (Britain elected its first only in 1987). Poland certainly has its problems ‚Äì but the highly questionable assumptions behind eastern ‚Äòbackwardness' and Western ‚Äòprogress' went blithely unexamined. It would be easy to scent a kind of 'orientalism' here: the belief that ‚Äòex- communist' is synonymous with 'poor', 'nasty' and 'ignorant'. The muddy wastelands of the east are great places to make shocking documentaries. Best of all, because nobody there knows English, you can say pretty much what you like and get away with it. Not any more.\\" Brendan O'Neill wrote in The Daily Telegraph that England fans had staged \\"a protest against BBC Panorama's hysterical depiction of Ukraine as a hotbed of racism and anti-Semitism, which they have discovered during their stay in that country to be untrue. ...it was the respectable Beeb, echoed by broadsheets, which painted an entire nation \\"over there\\" as backward and prejudiced, while it has fallen to everyday fans to poke holes in this xenophobic mythmaking and to point out that there is actually nothing scary about modern Ukraine and its inhabitants. England fans have proven themselves way more racially enlightened than the aloof suits in the current-affairs department of the BBC.\\" England football coach Roy Hodgson said the racism allegations were \\"the biggest negativity in England... As a result, I think we‚Äôve lost a lot of fans who didn‚Äôt come because of a lot of horror stories about how life would be in the Ukraine and Poland.\\" Hodgson added that he had nothing but positive impressions of Poland and Ukraine. According to the Dutch daily de Telegraaf, during an open training session in Krak√≥w, Dutch black players were allegedly subjected to monkey noises and jeers, an incident that the Holland captain Mark van Bommel described as a \\"real disgrace\\". UEFA acknowledged that there had been \\"isolated incidents of racist chanting\\". However, other Dutch media, including the prestigious daily de Volkskrant, have reported that the allegations of monkey chants were made up. According to the newspaper, the coach of the Dutch team has made several statements to the BBC that he had not heard the supposed chanting, nor did the rest of the team. According to de Volksrant, the story was sensationalised by de Telegraaf. Jessica Elgot wrote an article in The Jewish Chronicle headlined \\"I went all the way to 'racist' Kiev and all I got was love\\" reporting how \\"By-and-large, no one understood why we were going. Friends raised their eyebrows in horror, before inquiring if we had seen \\"that Panorama programme\\". My grandmother politely inquired why we wanted to go to \\"that shmatte place\\". As I left for the airport, I got a sweet good-bye text from my house-mate. \\"Have a lovely trip. Please don‚Äôt get Jew-bashed.\\" Irish football fans filled 14 pages of their blog with praise for Poland and Ukraine, many of them highly critical of the BBC and Panorama The Daily Mirror commented: \\"The biggest plus of Euro 2012 must be the scaremongering presented by BBC's Panorama of violence and terrible racism in Poland and Ukraine largely proved to be just that. If you do not believe me, then take the word of Gary Lineker who did not mind taking a swipe at his BBC bosses to point out how friendly and accommodating the locals have been. Ahead of Spain‚Äôs semi with Portugal, Lineker tweeted: 'Donetsk is a lovely town with friendly folk. Pre-tournament scaremongering way off the mark.'\\" Tim Black, senior writer at Spiked, speculated that \\"What seemed to drive ‚ÄòStadiums of Hate‚Äô was not an intention to deceive, exactly. It was something else: an overriding willingness to believe the worst about people from ‚Äòover there‚Äô. The East European ‚Äòthey‚Äô are not like ‚Äòus‚Äô, the programme seemed to be saying: they are less developed, less socially advanced; they need our moral lessons, our anti-racist schooling. Amid the apparent social backwardness of Poland and Ukraine, the multicultural, cosmopolitan superiority of Western Europe can shine through. And we in Britain can bask in its glow.\\" The deputy mayor of Krak√≥w, referring to the incidents of racism and anti-Semitism broadcast by Panorama, said: \\"We believe that, step by step, the clubs will also take more responsibility for this kind of activity at stadiums\\". Adam Bulandra, project coordinator of the Interkulturalni Foundation and co-author of Krak√≥w's new anti-racist strategy said: \\"The local community does not react properly to this problem, it does not actively oppose the incidents that happen, that's why they are so visible, and we want to change this situation.\\" A spokesperson for Poland's Ombudsman for Citizens' Rights, noted that while there may seem to be only a small number of racist incidents in Poland, that 80 percent of racist crimes go unreported in the country. In 2014, Jewish News and other news organizations reported that during the making of the documentary, host Chris Rogers had been filmed giving a Nazi salute while marching in front of the crew. Rogers was reprimanded by the BBC, apologized and had not been re-hired by the Panorama program for two years after the incident. =The Mind Reader: Unlocking My Voice= This Panorama Special broadcast on 13 November 2012 showed the pioneering work being done by scientists to help patients who have suffered severe brain injuries. The film told the stories of a group of patients and their families, and showed the revolutionary efforts made to help them communicate with the outside world. The film included the story of Scott Routley, a Canadian man in a persistent vegetative state for more than a decade who was able to tell doctors he is not in any pain. =North Korea Undercover= North Korea Undercover was filmed in North Korea in late March 2013 by a 3-person team that accompanied a group of students from the London School of Economics. The trip was organised through the Grimshaw Club ‚Äì an international relations club affiliated with LSE ‚Äì by Tomiko Sweeney, the wife of John Sweeney. The North Koreans, who require permission for entry by journalists, and who have jailed journalists who have attempted unauthorised entry, were not informed of the BBC team and failed to recognize John Sweeney, calling him \\"professor.\\" The degree to which the students were informed led to a difference of opinion between the institutions later, with the BBC maintaining that less than full disclosure was a measure taken to protect the students in the event of discovery. Sweeney and his wife were accompanied by a BBC cameraman. Subsequently, however, a public statement signed by six of the 10 LSE student participants on the trip said that \\"We feel that we have now been put in more risk than was originally the case, as a result of the LSE's decision to go public with their story\\". They also indicated that they had no objection to the broadcast of the BBC Panorama documentary and that they were satisfied with how the BBC handled the trip. According to Gianluca Spezza, an informed critic and one of the directors of NK News, the documentary was of low quality, comparable to many of the videos frequently taken by tourists and posted to YouTube. In addition, according to Spezza, the undercover filming had a detrimental effect on responsible efforts to engage in legitimate cultural exchange and development of mutual understanding. =Contaminated Blood: The Search for the Truth= Originally broadcast on 10 May 2017, the 1-hour special episode examined some of the events surrounding the Contaminated Blood Scandal whereby Haemophiliacs were infected with Hepatitis C and HIV via Factor VIII medicine products. The programme featured former Health Ministers Andy Burnham and David Owen, both were critical of successive governments roles in the scandal, with the former suggesting it was \\"criminal\\". Professor John Cash (former Director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service) told the programme that the truth about the Scandal in England & Wales \\"has not yet been told\\". One of the victims' sons, Jason Evans, told the programme he was now taking legal action, which was subsequently billed by the press as a \\"Landmark Legal case\\". In the days after the programme, he was joined by hundreds of others and the situation is on- going. =Is Labour Anti-Semitic?= There was media significant coverage, even prior to airing, for this hour-long episode, which premiered on 10 July 2019 and explored allegations of antisemitism in the UK Labour Party. During the programme, eight former members of Labour party staff said that senior Labour figures had intervened to downgrade punishments handed out to members over antisemitism. The programme was presented by John Ware and produced by Neil Grant, both of whom also worked on a 2015 Panorama programme, Labour's Earthquake. Grant, who had been a teacher at JFS and London Labour Party activist, also produced a 2016 Dispatches programme, Battle for the Labour Party. Both programmes were strongly criticised by supporters of the party leadership for their hostility to Corbyn and the left. The programme was criticised by groups such as the Media Reform Coalition, Jonathon Cook, The Canary and the website PressGang, who alleged a lack of alternative views, use of partial quotes and unjustified assumptions. Ken Loach called it \\"probably the most disgusting programme I‚Äôve ever seen on the BBC...it bought the propaganda from people who were intent on destroying Corbyn.‚Äù The Labour Party itself criticised the programme prior to broadcast and issued the following statement afterwards: > \\"The Panorama programme was not a fair or balanced investigation. It was a > seriously inaccurate, politically one-sided polemic, which breached basic > journalistic standards, invented quotes and edited emails to change their > meaning. It was an overtly biased intervention by the BBC in party political > controversy. An honest investigation into antisemitism in Labour and wider > society is in the public interest. The Panorama team instead pre-determined > an answer to the question posed by the programme's title.\\" A Labour Party spokesman further accused staff featured in the documentary of being \\"disaffected former officials... who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind.\\"Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot, \\"Corbyn under fire from staff and Labour peers over antisemitism\\", The Guardian, 15 July 2019, accessed 21 July 2019) However, Labour Party staff represented by the GMB Union voted 124-4 to demand the party apologises to the former staff. John Cryer, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, said that attacking former Labour staff who appeared on the documentary was \\"a gross misjudgment\\". Five of the staff featured announced their intention to sue the Party, claiming that Labour's response breached its commitment to protect the rights of whistleblowers and 'defamed' them. The Labour Party submitted a formal complaint about the programme to the BBC, which received around 1,600 complaints in total. The BBC‚Äôs Executive Complaints Unit rejected these complaints. Over 20 complaints of bias were taken to Ofcom, who ruled that the programme had been \\"duly impartial\\" and had given appropriate weight to Labour's position. In April 2020, an unpublished 860 page Labour Party report on the handling of antisemitism intended for an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, according to Sky News, \\"singles out for criticism some who gave whistleblower evidence to last year's highly-critical BBC Panorama investigation on antisemitism within Labour. These include the former General Secretary Lord McNicol and the former acting head of the governance and legal unit, Sam Matthews.\\" Sky News quotes the report as urging the EHRC to \\"question the validity of the personal testimonies\\" of former members of staff and to \\"focus instead on the documentary, primary-source evidence that the Party has made available\\". In July 2020, the Labour Party, now under the leadership of Keir Starmer, retracted in full the allegations it had made about both John Ware and the participants in the Panorama documentary, which it conceded were false, issued a formal apology, and agreed to pay damages and costs, estimated to be around ¬£600,000.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/22/labour-pays-out-six- figure-sum-and-apologises-in-antisemitism-row =Has the government failed the NHS?= Broadcast on 27 April 2020, this episode, conducted by reporter Richard Bilton, investigated the UK Governments alleged failure to stockpile critical equipment such as PPE, and the impact this has had on the management of Covid-19 within the NHS.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/key-ppe-items- not-in-governments-pandemic-stockpile-when-coronavirus-hit-uk-investigation- finds-a4425531.htmlhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000hr3y/panorama- has-the-government-failed-the-nhs The investigation also examined the reversal of the designation of Covid-19 as a \\"High consequence infectious disease\\" (HCID) and the simultaneous downgrading of PPE guidance. It was intimated that the decision making was fuelled, in part, by the lack of suitable equipment in the stockpile.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641 Among the interviewees was public health expert and long-time Labour Party member, Professor John Ashton, who described the findings as \\"breathtaking\\" and stated; \\"The consequence of not planning; not ordering kit; not having stockpiles is that we are sending into the front line doctors, nurses, other health workers and social care workers without the equipment to keep them safe\\". Attempted censorship by security services In December 2011, it was revealed that former BBC Director General Sir Ian Trethowan had met with the chiefs of MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service about an episode of Panorama dealing with the security services in 1981. He showed a video recording of the original programme to Bernard Sheldon, then legal adviser to MI5. The latter suggested cuts to the programme and Trethowan asked the head of BBC News to reduce the programme to half its length. Scheduling The scheduling of Panorama has, since the 1980s, often been a subject of media debate and controversy, due to the duties of the BBC to provide both, on the one hand, entertaining programming that appeals to a mass audience, and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5 million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10 pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30 pm, after the Nine O'Clock News. Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yenotob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9 pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10 pm, to make way for the sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was sidelining serious content in favour of lighter programming. In 2000, the programme was moved again, with the 10 pm timeslot no longer available due to the transferring of the BBC News from 9 pm to the later slot. Panorama was moved to Sunday nights, after the news, usually shown at around 10.15 pm ‚Äì labelled by some critics as a \\"graveyard slot\\". The number of editions made per year was also reduced, which attracted press criticism for the BBC in general and its Director-General Greg Dyke in particular, as Dyke was the driving force behind the schedule changes. The incoming Controller of BBC One, Lorraine Heggessey, defended the move, claiming that the programme's audience would have \\"dwindled\\" had it remained on Monday nights. In January 2007 Heggessey's successor, Peter Fincham, moved Panorama back from Sunday nights to a prime time Monday evening slot at 8.30 pm, although it was now shorter than it had previously been, running to half an hour. This decision was at least partly in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel to show more current affairs programming during prime time.

An earlier arrangement of legislative councils for the colony and provinces existed from 1841 when New Zealand became a colony; it was reconstituted as the upper house of a bicameral legislature when New Zealand became self-governing in 1852, which came into effect in the following year. Unlike the elected lower house, the House of Representatives, the Legislative Council was wholly appointed by the governor-general. The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 had authorised the appointment of a minimum of ten councillors. Beginning in the 1890s, the membership of the upper house became controlled by government of the day. As a result, the Legislative Council possessed little influence. While intended as a revising chamber, in practice, debates and votes typically simply replicated those in the lower house. It was abolished by an Act of Parliament in 1950, with its last sitting in December 1950.  Establishment  The first Legislative Council was established by the Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand on 16 November 1840, which created New Zealand as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841. Originally, the Legislative Council consisted of the governor, colonial secretary, and colonial treasurer, and a number of senior justices of the peace. The Legislative Council had the power to issue Ordinances (statutory instruments). With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the first Legislative Council was disestablished and a similar appointed body created as the upper house of the General Assembly in 1853.  Role  The Legislative Council was intended to act as a revising chamber, scrutinising and amending bills which had been passed by the House of Representatives. It could not initiate bills, and was prohibited from amending money bills (legislation relating to finance and expenditure). The model for the Legislative Council's role was the House of Lords in the United Kingdom.  Membership  =Appointment and tenure= The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 provided for councillors to be appointed for life terms by the governor. As the power of the Governor over New Zealand politics gradually decreased, it became the convention that appointments were made on the recommendation of the premier (later prime minister), essentially meaning that councillors were selected by the government of the day. However, the life term of councillors meant that the Legislative Council always lagged behind the House of Representatives‚ÄîPremiers were frequently hampered in their activities by a Legislative Council appointed by their predecessors. In 1891, life membership was replaced by a seven-year term by the new Liberal Party government of John Ballance. Part of the Liberal Party's motivation was probably ideological, but part was undoubtedly political, as Ballance's conservative predecessor, Harry Atkinson, had stacked the council with seven conservatives shortly before leaving office. Ballance had considerable difficulty in achieving his reform of the Council, with major clashes occurring between him and the Governor, The Earl of Onslow, who had approved the seven appointments. Ballance's victory is seen as establishing an important precedent in the relationship between Governor and Prime Minister. The seven appointments on 20 or 22 January to the Council were Atkinson himself (he was appointed Speaker) plus Charles Bowen, James Fulton, Charles John Johnston, John Davies Ormond, William Downie Stewart Sr and John Blair Whyte. The structure of the Legislative Council prior to 1891 was therefore similar to that of the Canadian Senate (which continues as an appointed upper house, although senators are no longer appointed to life terms, and must retire at the age of 75). The title \\"The Honourable\\" could be retained from 1894 by a councillor with not less than ten years service if recommended by the Governor. This privilege was extended to one member, William Montgomery, in 1906; and a further eleven members in 1951 after abolition of the Council. =Number of members= It was specified in the Constitution Act 1852 that the Council would consist of at least ten members. Although not actually a part of the Act, instructions were issued that the number of members should not exceed fifteen. One member was to be selected as Speaker of the Legislative Council, corresponding roughly to the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. A quorum of five members was established. The first appointments to the Legislative Council were made in 1853, when twelve members were called to the upper house. They were John Salmon, William Swainson and Frederick Whitaker on 26 May 1853; Mathew Richmond on 23 June 1853; and on 31 December 1853 Edmund Bellairs, George Cutfield, William Kenny, John Yeeden Lloyd, Ralph Richardson, Henry Seymour, Henry St. Hill and John Charles Watts- Russell. Gradually, the maximum number of members was raised, and the limit was eventually abolished. The Council reached a peak of 53 members in 1885 and 1950. =Extent of representation= The Legislative Council was generally less representative of the New Zealand public than was the House of Representatives. Women were not eligible to serve as councillors until 1941, and only five were appointed. Two, Mary Anderson and Mary Dreaver, were appointed in 1946 by the First Labour Government. In 1950, when the First National Government appointed several new members to vote the council out of existence, three women were included; Cora Louisa Burrell, Ethel Marion Gould and Agnes Louisa Weston. MƒÅori were slightly better represented. The first two MƒÅori councillors were appointed in 1872, not long after the creation of the MƒÅori electorates in the House; Mokena Kohere and Wiremu Tako Ngatata. A convention was established that there should always be MƒÅori representation on the Council. =1891 appointments= In January 1891 the outgoing Atkinson Ministry appointed six new members to the Legislative Council, with the object of blocking any radical bills that the John Ballance (who became Premier on 24 January) and the new Liberal Government might introduce. They were the last appointments for life as the new government introduced a seven year term. The new members were Charles John Johnston and John Davies Ormond on 20 January; and Harry Atkinson, James Fulton, William Downie Stewart, and John Blair Whyte on 22 January. John Hall had written to Ormond: \\"It will be a serious disaster if the Council is not strengthened before the Reds get into the saddle.\\" Petitions were tabled against the \\"stacking of the Council\\" by MPs and by Aucklanders. But the \\"stacking\\" has been seen as assisting the Liberal Government, which: \\"might not have survived but for this assistance .... (which) provided a useful unifying influence in the critical early years (and) identified with dramatic clarity the reactionary class enemy .... and acted as a convenient brake on the radicals (who) were asked to settle for moderate measures\\". =Proposals for election= A number of proposals were made that the Legislative Council should be elected, not appointed. When responsible government had been granted at the beginning of the 2nd Parliament, the Governor, Thomas Gore Browne, was given sufficient authority to make the Legislative Council elected, but no action was taken. In 1914, a reform proposal to establish a 42 or 43 member council elected by proportional representation for six years was introduced by the Liberals, but postponed due to World War I. In 1920 it was no longer favoured by the Reform government then in power. But the 1914 Act \\"remained like a sword of Damocles suspended above the nominated upper house, available at will or whim to any succeeding government\\".  Abolition  By the middle of the 20th century, the Legislative Council was increasingly being looked on as ineffectual and making little difference to the legislative process. The Legislative Council rarely criticised bills sent to it by the House, and many believed that it was now obsolete. Some favoured its reform, while others favoured its abolition; among the latter group was the leader of the National Party, Sidney Holland, who introduced a private member's bill to abolish it in August 1947. However, because the Parliament of New Zealand was unable to amend the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, it had to first adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931, which it did with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947. Following the adoption of the Act, the Parliament of New Zealand passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment (Request and Consent) Act 1947, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947, allowing the New Zealand Parliament to amend the Constitution Act and abolish the Legislative Council. However, the Labour government did not actually enact the abolition itself, and lost office in the 1949 general election. In 1950, the National Party, now in government, passed the Legislative Council Abolition Act. To assist its passage into law, Holland appointed twenty members known as the \\"suicide squad\\", to vote for abolition, just as the Australian state of Queensland had done to abolish its upper house in 1922. They included former MPs Harold Dickie and Garnet Mackley. To encourage co- operation from other members, Holland also promised to use the money saved through abolition to set up a fund for retired members. A Statutes Revision Committee (now defunct) was established to carry out some of the scrutiny that the Legislative Council had been intended for. Although abolition was intended as an interim measure, no serious attempts were made to introduce a new second chamber, and Parliament has been unicameral since.  Proposed reestablishment  Support for bicameralism is not completely absent, and there have been occasional proposals for a new upper house or Senate. A constitutional reform committee chaired by Ronald Algie proposed an appointed Senate in 1952. In 1990, the government of Jim Bolger proposed an elected Senate, an idea advanced partly as an alternative to New Zealand's electoral reform process. Unicameralists in New Zealand, like former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, argued that the country is a small and relatively homogeneous unitary state, and hence does not need the same arrangements as federal countries like Australia or Canada.Unbridled power: An Interpretation of New Zealand's Constitution and Government, Oxford University Press, 1987, page 231 In addition, Peter Dunne, then also a Labour MP, argued that other political reforms in New Zealand such as the strengthening of the select committee system, and the introduction of proportional representation, provided adequate checks and balances, which would simply be duplicated by a second chamber.New Zealand Hansard: Tuesday, December 15, 1992 ELECTORAL REFORM BILL : Introduction  Legislative Council Chamber  Today, the Legislative Council Chamber is used for the speech from the throne, as following the British tradition, by convention the sovereign (or a representative) does not enter the elected House.

In general theory, the Pericardium is not distinguished from the Heart. It is also the first line of defence against the Heart from External Pathogenic Influences. The Pericardium has a meridian named for it, which reflects the health of the organ. In terms of the Five Elements, these organs are both associated with the fire element.

His name is also rendered as Tetigus, Tatizius, Tatitius, Tatic, or Tetig. Origins and early life The father of Tatikios was a \\"Saracen\\", probably meaning a Turk,Brand, p. 3 who was captured by Alexius' father John Comnenus and who served as a slave in the Comnenus household. Tatikios and Alexius grew up together. Tatikios is described as an oikogenes of Alexius (that is, \\"from the same house\\"). In 1078, before Alexius became emperor, Tatikios accompanied him in battle against his rival Nicephorus Basilacius. During this campaign Tatkios discovered Basilacius' plans for an ambush. When Alexius became emperor in 1081 Tatikios held the office of megas primikerios in the imperial household. Later that year he commanded the \\"Turks living around Ochrida\\", perhaps HungariansBrand, loc.cit. at the Battle of Dyrrhachium against Robert Guiscard. Military and political career In 1086 Tatikios was sent to Nicaea in an attempt to recapture it from the Seljuks. He was forced to retreat when he learned that Seljuk reinforcements were on their way. Alexius sent Tatikios back with naval assistance from Manuel Boutoumites. Although Tatikios was able to defeat Abu'l Qasim, in Bithynia, he could not recapture the city. At the end of the year Tatikios was recalled and sent to fight the Pechenegs, who were assisting the heretical Manichaeans in revolt against Alexius, near Philippopolis. In 1087 Tatikios commanded the Byzantine right wing in the Battle of Dristra against the Pechenegs, and in 1090 he defeated a small force of 300 Pechenegs while leading the Archontopouloi tagma against them. In early 1094, Tatikios was placed in charge of guarding Alexius' tent at Pentegostis. Here he discovered the plot of Nikephoros Diogenes, son of the former emperor Romanus IV Diogenes, to kill the emperor. Nicephorus was an old friend of Alexius and Tatikios and Alexius was reluctant to punish him, but it was clear that Nicephorus was ambitious for the throne. Nicephorus was exiled and was eventually blinded. Later in 1094, Tatikios attended the synod of Blachernae which condemned Bishop Leo of Chalcedon, presumably performing some function of security. In the records of this synod Tatikios is given the court title of protoproedros.Magdalino, p. 502. In 1095 Tatikios accompanied Alexius in the campaign against the Cumans. Role during the First Crusade In 1096 Tatikios defended Constantinople from peasant crusaders who attacked the city after their arrival. In 1097 Tzitas, commanding 2000 peltasts, was sent by Alexius to Nicaea to assist the Crusaders in their siege of the city. The Frankish chronicler Albert of Aix says that Tatikios acted as an envoy between the Turks and the crusaders, but according to the more reliable Anna Comnena, he was working with Boutoumites to negotiate the surrender of the city without the Crusaders' knowledge. This caused a deep rift between the Latins and Greeks. However, Tatikios was ordered to accompany the Crusaders across Anatolia, both as a guide and also to ensure that any former Byzantine territory re-captured was returned to the Empire. After leaving Nicaea, the Crusaders split into two groups. Tatikios accompanied the Norman (under Guiscard's son Bohemund of Taranto, Bohemund's nephew Tancred, and Robert of Normandy) and Flemish (under Robert of Flanders) contingents. The Gesta Francorum records that Tatikios frequently warned the Crusaders of the ferocity of the Turks. During the siege of Antioch, Raymond of Aguilers writes that Tatikios advised the Crusaders to disperse and capture the surrounding countryside before attacking the city itself, which would also help them avoid a famine (this advice was ignored). In February 1098 he left the siege; according to Anna, who probably talked to Tatikios personally or had access to his reports, Tatikios was informed by Bohemund that the other Crusaders mistrusted him and had threatened his life. Bohemund, on the other hand, spread the rumour that Tatikios was a coward and a traitor, and had fled the army never intending to return, despite his promises to bring back reinforcements from Constantinople. This is the account preserved in contemporary crusader chronicles, who refer to him as a great enemy and a liar (periurio manet et manebit, according to the Gesta Francorum); Anna's account, of course, may be influenced by her deep prejudice against Bohemund, a long- standing enemy of her father. Appearance and descendants The Crusade chroniclers mention that Tatikios had a mutilated nose. Mutilation of the face was a common Byzantine punishment for traitors but this does not appear to be the case in this instance. According to Guibert of Nogent he had a prosthetic gold nose as a replacement. Contrary to the Crusaders' opinions of him, Anna describes him as \\"a valiant fighter, a man who kept his head under combat conditions,\\" and \\"a clever orator and a powerful man of action.\\" Anna also tells the story that Tatikios and Alexius were playing polo when the general was thrown from his horse and landed on the emperor. Alexius injured his knee in the incident and was thereafter afflicted by gout. Anna does not mention the date of this incident; it is an aside in her account of Alexius' campaigns against the Turks around 1110. There is no record of the dates of Tatikios' birth or death. Although the office of Grand Primicerius (megas primikerios) was usually held by a eunuch, Tatikios seems to have had descendants who were members of a powerful noble family in the 12th century, including another general, prominent at the Battle of Sirmium, under Manuel I Comnenus. A probable descendant, Constantine Tatikios, was deprived of his sight following a failed plot against Isaac Angelos.Choniates p. 233 Notes References Primary: * * Secondary: *Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, Vol. 1: The First Crusade.

The population is 21,375 (2015) within an area of 784 km¬≤.Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica In 2000, its Human Development Index was 0.816.  History  The region of Pompeia was originally inhabited by Kaingang natives, called Coroados (\\"Crowned\\") by the Portuguese colonizers. The first settlers arrived in 1852, when the Imperial Government granted Jo√£o Antonio de Moraes, Francisco de Paula Morais and Francisco Rodrigues de Campos occupancy over the lands in the surroundings of Rio do Peixe and Aguape√≠ River (S√£o Paulo). In 1919, J√∫lio da Costa Barros purchased a share of Guataporanga farm for agricultural purposes. In the following three years, the first Coffea plantations started to grow. Later on, abiding by a condition from Guataporanga Farm's landowner, Barros founded Vila de Novo Cravinhos, name given after Cravinhos, where the first customers of theirs came from. The clear-cutting in the nearby started alongside with the construction of former Noroeste do Brasil Railroad in order to link the cities of Bauru (S√£o Paulo) and Corumb√° (Mato Grosso do Sul). Jacutinga Farm was the first to arise in the environs. Its landowner Rodolfo Lara Campos acquired it in order to grown Coffea large-scale profit crops and started the deforestation of the region where later the city of Pompeia would be established. In 1928, Rodolfo and Luiz Miranda planned the foundation of a city and commanded the cutting of a 250 hectare area, which was named Patrim√¥nio de Otom√¢nia (\\"Otom√¢nia's Patrimony) and after being divided into lots the first of those began to be sold. A few years later, Patrim√¥nio was officially renamed Pompeia after senator Rodolfo Miranda's wife, Aretuza Pompeia. As several cities of the state of S√£o Paulo, Pompeia was majorly populated by Portuguese, Italian and Japanese immigrants. The latter's culture even nowadays is still remarkable in traditional festivities and the architectural design of the city, e.g. many bus stops have roofs with eaves curved.  Education  Pompeia has become a reference in Education within the state of S√£o Paulo and also in nationwide indicators. It was listed as one of the 500 cities that offer more educational opportunitites in Brazil. Since 2013, Shunji Nishimura Foundation of Technology has collaborated with Faculdade de Tecnologia offering graduation courses of Mechanization of Precision Agriculture and Big Data in Agribusiness, which has contributed to transform the city into a new hub for higher education.  M√°quinas Agr√≠colas Jacto  In 1948, the Jacto Group was founded in the city by Japanese immigrant Shunji Nishimura, who arrived in Brazil in 1932. Graduated at Dai-Ichi Kogyo Gakko Industrial School in Kyoto, Nishimura and his family developed agricultural fixing equipment which gradatively gained more popularity among farmers and agricultural families in the countryside of not only S√£o Paulo but also other states of Brazil. The company has been one of the top earners of the city and a major revenue stream of the Midwestern state of S√£o Paulo. The Nishimura family was also responsible for the Shunji Nishimura Foundation of Technology, created to provide farmers testing services to determine soil fertility and analyze plant tissues, as well as working on continuous technological improvement in rural areas. .

Because of the lack of investment, the city hardly explores this market. Facade of the Mineral Water Po√° Company . An example of a tourist attraction, is the municipal spa Vicente Leporace, located in front of the Fonte A√∫rea, which was opened in 1970 as a condition for the council to receive the title of hidromineral and tourist resort. After being used for 30 years, it was deactivated at the beginning of the decade, because the mayor at the time, Eduardo Carlos Felippe, felt that there was no need to have a spa in the city. Since then the site is used as a physiotherapy center. =EXPO√Å = Main Square Event in one of the editions of the Expo. Because there are a lot of orchids existing Po√° and throughout the Upper Tiet√™, because of the favorable climate for the cultivation of the plant, in 1970 the Exhibition of Orchids and Ornamental Plants of Po√°, better known as EXPO, was established with the goal \\"to increase tourism in the city, as well as to provide a tribute to nature\\". The exhibition is recognized by the State Ministry of Sports and Tourism of the S√£o Paulo State Government and since 1976 is part of the National Calendar of the Brazilian Institute of Tourism (formerly Embratur), linked to the Ministry of Tourism. It is held every year in September. From 1983 to 1993 the Expo was held at the Municipal Gymnasium Sports Americo Franco at Golden Village, and is currently held in the Event Square Lucilia Felippe Gomes, receiving approximately 300,000 visitors per year.  Education, sport and culture  ETEC Technical School of Po√°. Bible Square There are several schools located in the city, municipal, state, private and run by nongovernmental organizations. Among these are the unit of SESI, located in the Village Perracini the Napes - Center for Educational Support Specialist - which makes the inclusion of rooms in normal classroom of students with various types of disabilities, located in Golden Village, which is ETEC and administered by the city of Po√° - Po√° State Technical College - which began its activities in the second half of 2009 and was inaugurated on 5 October that year. The deployment of ETEC was a partnership of municipal and state governments, where it invested R $1.5 million. They are offered technical courses and school regularly. At the time of inauguration, the building of ETEC Po√° was considered by the Paula Souza Center, \\"one of the best network.\\" [21] The average candidate ETEC of Po√° in 2009 was 6.1 applicants per vacancy. [22] In Po√°, there are several locations available to the population, which were built from the emancipation. The gym hall for example, located in Golden Village, started construction on January 25, 1957, the state government. There are several sports associations legally registered in Po√°. Three clubs, meanwhile, stands out for its ancient foundation and participation within the community. It Esporte Clube XI Paulista, Poaense Athletic Association, and Sports Club Concordia Poaense, and other associations like the Rotary Club and the Lyons Club. Are offered free courses in rhythmic gymnastics, futsal, beach volleyball, capoeira, boxing, volleyball, basketball, judo, karate, handball, among others, in their own municipal gymnasium and sports groups installed in neighborhoods such as those in towns and Julia Varela and St. Joseph's Garden. Sports competitions are held sporadically in the various fields in the city, as in the neighborhoods Teresa Palma, Jardim Am√©rica, Garden St. Helena, Juliet Villa, Villa Giulia, in the New Forest Po√°, Vila Monteiro, Calmon Viana, together with companies neighborhood friends. Also occur capoeiristas meetings, the challenge of beach volleyball, indoor soccer battle, streetball, among others. The skate park built in 2000, is installed next to the viaduct at the Centre, is open to the public and receives championships annually [23]. Po√° also has cultural spaces like the Public Library, Cultural Center and Municipal Museum Taiguara House Station. The squares within the existing neighborhoods and in the central region are also leisure facilities. The squares of the Bible and Events, for example, function as parks, as have recreational equipment such as playgrounds, restrooms and security. The Carnival is also a very traditional activity in the city, where there are parades of samba schools for over thirty years. Po√° currently has ten active samba schools, among which we mention: the New Academic Po√°, Empire Village Vampr√©, Clover Gold, Ultima Hora, Jau Village, Villa Julia, among others.  Economy  Nove de Julho Avenue Calmon Viana Train station In 2010, the Index of consumption potential of the inhabitants of Po√° should consume R $1.4 billion. According to Target CPI, with the rate of 0.06408, Po√° contribute six cents to every $100.00 spent in Brazil. This places the municipality in the 74th position in the state ranking. The city has 32,623 households and 31,813 cars caught on. Poaense each urban area in the city should consume R $12,459.76 in 2010 .

The change resulted in the departure of some industries, but even so Po√° houses large industries, among the nearly 200 installed on its territory. Highlights for the manufacturer of refractory Ibar (Brazilian Industry of Refractory items) which was installed in Po√° five years before the emancipation of the municipality, the maker of electrical cables Inducabos, and the Brazilian subsidiary of the multinational Aunde, which produces automotive fabrics. Together, Ibar and Aunde occupy nearly half the area of Calmon Viana. The district that was formed between the two industries was renamed Vila Ibar. Shopping: The main shopping streets of the city are street March 26 and July 9 Avenue that are in the center, housing most of the banks and \\"anchor stores\\" of the city. There are other commercial corridors such as Lucas Nogueira Garcez Avenue and Avenida Getulio Vargas, among others. It is estimated that there are approximately 2,000 commercial premises. Services: It is the sector of the economy that is more present in the city. There are various tax incentive laws and among them, and that attracts companies of its kind, is to reduce the tax on services (ISS), which has much lower rate than in most towns. While its neighbor St. Paul (city that focuses more services company in Brazil), charge rate of 5% for most service activities, in Po√° charge rate of 2%. are more than 20,000 service providers, among which we highlight the holding company of Banco Safra (the Safra Leasing, located in the center) and Banco Itau (Itau Administradora Consortia and Itaucard Bank, both located in Vila das Acacias - also in the central region) and the subsidiary company of S√£o Paulo TMKT telemarketing, (installed in Calmon Viana). There are also horticultural activity in rural areas little is left of the city after the dispute of territory with Suzano in the 1950s and 1960s. Tourism began to be promoted now, in the early 2000s (decade). Yet the main event done in the city, the Expo comes to attract 350,000 people in seven days.

Early life He was the son of Catherine Alexander (Robinson) and Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, both of whom were natives of New York City. His father was a well-known naval officer whose career had been surrounded in controversy; his uncles included William Alexander Duer, John Slidell, and Matthew C. Perry. By the time of his birth, his parents had purchased a farm on the Hudson between Tarrytown and Sing Sing. His father died suddenly September 13, 1848, at his residence, near Tarrytown, N.Y., of heart disease. Military service Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1855, he graduated in June 1859 and was assigned to the newly completed steam sloop of war Hartford. During the next two years, Midshipman MacKenzie served in that ship with the East India Squadron. Promoted to Lieutenant in August 1861, he was an officer of the gunboat Kineo during the conquest of the lower Mississippi River in 1862. During 1863 and 1864 he later transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, MacKenzie served off Charleston, South Carolina, in the steam frigate Wabash and monitor Patapsco, taking part in combat operations against Fort Sumter and Morris Island. Later in the civil war he commanded the gunboat Winona, also in the waters off South Carolina. In July 1865 MacKenzie received the rank of Lieutenant Commander and soon began a second Far Eastern deployment in Hartford. After the end of the war, he returned to the Far East in Hartford, in which he served until June 13, 1867, when he was killed in action at Kenting, Taiwan while leading a punitive expedition against the massacre of the entire crew of an American merchant bark Rover.

He directed more than 20 campaigns and won 65 pitched battles, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history as part of the expansion of the Mongol Empire.Ch 1 Great Captains Unveiled Liddell Hart He often gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that operated hundreds of kilometers apart from each other. Subutai is well known for the geographical diversity and success of his expeditions, which took him from central Asia to the Russian steppe and into Europe. Early life Historians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175,Gabriel, Richard. \\"Genghis Khan's Greatest General Subotai the Valiant\\". University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6. probably just west of the upper Onon River in what is now Mongolia. He belonged to the Uriankhai clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest- dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.Gabriel, 6-8. Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother Jelme also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from Jebe, then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the Secret History of the Mongols. According to Subutai's biography in the History of Yuan, Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow, Stephen and Liao, Jingjing: Subutai - Sorting Fact from Fiction Surrounding the Mongol Empire‚Äôs Greatest General (With Translations of Subutai‚Äôs Two Biographies in the Yuan Shi). Journal of Chinese Military History, Volume 7, Issue 1. Brill, Leiden, 2018, p. 51-52, 69. Despite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the Mongol Empire was a meritocracy. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a blacksmith. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3. Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 tumens operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \\"dogs of war,\\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in The Secret History of the Mongols:Cummins, Joseph. History's Great Untold Stories: Larger Than Life Characters & Dramatic Events That Changed the World. 2006. Washington D.C.: National Geographic Society, 2006. Print. Appointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to Genghis Khan, \\"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.\\"Saunders, J. J. (1971). The History of the Mongol Conquests, Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.Gabriel, 10 Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite Jebe (1211‚Äì12, 1213‚Äì14, 1219‚Äì23) and Muqali (1213‚Äì14), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219). Subutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the Merkit, when he was just 22 years old. Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.Gabriel, 12-13. He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia. As a general Subutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances. Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and devastated the surrounded agriculture so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube\`etei Ba\`atur, Anonymous Strategist. In contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the battle of Carrhae or the battle of Manzikert, Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the battle of the Kalka River in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159. Subutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in siege warfare. Even in field battles he made use of siege engines. In the Battle of Mohi, the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge stonethrowers to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the creeping barrage of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War. Like Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity. Central Asian campaigns (1217‚Äì1220) In 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated Merkits and their allies, the Cuman-Kipchak confederation, in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the Chu River in 1217 and again in 1219 in Wild Kipchak territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow and Liao, 52-54. Mohammed II of Khwarizm attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.Juvaini, History of the World Conqueror, 370‚Äì371. Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the Kara-Khitai Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars. Genghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade Khwarizm as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the Khwarizim Empire, but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly Kyzylkum Desert to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.Juvaini, History of the World Conqueror, 373‚Äì385. After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammd attempted to save himself by fleeing into central Persia, but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.Juvaini, History of the World Conqueror, 375‚Äì410. Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'. The Great Raid (1220‚Äì1223) Routes taken by Mongol invaders Subutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in Azerbaijan and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \\"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the Caspian Sea through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild Kipchaks and Cumans.In the Service of the Khans, 19. After destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of Georgia. Though the king George IV of Georgia was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated Georgian army with many thousands of knights, by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166‚Äì167. This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the Fifth Crusade. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope Honorius III to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.Oliver of Paderborn, \\"The Capture of Damietta\\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198‚Äì1229, ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123‚Äì124. Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer. After ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the Caucasus Mountains during the winter to get around the Derbent Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a perilous route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the Alans, Circassians, and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. The plan worked out, but strategical advantage came at a high price. In all likelihood the 1,000 men were led by Jebe who was killed by some Kipchaks.Stephen Pow: The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 27, no. 01 (2016): 31-51. As expected the coalition army pursued the Mongols and after retreating for 9 days, Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined Rus' and Cuman army at the Kalka (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607‚Äì613. Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin China (1207, 1209, 1211‚Äì1215, 1226‚Äì27) In the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming Great Wall). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic battle of Yehuling. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.In the Service of the Khan, Paul Buell, 17‚Äì18. Subutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of Xi Xia in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the Jin districts along the upper Wei River, and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.Buell, 20. Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son √ñgedei in 1229. =Conquest of Jin China (1231‚Äì1235)= Mongol conquest of Jurchen Jin and other regimes of China After a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230‚Äì1231, √ñgedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central China) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,Rashid al-Din, Annals of Ogedei Khan, 33. but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229‚Äì1230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.Christopher P. Atwood, Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin, 31. Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them. Subutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of Henan ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch‚Äôe-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.Christopher P. Atwood, Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin, 31‚Äì41. In 1231‚Äì1232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and Tolui, invading the Song Empire and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.Atwood, 34. The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.Yuanshi 115.2885-6. This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south. The main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow and Liao, 60-62, 71-72. Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.Carl Svedrup, \\"Sube'etei Ba'atur\\", Anonymous Strategist, 41‚Äì43. With part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Sanfengshan, capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T‚Äôiehling (1 March 1232).Carl Svedrup, \\"Sube\`etei Ba\`atur\\", Anonymous Strategist, 41‚Äì43. The heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of circumvallation that had a perimeter stretching . Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \\"Thunder Crash Bombs\\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, mangonels, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their intransigence and extremely long resistance. However, √ñgedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly.McLynn, 407‚Äì410. With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234. However, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized Kaifeng and Luoyang during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them, and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position. Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward. Conquest of Russia (1236‚Äì1240) √ñgedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the Wild Kipchaks and Bulgars. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince Batu). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: √ñgedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.McLynn, 435. In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.Svedrup, 43‚Äì44. After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader Bachman on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had ensconced himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.McLynn, 436‚Äì437. Unlike in 1222‚Äì23 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked Ryazan and Vladimir-Suzdal, operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The Rus forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the Don River. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the Black Sea. In 1239, the Rus' state of Chernigov was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer Novgorod when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.Frank McLynn, 434‚Äì441. The most notable encounter of the campaign was the battle of the Sit River in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.The Chronicle of Novgorod (1914), 83. The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. Kiev, Vladimir, and other cities were quickly taken. Invasion of Central Europe (1241‚Äì1242) Mongol invasion of Europe 1236-1242 The attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of Jochi, was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against Kievan Rus'. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the Kingdom of Hungary, and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates. Though the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, Bela IV, was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.Paul Lendvai, The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat. Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories Baidar and Kadan regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the Battle of Legnica, right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While G√ºy√ºk's army triumphed in Transylvania, a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King Bela IV had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.McLynn, 465‚Äì466. Only one day after the smaller Mongol army in Poland had won the Battle of Legnica, Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the Battle of Mohi during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so catapults were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow and Liao, 63-68, 72. Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled. The result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the Mongols left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.Denis Sinor, The Mongols in the West (1999). In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong ba'aaturs (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow and Liao, 63-68, 72. =Mongol subjugation of Hungary= In addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check during the Hungarian campaign. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow and Liao, 63-68, 72. This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.Yuanshi 121, 122 in: Pow and Liao, 63-68, 72. Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes Guyuk and Buri.Hodong Kim, A Reappraisal of G√ºy√ºg Khan, 319‚Äì320. Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to √ñgedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.Urgunge Onon, The Secret History of the Mongols, 270. Despite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary. From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy.McLynn, 472‚Äì479; Thomas of Spalato, Historia; Rogerius of Apulia, Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro. In order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at Oradea, the castle of St. Martin of Pannonia, and the capital Esztergom, though the latter's stone citadel held out, and not all sieges proved successful. By early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the Holy Roman Empire, when news came of the death of √ñgedei Khan and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.John of Plano Carpini, The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars. Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal.Timothy May, The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy. However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.McLynn, 479; Carmen Miserabile.Paul Lendvai, The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat, 49. Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to Pope Innocent IV that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.Laszlovszky, J√≥zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh√°nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt. (2018). Contextualizing the Mongol Invasion of Hungary in 1241-42: Short-and Long-Term Perspectives *. 7. 419-450.SƒÉlƒÉgean, Tudor. \\"1 The Mongol Invasion and Its Aftermath\\". In 1 The Mongol Invasion and Its Aftermath, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2016) Final years After subduing a Cuman revolt in what is now Russia, Subutai turned towards Mongolia. Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and G√ºy√ºk was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G√ºy√ºk had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the Song dynasty for 1246‚Äì1247. The Papal envoy Plano Carpini saw him when he was in Karakorum, Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the Tuul River (near modern Ulaanbaatar), dying there at the age of 72. A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the Danube river. Subutai's descendants such as Uriyangkhadai and Aju would serve the Great Khans for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of Dali, invade Dai Viet and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of M√∂ngke Khan. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the battle of Xiangyang, which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279. Legacy In a unique historical anomaly, the strategic and operational innovations of Genghis Khan and Subutai became lost in history, and others were forced to rediscover them 600 and 700 years later. Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.Gabriel, 110. The Mongols did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3‚Äì5 axes of approach, often 500‚Äì1000 km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail. Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight.Gabriel, 113. Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.LTC Sean Slappy, Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur (2010). Though unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book Great Captains Unveiled after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise. In particular, Erwin Rommel and George Patton were avid students of Mongol campaigns.James C. Bradford, ed., International Encyclopedia of Military History. ='Deep Battle' theory= Russia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns. Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General Mikhail Ivanin in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century.Gabriel, 111. Ivanin's work became used in the Deep Battle doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Mikhail Frunze, and G. S. Isserson. Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery. The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai's use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements.Gabriel, 112‚Äì118. Later in the 20th century, American military theorist John Boyd and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai's campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.LTC Joe E.

It is also most commonly found in the ribs, nose, larynx, and trachea. Hyaline cartilage is pearl-grey in color, with a firm consistency and has a considerable amount of collagen. It contains no nerves or blood vessels, and its Structure Hyaline cartilage is covered externally by a fibrous membrane known as the perichondrium or, when it's along articulating surfaces, the synovial membrane. This membrane contains vessels that provide the cartilage with nutrition through diffusion. Hyaline cartilage matrix is primarily made of type II collagen and chondroitin sulphate, both of which are also found in elastic cartilage. Hyaline cartilage exists on the sternal ends of the ribs, in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, and on the articulating surfaces of bones. It gives the structures a definite but pliable form. The presence of collagen fibres makes such structures and joints strong, but with limited mobility and flexibility. Hyaline cartilage is the most prevalent type of cartilage. It also forms the temporary embryonic skeleton, which is gradually replaced by bone, and the skeleton of elasmobranch fish. =Microanatomy= When a slice of hyaline cartilage is examined under the microscope, it is shown to consist of cells (chondrocytes) of a rounded or bluntly angular form, lying in groups of two or more in a granular, or almost homogeneous matrix. When arranged in groups of two or more, the chondrocytes have rounded, but generally straight outlines; where they are in contact with each other, and in the rest of their circumference, they are rounded. They consist of translucent protoplasm with fine interlacing filaments and minute granules are sometimes present. Embedded in this are one or two round nuclei, having the usual intranuclear network. The cells are contained in cavities in the matrix, called cartilage lacun√¶. These cavities are actually artificial gaps formed from the shrinking of the cells during the staining and setting of the tissue for examination. The inter-territorial space between the isogenous cell groups contains relatively more collagen fibres, allowing it to maintain its shape while the actual cells shrink, creating the lacunae. This constitutes the so-called 'capsule' of the space. Each lacuna is usually occupied by a single cell, but during mitosis, it may contain two, four, or even eight cells. =Articular cartilage= Histology of articular cartilage zones. -\\"The work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication.\\" Articular cartilage is hyaline cartilage on the articular surfaces of bones, and lies inside the joint cavity of synovial joints, bathed in synovial fluid produced by the synovial membrane, which lines the walls of the cavity. Though it is often found in close contact with menisci and articular disks, articular cartilage is not considered a part of either of these structures, which are made entirely of fibrocartilage. The articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) has a highly specialized architecture that is zonally organized: the superficial zone consists mostly of collagen II fibers aligned parallel to the articular surface to resist shear forces, whereas the deep zone consists of the same fibers aligned perpendicularly to the bone interface to absorb compressive loads. The biochemical breakdown of the articular cartilage results in osteoarthritis ‚Äì the most common type of joint disease. Osteoarthritis affects over 30 million individuals in the United States alone, and is the leading cause of chronic disability amongst the elderly.

Master Chief is a playable character in the series of science fiction first-person shooter video games Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians and Halo Infinite. The character also appears in Halo books and graphic novelsincluding Halo: The Fall of Reach, Halo: The Flood, Halo: First Strike, and Halo: Uprisingand has minor appearances or cameos in other Halo media. Master Chief is a towering supersoldier known as a \\"Spartan\\", raised and trained from childhood for combat. He is almost faceless and rarely seen without his green-colored armor and helmet. He is commonly referred to by his naval rank rather than his given birth name. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey, in the video games in which he appears. Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch, which called for a Clint Eastwood‚Äìtype character of few words. With each new appearance, the character's visual design undergoes revamping or updates. The Master Chief serves as a mascot for Halo and the Xbox brand. The character has received a generally positive reception; while some critics have described the Chief's silent and faceless nature as a character weakness, other publications have suggested these attributes better allow players to inhabit the character. Criticism of the Master Chief's lessened role in Halo5 led to the developers refocusing on him for the upcoming video game Halo Infinite. Character design Shi Kai Wang's preliminary sketch of the Master Chief in Halo: Combat Evolved The task of developing Master Chief for the character's first video game appearance in developer Bungie's Halo: Combat Evolved (2001) fell on art director Marcus Lehto and Robert Mclees. Eventually, Shi Kai Wang was hired for conceptual art. One of Wang's sketches became the basis for Master Chief, but the initial translation of the drawing into a three-dimensional model looked too slim and anime-inspired. Lehto felt the character needed to feel more like a walking tank, and the design was bulked up. The Chief's armor went through various changes, such as the addition (and later removal) of an antenna, and a green tint. The character's two-prong visor, intended to convey speed and agility, was inspired by BMX helmets. Story writer Joseph Staten recalled that early on in Halos development, they had not considered how to engage players in the world, and Master Chief's character was what drew people in. The Chief was always intended to be a soldier in the last part of a long and bitter war. For much of the game's development, the character had no name, and early on was referred to as \\"Future Soldier\\" or \\"The Cyborg\\". Eric Nylund established the character's forename as \\"John\\" in the tie-novel Halo: The Fall of Reach, but Bungie did not want to use that in the game itself, instead looking to military ranks. Naval ranks grabbed them as \\"different\\" from ones the developers had heard of before. Around 0:17:00‚Äì0:19:00. McLees, insisting on accuracy, wanted to make sure the character still had a plausible rank for his role. \\"Master Chief\\" was the highest non-commissioned rank where the character would still be considered \\"expendable\\"; McLees also felt the shortened \\"Chief\\" felt more colloquial and less like a modern military designation. Though the name was not universally liked and intended to be a placeholder, it ended up sticking. After the success of Halo, Bungie began developing a sequel. According to Mclees, the developers wanted to \\"tone down\\" the look from Halo. In the story, Master Chief's armor receives an upgrade, and the character received a new look he sported for Halo 2 and Halo 3, with added damage and wear and tear included in the high-definition graphics of Halo3. For Halo 4, 343 Industries took over development duties after Bungie spun off from Microsoft as an independent company. Halo4 made extensive use of motion capture for character animation, shooting in a studio that allowed multiple actors to interact. 343 looked for an actor to portray the Master Chief's physicality, while still conveying the emotions of the character. Bruce Thomas portrayed the Master Chief for motion capture sessions, focusing on giving the Master Chief a personality through actions that would be applied to the three-dimensional model; though his face and voice never appear in the final product, Creative director Josh Holmes credited Thomas with strongly influencing all the other performers for the game. The Master Chief's armor was redesigned with the aim of making the player feel like they were inhabiting a character wearing hundreds of pounds of futuristic armor; art director Kenneth Scott emphasized finding a \\"sweet spot\\" where the armor remained familiar but still new. Real-world military vehicles inspired some of the details. The armor of Master Chief and his fellow elder Spartans was intended to look more utilitarian and tanklike, contrasting with the more streamlined look of newer characters. Despite the visual differences between the character's armor in Halo3 and Halo4, the developers intended it to canonically be the same armor. 343 Industries redesigned Master Chief's armor for Halo Infinite, drawing inspiration from his previous looks. Actor Bruce Thomas returned to provide motion capture for the character, as he had in Halo4 and Halo5. =Voice acting= Voice actor Steve Downes at Otakuthon in 2011 Downes, who voices the Master Chief, is a disc jockey and voice actor who had never played video games before Halo. Downes's previous experience with video game voice work was a small part for Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator. During production of Halo, Martin O'Donnell, Bungie's music director, recommended Downes for the part of the Chief based on his experience working with Downes on Septerra. Downes never interviewed for the part, describing his acceptance as a phone call. After Halos success, Bungie briefly considered recasting the role with a celebrity before deciding against a change. Downes believed he came close to losing the role with Halo4 as well. \\"When I did my first 'demo' session for Halo4 in early 2012, I knew it was really an audition to see if I could carry the additional emotional weight that John was going to endure,\\" he recalled. \\"I knew my future as the voice of Master Chief was on the line that day.\\" Downes was more involved with the Halo4 sessions, seeing the script in advance for input and recording sessions in person over a longer duration, with him and Jen Taylor (Cortana) playing their roles in the same space for the first time. For years Downes never appeared at Bungie or Microsoft events and believed the Master Chief was left masked because \\"[the character's identity] is really in the eye of the player.\\" He has called the role the most rewarding of his voice acting career. Attributes Downes's voice for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's character description, which specified a man of few words similar to Clint Eastwood. The actor noted that during recording, he was given creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality. In the early games, Master Chief rarely spoke during player- controlled gameplay, making him an almost-silent protagonist. Even during cut scenes, the character generally spoke sparingly. Bungie's Frank O'Connor described the Chief as \\"so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit those shoes [and] apply their own personality.\\" Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as \\"pretty much the consummate professional. He does his job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her.\\" Joseph Staten felt that a focus on immersion was key to developing Master Chief's personality in the games, as \\"the less players knew about the Chief, we believed, the more they would feel like the Chief.\\" Eric Nylund recalled that some at Bungie wanted the tie-in novel The Fall of Reach cancelled because they felt it gave Master Chief too much of a distinct character. The Master Chief has a close relationship with the artificial intelligence construct Cortana, whom he meets just prior to the fall of the human colony Reach before the events of Combat Evolved. Cortana was created as a game design requirement to guide the character as Master Chief throughout the game world, but she became an important aspect of revealing the Chief's humanity. \\"Over time, Cortana became a fully realized charactera friend and companion to the Chief, not to mention the only person to poke revealing holes in his tough-guy exterior,\\" Staten recalled. The game designers also crafted the player experience of the first game to focus on abandonment and loneliness in many levels, as it reinforced the plot point that many of the Chief's friends were killed before the game began. For Halo 4, 343 Industries consciously decided to treat Master Chief as less of a vessel for the players, exploring the character as a human being facing new challenges and threats. Creative director Josh Holmes described the challenge thusly: > What we were striving for with Master Chief in Halo4 was right in the > middle, and I describe it as a marriage of player and protagonist. There has > to be enough space within the character for you to feel you can inhabit it > as a player. And also, just from the standpoint of personality, Chief is a > stoic character. He's a man of few words. If he speaks too much, it goes > against his innate persona. And yet if we don't have him speak at all, > there's no way to really understand his mind and you can't chart his growth > as a characterhe becomes dull and one-dimensional. Holmes cited the video game Ico as an inspiration for the Chief-Cortana relationship in Halo4, noting that it emphasized how to tell a story without dialogue. In the video games, the Master Chief is rarely seen without his armor. To aid players in identifying with the character, cutscenes tease the character's face, but never fully reveal it; for example, at the end of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Chief removes his helmet, but camera movement hides his head. O'Connor said in an interview that revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character. At the end of Halo 4, if the player beats the game on the highest difficulty, Master Chief's eyes are briefly shown when he removes his helmet. In Halo: The Flood, the Chief is described as tall with short brown hair, serious eyes, and strong features. His skin is unnaturally white as a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor. The Master Chief stands about 7feet (2.13m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450kg) in armor; without it, he stands 6feet, 7inches (2.00m) tall and weighs 287pounds (130kg).Mark MacDonald, \\"Spartan Specs: Under the Chief's hood\\", Electronic Gaming Monthly 225 (February 2008): 26‚Äì27. Appearances =2001‚Äì2007= The Master Chief's backstory is revealed in the 2001 novel The Fall of Reach. Born in 2511 on the human colony world of Eridanus II, John and other selected children are covertly taken from their homes and conscripted by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) into the SPARTAN-II Project. The military and the SPARTAN-II Project's lead, Doctor Catherine Halsey, believe humanity will fall into interstellar civil war without the creation of supersoldiers (the Spartans). John proves a natural leader and leads his fellow trainees over eight years of grueling training and dangerous physical augmentation. Though John and the Spartans would battle human insurgents, a new threat emerged: the Covenant, a collective of alien races determined to exterminate humanity. Though the Spartans prove a tremendous weapon against the Covenant, they are too few to turn the tide in the UNSC's favor. Master Chief first appears in the games with Halo: Combat Evolved. After the destruction of the human stronghold of Reach, Master Chief and the crew of the UNSC ship Pillar of Autumn discover the alien ringworld Halo. Master Chief is entrusted with safeguarding Cortana, the ship's artificial intelligence, as her capture would give the Covenant vital tactical information. While fighting the Covenant, Master Chief and Cortana learn that Halo was created by an ancient race, the Forerunners, as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the Flood. The Covenant accidentally release the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. Learning that Halo's activation destroys all sentient life in the galaxy to prevent the Flood's spread, the Master Chief and Cortana destabilize Pillar of Autumns reactor, destroying it and Halo. The Master Chief and Cortana escape in a spacecraft. In the 2003 novel Halo: First Strike, Master Chief and Cortana pick up survivors from Halo and reunite with Halsey and more Spartans at Reach. Learning the Covenant has discovered the location of Earth, Master Chief leads a preemptive strike against a Covenant fleet. Master Chief returns to Earth in Halo 2 (2004), defending the planet from Covenant attack. Pursuing a fleeing Covenant vessel, Master Chief and the crew of the human ship In Amber Clad discover another Halo ring. Master Chief kills one of the Covenant's leaders, but his position is attacked in retaliation. The Master Chief reawakens in the clutches of the Flood intelligence known as a Gravemind, who forges an alliance between them and the disgraced Covenant commander known as the Arbiter. Revealing the truth of the rings, the Gravemind sends them to stop Halo's activation. Cortana remains behind on the Covenant city of High Charity to make sure the ring is destroyed if activated, while Master Chief pursues the remaining Covenant leader, the Prophet of Truth, as he flees High Charity aboard a Forerunner ship. Truth heads to Earth, intent on activating the Halo Array remotely from a place known as the Ark. During the events of Halo 3 (2007), Master Chief allies with the Arbiter and his troops to stop Truth. After Truth opens a portal to the Ark (a Halo foundry located on the edge of the galaxy) Master Chief and Arbiter pursue him. On the Ark, the Flood-controlled High Charity crashes into the installation; the Gravemind temporarily allies with Master Chief to prevent Truth from activating the Halo Array before betraying them. Master Chief battles through the wreckage of High Charity to rescue Cortana, who activates the replacement Halo being built on the Arkdestroying the Flood while sparing the galaxy at large. While Master Chief and Cortana escape aboard the UNSC ship Forward Unto Dawn, the portal home is destabilized by the damage to the Ark. The section of the ship with Master Chief and Cortana is set adrift in space, while Arbiter lands safely on Earth. =2008‚Äì2015= Master Chief does not appear in the games Halo 3: ODST and Halo: Reach, save for a cameo easter egg in Reach. The character returns as the playable protagonist in 2012's Halo 4\\\\. After years adrift in space, Cortana awakens Master Chief from cryonic sleep as Forward Unto Dawn drifts towards a Forerunner installation, Requiem. Hoping to prevent the UNSC ship Infinity from being drawn into Requiem like them, Master Chief and Cortana attempt to activate what they believe is a communications relay; instead, Master Chief awakens the Didact, a Forerunner who hated humanity and intended to resume his war against them. Master Chief and Cortana pursued the Didact, and Cortana sacrifices herself to stop his attack on Earth. Master Chief reunites with his fellow Spartans of Blue Team in a 2014 arc of the comic series Escalation. During the events of Halo 5: Guardians (2015), Master Chief is contacted by Cortana, directing him to the human colony of Meridian. Disregarding orders, Master Chief and Blue Team head to the planet, leading the UNSC to dispatch another group of Spartans, Fireteam Osiris, to bring them in. Blue Team board a buried Forerunner construct known as a Guardian and are transported to the Forerunner planet Genesis, where Cortana reveals her survival through the Forerunner repository of knowledge known as the Domain. After Master Chief realizes Cortana's new plans for the galaxy would mean authoritarian rule, Cortana imprisons him and Blue Team in stasis as she rallies human AIs to her cause and deploys Guardians around the galaxy as enforcers of her new order. Through the efforts of Fireteams Osiris, Master Chief and Blue Team are rescued, but forced to retreat as Cortana puts her plans in motion. The novel Halo: Bad Blood (2018) details the events immediately following Halo5. =Other appearances= The Master Chief is a major character in the novels Silent Storm (2018), Oblivion (2019), and Shadows of Reach (2020), written by Troy Denning. The character also appears in the 2010 animated anthology Halo Legends, as well as the comics The Halo Graphic Novel, Halo: Uprising, Halo: Collateral Damage, and Halo: Tales from Slipspace. Peter David's graphic novel Helljumpers contains a cameo by the Master Chief \\"before he actually was [the Chief]\\". In the live- action film Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, the character is portrayed by Daniel Cudmore, while the voice is provided by Alex Puccinelli. In the forthcoming Halo television series, the character is played by Pablo Schreiber. The character would have also appeared in the cancelled Halo film. Director Neill Blomkamp said the film would have depicted the character as \\"the most important supporting cast member\\" because of his faceless nature, with \\"other characters around him [doing] most of the emotional heavy lifting\\" and exploring their perception of the Chief. The character appears outside Halo canon. Master Chief appears as a playable character in the Xbox One version of Super Bomberman R. A medieval variation of the Master Chief's armor appears in Fable II, as the suit of armor worn by a legendary hero named \\"Hal\\". Team Ninja approached Bungie and asked to use the Master Chief in their 2006 video game Dead or Alive 4. Although the Chief could not be used due to storyline restrictions, Bungie's interest in the idea resulted in the development of Nicole (Spartan-458). The character is referenced in Rooster Teeth Productions' Halo-based machinima parody series Red vs. Blue. Influences and analysis IGN saw in the Master Chief elements of Jon 6725416, a character in Christopher Rowley's novel Starhammer. Other reviewers have suggested that the name John-117 could be a Biblical reference. Michael Nitsche of the Georgia Institute of Technology found similarity to Gordon Freeman, the protagonist of Valve's Half-Life series of FPS video games: \\"[Both characters] are the independent, individualistic, and often lonely heroes that gain admiration by constantly proving their superiority... in technology-driven, hostile, often closed spaces.\\" Roger Travis, associate professor of classics at the University of Connecticut, compared Master Chief to the epic hero Aeneas, in that both superhuman characters save a civilization by defeating strong enemies in a martial setting. The audience is intended to identify with the protagonist similarly in both stories. Matthew Stover compared Halo to the Iliad, saying both stories share the meta-theme that \\"war is the crucible of character\\". As military science fiction, Halo further raises the issue of being human. Stover argued that, since players are to imagine themselves as the Master Chief, the character is correctly presented as a cyborg, neither a flawless machine nor fully human. Players would be unable to empathize with the former, and the latter would be too specifically developed. This immersion has facilitated the use of the Halo series' multiplayer mode for live digital puppetry, as in Chris Burke's machinima talk show This Spartan Life. Cultural impact =Merchandise= A cosplayer portraying Master Chief at the Atlanta Dragon Con parade in 2011 BusinessWeek listed the Master Chief among several video game characters who have been branded beyond their respective video games, \\"helping them transcend the very medium in the process\\". The Master Chief has been used in marketing on a variety of products, from 7-Eleven Slurpees to T-shirts, controllers to Mountain Dew, and costumes to motorcycle helmets. Several action figures of the character have been created to market of the Halo series, including lines by McFarlane,< Jazwares, 1000toys, and Mega Bloks. One2One collectibles produced 1:2 scale busts of the Master Chief. Marketing for the video games focused heavily on the character of the Master Chief, including \\"The Museum\\", part of Halo3s \\"Believe\\" campaign, the Halo4 live-action trailer \\"Scanned\\", Halo5s Hunt the Truth, and Infinites \\"Become\\" campaign. The heavy merchandising was considered necessary for the game franchise; Ed Ventura, director of Xbox's worldwide marketing, said, \\"We want to be in the hearts and minds of our fans as much as we can.\\" =Reception= In an article in Time, Lev Grossman said the Master Chief represents a \\"new kind of celebrity for a new and profoundly weird millennium\\" and was a symbol of the increasing legitimacy of video games as an art form. IGN, Kotaku, and The Sydney Morning Herald described the Chief as \\"iconic\\". Master Chief has been called the de facto symbol for the Xbox console, Microsoft, and for a generation of gamers. The recognition of the Master Chief has spread to mainstream culture; Madame Tussauds in Las Vegas has developed a wax sculpture of the Chief. At the ceremony, Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy called the Master Chief a hero of the times as much as characters like Spider-Man and Luke Skywalker were for previous generations. Downes realized his character was such a huge hit only after children lined up around the block for his autograph a year after the game shipped. The character has appeared on lists of the best video gaming characters by UGO, Empire, GamesRadar, Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, and Complex,Chad Hunter, Michael Rougeau, The 50 Greatest Soldiers In Video Games , Complex.com, May 25, 2013. and Time. IGN suggested that the dramatic death of the character could be one of the most powerful events in gaming. The faceless nature of the character has alternatively been praised and criticized, with the character called overrated. Writing for The Artifice, Sam Gray argued the character uncomfortably straddled the divide between silent and active protagonist, and the lack of character conflict made him uninteresting. O'Connor noted that given players invest the character with much of his meaning, there is a tension between players who prefer more personality and those who prefer \\"a sort of paragon of useful emptiness\\". The more character-focused portrayal of Chief in Halo4 was positively received. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times called Halo4 a more introspective Halo game, and the first to explore the motivations and emotions of the Master Chief. Reviews that found the game's story otherwise hard to follow praised the focus on fleshing out the character and Chief and Cortana's relationship. Halo 5 received a backlash from fans about Master Chief's reduced role in the story, as he appeared in fewer story missions compared to Fireteam Osiris. Kotaku's Stephen Totilo wrote that the confrontation between Locke and Master Chief felt \\"under-cooked\\", and the plot point of a rogue Master Chief more effectively explored in Hunt the Truth. O'Connor promised the studio would refocus on Chief in future media.

Le Gendre showing \\"Where the Rover's Crew landed\\" (bottom middle of map). The Rover Incident ( or ) occurred on 12 March 1867 when the American merchant ship Rover, captained by Joseph Hunt who was accompanied by his wife Mercy G. Beerman Hunt, and en route from Swatow to Newchwang, was wrecked off the coast of Formosa (Taiwan under Qing rule). The ship struck a coral reef called Chihsingyen near Oluanpi and drifted into the area of Kenting in modern-day Hengchun, Pingtung County, Taiwan. Fourteen American sailors, including Hunt and his wife, were killed by Taiwanese Aborigines in revenge for earlier killings of Kaolut (Koalut/Ku-a-lut/etc) tribe members by foreigners. Subsequently, the U.S. military decided to send a military expedition against the tribe members responsible. American reaction Following the wreck of the United States ship and killing of the surviving crew by aborigines, the American Consul to Amoy Charles William Le Gendre quickly traveled to Foochow, arriving on 2 April 1867, to persuade the governor generals of Fukien and Chekiang to intervene and put pressure on the Chinese authorities in Taiwan to resolve the issue.Yen 1965, pp. 126-127; Carrington, George Williams, Foreigners in Formosa 1841‚Äì1874 (San Francisco: Chinese Materials Center, 1978), p. 153; Dictionary of American Biography, p. 146; The Far East (1877): 88. The governor general of Fukien gave Le Gendre permission to go to Taiwan himself, and wrote him a letter of introduction to take to the prefect of Taiwan, asking him to cooperate with Le Gendre, but adding that \\"if the consul takes measures to manage the case himself, please invite him not to do so, for these savages might give him more trouble that he thinks.\\"U.S., National Archives, Record Group 59, \\"Consular despatches, Amoy,\\" vol. 3 (microfilm no. 100, roll 3), enclosure, \\"Intendant of Circuit of Foochow to the Prefect of Formosa,\\" translation from the USNA and USDC; as quoted in Yen 1965, p. 127. Le Gendre commissioned the United States steamer , under the command of Captain John C. Febiger, in order to visit the scene of the wreck and to try (unsuccessfully) to get foreign officials in Taiwanfoo (capital of Taiwan Prefecture, where he arrived on 18 April) to act. After a subsequent failed punitive expedition carried out by Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell of the United States Navy, Le Gendre again returned to Formosa‚Äîthis time without any reference to his superiors. While in Taiwan, he asserted United States consular authority, selected a deputy consul in north Taiwan, visited the Keelung mines, and gathered information from United States merchants.Carrington 1978, pp. 154, 159; Dictionary of American biography, p. 146; The Far East (1877): 88.

You then instructed me to leave a sergeant and five men on the beach, and to advance with the main body, headed by yourself.

This gave the ships a maximum speed of . The ships were initially armed with two /50 caliberCaliber denotes the length of the barrel. In this case, 50 caliber means that the gun barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter dual- purpose guns mounted in a single turret forward. The extra topweight of the helicopter required the return of the American Mk 33 3-inch gun over the heavier 3-inch/70 caliber guns used on the preceding class. The guns could fire 45 ‚Äì 50 rounds per minute with a lifespan of 2,050 rounds. The guns were placed in a Mk 33 mount. The mounting allowed the guns to elevate from ‚àí15¬∞ to 85¬∞. The elevation rate was 30¬∞ per second and train rate was 24¬∞ per second. The mounts could train 360¬∞. For anti-submarine warfare, the ships were armed with a Mk 10 Limbo mortar. The Limbo was a British-designed three-barrel mortar capable of launching a projectile shell between . Placed on stabilized mountings, the projectiles always entered the water at the same angle. The total weight of the shell was . They also had a Mk.4 thrower with homing torpedoes. Initially the ships were outfitted with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar, and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For sensing below the surface, the class was given one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted active search sonar and one SQS-504 VDS medium frequency active search sonar. For fire control purposes they were given one Mk 64 GFCS fire control with SPG-48 tracker (GUNAR). Close-up of the hangar bay The two Annapolis-class destroyers were built late enough to incorporate the helicopter hangar retrofitted to the St. Laurent class and the \\"Beartrap\\" haul-down device. This allowed the destroyer escorts to deploy with one CH-124 Sea King helicopter. =DELEX refit= The DEstroyer Life EXtension (DELEX) refit was born out of the need to extend the life of the steam-powered destroyer escorts of the Canadian Navy in the 1980s until the next generation of surface ship was built. Encompassing all the classes based on the initial St. Laurent (the remaining St. Laurent, , Mackenzie, and Annapolis-class vessels), the DELEX upgrades were meant to improve their ability to combat modern Soviet submarines,Milner, pp. 277‚Äì278 and to allow them to continue to operate as part of NATO task forces.Gimblett, p. 179 The Annapolis class received the same sensor and communications upgrades that others in the St Laurent family of ships received, including the installation of a new tactical data system (ADLIPS), updated radars and sonars, fire control and satellite navigation. They also received the new Canadian Tactical Towed Array Sensor or CANTASS which was a long-range towed sonar array that was affixed to the stern,Milner, p. 278 which replaced the older VDS. The class also received a new lattice mast. They were given torpedo tubes to allow them to fire Mark 46 torpedoes. However, the Limbo mortar was removed in order to install the CANTASS. This visibly altered the overall appearance of the ships. Construction and career HMCS Nipigon docked at Montreal, Quebec in 1992 Nipigon was ordered in 1958, initially as a repeat Restigouche-class vessel. However, in 1959, the last two repeat Restigouches were altered to incorporate variable depth sonar and a helicopter landing area and became a separate class.Milner, pp. 224‚Äì225 The ship was laid down on 5 August 1960 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel and launched on 10 December 1961.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 261 Her construction was overseen by Cdr Donald Clark CD, who also oversaw the laying-down and commencement of . She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 May 1964 with classification number 266 and with the wife of the then Governor-General Georges Vanier, Madame Pauline Vanier, as her sponsor. She was actually the first vessel to commission in the class. In 1964, the ship escorted the royal yacht on its tour of Canada. On 18 October 1965, a fire broke out in the fuel-handling room, killing one and seriously injuring others. Eight crew members were evacuated to .Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 63 Nipigon awaiting her fate in Rimouski harbour, summer 2003 Nipigon served most of her career with the RCN and later Canadian Forces' Atlantic Fleet. During her service with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT), she was primarily used as a training ship. After the discovery of cracks in the boilers of , all the Annapolis-class destroyers were temporarily taken out of service for an inspection in 1981. However, no cracks were discovered in Nipigon.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 13 In 1982, Nipigon was tasked with searching for and recovering any survivors from Ocean Ranger, a semi- submersible oil platform that had sunk in heavy seas. Nipigons DELEX refit was performed by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, taking place from 27 June 1983 to 22 August 1984 and cost $16 million. On 28 April 1985, the warship shelled and sank the fishing trawler Lady Marjorie after it had been abandoned by its crew and became a hazard to navigation. Initially the decision was questioned, but Nipigon was later cleared by a Canadian Coast Guard report. In June 1985, Nipigon, while participating in naval exercises, suffered structural damage after a stress crack sheared 215 rivets in the vessel's superstructure. The problem was not resolved until 1986. On 27 February 1987, her CH-124 helicopter rescued crewmen from the tug Gulf Gale which had caught fire off Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The ship became the second to have a mixed-gender crew in the Canadian Forces in September 1987. Nipigon underwent another refit, this time at Port Weller, Ontario beginning on 30 August 1988 and lasting to 16 February 1990. In August 1991, the destroyer was deployed to STANAVFORLANT, the standing NATO fleet. In May 1993, Nipigon took part in commemorative events remembering the Battle of the Atlantic in Liverpool and off the Welsh coast. In 1995, Nipigon was deployed into the Atlantic as a guard ship during the Turbot War. In June 1995, the destroyer intercepted the Spanish fishing vessel Patricia Nores, and boarded her just outside Canada's exclusive economic zone. Eleven tonnes of unrecorded turbot catch was found aboard Patricia Nores in a secret compartment.Harris, p. 1880 She was decommissioned from the Canadian Forces on 2 July 1998 and sold for use as an artificial reef. She was sunk in the St. Lawrence River north-east of Rimouski, Quebec on 22 July 2003.

No Chance. (also called Beagle 2: Evolution) was a proposed Mars lander mission to search for life on Mars, past or present. Beagle 3 was the proposed successor to the failed British Beagle 2 Mars lander, with which communication was lost. Beagle 3 was promoted by Professor Colin Pillinger, lead scientist on the Beagle 2. EADS Astrium also played a part in funding and early development of the project. Pillinger dreamed of launching up to two landing craft from an orbiter in 2009 as part of the European Space Agency's Aurora Programme. The putative Beagle 3 would be named after the ship HMS Beagle that took Charles Darwin around the world. After the Beagle 3 project was rejected by ESA in 2004, Pillinger proposed to the NASA to hitch a ride on the Mars Science Laboratory Mars lander, but the proposal was not accepted. One of the goals of Beagle 3 was to support the ESA Aurora programme if chosen.  Proposed payload  * Advanced solar cell technology, meaning two disc-shaped solar arrays (as opposed to the previous four) * A gas analysis package (Gap) to test soil and rock for biosignatures and biomolecules * Powerful X-band (8.0 to 12.0 GHz) antenna for direct vehicle- to-Earth radio link on the vehicle's main shell, to provide real-time descent data. * New lithium-ion battery technology‚Äîto be able to operate at lower temperatures, meaning less power wasted on heating‚Äîa possible 60% capacity boost to that of Beagle 2. * Deadbeat airbags, which inflate just before touch-down, and gently deflate during landing, so that the probe could come to a stop where it lands, and not bounce to a stop. * Life-chips, which detect the presence of amino acids. Impact of Beagle 2 discovery Beagle 2 was found in 2015, which overturned a previous theory that it hit thin air and collided with Mars at high speed, however it was not known for sure because it did not transmit any data during descent. When the Beagle 2 leader tried to raise money for Beagle 3, the EDL system used on Beagle 2 was an unknown. However, after its discovery there was realization that the EDL must have worked as it was found on the surface with several panels deployed, even though it did not transmit. One of the goals of Beagle 3 was to use lessons learned from Beagle 2 to improve the spacecraft, and also take advantage of newer technology. However, since it was not clear what happened to Beagle 2, it was not obvious what should be changed.

It is about 48 km (30 mi) long and 16 km (10 mi) wide, extending WSW-ENE from Eldridge Peak to Mirsky Ledge. The range forms the northeast end of the Horlick Mountains and consists primarily of a large snow-topped plateau with steep northern cliffs and several flat-topped ridges and mountains. The highest point is the summit of Mount Schopf (2990 m). The range was surveyed in 1958-59 by the USARP Horlick Mountains Traverse, and was investigated in 1960-61 and 1961-62 by geologists of the Institute of Polar Studies of The Ohio State University, for which the range is named. The central part of the range is occupied by the Buckeye Table, a plateau, 12 mi long and 2 to 5 mi wide. The feature is a high level snow surface with precipitous northern cliffs; the plateau surface merges gradually with the inland ice to the south. The name, a nickname of the state of Ohio and Ohio State University, was proposed by William H. Chapman, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) surveyor in these mountains in the 1958-59 season. Ohio State University and its Institute of Polar Studies initiated a program of geological investigation in the Ohio Range and the Horlick Mountains beginning in the 1960-61 season.  Features  This range includes the following geographic features: * Bennett Nunataks Two rock nunataks apart, lying 0.5 nautical miles north of Lackey Ridge in the Ohio Range * Discovery Ridge A broad rock ridge with a rather flat summit area which projects NW from Buckeye Table two miles NW of Mount Glossopteris. The name was suggested by William E. Long, geologist of the Ohio State University expedition to the Horlick Mountains in 1960-61 and 1961-62. The first tillite and the first Devonian brachiopods were discovered by the expedition on this ridge, hence the name. * Eldridge Peak A small, mainly ice-free peak, or nunatak, marking the west extremity of the range. Surveyed by the United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) Horlick Mountains Traverse party in December 1958. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Henry M. Eldridge, Antarctic cartographer, Branch of Special Maps, U.S. Geological Survey. * Mount Glossopteris - A mainly ice-covered mountain which may be identified by the exposed horizontal bedding on the north face, located at the NE end of Buckeye Table. The name was proposed by USARP geologist William Long, a member of the Horlick Mountains Traverse party 1958-59, who, with Charles Bentley, Frederic Darling and Jack Long, climbed to the summit in December 1958. Glossopteris is a prehistoric fernlike plant whose imprint was found on rocks of this mountain. * Iversen Peak A peak 3 miles (4.8 km) east-northeast of Urbanak Peak at the northeast end of the range. Surveyed by the USARP Horlick Mountains Traverse party in December 1958. Named by US-ACAN for Frede Iversen, ionospheric physicist at Byrd Station in 1960. * Mirsky Ledge A snow-covered ledge, or shelf-like feature, about NE of Mount Schopf. Urbanak Peak and Iversen Peak rise above the ledge which is the apparent northeast extremity of the Horlick Mountains. The geology of these mountains was investigated by researchers from the Institute of Polar Studies, Ohio State University, 1958-62. The ledge was named by US-ACAN for Arthur Mirsky, Assistant Director of the Institute in that period. * Quartz Pebble Hill A flat-topped elevation on the north escarpment of Buckeye Table. The hill is located where Discovery Ridge joins the main escarpment. The rock that forms the hill is composed of sandstone and quartz pebble conglomerate. The name was suggested by William E. Long, geologist of the Ohio State University expedition, who worked in these mountains in 1960-61 and 1961-62. * Mount Schopf - An elongated, mesa-like, mainly ice-covered mountain located just east of Buckeye Table. Surveyed by the USARP Horlick Mountains Traverse party in Dec. 1958. Named by US-ACAN for James M. Schopf, geologist, Coal and Geology Laboratory, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Columbus, Ohio, who greatly assisted the field geologist by analyzing coal and related rock specimens from this mountain. Schopf was a member of the Horlick Mountains Party in the 1961-62 season. * Urbanak Peak A peak with exposed rock on the north side, situated along Mirsky Ledge. Surveyed by the USARP Horlick Mountains Traverse party in December 1958. Named by US-ACAN for Richard L. Urbanak, meteorologist at Byrd Station in 1960.

He was the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Willowdale from 2003 to 2018. He was a member of cabinet in the government of Kathleen Wynne. He was the longest serving minister of aboriginal/indigenous affairs in Ontario history to date. Background Zimmer was born in Kitchener, Ontario. He attended University of Ottawa Law School and was called to the Bar of Ontario. He first sought elected office as an alderman in Kitchener in the 1970s but was not successful. While living in Kitchener, he was active in the Progressive Conservative Party. When the Kitchener‚ÄîWilmot provincial electoral district was created in 1975, Zimmer served as the founding president of the local PC riding association, and managed the 1981 campaign for the local PC candidate Alan Barron. He left the PC Party and joined the Liberals in 1985 , citing disenchantment with both federal leader Brian Mulroney and provincial leader Frank Miller.\\"PC director bolts ranks for Liberals\\". The Globe and Mail, May 2, 1985, p.8. Zimmer served several prominent legal functions in both the federal and provincial Liberal parties prior to his election. He was legal counsel for Maurizio Bevilacqua in the two year saga following his 1988 election, where the close results were extensively contested in court and was eventually voided by the Ontario Supreme Court.\\"Election result overturned again\\". Toronto Star, December 17, 1988, p.A14. He also chaired the federal party's permanent appeal committee, overseeing numerous appeals during the 1990 leadership contest and from nomination contests prior to the party's victory in 1993. From 1982 to 1984 Zimmer was Director of the Humane Society and from 1993 to 1995 was President of the Alzheimer Society of Canada. He also served as an administrative law instructor in the Law Society's Bar Admission Course. In 1994, Zimmer was appointed by the federal government to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada as its assistant deputy chairman heading the Toronto office, and was shortlisted for the national chairmanship in 1999.\\"Ottawa considers new refugee board chief ; Successful candidate faces declining public confidence in system\\". Toronto Star, Sep 20, 1999, p.1. In 2001, he was appointed chairperson of Toronto's public housing provider, the Toronto Community Housing Corporation. Provincial Politics In the 2003 Ontario provincial election, Zimmer ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Willowdale, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent and sitting Minister of Municipal Affairs David Young by 1,866 votes. The contest, billed in the press as \\"the battle of the Davids\\",\\"Battling Davids don't sling shots\\". Toronto Star, Sep 23, 2003, p.C2. was consider a key race to watch given Young's profile as a possible future PC leader and Willowdale's long history of being represented by prominent PC ministers.\\"Young tries to hold key riding; Willowdale\\". The North York Mirror, 26 Sep, 2003, p.5. Willowdale was where the PC came the closest to retaining a seat within the City of Toronto in 2003. Zimmer fended off a challenge by high profile local councillor David Shiner in 2007,, and was re-elected again 2011, and 2014, increasing his share of vote and margin of victory each time. Between 2003 and 2011, Zimmer served as Parliamentary Assistant to Attorneys General Michael Bryant and Chris Bentley. Between 2011 and 2013, Zimmer served as Parliamentary Assistant to Kathleen Wynne, then Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. He was a member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (2003‚Äì06, 2007‚Äì11, 2012), Standing Committee on Estimates (2006‚Äì07), Standing Committee on Justice Policy (2006‚Äì11), Standing Committee on General Government (2012), Select Committee on Elections (2008‚Äì09), and Select Committee on the proposed transaction of the TMX Group and the London Stock Exchange Group (2011). In 2004, his motion to create an \\"Elder Abuse Awareness Day\\" was passed with support from all parties. He also assisted former Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant with legislation to ban pit bulls in Ontario. In 2006, he sponsored a Private Member‚Äôs Bill which will suspend the driver‚Äôs license of anyone who is convicted of impaired boating. It passed with unanimous consent of all parties in the Ontario Legislature. Zimmer was awarded the Greatest Local Hero Award by the North York Town Crier for his volunteer and community work in Willowdale. In 2005, he received a \\"Social Work Doctors‚Äô Colloquium\\" Award of Merit for his work toward a just and caring society. He has also been cited for work on Ontario Municipal Board reform and the new City of Toronto Act, which gives Toronto greater power to manage its own affairs. During Ontario Liberal Party's 2012-13 leadership election, Zimmer along with Linda Jeffrey, Reza Moridi and Mario Sergio, were the first four caucus supporters of Kathleen Wynne's candidacy, declaring their support at Wynne's campaign launch on November 5, 2012. =Minister of Aboriginal Affairs= In February 2013, Zimmer, who was Premier Kathleen Wynne's parliamentary assistant in the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs and one of her earliest caucus supporters, was appointed by Wynne to her cabinet to succeed herself as the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. Under Zimmer's watch, the aboriginal affairs ministry was able to secure significant, in some case unprecedented, progress on many files, in large part due to the Wynne's personal interest and support in the portfolio and her personal affinity with Zimmer. He oversaw Ontario's Response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including a $250 million investment on a suite of education, health, cultural and social services programs focused on reconciliation and addressing the legacy and negative impacts of residential schools. As part of Ontario's response, in June 2016, his ministerial title was renamed to Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. Zimmer is the longest serving minister for indigenous affairs in Ontario history to date, and was only one of two ministers who serve no other ministerial role while minister. During his tenure, he placed specific focus on the indigenous relationship aspect of his role. He was determined to personally visited as many of Ontario's First Nation Communities as possible, including remote reserves in extremely poor conditions that are difficult to reach. By the end of his tenure, he personally visited 129 of Ontario's 133 First Nations. In the 2018 provincial election, when the Liberal Party suffered its worst result in the party's 161-year history, Zimmer was defeated locally in Willowdale by Progressive Conservative candidate Stan Cho. =Electoral record= References =Notes= =Citations= External links * Category:1944 births Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Ontario Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:People from Kitchener, Ontario ","title":"David Zimmer"},{"id":"1130686","text":"Ami Cusack (born January 25, 1973) is a model and barista who was a contestant on Survivor: Vanuatu and Survivor: Micronesia. She is the former Charitable Director of Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS). Cusack posed for Playboy magazine in 1996. Personal background Cusack was born and raised in Lakewood, Colorado. She is the oldest daughter of Richard and Virginia. Richard is a retired Marine and Naval Aviator, and Virginia, a former substitute English teacher. She attended Golden High School, and the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD) in Lakewood. In 1996, her 18-year- old brother, Kyle, was killed in an accident involving a drunk driver. Since then, her mother has conducted seminars in high schools about the consequences of drinking and driving. Cusack's Survivor: Vanuatu bio states she was dating a woman named Crissy. Her girlfriend also appeared on the show. However, in an interview, Cusack stated \\"I'm not gay. I never was gay. I'm just very openhearted. I was very much in love with Crissy, but things just didn't work out between us. I still love her, and she's my closest friend today.\\" In a 2008 interview with AfterEllen, Cusack also said: \\"Oh gosh, I don't know. I don't know if I would put a specific label on any of it. I mean, if I met the woman of my dreams and fell in love, I would stay with her, and if I met the man of my dreams and fell in love, I would stay with him. Like, I don't know. \\"Bisexual\\" doesn't really seem to fit me, and \\"lesbian\\" doesn't really fit. I don't know. I don't know what I would classify myself [as]. Modeling In the mid-late 1990s Cusack appeared regularly as a model in photospreads and on covers for Muscle Media 2000, the muscle magazine published by her then-fianc√© Bill Phillips. Cusack also worked for Phillips' sports-nutrition company EAS, initially answering phones, and eventually as Charitable Director which she held until 1998, when Phillips sold the company. Cusack can be seen in the promotional video entitled Body of Work, which depicts the ten winners of the first ever \\"Body for Life Challenge\\" in 1997. Cusack also appeared in the book Body-for-LIFE, demonstrating various exercises. Survivor =Vanuatu= In her first season of Survivor, Cusack was the leader of a majority all-female voting bloc. Despite her apparent safety, she became the 13th contestant voted out of the game and the fourth member of the jury when her alliance turned on her. Despite the fact that she was betrayed by finalist Twila Tanner, Cusack still voted for her to win the $1 million prize and title of Sole Survivor over eventual winner Chris Daugherty. =Micronesia= Cusack later appeared on the 16th season of Survivor, entitled Survivor: Micronesia ‚Äî Fans vs. Favorites, which began airing on February 7, 2008. She was one of ten recurring favorites on the Malakal tribe. Prior to the start of the season, Jeff Probst commented on Cusack, \\"Ami will betray you; she'll do whatever it takes to get deeper in the game.\\" Cusack was the eighth contestant to be voted out of the competition.

The Thiel Mountains were named by US-ACAN after Dr. Edward C. Thiel, traverse seismologist at Ellsworth Station and the Pensacola Mountains in 1957. In December 1959, he made airlifted geophysical observations along the 88th meridian west, including work near these mountains.

A 'paradigmatic design' in this sense, refers to a design solution that is considered by a community as being successful and influential. Usually success is associated to market share or some other measure of popularity, but this need not be the case. For instance, the eMate and other Apple Newton devices can be considered as paradigmatic because of their influence in subsequent designs, despite their commercial failure. * As sociological paradigms, a design paradigm is the constellation of beliefs, rules, knowledge, etc. that is valid for a particular design community. Here a paradigm is not a particular solution, but rather the underlying system of ideas that causes a range of solutions to be 'normal' or 'obvious'. A current example is the laptop: as of 2010 the design paradigm of laptops includes a portable computer unit consisting of a QWERTY keyboard, a hinged screen, etc. Moreover, such device is assumed to be helpful in task such as education as in the One Laptop per Child project. While the first meaning of \\"design paradigm\\" refers to exemplary design solutions that create \\"design trends\\", the second meaning refers to what a group of people expects from a type of design solutions. The term \\"design paradigm\\" is used within the design professions, including architecture, industrial design and engineering design, to indicate an archetypal solution. Thus a Swiss Army Knife is a design paradigm illustrating the concept of a single object that changes configuration to address a number of problems. Design paradigms have been introduced in a number of books including Design Paradigms: A Sourcebook for Creative Visualization by Warren Wake, and discussed in Design Paradigms: Case Histories of Error and Judgment in Engineering but never defined by Henry Petroski. This concept is close to design pattern coined by Christopher Alexander in A Pattern Language. Design paradigms can be used either to describe a design solution, or as an approach to design problem solving. Problem solving occurs through a process of abstraction and characterization of design solutions, with subsequent categorization into problem solving types. The approach is akin to the use of metaphor in language; metaphors are used to help explain concepts that are new or unfamiliar, and to bridge between a problem we understand and a problem we don't. Design paradigms then can be seen as higher order metaphors; as the often three-dimensional distillation of a working relationship between parts, between groups of things, between the known and the unknown. In this sense, a bridge is a paradigm of the connection between the known and the unknown, and the functional equivalent of a physical bridge is consequently used in many fields from computer hardware to musical composition. The design paradigms concept has proven so powerful in traditional fields of design, that it has inspired a branch of computer science, where computational analogies to design paradigms are commonly called software design patterns. Importantly however, in design professions the term \\"design pattern\\" usually describes a 2-dimensional structure, whereas the term \\"design paradigm\\" (or model) usually implies a higher order, having 3 or more dimensions.

Parrish played with the Montreal Expos (1974‚Äì81), Texas Rangers (1982‚Äì88), and Boston Red Sox (1988). He also played two seasons in Japan for the Yakult Swallows (1989) and the Hanshin Tigers (1990). Later, he served as manager of the Detroit Tigers (1998‚Äì99). Playing career Making his debut in 1974 at the age of 20, Parrish became a solid hitter as a third baseman in the 1970s and 1980s, hitting 20 or more home runs in a season 5 times during his Major League career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 1979, he was named the Montreal Expos Player of the Year after batting .307 with 30 homers and 82 runs batted in. Parrish is the only Montreal Expos player to ever hit three home runs in one game on three separate occasions (May 29, 1977, July 30, 1978, and April 25, 1980). In the May 1977 game against the Cardinals, he went 5‚Äìfor‚Äì5, batting in 5 runs in a 14‚Äì4 victory. In the April 1980 game, he drove in all 7 runs for Montreal in an 8‚Äì7 loss to Atlanta. In 1982, during his first season with the Texas Rangers, Parrish tied a major league record held by Jim Northrup when he hit three grand slams in the span of one week. Parrish ranks seventh on the Texas Rangers all-time home run list with 149 and eighth in RBIs at 522. He closed out his American Major League career by joining the Boston Red Sox during the stretch run of the 1988 season; while he was with the Red Sox, the team won the American League Eastern Division championship. After his Major League Baseball career ended, Parrish played for two different Japanese major league teams. Parrish had a career .263 batting average in Major League Baseball with 256 home runs and 992 runs batted in. In 13 career playoff games, he batted .182 with no home runs and three RBIs. Coaching career After retiring from the majors and spending time playing for the Yakult Swallows and Hanshin Tigers of the Japanese Central League, Parrish became a full-time coach within the Detroit Tigers organization. In 1992, Parrish was named the manager for the Single-A Niagara Falls of the New York‚ÄìPenn League and won the league championship in 1993. In 1995, he was named the roving hitting instructor for the Tigers minor league system. In 1996, he returned to the dugout as the manager of the Double-A Jacksonville Suns, where he won another League Championship the same year. Parrish then served as bench coach under manager Buddy Bell for the 1997 season and part of the 1998 season before Bell was fired. Parrish was promoted as the replacement and managed the Tigers from 1998‚Äì99, compiling an 82‚Äì104 record; however, he was replaced by Phil Garner for the 2000 season. Parrish managed the Tigers through their final season at Tiger Stadium. Parrish remained in the Tigers organization as a scout from 2000‚Äì2002, and in 2003, he returned to the dugout once again as the manager for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. In 2005, Parrish managed the Mud Hens to an impressive 89‚Äì55 record and the Governors' Cup as champions of the International League. The Mud Hens defeated the Indianapolis Indians. Following the season, Parrish was named the 2005 Minor League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News. In 2006, Parrish led the Mud Hens to a 76‚Äì66 record and a repeat of the Governor's Cup, giving the Mud Hens their third title and making them back-to-back champions for the first time in team history. This time, the Mud Hens defeated the Rochester Red Wings. The team moved on to play in the first Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game, in Oklahoma City, where they would take on the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League. The Mud Hens fell to the Sidewinders by a score of 5‚Äì2. On October 29, 2010, it was announced that Parrish would become the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves, replacing Terry Pendleton, who was moved to first base coach. After the Braves offense went from first in the National League in On-base percentage in 2010 to 14th in 2011 with roughly the same lineup, Braves general manager Frank Wren announced on September 30, 2011 that Parrish would not return to his duties for the 2012 season. Parrish was named manager of the West Michigan Whitecaps for the 2013 season. Parrish was elected to the International League Hall of Fame as a manager in 2013. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that Parrish would return to the Mud Hens for his third stint as manager. He replaced Phil Nevin, whose contract was not renewed. On August 2, 2015, Parrish announced his plan to retire at the end of the Mud Hens' season.

He did not seek re-election in 2000. Yakabuski was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 2003 provincial election, defeating Liberal Derek Nighbor by 595 votes. This result was regarded by some as an upset, as it was the only formerly Liberal seat to be won by the Tories in an election that saw the Liberals elected to a strong majority government. Moreover, the seat had been held for many years by Liberal Sean Conway (Yakabuski's second cousin). However, Yakabuski benefited from a growing social conservative trend in the region. He won the election despite publicizing of his earlier convictions by the opposition press.

The range is composed of Washington Escarpment with its associated ridges, valleys and peaks, the Iroquois Plateau, and the Schmidt and Williams Hills. It was discovered and photographed on 13 January 1956 on a US Navy transcontinental plane flight from McMurdo Sound to Weddell Sea and return. Named by US-ACAN after the Navy 2V-2N Neptune aircraft with which this flight was made. The entire Pensacola Mountains were mapped by USGS in 1967 and 1968 from ground surveys and United States Navy tricamera aerial photographs taken in 1964.  Key mountains  * Astro Peak () is a peak, 835 m, standing 1 mile (1.6 km) off the west end of Berquist Ridge. So named by US-ACAN because the USGS established an astro control station on this peak during the 1965-66 season. * Mount Dasinger () is a mountain, 1,360 m, standing 6 nautical miles (11 km) northeast of Neith Nunatak in northern Neptune Range. Mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1956-66. Named by US-ACAN for Lieutenant (j.g.) James R. Dasinger, U.S. Navy, of the Ellsworth Station winter party, 1958. * Mount Torbert () is a prominent, pyramidal rock peak, 1,675 m, midway along Torbert Escarpment in the Neptune Range. Discovered and photographed on January 13, 1956 on the transcontinental nonstop plane flight by personnel of U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze I from McMurdo Sound to Weddell Sea and return. Named by US-ACAN for Lieutenant Commander John H. Torbert, U.S. Navy, pilot of the aircraft making this flight.  Key geographical features  * Gillies Rock () is an isolated rock lying 6 nautical miles (11 km) north of Mount Dasinger. Mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1956-66.

It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. The cream and ointment are not effective for nail infections. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make sterols. It appears to result in fungal cell death. Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 307th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Terbinafine is mainly effective on the dermatophyte group of fungi. As a cream or powder, it is used topically for superficial skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and other types of ringworm (tinea corporis). Tablets by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or Candida species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the cuticle to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to by mouth administration have been studied. Terbinafine may induce or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy. Side effects Many side effects and adverse drug reactions have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes: * Gastrointestinal problems: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, fullness, abdominal pain, indigestion, dyspepsia, gastritis, cholestasis, flatulence, altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain * Central nervous system or neurological problems: Headaches, dizziness, vertigo, light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles) * Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver damage, liver failure * Immune system problems: Decreased white blood cell counts including pancytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and neutropenia, autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus * Psychological problems: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, increased or unusual dream activity, malaise * Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste (ageusia), decreased taste (hypogeusia) and distorted taste (dysgeusia), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent * Skin problems: Rashes, hives (urticaria), skin irritation, itching, jaundice, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome * Other side effects: Fatigue, increased heart rate (tachycardia), hair loss (alopecia), decreased red blood cell count (anemia), muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia) In 2015 physicians reported that a patient with an MTHFR enzyme mutation (specifically the C677T variant) had developed an adverse reaction to Lamisil (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation. Pharmacology Generic terbinafine hydrochloride pills =Pharmacodynamics= Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to lanosterol. In fungi, lanosterol is then converted to ergosterol; in humans, lanosterol becomes cholesterol. However, there is sufficient genetic divergence between fungal and human squalene epoxidases that terbinafine preferentially binds fungal squalene epoxidase, making it selective for inhibiting ergosterol production in fungi without significantly affecting cholesterol production in humans. This is thought to change cell membrane permeability, causing fungal cell lysis. Terbinafine is highly lipophilic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fatty tissue. Chemistry Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white fine crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. Terbinafine is produced from metathesis of 1,3-dichloropropene and neohexene followed by reaction with N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. History Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is a new treatment approved for use by children age four and up. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat ringworm of the scalp, tinea capitis. In the United States the price in 1999 was $547 for a 12-week course; this fell to $10 by 2015, after the patent had expired.

He developed early hand-powered submarines, the most famous of which was posthumously named for him, CSS H. L. Hunley.  Biography  Horace Lawson Hunley was born in Sumner County, Tennessee to Louisa Harden Lawson and John Hunley. After relocating to New Orleans, Hunley studied law at the University of Louisiana and was admitted to the bar in 1849. He served in the Louisiana State Legislature and practiced law in New Orleans.Duncan (2015), pp. 188‚Äì189. In response to the Union blockade of southern ports the Confederate government offered bounties of up to $50,000 to anyone who sank a Union warship. In the summer of 1861, the Reverend Franklin Smith advocated southern businessmen pursue submarine warfare, in writings to Southern newspapers.Hicks (2014) At this time Hunley joined engineer James R. McClintock and Baxter Watson in building the . In order to prevent her capture, the submarine had to be scuttled during trials in Lake Pontchartrain when New Orleans fell to Union forces in early 1862.Pizzuto (2001) Hunley, with McClintock and Watson, followed by building the . The second submarine was towed to Fort Morgan and attempted an attack on the Union blockade of Mobile. However, the submarine foundered in foul weather and sank in the mouth of Mobile Bay.Sledge (1966), pp. 377‚Äì378. Hunley organized and funded a third submarine, the , by himself. After a demonstration held on July 31, 1863 was successful by sinking an old barge the submarine was transported to Charleston harbor and presented to General P.G.T. Beauregard. Five men from the first crew of H. L. Hunley died during early tests when she was accidentally swamped by the wake of a passing ship through her open hatches; four managed to escape. A second crew was recruited in Charleston. On October 15, 1863, though he was not part of the crew, Hunley decided to take command during a routine exercise. The vessel again sank, and this time all eight crew members were killed, including Hunley himself. The vessel was later raised and used again in 1864 in the first successful sinking of an enemy vessel () by a submarine in naval history. The operation was also fateful for H. L. Hunley, which sank a third time, and for the second time losing all hands.Pizzuto (2001) Horace L. Hunley was buried with full military honors at Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8, 1863.

The twelfth installment in the Kamen Rider Series of tokusatsu shows, it was a joint collaboration between Ishimori Productions and Toei, and it was shown on TV Asahi from February 3, 2002 to January 19, 2003. The series marked the franchise's switch from Columbia Music Entertainment to Avex Group, which continues to produce music for the Kamen Rider Series today. In 2008, Ryuki was adapted into the American television series Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight, the first adaptation of a Kamen Rider Series in the United States since Saban's Masked Rider in 1996. Story were created for thirteen Kamen Riders. They make Contracts with monsters from the mysterious , a parallel dimension opposite to our own in which only the Kamen Riders can exist. The Riders draw on their monsters' strength in exchange for feeding them the life force of the creatures they destroy. The creator of the has only one rule: that there can be only one Kamen Rider. The others must be killed, and the sole victor will be granted a single wish, which leads to a conflict known as the Rider War. All over the city, innocent people are being mysteriously abducted, never to be seen again. During his investigations of these incidents, Shinji Kido ‚Äì an intern at the online news service ORE Journal ‚Äì discovers one of the Advent Card decks at an apartment where every reflective surface has been covered by newspaper. He is soon sucked into the Mirror World, discovering the terrifying truth behind the disappearances: people are literally being pulled through mirrors by the monsters of the Mirror World so that they may feed. He is about to be killed by a powerful dragon named Dragredder when he is saved by a Kamen Rider Knight: Ren Akiyama. Ren seeks to win the Rider War at all costs. He works with a young woman named Yui Kanzaki, who seeks her missing brother: the master of the Rider War, Shiro Kanzaki. Seeing Ren's strength, Shinji enters the Rider War not for the prize, but so that he may protect innocent people from the threat of the Mirror World, and stop the senseless fighting between the Kamen Riders. With Dragredder as his Contract Monster, he becomes Kamen Rider Ryuki. He discovers that there are some people who cannot be saved, and that he must sometimes fight in order to stop the fighting. The extent to which he must go if he want his deepest wish to come true, and the sacrifices that he must make. In the end, there can be only one Kamen Rider.

It features the debut of the thirteenth Kamen Rider in the continuity of Ryuki: Verde. This special was first broadcast on TV Asahi on September 19, 2002. It was later released on DVD on July 21, 2003. The DVD also featured information on the characters, an interview with actor Arthur Kuroda, and an \\"interview\\" with some of the characters. This television special is an alternate telling of the Kamen Rider Ryuki story. Shinji Kido's life, working as an employee at ORE Journal, takes a sharp turn after being pulled into the Mirror World by a Mispider. Luckily, he was saved by a Kamen Rider, Ryuki (Koichi Sakakibara, portrayed by Keiichi Wada). However, Sakakibara could no longer go on due to the severity of his injuries and passed his Card Deck to Shinji, allowing him to become the next Ryuki and defeat the monster. After meeting Yui Kanzaki and Ren Akiyama (Kamen Rider Knight), Shinji learns about the conditions of the Rider War, as well as of the other Riders participating. Unable to allow such a game of death to exist like his Rider predecessor, Shinji sets out to convince all the Riders to end the senseless fighting and put an end to the War. His pleas fall upon deaf ears as just about every other Rider (except for the already-defeated Riders Raia and Scissors) sets out to hunt down Shinji and his eventual reluctant ally, Ren. Eventually, Shinji's deck is destroyed and Ren dies, after passing on the deck for Kamen Rider Knight to Shinji. The special has two different endings which were voted on by the viewers via phone at the time of the initial airing: the voted-for-air ending (in which Shinji faces the surviving Riders on his own) and the alternate ending (a resetting of the Rider War). =Episode Final= is an alternate ending to the series, taking place after the events of episode 46. With only six Riders remaining in the Rider War; Ryuki (Shinji Kido), Knight (Ren Akiyama), Zolda (Shuichi Kitaoka), Ouja (Takeshi Asakura), and Femme (Miho Kirishima); Shiro Kanzaki alerts them to quickly settle the Rider War within three days. One of them must win and become the last survivor before the sixth surviving Rider reveals himself. Amidst the impending chaos of the fight between the Riders, Shinji discovers an unbelievable truth about the relationship between Yui Kanzaki and the Mirror World, as well as discovering the existence of his Mirror World doppelganger, Kamen Rider Ryuga. =Ryuki vs. Kamen Rider Agito= is the Ryuki Hyper Battle Video.

Lafferty served as Registrar for the Northwest Territories Medical Ordinance regulator to professionalize the practice of medicine. he was actively involved in establishing the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and the Canadian Medical Association's Alberta Division, which was later known as the Alberta Medical Association. He served one term as the fifth mayor of the town of Calgary, Alberta from January 20, 1890 to January 19, 1891. Early life Lafferty was born in Perth, Ontario in 1849 and attended local schools. He had seven brothers and four sisters. Three of his brothers became physicians, and his brother Tom became a lawyer and moved to Calgary, Alberta. Education He worked as deputy registrar of titles in Kingston to finance his further education. He graduated from Queen's University medical school in 1871. Lafferty practised medicine for a year in Perth before becoming a senior resident at Ward Island hospital (later Bellevue Hospital) in New York City and at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Lafferty next took a post-graduate course at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, England. Medical career In 1873, he set up practice in Pembroke, Ontario; later that same year, he married Jessie P. Grant. From 1877 to 1880, Lafferty also operated a drug store in Pembroke. In 1880, he was named associate coroner for Renfrew County. The following year, Lafferty was offered the position of chief surgeon for the eastern division of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba later that year. Lafferty and his family had moved to Regina, Saskatchewan by 1885 and then moved on to Calgary in December 1885. In Calgary, Lafferty took on the contracts to provide medical services for the CPR mainline and for the nearby Indian reservation. In 1889, he was a founding member of the North West Territories Medical Association and, in the following year, was elected to the medical council for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the North West Territories. Lafferty served as NWT Medical Ordinance regulator, which included the geographic regions that became the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. When Alberta became a province of the Dominion of Canada, with the passage of the July 20, 1905 Alberta Act in the Canadian parliament, all existing societies or associations that regulated the medical profession, dentistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and others, under the Northwest Territories (NWT) Medical Ordinance, were dissolved. A new entity was formed with the passage of the May 9, 1906Alberta Medical Profession Act , in the newly formed Alberta provincial legislature. Lafferty, who had drafted the medical acts for both newly formed provinces‚ÄîAlberta and Saskatchewan, organized the 1906 meeting which formed the Alberta Medical Association. Later that same year, he organized the first meeting of the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. Lafferty served as Registrar-Treasurer for the college until 1911. From 1907 to 1910, he served as chair of the Provincial Board of Health. He also served as first president of the Calgary Medical Society. Lafferty retired from the practice of medicine in 1909 but served as a hospital inspector from 1909 until 1918 (or possibly later). Banking career Lafferty was also involved in the operation of a chain of private banks in western Canada known as the Lafferty and Smith Banks in partnership with Frederick G. Smith. He left that partnership in 1889 and formed the Lafferty and Moore Bank. In 1893, Lafferty and Moore was acquired by the Bank of Montreal. Political career in federal politics Lafferty ran for the Liberal Party in the provisional district of Alberta in the 1887 Canadian federal election, but lost out to Conservative Donald Watson Davis. Personal life Three of Lafferty's brothers became physicians, and his brother Tom became a lawyer and moved to Calgary, Alberta. His brother Alan Marshall Lafferty (1861‚Äì1947) was a medical practitioner in Lethbridge, Alberta. His sister Janet Lafferty Short (1847‚Äì1934) married the lawyer, James Short of Calgary. Lafferty died on July 29, 1920 in Calgary, aged 71. His July 20, 1920 obituary in the Calgary Albertan, described him as an \\"ebullient, effervescent, entertaining pro westerner [he was] a shrewd judge of character with great drive and persuasion.\\" He was survived by his three sons, Guy, Geoffrey, and Heber and by his two sisters.

Captain Roald Amundsen and his South Pole party ascended Axel Heiberg Glacier near the central part of this group in November 1911, naming these mountains for the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales.

She was married to soldier, writer and public servant Wira Gardiner. Early life Pauline Wayman was born in Christchurch in 1947. She received her education at New Brighton School (1952‚Äì1960) and Christchurch West High School (1961‚Äì1963). After school, she joined the New Zealand Women's Royal Army Corps (NZWRAC) for three years. Member of Parliament Gardiner contested the electorate for National in the against Fran Wilde, the incumbent of the Labour Party. On election night, Gardiner had a lead, but Wilde won when the special votes had been counted. Wilde was elected Mayor of Wellington in 1992, and her resignation from parliament caused the 1992 Wellington Central by-election. Gardiner again contested the seat, but was beaten by Labour's Chris Laidlaw by a vote margin of just over 1%. In the , Gardiner in turn defeated Laidlaw in the new Wellington-Karori electorate. This was the only seat Labour lost at this election, which allowed National to govern with a majority of one. However, in 1995, Gardiner left the National Party to join six other MPs in the establishment of centrist party United New Zealand. Like all United MPs but Peter Dunne, she was defeated in the 1996 election; she contested the Wellington Central electorate, where she came fourth. In 1998 she ran for United in the Taranaki-King Country by election following the resignation of Jim Bolger. She came a distant ninth place with less than 1% of the votes. Interest outside parliament Gardiner is most well known for her campaign against drug abuse. She is particularly critical of New Zealand's harm minimisation policy, which was introduced in 1990, and during this time, the country has become one of the highest users of drugs. Family Gardiner has three children by her former husband Wira Gardiner. Their daughter Ainsley Gardiner is a film producer who became well-known through her 2010 film Boy. She now lives in Whakatane.

History =The beginning of sifting and winnowing: 1892-1932= The Daily Cardinal was founded as a rival to the monthly student paper Aegis, by Monroe, Wisconsin native William Wesley Young, the brother of cartoonist Art Young and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's first journalism student, and William Saucerman. Four hundred free copies of the paper were made available to Wisconsin students on April 4, 1892. For the first month of production, Young rode his horse down State Street to the offices of the Madison Democrat, which printed the Cardinal. The newspaper's name was decided by a vote of university students, \\"Cardinal\\" representing one of the school colors. During the early years of the paper, the founder of the university's journalism school, Willard G. Bleyer, was a reporter and editor as an undergraduate. The experience was formative in his views on the teaching of journalism. While against World War I at its outset, the Cardinal developed favorable attitudes toward the war, especially following the Nov. 11, 1918, armistice. The Cardinal did not initially support the Second World War either, but later added special military sections to the paper to help coordinate the war effort. =Making an impression: 1932-1960= During the Great Depression the Cardinal first earned its reputation for radicalism. Disagreeing with a policy of mandatory military training for male undergraduates to prepare for the impending World War II and running a letter to the editor signed by Junior Women discussing free love led U.S. Senate nominee John B. Chapple to declare that the Cardinal was controlled by \\"Reds, Atheists and free love advocates\\". The UW Board of Regents revoked the Cardinal‚Äôs title as \\"official University newspaper\\" following this discourse and threatened to close the paper down until a compromise added a faculty member and a regent to the Cardinal board. In 1940, the Cardinal moved out of its office east of Memorial Union to a building on University Avenue, on the land where Vilas Communication Hall sits today. In 1956, the Cardinal board donated the land to the university in an agreement stipulating that the Cardinal would enjoy rent-free tenancy in the new building. The Cardinal's offices remain in Vilas Hall today. In 1942, Cardinal founder Young returned to edit the paper for a day. The New York Times wrote on the occasion, \\"Despite annual changes in student staffs, a few college newspapers in the country have acquired a definite character. One of these is the Daily Cardinal of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The Cardinal is proud of its liberal tradition. Because it fights cleanly and with a sense of responsibility, its youthful passion for righteousness does not burn less brightly.\\" =A radical reputation: 1960-1988= During the 1960s, the Cardinal developed a national reputation for its vehement left-wing politics, Mark Lisheron. \\"A campus newspaper war in Wisconsin\\". American Journalism Review (April 1999) strongly protesting the Vietnam War and supporting Civil Rights in its editorials. In 1969, a group of conservative UW students, frustrated by the Cardinal‚Äôs unrelenting liberalism, founded The Badger Herald as a right-wing alternative. Until recently, UW-Madison was one of few American universities with competing daily news publications, though starting in 2014 that competition largely shifted online with the Cardinal cutting Friday editions and the Herald publishing print issues once a week.Abby Becker. \\"New printing model, same standard of excellence\\". The Daily Cardinal, Jan 30, 2014.Tara Golshan. \\"I'm graduating with a degree in the next generation The Badger Herald\\". The Badger Herald, May 7, 2015. The 1970s saw the Cardinal maintain its strong issue advocacy, but opinion began to shift to more campus, rather than national, angles. In the last half of the decade, the paper continually attacked the university for its holdings in corporations that participated in apartheid in South Africa. In 1987 the Cardinal survived a hostile takeover attempt by the Herald when then-president of the Daily Cardinal Board of Directors David Atkins conspired with Herald Publisher Richard Ausman to hire Herald staffers for Cardinal leadership positions and eventually merge the papers.Rogers Worthington. \\"Tussle between college papers is not just academic\\".

Westminster, MD: Heritage Books, 2007. =Strife and shutdown: 1988-1995= In the beginning of the difficult stretch for the Cardinal, in 1988 the university announced it would shut down the paper's presses, then located in Vilas Hall. Fortunately for the Cardinal, the university decided to sell the presses to UW‚ÄìExtension, which remained the Cardinal‚Äôs printer for the next five years. Today, the Cardinal is printed at Capital Newspapers. In 1995, the Cardinal was forced to stop printing due to financial issues, suffering a seven-month shutdown until the necessary funds were secured to return to publication. =The Cardinal reborn: 1995-= The Cardinal returned to campus later that year with a cover depicting a cardinal rising from ashes like a phoenix. The paper repaid its remaining debts two years to the day of the shutdown. In 2000, the Cardinal broke the story that university officials had digitally inserted a black student's face into a photograph of white Badger football fans. The image had been used on the cover of Wisconsin's 2001-02 undergraduate application. The story received the 2001 Diversity Story of the Year award for student journalism,Associated Collegiate Press. \\"2001 ACP Story of the Year \\". awarded by the Associated Collegiate Press and the Los Angeles Times.

A commander may disdain the enemy, and believe his own invincibility, leading his troops to disaster. That commander may employ strategies that, if effective in earlier combats or maneuvers, prove catastrophic against a new or smarter enemy. The commander afflicted by \\"victory disease\\" may also fail to anticipate that a new enemy may use tactics different from those of old enemies. An overconfident commander may disregard military intelligence that would enable the commander to realize that new tactics are needed. Though \\"victory disease\\" does not inevitably foretell defeat, it often precedes it. The term is also applied outside the military world in areas such as psychology, business, or marketing. Origin The origin of the term (, in Japanese) is associated with the Japanese advance in the Pacific Theater of World War II, where, after attacking Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japan won a series of nearly uninterrupted victories against the Allies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Much of Japan's arrogance is attributed to the performance of Admiral Matome Ugaki. From overriding decisions to ignoring the evolving conflict in the Pacific, Ugaki's tactics incited tension and doubt in other Japanese military personnel before the Midway operation. Although the Japanese had planned to establish a perimeter and go on the defensive, victories encouraged them to continue expanding to an extent that strained logistics and the navy. This culminated in the Battle of Midway in 1942, a catastrophic defeat of the Japanese navy. All four Japanese aircraft carriers involved were sunk, and the hitherto unstoppable Japanese advance was blunted. History =Pre-modern= * The hubris of Xerxes I led to a catastrophic defeat of the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Salamis, which occurred in 480 BC. This was the turning point of the Greco-Persian Wars and the ancient Greeks, who the Persians were opposing, eventually won. The ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus fought in the battle; he wrote the play The Persians in which the Battle of Salamis is a setting. * In 1415, at the Battle of Agincourt, the English were outnumbered by a factor of four to three, but the disorganization of French knights, as well as superb quality longbows, were the underlying circumstances which led to the English overcoming the odds and annihilating the French. * The overconfidence and lack of preparation led to the disastrous defeat of the English, led by Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn to the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce. * The Spanish naval assault on England in 1588 suffered the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Similarly, English overconfidence the following year led to the disaster of the English Armada. =19th century= * The calamitous decision by Napoleon to invade Russia in 1812 led to the return of only 10,000 French soldiers when 610,000 had initially been sent out. Napoleon's repeated victories in Central Europe led him to believe that Russia would surrender after a few won battles, and made no plans for a sustained campaign or occupation in Russia. *The first six weeks of the Franco-Prussian War saw French armies, convinced of their superiority following French victories in the Crimean War and the wars of Italian unification, enter a war with Prussia believing that their weapons and tactics would easily defeat the Prussians. However, the Prussians had better weapons and tactics, and this led to catastrophic French defeats at Sedan and Metz. * United States victories against Mexico and American Indians led Union forces to be overconfident going into the Civil War. Failing to update their tactics to match new technology, such as rifling of firearms and the use of the Minie ball as ammunition, they assumed that superior numbers would give them rapid victories, and ignored plans for an extended war until after repeated defeats. * Confederate decisions made at and before their loss at the Battle of Gettysburg, after their outnumbered-five-to-two victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville during the American Civil War. * Captain and Brevet Lt. Col. William J. Fetterman boasted during America's Indian Wars that, given \\"80 men,\\" he would \\"ride through the Sioux nation\\". He had contempt for the Sioux's fighting ability and overconfidence in his own military prowess. In 1866, during Red Cloud's War, he and his army of exactly 80 men (including two volunteering civilians) were massacred to the last man by a combined force of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho. It was possibly the worst army defeat on the Great Plains until eclipsed by the disaster at Little Bighorn ten years later. * The 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne annihilated five companies of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and severely mauled six others. Expecting a repeat of the Battle of Washita River, Custer ignored contrary intelligence or did not seek it out. * In the 1879 Battle of Isandlwana, during the Anglo-Zulu War, a Zulu army wiped out a British army equipped with the most advanced weapons and tactics of the age. This victory at Isandlwana led a previously unengaged Zulus unit, Undi Corps under Prince Dabulamanzi kaMpande, to believe they would easily wipe out the British defenders in the Battle of Rorke's Drift with ferocity and sheer numbers and so attacked the location in violation of orders from King Cetshwayo kaMpande. Instead, the British, who used sensible tactics and concentrated their firepower as much as possible, won the battle and killed approximately 370 Zulu men. =20th century= * The battles of Cer and Kolubara during the First World War were considered disastrous defeats for the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, whose overconfidence and underestimation of the Serbian Army eventually led to a two-year delay in the Serbian Campaign. *The Battle of Pingxingguan during the Second Sino-Japanese War between Japan and China. After a series of easy victories against their opponents, the overconfident Japanese failed to take elementary precautions. * The catastrophic decision by Hitler to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 underestimated Soviet military resilience and counted on the success of the tactics used in previous campaigns, such as the Invasion of Poland and the Battle of France. Confident of victory, the Germans did not count on getting caught in a Russian winter or rasputitsa (mud season). As a result, the German offensive in the Soviet Union was halted on December 5, 1941. * Japan's decision to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. This followed wins in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War, and early victories during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As it turned out, the attack appeared tactically successful, but strategically disastrous with US Pacific Fleet damaged to a relatively superficial degree, with its carrier groups out at sea while vital shore base facilities were ignored in the attack such as its fuel storage, whose destruction could have crippled fleet operations for months by itself. More significantly, with the corresponding Japanese diplomatic communication being too slow to process and present to the American government until after the attack began, the attack, intended in part to demoralize the Americans, provoked instead an infuriated retaliation that would ultimate defeat Japan. * Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, believed that during the Suez Crisis, the Egyptian Armed forces had defeated the combined forces of Israel, the United Kingdom and France, when in reality it was the pressure from the United States which was the decisive factor. This gave Nasser an inflated view of the strength of his forces, so when the Six Day War started, he believed that Egypt would be able to defend itself against Israel's advance. However, this overconfidence, as well as false \\"victory\\" reports which brought Jordan and Syria into the war, proved to be its downfall as Israel managed to defeat the Arab forces and conquered their territory as well.

The full names for the term are, in , , . Selsoviets were the lowest level of administrative division in rural areas in the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they were preserved as a third tier of administrative- territorial division throughout Ukraine, Belarus, and some of the federal subjects of Russia. A selsoviet is a rural administrative division of a district that includes one or several smaller rural localities and is in a subordination to its respective raion administration. The name refers to the local rural self-administration, the rural soviet (council), a part of the Soviet system of administration. A selsoviet was headed by a chairman, who had to be appointed by higher administration. For a considerable period of Soviet history, passports of rural residents were stored in selsoviet offices, and people could not move outside their area of residence without the permission of selsoviet. Selsoviets in Russia Division into selsoviets as administrative-territorial units remained after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in many of the federal subjects of Russia. In modern Russia, a selsoviet is a type of an administrative division of a district in a federal subject of Russia, which is equal in status to a town of district significance or an urban-type settlement of district significance, but is organized around a rural locality (as opposed to a town or an urban-type settlement). In some federal subjects, selsoviets were replaced with municipal rural settlements, which, in turn, were granted status of administrative-territorial units. Prior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, this type of administrative division had a uniform definition on the whole territory of the Russian SFSR. After the adoption of the 1993 Constitution, the administrative- territorial structure of the federal subjects is no longer identified as the responsibility of the federal government or as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the federal subjects.\\"–≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞\\". –°—Ç–∞—Ç—å—è \\"–ê–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ\\". –°–æ—Å—Ç. –ê. –ê. –ò–∑–±—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤. ‚Äî –ú–Ω.: –ò–∑–¥. –í.–ú. –°—É—Ä–æ–≤, 2001. This state of the matters is traditionally interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions are the sole responsibility of the federal subjects themselves. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another; that includes the manner in which the selsoviets are organized and the choice of a term to refer to such entities.

The games were very popular in Ancient Rome, and usually put on after longer pantomime plays. The origin of the Atellan Farce is uncertain but the farces are similar to other forms of ancient theatre, such as the South Italian Phlyakes, the plays of Plautus and Terrence, and Roman mime.J. Trapido The Johns Hopkins University Press, Educational Theatre Journal Most historians believe the name is derived from Atella, an Oscan town in Campania. The farces were written in Oscan and imported to Rome in 391 BC. In later Roman versions, only the ridiculous characters read their lines in Oscan, while the others read in Latin. History and surviving evidence The Atellan Farce was a masked farce that originated in Italy by 300 B.C.and remained popular for more than 500 years. Originally, the farces were improvised and not recorded. Evidence of the original forms is scarce, primarily found in the depictions of scenes and characters on ancient vases. The extant literary evidence contains only fragments of the Atellan Farce with 400 lines and the titles of approximately 115 farces are recorded from the first century B.C. by the dramatists Lucius Pomponius and Quintus Novius. With the evidence that does remain, historians believe the plays were between 300 and 400 lines and lasted from 15 to 28 minutes. Surviving titles indicate that the Atellana or short sketches were meant to entertain the audience on holidays and market days. The names of some of these extant titles include \\"The Farmer\\", \\"The She-goat\\", \\"The Woodpile\\" and \\"The Vine-Gatherers.\\" W Beare \\"Quintilian VI lii 47 and the Fabula Atellana\\" The Classical Review, vol 51, no 06, 1937, pp 215- 218 While the actors in Atellan Farce were known to be Oscan, evidence of language-switching from Oscan to Latin is evident in a literary Atellana.W Beare \\"Quintilian VI lii 47 and the Fabula Atellana\\" The Classical Review, vol 51, no 06, 1937, pp 213- 215 We can also surmise that the plots of the sketches included ridiculous situations consisting of puns, horseplay and riddles of a vulgar and crude nature.J Adams \\"A Passage of Varro, De Lingva Latina and An Oscan Fragmen of Atellan Farce.\\" Mnemosyne, vol 57, no3, 2004, pp 352- 358 Stock characters and origins Some of the hypothesized stock characters included: * Maccus Believed derived from either the Greek term makkoan, meaning \\"to be stupid\\" or the Greek prefix mac-, that denotes greed. The character Maccus makes the most appearances of all stock characters in the works of Pomponius and Novius and includes the play Maccus The Maid where confusion ensues from \\"twin subjects.\\" Maccus was a most popular clown and the leading character in many Atellan plays including The Fool, as a hunchback with a beak nose. * Buccus Although the origin of this name is not definitely known, the Italian word bucca, meaning \\"cheek\\" or \\"mouth\\" is a common consideration. and infers a \\"country booby\\" \\"fat- cheeked, gluttonous braggart.\\" * Manducus Deriving from the Latin for \\"The chewer\\", Manducus is a hypothesized stock character that does not appear in any of the surviving titlesJ.Trapido The John Hopkis University Press, Educational Theatre Journal Possibly Manducus and Dossennus are the same character and Manducus is simply the description for Dossennus. as the arrogant soldier. * Pappus The name is considered derived from the Greek pappos meaning \\"grandfather.\\" Pappus was easy to deceive often falling victim to either his daughter or wife, the character appears in five extant plays. Pappus is the only character from Atellan Farce that has a name of Oscan origin as the P. Hartnoll, P. Found, Oxford University Press, The Oxford Concise Companion to The Theatre old man. * Centunculus The name of a comic slave. * Dossennus The origin of the name Dossennus is believed to have originated from the word dorsum or \\"back\\" as the character was hump backed as the pompous doctor or \\"hump backed, crafty cheat.\\" J. Trapido, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Educational Theatre Journal The characters may have connections to similar roles in Commedia dell'arte and Punch and Judy. Both Atellan Farce and Commedia were improvised masked comedies. Stock characters in Atellan Farce are speculated as the beginnings of the Commedia dell'arte stock characters. For example, theorized character progressions include: * Pappus ‚Üí Pantalone * Maccus+Buccus ‚Üí Pulcinella * Manducus ‚Üí il Capitano However, these connections remain speculative and are contested in ongoing research. There are similarities between Punch and the Commedia dell'arte character Pulcinella, however, there is no consensus that Punch's derivation can be traced back to Pulcinella. The character Cicirrus, the Oscan word for \\"gamecock\\", is thought to be a stock character.J. Trapido The Johns Hopkins University Press, Educational Theatre Press Authorship The subjects and characters were decided upon just before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens who were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were supplemented by songs in Saturnian metre, the common language, accompanied by lively gesticulation. The plays were characterized by coarseness and obscenity. Atellan play acting contained much pantomiming. All roles were played by males. The plays did not have elaborate scenery and were performed in normal theaters.j. Trapido The Johns Hopkins University Press, Educational Theatre Journal Atellan plays first became popular in Rome in the 3rd century B.C, with a revived popularity in literary form in the 1st century B.C. and included the stock characters in written verse. Later, the dictator Sulla wrote some Atellan Fables. The dramatist Quintus Novius, who lived and wrote 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote fifty fables, including Macchus Exul (Exiled Macchus), Gallinaria (The Henhouse), Surdus (The Deaf One), Vindemiatores (The Harvesters), and Parcus (The Treasurer). When the Atellan plays were revived in the 1st century B.C. professional actors were no longer excluded from playing the stock characters' roles.J. Trapido The Johns Hopkins Press, Educational Theatre Journal Lucius Pomponius of Bologna, influenced by Palliata Fabius Dorsennus composed several Atellan plays, including Macchus Miles (Macchus the Soldier), Pytho Gorgonius, Pseudoagamemnon, Bucco Adoptatus, and Aeditumus. Quintus Novius and a \\"Memmius\\" also authored these comedies. Ovid and Pliny the Younger found the work of Memmius to be indecent. Pomponius is speculated to be the \\"founder\\" of the Atellan Farce plays. Controversy and suppression Taken from Tacitus ( Annals, Book 4): \\"...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor Tiberius finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players. 'They had often,' he said. 'Sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority'. The players, upon this, were banished from Italy\\". Suetonius ( Tiberius, 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying \\"the old goat lapping up the doe\\" (hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire) became popular. In the 20s AD, the growth in popularity and revival of the Atellan plays met the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators. The performances became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all who performed in the farces were banished from Italy. The Augustan History records that Hadrian furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.HA Hadrian 26. Contemporary comparisons Due to the outlandish nature and brevity that the Atellan Farces are believed to have, they are comparable to the sketches that one would see on a variety show such as Saturday Night Live or Whose Line Is It Anyway? D Nardo The Greenhaven Encyclopedia of Ancient Rome, San Diego, California, 2002, pp 39- 351, Greenhaven Press Oftentimes the improvised play would center on an uncomplicated situation such as eating too much, becoming intoxicated or stealing. Such as in popular television shows as Saturday Night Live and Whose Line Is It Anyway, they would include adult content and done for the entertainment of others.

Klimavichy is located east of Mogilev on the bank of Kalinica River and is the administrative center of the Klimavichy District since 1924. As of 2009, its population was 17,064. History First references in historical documents are dated by 1581 in relation to M≈õcis≈Çaw Voivodship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was granted city status in 1777, and a Coat of Arms in 1781. According to the census of 1897, the city had 4,714 inhabitants. 50.2 percent were Orthodox, 47.9 percent Jews and 1.5 percent Catholics. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II on August 10, 1941 and liberated in October 1943. In January 1939, there were 1,693 Jews in the village. There was a Yiddish school until 1938. The majority of the Jews were merchants. There were 4 executions of Jews in Klimovichi. At the end of August 1941, 13 Jews were arrested, taken to the Jewish cemetery in order to dig a pit. They were shot there afterwards. The second execution took place on November 6, 1941. Some Jews were sent to work and the remaining Jews were gathered in a garage near the hospital. Germans took their valuables. The Jews were then displaced near the airport, not far from the village of Dolgaya Gora and were shot by Germans and local policemen. On the same day, the Jews who were sent to work were shot at the same location. According to some sources, between 750 and 900 Jews were killed on that day. After this massacre, 80 Jews remained alive. They were concentrated in one house. At the end of November 1941, these Jews were forced to walk to Melovaya Gora and were shot. In April 1943, the children from mixed-families were imprisoned by the Germans and were shot on April 12, 1943.http://yahadmap.org/#village/klimovichi-klimavichi-mogilev-belarus.654 The city and especially its raion heavily suffered during the Chernobyl disaster.

The Ross Sea extends much further south‚Äîas far as the Gould Coast, some from the South Pole‚Äîbut most of that area is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf rather than open sea. Discovery and naming Ernest Shackleton named the feature on January 24, 1908, during the Nimrod Expedition, because of the large number of whales seen near this location.

Depending on the context, this may be seen as consensual body modification, or non-consensual genital mutilation. The term can also refer more generally to anything that renders a male less masculine. Genital modification and mutilation =In history= Europe In Medieval Europe, emasculation was used as a form of punishment. It was sometimes done when a person was hanged, drawn and quartered, a form of execution by torture. In 19th-century Russia, the Skoptsy sect of Christianity performed emasculation, which they termed the \\"greater seal\\". East Asia In ancient China, emasculation was performed as a punishment up until the Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty. Additionally, some men underwent the procedure as means of becoming employed as an imperial servant or bureaucrat. In English, the word eunuch is generally used to refer to these Chinese people who underwent emasculation, and they are often referred to as having been \\"castrated\\" rather than \\"emasculated\\". As of the Qing dynasty, emasculation was still performed in China. Zheng He, a Ming dynasty noted admiral of the imperial navy was castrated as a boy. In the 19th century, the surviving sons and grandson of rebel Yaqub Beg were punished by being emasculated and enslaved. The last Imperial eunuch was Sun Yaoting, who died in 1996. For more information on emasculation in China, see Castration in China. The ancient Vietnamese adopted China's practice of emasculation and the use of eunuchs as servants and slaves for the monarchy. The procedure was reportedly very painful as both the testicles and penis were removed. In 1838, Minh M·∫°ng, Emperor of Vietnam, made a law that said only adult men of high social standing could be emasculated. In the end, most eunuchs ended up being men who had been born with genital abnormalities and then handed over to the authorities. During the late 19th century, the French used the existence of eunuchs in Vietnam to degrade the Vietnamese. For more information on emasculation in Vietnam, see Castration in Vietnam. The Khitan people of northeast Asia also adopted the Chinese practice of emasculating slaves. Middle East and Africa In the Arab slave trade, enslaved men and boys from East Africa were often \\"castrated\\" by removing both the penis and testicles. =In the modern day= On the Indian subcontinent, some members of hijra communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called nirwaan and seen as a rite of passage. In the United States, males in the Nullo subculture voluntarily undergo emasculation. Perpetrators of wartime sexual violence often seek to cause harm by weaponizing ideas of gender and sexuality against their victims. =In the Bible= In the Old Testament: : No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the . : ‚Äî Deuteronomy 23:1 (ESV) :(\\"...shall not enter the assembly of the Lord\\" is claimed by rabbis to mean that he cannot marry a daughter of Israel.)Shulchan Aruch, Eben ha-Ezer 5:1 Other meanings By extension, the word emasculation has also come to mean rendering a male less masculine, including by humiliation. It can also mean to deprive anything of vigour or effectiveness. This figurative usage has become more common than the literal meaning. For example: \\"William Lewis Hughes voted for Folkestone‚Äôs amendment to Curwen‚Äôs emasculated reform bill, 12 June 1809...\\"Thorne R. (1986) History of Parliament online. Accessed 12 April 2017 In horticulture, the removal of male (pollen) parts of a plant, largely for controlled pollination and breeding purposes, is also called emasculation.

Its major regional centre is Rockhampton. The region extends from the Capricorn Coast west to the Central Highlands at Emerald, north to the Mackay Regional Council southern boundary, and south to Gladstone. The region is also known as Capricornia. It is one of Australia's main coal exporting regions. At the 2011 Australian Census the region recorded a total population from the six local government areas of 233,931. Industry Mount Morgan, 1903 Economically, Central Queensland is an important centre of primary industries, particularly for food and fibre production. Central Queensland includes the Bowen Basin which is rich in high quality coking coal, the Port of Gladstone produces 40% of the state's export earnings, the Fitzroy River is the second-largest river system in Australia and commands significant water resources such as Fairbairn Dam. Gladstone has a significant aluminium smelter. =Beef= Rockhampton is claimed to be the beef capital of Australia, a title which is disputed by Casino in New South Wales. Beef production in the region is centered on Brigalow and speargrass land types. There are three abattoirs in the region. Every three years, Rockhampton holds the national Beef Australia exposition to celebrate the cattle industry as well as to facilitate trade opportunities for Australian beef producers.About Beef Australia, Beef Australia website. Accessed 10 December 2017. =Mining= Sapphire, 2012 Central Queensland is one of the world's leading producers and exporters of black coal. Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to discover coal deposits in the region in 1845. In the 2011-2012 financial year the region produced 40% of the state's total coal production. Coal is extracted from the Bowen Basin and transported to port facilities at Port of Gladstone via the Blackwater railway system or to both Hay Point and Abbot Point via the Goonyella railway line. Coal mining is expanding west into the Galilee Basin and requires an extension of the Goonyella line to transport coal to port. Many mines in the region, particularly those within the Fitzroy River basin, were severely impacted by flooding during the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. Gold, silver, limestone, coal seam gas, magnesite and gemstones are also mined. Sapphires were discovered here in 1875. Gold was discovered in the Mount Morgan region around 1865. Mount Morgan Mine has since gone on to become one of Australia's richest mines. Purpose built mining towns in Central Queensland include Dysart, Middlemount, Moranbah, Mount Morgan and Moura. Three mining disaster have occurred at Moura since 1975, resulting in the loss of 36 lives. =Citrus canker outbreak= In 2004, an orchard on Evergreen farm was the site of the first detection of citrus canker in Central Queensland. A significant part of the citrus growing industry was devastated when a total of of crop had to be destroyed so the disease would not spread across the country. In 2005 several fresh outbreaks were reported so the eradication expanded to include private backyard trees. The outbreak's cause has not been fully explained despite a federal inquiry. In 2009 authorities from the Government of Queensland declared the eradication program complete. Protected areas Carnarvon Gorge from Boolimba Bluff, 2010 Mount Castletower and Lake Awoonga The region contain 33 national parks. Great Keppel Island has been an island tourist attraction since the 1960s. It and several other islands in the area are surrounded by coral reefs. In the west of the region is Queensland's central highlands and the Carnarvon Gorge, which is protected within the Carnarvon National Park. Carnarvon Gorge features white sandstone cliffs, steep-sided gorges a diverse range of significant plant and animal species and many walking tracks. Kroombit Tops National Park provides habitat for the endemic Kroombit tinker frog. Deepwater National Park is good place for turtle watching. From November to March three species of turtle lay their eggs on beaches protected within the park. Communities For this purpose the area of Central Queensland was restricted to the areas encircled by the Dawson Highway between Gladstone and Springsure; the Gregory Highway between Springsure and Clermont, and the Peak Downs Highway between Clermont and enters North Queensland via Mackay - extended right to the eastern coastline. Major cities in the region are Emerald, Gladstone and Rockhampton. Some communities on the Capricorn Coast include Byfield, Yeppoon, Great Keppel Island, Emu Park and Cawarral.

Early life Ignacio Jord√† Gonz√°lez was born in Matar√≥ (Barcelona) in Catalonia, Spain. His nickname, Nacho, is the common nickname for Ignacio. When he was young, Jord√† moved with his family to Valencia, where part of his family originated. His family was wealthy, but ended up losing their money in the 1987 stock market crash. At 14, Vidal quit school to work to help his family. As a teenager, he was in a punk band. He also was a boxer and enlisted in the Spanish Legion in Melilla. Career In 1994, Vidal started working in the live porn club Bagdad of Barcelona, where he performed live sexual acts with his girlfriend, Sara Bernat (born 1976). There, he met the director of the Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival, Jos√© Mar√≠a Ponce, who introduced him to porn films. Vidal became a prot√©g√© of Rocco Siffredi, who brought him to Hollywood in 1998. Vidal has starred in over 1,500 movies; he has also produced and/or directed many others (since 2000, including gay titles for the Evil Angel video company). Although self-stated as heterosexual, he has directed gay porn films. Vidal has starred in Spanish mainstream movies and TV shows, including the Spanish TV series Los Simuladores and the Spanish movies Va a ser que nadie es perfecto, El Alquimista Impaciente and Imp√°vido. Legal problems On 16 October 2012, Vidal and his sister Mar√≠a Jos√© Jord√° Gonz√°lez were arrested in Barcelona, suspected of involvement in money laundering and tax evasion on behalf of Chinese organized crime. When Spanish police raided over 100 businesses in Madrid and Barcelona suspected of running money-laundering and tax evasion rackets in connection with the Chinese mob, Vidal and his sister were among the approximately 80 detained. Hundreds of police were involved in serving \\"warrants to search 120 properties belonging to those suspected of laundering money from prostitution and extortion.\\" While prosecutors sought to hold Vidal in jail during the investigation and subsequent trial, on 19 October 2012, National Court Judge Fernando Andreu accepted the defense's contention that, \\"Vidal is not a flight risk because he signed a contract to participate in a reality show for the next three months.\\" Upon his no-bail release, Vidal announced, \\"Thanks to everyone for their support. I've gone without any charge.\\" Vidal's movie studio Nacho Vidal Productions was implicated in the Spanish National Court led sting and charged with counts of flight of capital and tax evasion. The newspaper El Pa√≠s described Vidal as \\"one of the high[est]-profile suspects arrested\\" and explained that he was accused along with his sister of helping the ring \\"by issuing false invoices from his movie production company.\\" Vidal claimed he was innocent. On 4 June 2020, Vidal was arrested on manslaughter charges in relation to the death of a fashion photographer, Jos√© Luis Abad in July 2019. Abad died as a result of inhaling venom from the bufo toad, in a traditional ritual where Vidal is alleged to have acted as Shaman. Vidal was arrested together with two other unnamed individuals, a member of his family and an employee. Personal life Vidal has stated that he is open-minded, but is heterosexual in his personal life. He had his first daughter with Venezuelan Rosa Castro Camacho.Rosa Castro: \\"Si nos pasa algo, a m√≠ o a mi hija, ha sido Nacho Vidal\\" (Rosa Castro: \\"If something happens to me or my daughter, it's Nacho Vidal's fault\\") On 31 May 2005, Vidal announced his retirement from pornography and married Colombian model Franceska Jaimes. They moved to a mansion previously owned by his family, located in the small town of Enguera, in Valencia, recovering it after his family's financial losses. He and his wife decided to start a family there. However, the couple separated six weeks later, and Vidal returned to porn only a few months after announcing his retirement. They have two children, and divorced in 2015. In February 2019, a Spanish newspaper stated that Nacho Vidal has HIV. Later that year, in a 12-minute YouTube video, he clarified that his test was a false positive. What he does have, he found after visits to a series of doctors, is Reiter's syndrome, a highly painful, sometimes chronic or lifelong, reactive arthritis. This inflammatory syndrome is often triggered by a prior, treatable infection which may itself resolve (be healed). In Vidal's case, he explains, it was repeated infections by the STDs chlamydia and gonorrhea contracted during his sex work, each instance having been quickly treated and cured. Because of the disease he cannot work and is seeking disability benefits.

SACO gave substantial loans to Giesche‚Äôs Erben by selling $15,000,000 collateral trust sinking fund bonds that would mature on August 1, 1941. Giesche was that part of the holdings of the German corporation Bergwerksgesellschaft Georg von Giesche's Erben (commonly referred to as Giesche‚Äôs Erben) that were in the previously German controlled Upper Silesia territory with the re-established Poland. SACO was 100% owned by: the Silesian Holding Company (51% of common stock and 58,33% of preferred stock) and Giesche (49% of common stock and 41,67% of preferred stock). Silesian Holding Company was owned by Anaconda Copper Mining (65%) and W. Averell Harriman. Harriman's portion would later be owned by Harriman, close affiliates and associates.  WWII  Following invasion in 1939, Silesian-American was among the Polish corporations and companies that were brought under the supervision of a German military commissar, Dr. Albrecht Jung. During this time SACO was denied all income from the European Silesian-American activities and affiliates, and was hence unable to pay dividends on its outstanding bonds, which came due in 1941. At the time, the company had only about half a million dollars in cash. Accordingly, it filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter X of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.  Repatriation scheme  Before entry to WWII by the U.S., the owners and leading managers of Giesche's Erben sought, through a \\"repatriation scheme\\", to regain legal control of Silesian- American through the leadership of Eduard Schulte, the Giesche‚Äôs Erben General Manager, and Jung. In 1941, the Swiss bank LaRoche acted jointly with Schulte to register another company in Switzerland, Internationale Kapitalanlegen Gesellschaft (Ikap). Schulte convinced Harriman and Cornelius Kelley (president of Anaconda Copper) to sell their shares in Silesian Holding Company to Ikap. However, the action could not be completed without coming under the scrutiny of the U.S. government owing to the Presidential freeze order, which was extended to Switzerland on June 14, 1941‚Äîthe order mandated that transactions which potentially could benefit an enemy be subject to the review and approval of the United States Treasury Department. The first of three applications to transfer stock ownership from U.S. holders to enemy holders was refused by the Treasury Department on July 26, 1941; the other two were in August and December. On November 17, 1942, the Alien Property Custodian as authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act, took over control of the German-owned shares of the Silesian-American Corporation.Order No. 370: Silesian-American Corp. Executed November 17, 1942, signed by Leo Crowley, Alien Property Custodian: ‚ÄúTwo blocks of stock - 98,000 shares of common and 50,000 shares of preferred stock in the Silesian-American, a Delaware corporation\\" are being confiscated. The stock, prior to August 31, 1939, stood in the stock book of Silesian in the name of Non Ferrum, Zurich, Switzerland, a Swiss corporation, which held the stock for the benefit of Bergwerksgesellschaft Georg von Giesche's Erben, a German corporation. This action effectively put a stop to Schulte‚Äôs repatriation scheme.

It usually consists of phosphocholine and ceramide, or a phosphoethanolamine head group; therefore, sphingomyelins can also be classified as sphingophospholipids. In humans, SPH represents ~85% of all sphingolipids, and typically make up 10‚Äì20 mol % of plasma membrane lipids. Sphingomyelin was first isolated by German chemist Johann L.W. Thudicum in the 1880s. The structure of sphingomyelin was first reported in 1927 as N-acyl-sphingosine-1-phosphorylcholine. Sphingomyelin content in mammals ranges from 2 to 15% in most tissues, with higher concentrations found in nerve tissues, red blood cells, and the ocular lenses. Sphingomyelin has significant structural and functional roles in the cell. It is a plasma membrane component and participates in many signaling pathways. The metabolism of sphingomyelin creates many products that play significant roles in the cell. Physical characteristics Sphingomyelin Black:Sphingosine Red:Phosphocholine Blue:Fatty acid Top-down view of sphingomyelin, demonstrating its nearly cylindrical shape =Composition= Sphingomyelin consists of a phosphocholine head group, a sphingosine, and a fatty acid. It is one of the few membrane phospholipids not synthesized from glycerol. The sphingosine and fatty acid can collectively be categorized as a ceramide. This composition allows sphingomyelin to play significant roles in signaling pathways: the degradation and synthesis of sphingomyelin produce important second messengers for signal transduction. Sphingomyelin obtained from natural sources, such as eggs or bovine brain, contains fatty acids of various chain length. Sphingomyelin with set chain length, such as palmitoylsphingomyelin with a saturated 16 acyl chain, is available commercially. =Properties= Ideally, sphingomyelin molecules are shaped like a cylinder, however many molecules of sphingomyelin have a significant chain mismatch (the lengths of the two hydrophobic chains are significantly different). The hydrophobic chains of sphingomyelin tend to be much more saturated than other phospholipids. The main transition phase temperature of sphingomyelins is also higher compared to the phase transition temperature of similar phospholipids, near 37 C. This can introduce lateral heterogeneity in the membrane, generating domains in the membrane bilayer. Sphingomyelin undergoes significant interactions with cholesterol. Cholesterol has the ability to eliminate the liquid to solid phase transition in phospholipids. Due to sphingomyelin transition temperature being within physiological temperature ranges, cholesterol can play a significant role in the phase of sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin are also more prone to intermolecular hydrogen bonding than other phospholipids. =Location= Sphingomyelin is synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it can be found in low amounts, and at the trans Golgi. It is enriched at the plasma membrane with a greater concentration on the outer than the inner leaflet. The Golgi complex represents an intermediate between the ER and plasma membrane, with slightly higher concentrations towards the trans side. Metabolism =Synthesis= The synthesis of sphingomyelin involves the enzymatic transfer of a phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine to a ceramide. The first committed step of sphingomyelin synthesis involves the condensation of L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase. The product of this reaction is reduced, yielding dihydrosphingosine. The dihydrosphingosine undergoes N-acylation followed by desaturation to yield a ceramide. Each one of these reactions occurs at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. The ceramide is transported to the Golgi apparatus where it can be converted to sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin synthase is responsible for the production of sphingomyelin from ceramide. Diacylglycerol is produced as a byproduct when the phosphocholine is transferred. Sphingomyelin de novo synthesis pathway =Degradation= Sphingomyelin breakdown is responsible for initiating many universal signaling pathways. It is hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinases (sphingomyelin specific type-C phospholipases). The phosphocholine head group is released into the aqueous environment while the ceramide diffuses through the membrane. Function =Membranes= The membranous myelin sheath that surrounds and electrically insulates many nerve cell axons is particularly rich in sphingomyelin, suggesting its role as an insulator of nerve fibers. The plasma membrane of other cells is also abundant in sphingomyelin, though it is largely to be found in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. There is, however, some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2 ‚Äì an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelin into ceramide - has been found to localise exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there. =Signal transduction= The function of sphingomyelin remained unclear until it was found to have a role in signal transduction. It has been discovered that sphingomyelin plays a significant role in cell signaling pathways. The synthesis of sphingomyelin at the plasma membrane by sphingomyelin synthase 2 produces diacylglycerol, which is a lipid-soluble second messenger that can pass along a signal cascade. In addition, the degradation of sphingomyelin can produce ceramide which is involved in the apoptotic signaling pathway. =Apoptosis= Sphingomyelin has been found to have a role in cell apoptosis by hydrolyzing into ceramide. Studies in the late 1990s had found that ceramide was produced in a variety of conditions leading to apoptosis. It was then hypothesized that sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide signaling were essential in the decision of whether a cell dies. In the early 2000s new studies emerged that defined a new role for sphingomyelin hydrolysis in apoptosis, determining not only when a cell dies but how. After more experimentation it has been shown that if sphingomyelin hydrolysis happens at a sufficiently early point in the pathway the production of ceramide may influence either the rate and form of cell death or work to release blocks on downstream events. =Lipid rafts= Sphingomyelin, as well as other sphingolipids, are associated with lipid microdomains in the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are characterized by the lipid molecules being in the lipid ordered phase, offering more structure and rigidity compared to the rest of the plasma membrane. In the rafts, the acyl chains have low chain motion but the molecules have high lateral mobility. This order is in part due to the higher transition temperature of sphingolipids as well as the interactions of these lipids with cholesterol. Cholesterol is a relatively small, nonpolar molecule that can fill the space between the sphingolipids that is a result of the large acyl chains. Lipid rafts are thought to be involved in many cell processes, such as membrane sorting and trafficking, signal transduction, and cell polarization. Excessive sphingomyelin in lipid rafts may lead to insulin resistance. Due to the specific types of lipids in these microdomains, lipid rafts can accumulate certain types of proteins associated with them, thereby increasing the special functions they possess. Lipid rafts have been speculated to be involved in the cascade of cell apoptosis. Abnormalities and associated diseases Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, types A and B. It is a genetically-inherited disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, which causes the accumulation of sphingomyelin in spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and brain, causing irreversible neurological damage. Of the two types involving sphingomyelinase, type A occurs in infants. It is characterized by jaundice, an enlarged liver, and profound brain damage. Children with this type rarely live beyond 18 months. Type B involves an enlarged liver and spleen, which usually occurs in the pre-teen years. The brain is not affected. Most patients present with <1% normal levels of the enzyme in comparison to normal levels. A hemolytic protein, lysenin, may be a valuable probe for sphingomyelin detection in cells of Niemann-Pick A patients. As a result of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS), the myelin sheath of neuronal cells in the brain and spinal cord is degraded, resulting in loss of signal transduction capability. MS patients exhibit upregulation of certain cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid, particularly tumor necrosis factor alpha. This activates sphingomyelinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide; sphingomyelinase activity has been observed in conjunction with cellular apoptosis. An excess of sphingomyelin in the red blood cell membrane (as in abetalipoproteinemia) causes excess lipid accumulation in the outer leaflet of the red blood cell plasma membrane. This results in abnormally shaped red cells called acanthocytes.

Overview Hybrid libraries are mixes of traditional print material such as books and magazines, as well as electronic based material such as downloadable audiobooks, electronic journals, e-books, etc. Hybrid libraries are the new norm in most public and academic libraries. It seems that the term \\"hybrid library\\" was first coined in 1998 by Chris Rusbridge in an article for D-Lib Magazine.Chris Rusbridge: \\"Toward the Hybrid Library\\", D-Lib Magazine, July/August 1998. Hybrid libraries evolved in the 1990s when electronic resources became more easily available for libraries to acquire for public use. Initially these electronic resources were typically access to material distributed on media such as CD-ROM or searches of specialised databases. OCLC helped push libraries towards acquiring digital resources by providing a centralized technology resource for participating libraries.Malinconico, S. Michael: \\"Digital Preservation Technologies and Hybrid Libraries,\\" Information Services and Use, 159(74): 173, 2002 Now, with the widespread availability of digital content, it includes Internet resources and documents which are online, such as eprints. Hybrid libraries are the new norm for many archivists as well. Digitization has changed the way archivists have gone about preserving historical items. Archivists are now using digital technology to preserve items that were once only preserved by things like microfiche. Archivists now use things like digital imaging which make it possible for researchers to see historical items online.Malinconico, S. Michael: \\"Digital Preservation Technologies and Hybrid Libraries,\\" Information Services and Use, 159(74): 162, 2002 The emergence of the hybrid library has put a new emphasis on copyright issues for many libraries. The complicated and changing copyright laws in both the United States and the European Union have made it a challenge for many libraries to make sure their patrons are using the digital items lawfully.Oppenheim, Charles: \\"Copyright Issues in Digitisation and the Hybrid Library,\\" Information Services and Use, 203(7): 204. Hybrid libraries need staff that are trained in helping patrons navigate the vast amount of information available in the digital age. Librarians working in hybrid libraries have training in electronic media as well as the traditional print forms. Issues in hybrid library Some of the issues facing the hybrid libraries are the digital divide, interoperability, collection development, ownership of electronic resources and preservation of digital media. Any advancement in information technology will be useful only when you know how to use it. The term digital divide is used to describe the gap between those with information technology knowledge and those who do not.Choemprayong, S.: Closing Digital Divides: The United States' Policies, 2006. Majority of the libraries these days are hybrid libraries. The libraries own and subscribe to different resources in different formats. Some of the common formats are ejournals, serials, print monographs, CD and DVD. The main components of digital library framework are user interfaces, repository, handle system, and search system.Arms, W. Y., Blanchi, C., & Overly, E. A.: \\"An Architecture for Information in Digital Libraries\\". D-Lib Magazine, February 1997. The handle system and search system are the major components that should be designed with interoperability features to search across different repositories owned by different vendors. The user interface should be designed in a generic way that it helps library patrons develop a common knowledge to do advanced searches across all repositories. Collection development Collection development is another challenge facing the hybrid libraries. The process of collection management in a hybrid library is similar to that of a traditional library. Hybrid libraries follow the same policies and procedures followed in traditional library collection development.Chowdhury, G. & Chowdhury, S.: Introduction to Digital Libraries. London: Facet Publication, 2003. Ownership of electronic resources Ownership of electronic resources is another issue facing the hybrid libraries. Ownership of electronic materials is virtual and not physical. There are no clear policies about the ownership of electronic materials once the subscription is cancelled or expired. Libraries have to pay attention to the legal contracts from the database vendors. If the libraries plan on archiving the electronic resources, then there are legal issues related to it. The most prominent legal issues are intellectual property and authenticity of digital information. Preservation of digital media With any new advanced technology related to digital information storage, the main question to be answered is its durability. Digital storage media like disc or tapes deteriorate over time. The main question related to digital preservation is what and how much should be preserved. To make the preservation of digital media cost effective, standardization of different media format is required. Following are the three possible approaches. Technology preservation, emulation, and migration In technology preservation, both hardware and software related to digital information are preserved. This may not be cost effective because changes to hardware and different versions of software need to be either maintained or constantly upgraded. In emulation, some emulator software programs will mimic the hardware and software of the original data and display in the original format. In migration, digital information is converted to a standard media with standard format. References Oppenheim,C.,& Smithson,D.1999). What is the hybrid library?.

Education Born Gloria Montemuro in Allenhurst, New Jersey, she attended the University of Iowa, New York University, and Columbia University, where she earned her master's degree in drama. Theatre work In 1952, she married writer and editor Robert O'Byrne, with whom she had founded a New York theater group, Abbe Theater School. With O'Byrne, Monty directed summer stock productions and led acting and speech workshops at The New School in New York City, where her pupils included Marlon Brando, Demi Moore and Tony Curtis. TV career After directing shows such as The First Hundred Years, The Secret Storm (for many years), and Bright Promise, she is best known for taking over the ailing ABC Daytime serial General Hospital in 1978 as Executive Producer. Fred Silverman, the head of ABC, gave Monty thirteen weeks to turn the show around, with cancellation threatened if she did not succeed. It subsequently became the top-rated American daytime drama and won several Daytime Emmy Awards. To accomplish this turnaround, she increased the show's pace, and focused main storylines on younger characters to reach out to younger viewers, particularly the pairing of ingenue Laura Spencer (Genie Francis) and troubled criminal Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary, whom she knew from his stint on her previous series, Bright Promise). She gave the sets a more contemporary look and feel, and employed production techniques once used only in primetime. One major result of the \\"Monty Revolution\\" was the faster pace of the show, effectively doubling the number of scenes in each episode. She was known for her rigid work ethic and for being tough with the cast and crew. ‚ÄúShe demand[ed] excellence, but she reward[ed] it,‚Äù said coordinating producer Jerry Balme. Monty was accused of perpetuating dangerous misconceptions about rape, implicitly exalting violence against women. But Monty viewed the ‚Äúrape‚Äù as a choreographed \\"seduction.‚Äù Under her tenure, General Hospital rose to the top spot in the ratings, with Luke and Laura's 1981 wedding being the highest rated episode in daytime history (about 30 million viewers in 13 million households). Monty's Revolution consisted of couples such as Luke/Laura, Frisco/Felicia, and Robert/Holly. She and various head writers also created the Quartermaine family, Bobbie Spencer, Luke Spencer, Lucy Coe, Robert Scorpio, Anna Devane, Robin Scorpio, the Cassadine family, and many other popular characters who would dominate the show in the 1980s and early 1990s. General Hospital received cover stories in both People, Soap Opera Weekly, and Newsweek, which referred to Luke and Laura as the ‚ÄúRhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara of Soapland‚Äù. Included in the show's fan base were celebrities Elizabeth Taylor and Sammy Davis Jr., both of whom guest starred on the series. She was also the executive producer of the primetime serial The Hamptons. She employed many former daytime performers for this show. The serial was unusual because it was videotaped rather than being filmed. Monty announced her departure from General Hospital in 1986, working on her final episode as executive producer in January 1987. Her next two successors, H. Wesley Kenney (1987‚Äì1989) and Joseph Hardy (1989‚Äì1991), were both lauded by viewers, but GH fell out of first place in 1988 (with the ratings top spot being taken over by The Young and the Restless, the show that Kenney was hired from). By 1990, the show's ratings were starting to sag significantly. That December, ABC's daytime programming head Jackie Smith successfully hired Monty back as GH executive producer, and Monty resumed her role on February 13, 1991. In early 1991, Monty lured Anthony Geary back to daytime, but not as the popular Luke Spencer. Instead, Monty went along with Geary's demand to play a brand new character, Bill Eckert, Luke's lookalike cousin. An entire new family, the blue-collar Eckerts, was ushered in, and quickly dominated storyline, while the longrunning Quartermaine family was phased out. Monty also fired a dozen actors, in what the press described as a \\"bloodbath\\", including actress Jennifer Guthrie, who played heroine Dawn Winthrop. After Monty appointed her sister, Norma Monty, as head writer, the ratings eroded further. Monty's dismissal became inevitable between the declining ratings and the departure of popular cast members such as Tristan Rogers (Robert Scorpio) and Finola Hughes (Anna Devane, who Monty fired among much criticism). In early 1992, after only a year, Monty was replaced with Wendy Riche. She produced several made-for-television movies based on her friend Mary Higgins Clark's novels. She also chaired the New Jersey Motion Picture & Television Commission. Honors In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to Monty.Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated Death Monty died on March 30, 2006 at Rancho Mirage, California from cancer, aged 84.

Functions Sphingosine can be phosphorylated in vivo via two kinases, sphingosine kinase type 1 and sphingosine kinase type 2. This leads to the formation of sphingosine-1-phosphate, a potent signaling lipid. Sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate, are lipid signaling molecules involved in diverse cellular processes.  Biosynthesis  Sphingosine is synthesized from palmitoyl CoA and serine in a condensation required to yield dehydrosphingosine. Sphingosine synthesis Dehydrosphingosine is then reduced by NADPH to dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine), and finally oxidized by FAD to sphingosine. There is no direct route of synthesis from sphinganine to sphingosine; it has to be acylated first to dihydroceramide, which is then dehydrogenated to ceramide.

Japanese Aircraft 1910‚Äì1941. London: Putnam, 1990. History The air arsenal's roots go back to 1869 when the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) established a naval arsenal at Yokosuka, about 13 miles south of Yokohama on Tokyo Bay. The arsenal provided ship building, repair and replenishment to the Japanese Navy. It was also a storage depot where munitions and other assorted supplies were brought as they were purchased. When a number of foreign aircraft were purchased for evaluation, the Navy brought them to the arsenal for processing. The arsenal assembled the aircraft from their shipping boxes, and when assembled, they were flown by the pilots who had been sent abroad for flying lessons and evaluate the aircraft flown. Modifications to these aircraft were done as weaknesses were found, or when an improvement was incorporated. To facilitate this work, the IJN established the Aeroplane Factory, Ordnance Department at the arsenal's torpedo factory in May 1913. The next year, the first acronym was used was Yokosho, a contraction of \\"Yokosuka Kaigun K≈çsh≈ç\\" (Yokosuka Naval Arsenal). The arsenal was renamed \\"Kaigun K≈çk≈´ Shiken-sho\\" (Naval Establishment for Aeronautical Research) in December 1919. The name \\"Kaigun Gijutsu Kenky≈´sho\\" (Naval Technical Research Institute) was assigned by April, 1923, when the arsenal was moved to Tsukiji with several other Naval support units. The entire Tsukiji facility was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. Several names were used when the navy began establishment of the arsenal. Research was started again in 1924 when several aircraft were evaluated. Under the command of the newly formed Naval Air Headquarters, the Kaigun Kokusho (Naval Air Arsenal) was formed at Yokosuka on 1 April 1932. A large amount of draftsmen and Designers were transferred from the Hiro Naval Arsenal, ending aircraft production there. The war years During World War II, the arsenal was responsible for the design of several IJN aircraft, although the arsenal itself did not manufacture more than a few prototypes of the aircraft it designed. Its designs were mass-produced by companies such as Aichi Kokuki, Watanabe Tekk≈çjo steel foundry, (renamed in 1943 to (Kyushu Armaments)), and the Hiro Naval Arsenal (Hiro Kaigun K≈çsh≈ç, which is often abbreviated as Hirosho). Aircraft designed by the arsenal are usually designated by the manufacturer's letter \\"Y\\" for \\"Yokosuka\\". An example of the above is the Yokosuka D4Y1 Carrier Attack Bomber Suisei Model 11 (Suisei - Comet) which was mainly produced by Aichi. The D4Y1 and later models were also produced by Dai-J≈´ichi Kaigun K≈çk≈´- sh≈ç (11th Naval Arsenal) at Hiro.

The line dividing them is roughly 69 degrees south. Graham Land is named after Sir James R. G. Graham, First Lord of the Admiralty at the time of John Biscoe's exploration of the west side of Graham Land in 1832. It is claimed by Argentina (as part of Argentine Antarctica), Britain (as part of the British Antarctic Territory) and Chile (as part of the Chilean Antarctic Territory). Graham Land is the closest part of Antarctica to South America.ESA Science & Technology: Graham Land Thus it is the usual destination for small ships taking paying visitors on Antarctic trips from South America.A cruise to Antarctica is a trip like no other (Larger ships are not allowed to disembark passengers.) Until the discoveries of the British Graham Land Expedition of 1934-1937, it was generally supposed to be an archipelago rather than a peninsula. The mountains of Graham Land are the last range of the American Cordillera, the almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges forming the western \\"backbone\\" of North America, Central America, South America and the Antarctic Peninsula.

A small parrot related to the more common red-rumped parrot, it is considered to be a superspecies with the hooded parrot (P. dissimilis) of the Northern Territory and the apparently extinct paradise parrot of Queensland and New South Wales. Description Male at Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, Brisbane Male and female golden-shouldered parrots in an aviary at the Queensland Museum, showing the salmon colour of the male's lower belly (photo 2004) Wild females at Artemis Station, Cape York Peninsula. The golden- shouldered parrot is 23‚Äì28 cm long and weighs 54‚Äì56 g. The adult male is mainly blue and has a characteristic yellow over the shoulder area. It has a black cap and pale yellow frontal band. It has an extended dark salmon pink lower belly, thighs and undertail-coverts. It has a grey-brown lower back. Adult females are mainly dull greenish-yellow, and have a broad cream bar on the underside of the wings. The head in older females has a charcoal grey cap. The feathers of the vent area are a pale salmon pink. Juveniles are similar to the adult female though newly fledged males have a brighter blue cheek patch than females of the same age. Habitat The golden-shouldered parrot lives in open forested grassland liberally populated by numerous termite species and their mounds. Often these mounds are found every few metres apart. The parrot feeds on the seeds of small grass species and several months of the year, principally those prior to the onset of the wet season, the birds are almost entirely dependent on the small but plentiful seed of firegrass (Schizachyrium fragile). An important habitat requirement is the presence of suitably sized terrestrial termite mounds, in which the birds nest. This has led to the Golden shouldered parrot and its relatives being known as the antbed parrots. Breeding The golden-shouldered parrot will build a nest in the taller magnetic termite mounds (up to 2 m high) but surveys point to the preference for the lower dome type mounds. This may be to do with the slower heating up and cooling of the smaller denser mounds. Commonly they dig a burrow into the mound when wet season rains have softened the substrate of the mounds. Typically a 50 ‚Äì350 mm long tunnel is dug down into the mound ending in the nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3‚Äì6 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The termite occupants of the mound use a natural form of air conditioning to preserve the climatic conditions of their colony and this process regulates the temperature of the parrot's nest chamber at around 28-30 degrees C. Temperature surveys have shown however, a range of 13-35 degrees C. These conditions have led to the parrots developing a habit of leaving the eggs at night beginning around the 10th day after hatching. A symbiotic relationship is present between the Golden shouldered parrot and a moth species (Trisyntopa scatophaga) that is worthy of note. Found in around half of parrot nests, the moths seek out the newly dug nest tunnels and deposit their eggs in the entrance. The hatching moth larvae consume the faeces of the nestling parrots therefore helping to keep the nest chamber clean. Whether the parrots receive any other benefits from the presence of moths is arguable as not all nests contain moth larvae. There appears to be a tendency for more male parrots relative to females to be born. This may be to counter the increased predation that males appear to suffer in the wild. Status The golden-shouldered parrot is listed as endangered (CITES I), with population surveys pointing to a total wild population of around 2,000 birds with around 300 breeding pairs. The remaining majority of birds are thought to be juvenile birds in their first year of life. The species has a restricted range and suffers from a variety of threats, including predation by feral cats, tourist disturbance as well as feral pigs which disturb and dig out nests. The main threat however has been the changes to traditional Aboriginal burning regimes in the grasslands upon whose seeds the birds depend. These so-called \\"cool fires\\" created a mosaic of burnt landscape allowing wildlife to move to remaining food resources and reveals fallen seed that is hidden by dried grass cover. Hot uncontrolled wildfires destroy all seed stores in the environment and favour the intrusion of teatree species into grassland habitats. The cover that is created by these thickets of teatree also allow the parrot's main predator, the pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), a more successful kill rate on the parrots, primarily upon the juvenile population and adult males. A number of cases have been noted where a juvenile male has taken over the role of an adult male ( that has been predated) and is feeding the chicks of that deceased male. This may be an adaptation to the increased rate of predation on adult males in comparison to females. In captivity it is noted that golden-shouldered parrots will readily accept a new partner and this may be related to this wild breeding behaviour. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for golden-shouldered parrot conservation are Morehead River and Staaten River. The ongoing conservation work of the owners of Artemis Station should also be noted. These graziers have been monitoring and providing conservation works on their property for the benefit of the Golden shouldered parrot since the 1970s. The reinstating of former burning practices and the temporary removal of cattle from prime breeding sites has aided the parrot's survival. The recent provision of feeding stations in order to help juvenile birds through the perilous first months of the wet season has also been undertaken. This period when heavy flooding rains results in any remaining seed being washed away or drowned and many young birds perish before newly sprouted grass can provide new seed. The conservation effort toward this species seems to be resulting in a stabilization of the population decline but no notable increase in numbers has been reported. The Golden shouldered parrot is scarce in captivity. A population of perhaps 1,000 birds in Australia and perhaps 300 held in overseas aviaries means a limited gene pool is available. A dedicated group of breeders in Australia have attempted to promote the species and ensure that a viable breeding population is maintained in captivity. Many international breeders are also working toward this same goal. The provision of heated nest boxes for breeding birds and the replication of a wild type diet is being used to try and formulate a successful regime leading to more predictable breeding results. Aviary birds can tend to become too fat if fed too rich a diet, resulting in infertility issues. The tendency to aggression between pairs means the keeping of one pair to an aviary and solid partitions between aviaries is essential to prevent injuries. The provision of earth floors in aviaries is considered best practice. Suspended flights do not allow for the parrots need to dig and feed on the ground as they do in the wild.

Background  ƒ∞smail Cem finished high school at Robert College in ƒ∞stanbul in 1959 and graduated from the Law School at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland in 1963. He had his master's degree in sociology of politics at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques in 1983, Paris, France. He was an exchange student with AFS Intercultural Programs at Piedmont High School, Piedmont California for one year during his high school years. A member of one of the most prominent families in Turkey, Cem was the cousin of murdered liberal-leftist journalist, intellectual and human rights activist Abdi ƒ∞pek√ßi, the editor in chief for then centre-leftist Milliyet newspaper. Cem was the son of ƒ∞hsan ƒ∞pek√ßi (1901-1966), who was one of the pioneers of the Turkish cinema industry, as the founder and partner of ƒ∞pek Film, and several popular Istanbul movie theaters including Yeni Melek and ƒ∞pek. ƒ∞smail Cem was an avid photographer, and held four photo exhibits, and published a book Mevsim, Mevsim  Journalism  Returning home in 1963, Cem started his professional career as a journalist. He worked in some major newspapers who published articles and became a columnist for Milliyet, \\"Cumhuriyet\\" and Politika, where he served as the editor in chief for the second newspaper from 1964 until 1966. Between 1971‚Äì1974, he served as the chief of the Istanbul office of the Turkish Newspaper Workers Union. In 1974‚Äì1975, he acted as the general manager of the state-owned Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) under the 37th and 38th governments. Cem's tenure as the general manager of TRT, then the only TV station in Turkey, created some controversy. The conservatives and prominent right-wing figures like future President of Turkey S√ºleyman Demirel used their political and social influence to remove ƒ∞pek√ßi from his post in several attempts, which have all proven fruitless.  Writing career  Among with his political and journalistic successes, ƒ∞pek√ßi is also known as one of the ideologists of social democracy in Turkey, and was counted among the prominent figures within the Turkish centre-left. ƒ∞pek√ßi, who advocated a moderate agenda in a time of political turmoil, wrote extensive accounts of the economic and social factors lying beneath Turkey's underdevelopment and theoretized methods for the revitalization of Turkish left. Among his books are Turkiye'de Geri Kalmƒ±≈ülƒ±ƒüƒ±n Tarihi (A History of Underdevelopment in Turkey), one of the most acclaimed books in the field of social sciences in Turkey and Sosyal Demokrasi Nedir?, Ne Deƒüildir? (What is and What is not Social Democracy?), one of the first books to introduce social democracy to Turkish politics. ƒ∞pek√ßi's books, characterized by their plain but informative nature, are still popular and are growing even more popular, especially in light of the current dissent against AKP's Islamism and the debate of reformation in Turkish left. He is also labeled as the visionary of the \\"Anatolian Left (Anadolu Solu)\\". A more detailed bibliography of his works can be found below.  Political career  He entered politics after being elected deputy of Istanbul from the Kadƒ±k√∂y district in the general elections held in 1987. He was re-elected in 1991 again from Istanbul and in 1995 from Kayseri. After the death of President Turgut √ñzal in 1993, he ran for president without success. In 1995, ƒ∞pek√ßi left the Republican People's Party (CHP) and joined the Democratic Left Party (DSP). He was then appointed Minister of Culture. He served as minister of foreign affairs from 30 June 1997 until 11 July 2002. He was the fourth longest-serving minister of this position in Turkey. =Relations with the European Union= He negotiated candidate status for Turkey's bid to join the European Union as foreign minister. He was largely credited with Turkey's declaration as a full member candidate during the Helsinki Summit Meeting in 1992, after much negotiation with the EU and a night trip by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and the then European Commissioner G√ºnter Verheugen to Ankara to iron out the last details. =Relations with Greece= ƒ∞pek√ßi and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou worked to improve Turkish-Greek relations. It is during his tenure as foreign minister that a confident, albeit a step-by-step approach was taken towards a rapprochement between Turkey and Greece. The relations were actually at an all-time low after the Abdullah √ñcalan affair, whereby Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and some officials of the Greek Foreign Ministry were involved in hiding organization PKK leader prior to his arrest by the Turkish police. ƒ∞pek√ßi and Papandreou picked up the historically hostile relationships initially starting with some confidence measures.  Later political career and illness  After a dispute with the party leader B√ºlent Ecevit, he resigned from the Democratic Left Party (DSP) ahead of 2002 parliamentary elections and formed the New Turkey Party (YTP) on 20 July 2002 together with his former party colleague H√ºsamettin √ñzkan. ƒ∞smail Cem was elected leader of YTP, which did not do well in the elections. Returning from the United States, where he was due to medical treatment of cancer, he closed YTP on 24 October 2004, joining the CHP. ƒ∞smail Cem was acting as the chief advisor to Deniz Baykal, the leader of CHP, and lectured in Applied Foreign Politics of Turkey at the Istanbul Bilgi University until his death. He was married to El√ßin Cem, and the couple had a daughter, ƒ∞pek Cem Taha, and a son, Kerim Cem. Funeral ƒ∞smail Cem died on 24 January 2007 in ƒ∞stanbul after suffering for two years from lung cancer. He was honored with a state funeral, at which Speaker of the Parliament B√ºlent Arƒ±n√ß, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, current and former leaders of the political parties, his close friend former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, George Papandreou and Greek Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodoros Kasimis attended.PAPANDREU, KASIMIS IN TURKEY FOR CEM'S FUNERAL, Anadolu Agency, TNN News. He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery.

Legacy  ƒ∞smail Cem was especially admired by young people in Turkey during his time as a foreign minister. Some polls indicated that young people desired to see Cem as President of Turkey. ƒ∞smail Cem's biography written by Turkish political scientist Ozan √ñrmeci, \\"Portrait of a Turkish Social Democrat: ƒ∞smail Cem\\" and its Turkish version \\"Bir T√ºrk Sosyal Demokratƒ±: ƒ∞smail Cem\\" found many readers among Turkish intellectuals and showed Cem's unique place in Turkish social democratic movement.

He started first Dindi for Pandharpur, Paithan, Mahur, Ghrushneshwar, Muktai Nagar from Mehkar. He worked for Jatibhed Nirmulan (demolishing of Cast system), equality, the spread of love in society and up-gradation of suppressed class like women and lower classes of society. In his life of 42 years, he obeyed all four Aashramas and in the last, he became Paramhans Parivrajkacharya 1008 Om Brahmee Shwasanand Saraswati. He took Sanjieevan Samadhee at Varanasi in 1930 A.D. At Mehkar he built Dnyanmandir as his Gurupeeth. Now Gurupeethdhish Ad. Rangnath Maharaj Pitale is keeping all Parampara. Shree Sant Gajanan Maharaj and Senaji Maharaj Mandir (Nabhik) It has a temple called \\"Shree Sant Gajanan Maharaj on Dongaon road and Senaji Maharaj\\" And \\"Vitthal Rukhmini\\" (Mola Road, Sena Nagar, Mehkar). It also has in its surrounding i.e. 12 km to its north a Dargah of AULIYA BABA at the outskirts of an ancient village named MOLA and is revered by every community irrespective of religion, caste, creed living in and around Mehkar. A week long annual fair (\\"Jatra\\", in local language) is held nearby the Dargah. Balaji Temple An idol of Lord Balaji, along with copper scripture (Tamrapat) was found during digging in 1888 AD. There is a temple of the Hindu God Balaji that is more than 120 years old. The documents written on copper found with Balaji's sculpture are now in the British Museum, England. it is the largest sculpture of Lord Balaji in Asia. This idol is made in a single black stone. There is a yearly celebration for Lord Balaji. Everyday visitors/tourists and the poor are provided with free food. Kanchani mahal In local folklore, the structure is connected with many tales and mysteries. The structure and the bricks are of Mughal architectural pattern and was designed for camping of an army and housing a very high ranking army officer of those times. The aforesaid monument is currently in ruins due to the lack of attention from the ASI.https://asi.nic.in/ However, the story connected to Kanchani Mahal seems to be a myth. Looking at the ruins one could easily gauge that the bricks are of Mughalia shapes and the monument would have been constructed to house and camp a general (or Shahenshah) of Aurangazeb's stature during Great Shivaji's period in their campaign to crush the rising of the great Maratha warrior. The ASI will be the right authority to ascertain the truth if they take an interest. N G Deshpande, renowned poet of Maharashtra, composed extensively on Kanchan Mahal. Kiran Shivhar Dongardive, another renowned poet from Mehkar has composed some poems on Kanchani Mahal. His poem is a work of fiction and cannot be construed as reality. However, Kanchani in Marathi as well as in Hindi dialect literally means a Courtesan or a dancing girl meant to entertain clients of higher class. Painganga River Mehkar is on the banks of the Painganga River, another name of Paingnga river is 'Pranhita', which provides multiple recreational activities. On the bank of this river there is Saoji Galli. In it, there is an old Vitthal mandir rather first Vitthal mandir in Mehkar, idol of this Vitthal, got in hands of Kimbahune Anster in Vari, to Ananta Shastri, it was a very religious place. A religious story is also attached to the Painganaga River that this river is formed by falling out of \\"Pranita Patram\\" from lord Vishanu's hand and has on location and story also mentioned in \\"Padma Puram\\". At the site of the Olandeshwar Tempel river Painganga changes its direction when the water level is low.

History In 1866, the Tokugawa shogunate government established the Yokosuka Seisakusho, a military arsenal and naval base, with the help of foreign engineers, including the French naval architect L√©once Verny. The new facility was intended to produce modern, western-style warships and equipment for the Tokugawa navy. The construction of the arsenal was an important first step for the modernization of Japan's industry. Modern buildings, an aqueduct, foundry, brick factories, technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established. Construction of the Yokosuka arsenal c.1870. After the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration, the new Meiji government took over control of the facility in 1871, renaming it the Yokosuka Zosenjo (Yokosuka Shipyards). The first dry dock was opened in 1871, and is still in operation today. Japan's first domestically produced warship, Saiki, was completed the same year. The Yokosuka Naval District was established at Yokosuka, Kanagawa, in 1884, as the first of the naval districts responsible for the defense of the Japanese home islands, and the Yokosuka Shipyards was renamed the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1903. Japan had purchased five submarines from the American Electric Boat Company during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905. These Holland Type VII submarines were built by Arthur Leopold Busch as he traveled to Japan during this time. Mr. Busch was a naval architect and shipbuilder who represented the newly organized company (Electric Boat Company) now located at the Quincy Massachusett's shipyard known as the Fore River Ship and Engine Company. These first five submarines became Japan's (IJN) initial entry into the theater of underwater warfare that began nearly the same time as the outbreak of the war. Another representative of Electric Boat, Frank Cable, an electrician working for Isaac L. Rice's company trained two Japanese crews in the operation of such craft. Arthur Busch was also the man responsible for building the United States Navy's first submarine some five or so years before this time for the Holland Torpedo Boat Company. This (particular craft) was named the and was America's first commissioned craft (of this) type. Two additional Holland- designed submarines were built for Japan by 1906 \\"under contract\\" and a licensing \\"agreement\\" with Holland's company back in 1905. These pioneering submarines progressively got larger and larger as time went on, climaxing (in size) by the end of the Cold War. In 1909, Japan's first domestically designed and produced battleship, Satsuma was launched. U.S. Navy base at the former Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Yokosuka became one of the main shipyards of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the 20th century, building numerous battleships such as Yamashiro, and aircraft carriers such as Hiryu and Shokaku. Naval aircraft were designed at the nearby Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal. During the Pacific War, the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was attacked by one bomber during the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 and by a large force of carrier aircraft during the Attack on Yokosuka on 18 July 1945. The facilities were seized by the Allied forces at the end of World War II, and on 15 October 1945 the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal was officially abolished. However, the facilities continued to be used in the post-World War II period, by the United States Navy as the Yokosuka Ship Repair Facility and its former property is now under the control of the United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka.

It is the present-day location of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The original fort, a crude, wooden palisade structure, was called Fort Cataraqui but was later named for Louis de Buade de Frontenac, Governor of New France who was responsible for building the fort. It was abandoned and razed in 1689, then rebuilt in 1695. The British destroyed the fort in 1758 during the Seven Years' War and its ruins remained abandoned until the British took possession and reconstructed it in 1783. In 1870‚Äì71 the fort was turned over to the Canadian military, who continue to use it. History =Establishment and early use= The intent of Fort Frontenac was to control the lucrative fur trade in the Great Lakes Basin to the west and the Canadian Shield to the north. It was one of many French outposts that would be established throughout the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi regions. The fort was meant to be a bulwark against the English who were competing with the French for control of the fur trade. By constructing the trading post the French could encourage trade with the Iroquois, who were traditionally a threat to the French because of their alliance with the English. Another function of the fort was the provision of supplies and reinforcements to other French installations on the Great Lakes and in the Ohio Valley to the south. Robert de La Salle inspecting the construction of Fort Frontenac, 1676. Explorer Ren√© Robert Cavalier de La Salle was ordered by governor Daniel de R√©my de Courcelle to select a location for a fort. He selected the strategic junction of Lake Ontario, the Cataraqui River, and the St. Lawrence River. Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac, de Courcelle's successor, was concerned about further Iroquois threats, and endorsed La Salle's proposal. Governor Frontenac and his close associates also hoped to personally benefit from building the fort by controlling trade.Cataraqui Archaeological Research Foundation, Fort Frontenac Retrieved 2017-07-09Harris 1987, p. 87 Frontenac, along with his entourage, journeyed up the St. Lawrence to the fort's future site where he met leaders of the Five Nations of the Iroquois on July 12, 1673 to encourage them to trade with the French, and to begin the fort's construction. The fort, which was constructed of wood surrounded by a wooden stockade consisting of sharpened poles, was completed within six days.Mika 1987, pp. 9‚Äì12Osborne 2011, p. 9. La Salle administered the fort and built storage buildings and dwellings, brought in domestic animals and ensured some land outside the fort was cultivated with the aim of attracting settlers.Mika 1987, p. 9 The fort was sited to protect a small sheltered bay (the \\"cannotage\\")Osborne 2011, p. 151. that the French could use as a harbour for large lake-going boats. Unlike the Ottawa River fur trade route into the interior, which was only accessible by canoes, larger vessels could easily navigate the lower lakes. The cost of transporting goods such as furs, trade items, and supplies through at least the lower Great Lakes would be reduced.The History of the Port of Kingston. Historic Kingston. Kingston Historical Society. 1954. pp. 3‚Äì4. Retrieved 2010-02-02 A painting by George Catlin of an expedition departing from Fort Frontenac, November 1678 La Salle was granted seigneurial privileges in the vicinity of the fort. In return for these privileges, La Salle was obliged to reimburse Frontenac for expenses related to building the fort, keep 20 workers onsite for two years, and maintain the fort. In 1675, La Salle rebuilt the structure. Stone bastions and a stone wall were constructed to strengthen the fort and much of the wooden pallisade was rebuilt. He was also required to attract settlers and meet their spiritual needs by building a chapel and establishing a mission with one or two Recollet priests.Armstrong 1973, pp. 15, 16 A description of the fort written in the 17th century mentions that: La Salle used Fort Frontenac as a convenient base for his explorations into the interior of North America. =Iroquois siege and reconstruction= Plans for Fort Frontenac from 1685. Fur trade rivalries continued to cause friction between the French and the Iroquois in the 1680s. The French began a campaign against the Iroquois to resolve the Iroquois threat, beginning with Governor Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre's unsuccessful expedition to Fort Frontenac and into Seneca territory south of Lake Ontario in 1684. In 1687 La Barre's successor, the Marquis de Denonville, gathered an army to travel into the Seneca territory. To quell suspicion about his motives, Denonville let on that he was merely travelling to a peace council at Fort Frontenac. As Denonville and his army moved up the St. Lawrence toward the fort, several Iroquois, many of whom were friendly to the French, including women and children and some prominent leaders, were captured and imprisoned at Fort Frontenac by intendant de Champigny ostensibly to prevent them from revealing Denonville's troops' location.Parkman 1877, ch. VIII, pp. 140‚Äì142Adams 1986, pp. 10, 13 Some were held hostage and sent to Montreal in the event that any French were captured, and some were sent to France to be used as galley slaves. Denonville's troops and native allies went on to attack the Seneca. In retaliation for these incidents the Iroquois laid siege to Fort Frontenac and blockaded Lake Ontario. The fort and the settlement at Cataraqui were besieged for two months in 1688. Although the fort was not destroyed, the settlement was devastated and many inhabitants died, mostly from scurvy. The French abandoned and destroyed the fort in 1689, claiming that its remoteness prevented proper defense and that it could not be adequately supplied. The French again took possession of the fort in 1695 and it was rebuilt and strengthened to serve primarily as a military base of operations. From Fort Frontenac in 1696 the French organized an attack on the Iroquois who inhabited areas south of Lake Ontario.Parkman 1877, ch. XIX, p. 410. Increased tension between the British and the French in the 1740s led to the French upgrading the fort's defensive capabilities by adding new guns, building new barracks and increasing the size of the garrison.Bazely 2007. However, when the Marquis de Montcalm arrived at the fort in 1756 to launch an attack on the British at Oswego, he was not impressed with its construction. One of his engineers noted that: The fort's strategic significance gradually decreased. Other forts such as Fort Niagara, Fort Detroit, and Fort Michilimackinac became more important. By the 1750s Fort Frontenac essentially served only as a supply storage depot and harbour for French naval vessels, and its garrison had dwindled. =Battle of Fort Frontenac= besieged the French at Fort Frontenac in 1759, during the Seven Years' War. During the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, who were vying for control of the North American continent, the British considered Fort Frontenac to be a strategic threat since it was in a position to command transportation and communications to other French fortifications and outposts along the St. Lawrence ‚Äì Great Lakes water route and in the Ohio Valley. Although not as important as it once was, the fort was still a base from which the western outposts were supplied. The British reasoned that if they were to disable the fort, supplies would be cut off and the outposts would no longer be able to defend themselves. The Indian trade in the upper country (the Pays d'en Haut) would also be disrupted.Anderson 2000, p. 264. Fort Frontenac was also regarded as a threat to Fort Oswego, which was built by the British across the lake from Fort Frontenac in 1722 to compete with Fort Frontenac for the Indian trade, and later enhanced as a military establishment. General Montcalm had already used Fort Frontenac as a staging point to attack the fortifications at Oswego in August 1756. A 1763 map showing the British positions during the battle. The British also hoped that taking the well-known fort would boost troop morale and honour after their demoralizing battle defeat at Fort Ticonderoga (Fort Carillon) in July 1758.Chartrand 2001.Anderson 2000, p. 260. In August 1758, the British under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Bradstreet left Fort Oswego with a force of a little over 3000 men and attacked Fort Frontenac. The fort's garrison of 110 men, including five officers and 48 enlisted men of the regular colonial troops, employees, women, children, 8 Indians, and others commanded by Pierre-Jacques Payen de Noyan et de Chavoy, surrendered and were allowed to leave. Bradstreet captured the fort's supplies and nine French naval vessels, and destroyed much of the fort. He quickly departed to avoid further conflict with any French support troops. For the British, Fort Oswego was secured, and the army's reputation was restored. For the French, the fort's loss was considered to be only a temporary setback. Fort Frontenac's surrender did not succeed in completely severing French communications and transportation to the west since other routes were available (e.g. the Ottawa River ‚Äì Lake Huron route). Supplies could also be moved west from other French posts (e.g. Fort de La Pr√©sentation). In the long term, however, the surrender compromised French prestige among the Indians and contributed to the defeat of New France in North America.Biography of John Bradstreet Since the fort was no longer perceived to be important to the French, it was never rebuilt and was left abandoned for the next 25 years. French imperial power was waning in the late 1750s, and by 1763 France had withdrawn from the North American mainland. Cataraqui and the remains of Fort Frontenac were relinquished to the British. =Reconstruction and modern times= View of the remains of Fort Frontenac, 1783. The fort was partially rebuilt by the British later that year. In 1783, the Cataraqui region was selected by the British as a location to settle United Empire Loyalists who had fled the United States after the American War of Independence. The centre of the region, a community focused on the old fort, would eventually become the city of Kingston. General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor of the Province of Quebec, ordered Major John Ross, commander at Oswego, to repair and rebuild the fort to accommodate a military garrison. This was done by a force of 422 men and 25 officers. By October 1783, a lime kiln, hospital, barracks, officers' quarters, storehouses, and a bakehouse were completed.Mika 1987, p. 21. In 1787, the rebuilt fort became known as T√™te-de-Pont Barracks.Kingston Historical Society: Chronology of the History of Kingston Retrieved: 2013-07-14 During the War of 1812, the fort was the focus of military activity in Kingston, having housed many military troops. Many of the present barrack buildings were built between 1821 and 1824.DND ‚Äì Fort Frontenac Officers' Mess Retrieved: 2010-01-19DND ‚Äì National Defence and the Canadian Forces ‚Äì A History of Fort Frontenac Retrieved: 2015-02-22 Entrance to the Fort in 2015. Fort Frontenac is presently used as the Canadian Army Command and Staff College. After British imperial forces withdrew from most Canadian locations in 1870‚Äì71, the Canadian Militia authorized the creation of two batteries of garrison artillery which provided garrison duties and schools of gunnery. \\"A \\" Battery School of Gunnery was established at T√™te-de-Pont Barracks and other locations in Kingston (\\"B \\" Battery was located in Quebec). These batteries were known as the Regiment of Canadian Artillery. When this regiment evolved into the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA), its headquarters was at the T√™te-de-Pont Barracks from 1905 to 1939. When the RCHA left for operational duties during the Second World War, the fort was used as a personnel depot. On 25 May 1923, the site of Fort Frontenac was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1939 the site of the fort again became known as Fort Frontenac. Canadian Army staff training began at Fort Frontenac when the Canadian Army Staff College moved to the fort from the Royal Military College in 1948. The college is now known as the Canadian Army Command and Staff College. Fort Frontenac was also the location of the National Defence College until 1994.  Archaeology  In 1982, archaeological investigation began at the fort. During the spring of 1984, the City of Kingston redesigned the intersection of Ontario and Place d'Armes Streets so that the northwest bastion (Bastion St. Michel) and curtain wall could be excavated and partially reconstructed. The research also provided important details about the development and use of the fort and surrounding area, and helped to establish the relationship between the physical remains and the information included in historical maps and plans. Intact remains of the east bastion were located in 2020 by archaeologists while preparing for infrastructure work. Deposits associated with the fur trade era were found on the south side of the bastion wall, including trade beads, beaver jaws, gun flints, and fish bones.

Formation The Democrat Party was founded and developed by Albert Davy, a prominent political organiser of the time. Davy had worked first for the Reform Party, then for the United Party, and finally for Reform again. He was highly effective in both campaign management and fundraising, but often came into conflict with those he worked for. Politically, Davy was an advocate of reducing the size of government, and of minimising government intervention in the business world -- the slogan \\"More Business in Government, Less Government in Business\\", once used by the Reform Party, was thought up by Davy. When the United Party and the Reform Party formed a coalition, Davy initially supported it, but later resigned in protest at the legislation the coalition enacted to counter the Great Depression. Davy denounced the coalition as \\"socialistic by inclination, action and fact\\". In 1934, Davy was approached by William Goodfellow, a wealthy Auckland businessman and industrialist. Goodfellow strongly opposed the economic policies of the United-Reform Coalition, and was also concerned by the rise of the Labour Party. Goodfellow hoped that a small but committed party could hold the balance of power in Parliament, and force the government to adopt more business-friendly policies. It was hoped by Goodfellow and his allies that Davy's talents could create an effective organisation. In response to this, the New Zealand Democrat Party was founded. Its primary base of support was the business community, particularly in Auckland. Before long, however, Davy and Goodfellow came into conflict. The most notable cause for dispute was the scale of Davy's plans -- Goodfellow had wanted a small party focused on winning a select few seats, but Davy was recruiting candidates as though the Democrats were a major party. Goodfellow tried to remove Davy from the chairmanship of the Democrats in July 1935, and later initiated court proceedings to recover part of the salary Davy had been paid. Davy remained in office, however, and the Democrat Party continued on. The sitting Mayor of Wellington, Thomas Hislop, was recruited as the party's political leader, while Davy remained its chief organiser and strategist. 1935 election In the 1935 elections, Davy's campaign was not as effective as his previous efforts. The Democrats fielded fifty-one candidates, including seven former United Party candidates and members of Parliament including Bill Veitch and Arthur Stallworthy. However, the Democrats did not win any seats. In total, they won around 7.8% of the national vote (66,695 votes). Despite their failure to enter Parliament, their impact on the election may have been the opposite to what was intended -- by splitting the anti-Labour vote they probably contributed to Labour's overwhelming victory in 1935. Dissolution Among the defeated Democrat candidates were Frederick Doidge and Matthew Oram who would become future National Party MPs. Davy himself went on to found the People's Movement and the New Zealand Co-operative Party but eventually retired from politics and returned to business. The party's remnants amalgamated with the National Party in 1936.

The pinch runner may be faster or otherwise more skilled at base-running than the player for whom the pinch runner has been substituted. Occasionally a pinch runner is inserted for other reasons (such as a double switch), ejection, or if the original player on base has become injured (such as having been hit by a pitch). A pinch-runner is not credited with a game played for the purpose of consecutive game streaks, per Rule 10.24(c) of baseball's Official Rules. In fact, Alfredo Griffin of the Toronto Blue Jays scored the winning run in a game, yet his consecutive game streak ended as he appeared only as a pinch runner. As with other substitutions in baseball, when a player is pinch run for, that player is removed from the game. The pinch runner may remain in the game or be substituted for at the manager's discretion. Earlier in baseball history, teams would occasionally use \\"courtesy runners\\" as well as pinch runners. A baserunner that had to leave the game temporarily due to injury would be replaced by a courtesy runner. The courtesy runner could leave the game and re-enter later, or could be a player already in the game playing a different position. The player who had to leave the game was free to return to play. The last use of a courtesy runner in Major League Baseball was in 1949. Rule 3.04 of baseball's Official Rules now forbids courtesy runners. One of the most famous pinch runners was Herb Washington of the Oakland Athletics. Oakland owner Charlie Finley, known as an unconventional thinker, came to believe that it would be useful to have a \\"designated runner\\"‚Äîa fast player on the roster whose only job was to periodically enter a game and run the bases for slower players. He signed Washington, a track star with no baseball experience. Washington appeared in 105 games for the Athletics in 1974 and 1975, scoring 33 runs and stealing 31 bases, without once playing the field or coming up to bat. His 1975 Topps baseball card is the only baseball card in history to use the \\"Pinch Runner\\" position label. For statistical and scorekeeping purposes, the pinch runner is denoted by PR. History After organized professional baseball was started with the National League in 1876, the National League changed a rule in 1878 so that pinch runners were not allowed except in cases of illness or injury with the substitute entering the game after the original player reached base.

Career Livingston, known as 'Judge Livingston' to distinguish him from his eponymous father and other prominent Livingstons, was a member of the New York Provincial Assembly from 1759 to 1768. He served as judge of the admiralty court from 1760 to 1763. He was a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, and, in 1775, a member of the Committee of One Hundred, which briefly governed New York City. From 1763 until 1775, he served as a Justice of the New York Supreme Court of Judicature. Family Robert's daughter, Alida Livingston Armstrong and Daughter, by Rembrandt Peale, ca. 1810In 1742, he married Margaret Beekman, daughter of Col. Henry Beekman and Janet Livingston (his second cousin), a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman and heir to immense tracts of land in Dutchess and Ulster counties. Their children included: * Robert R. Livingston (1746‚Äì1813), the Chancellor of New York who married Mary Stevens, daughter of John Stevens, in 1770. * Janet Livingston (d. 1824), who married Gen.

John Armstrong, Sr. * Edward Livingston (1764‚Äì1836), a U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of State who married Mary McEvers, the daughter of Charles McEvers and Mary Bache, in 1788. After her death, he married Madame Louise Moreau de Lassy in 1805. She was the sister of Auguste Davezac. Livingston died on December 9, 1775 at his estate in Clermont, New York, several months after his own father's death on June 27, 1775. =Descendants= Through his son Major John R., he was the grandfather of Robert Montgomery Livingston (1790‚Äì1838), who married Sarah Barclay Bache in 1811. Livingston and his father were known for their quarrels with Cornelius Vanderbilt and Thomas Gibbons over his operation of steamboats and the breakup of the Chancellor Livingston and Gov. Aaron Ogden monopoly resulting from the landmark Supreme Court decision in Gibbons v. Ogden. His grandson-in-law was George Croghan, a nephew of William Clark, the explorer, Lewis Livingston, Charles Edward Livingston and George Rogers Clark. His granddaughters include Margaret Lewis, Elizabeth Stevens Livingston, Margaret Maria Livingston, Julia Livingston, and Coralie Livingston. Through Chancellor Livingston, he was the 2x great-grandfather of Mary Livingston Ludlow (1843‚Äì1919), herself the mother of his 3x great-granddaughter, Anna Hall Roosevelt (1863‚Äì1892), herself the mother of First Lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt (1884‚Äì1962).

However, the hylids include a diversity of frog species, many of which do not live in trees, but are terrestrial or semiaquatic.  Taxonomy and systematics The earliest known fossils that can be assigned to this family are from the Cretaceous of India and the state of Wyoming in the United States. The common name of \\"tree frog\\" is a popular name for several species of the family Hylidae. However, the name \\"treefrog\\" is not unique to this family, also being used for many species in the family Rhacophoridae. The following genera are recognised in the family Hylidae: * Subfamily Acrisinae ** Acris ‚Äì cricket frogs ** Pseudacris ‚Äì chorus frogs * Subfamily Cophomantinae ** Aplastodiscus ‚Äì canebrake treefrogs ** Boana ‚Äì gladiator treefrogs ** Bokermannohyla ** Hyloscirtus ** Myersiohyla ** Nesorohyla ** \\"Hyla\\" nicefori * Subfamily Dendropsophinae **Dendropsophus ** Xenohyla * Subfamily Hylinae ** Atlantihyla ** Bromeliohyla ** Charadrahyla ** Dryophytes - Ameroasian treefrogs ** Duellmanohyla ‚Äì brook frogs ** Ecnomiohyla ** Exerodonta ** Hyla ‚Äì common tree frogs ** Isthmohyla ** Megastomatohyla ** Plectrohyla ‚Äì spike-thumb frogs ** Ptychohyla ‚Äì stream frogs ** Quilticohyla ** Rheohyla - small-eared treefrog ** Sarcohyla ** Smilisca ‚Äì burrowing frogs ** Tlalocohyla ** Triprion ‚Äì shovel-headed tree frogs * Subfamily Lophyohylinae ** Aparasphenodon ‚Äì casque-headed frogs ** Argenteohyla ‚Äì Argentinian frogs ** Corythomantis ‚Äì casque-headed tree frog ** Dryaderces ** Itapotihyla ** Nyctimantis ‚Äì brown-eyed tree frogs ** Osteocephalus ‚Äì slender- legged tree frogs ** Osteopilus ** Phyllodytes ‚Äì heart-tongued frogs ** Phytotriades - Trinidad golden treefrogs ** Tepuihyla ‚Äì Amazon tree frogs ** Trachycephalus ‚Äì casque-headed tree frog * Subfamily Phyllomedusidae (leaf frogs) ** Agalychnis ** Callimedusa ** Cruziohyla ** Hylomantis ‚Äì rough leaf frogs ** Phasmahyla ‚Äì shining leaf frogs ** Phrynomedusa ‚Äì colored leaf frogs ** Phyllomedusa ** Pithecopus * Subfamily Pseudinae (harlequin frogs) ** Lysapsus - harlequin frogs ** Pseudis ‚Äì swimming frogs ** Scarthyla ‚Äì Madre de Dios tree frogs * Subfamily Scinaxinae ** Julianus ** Ololygon ** Scinax ‚Äì snouted tree frogs ** Sphaenorhynchus ‚Äì lime tree frogs * Incertae sedis ** \\"Hyla\\" imitator - mimic tree frog Description Most hylids show adaptations suitable for an arboreal lifestyle, including forward-facing eyes providing binocular vision, and adhesive pads on the fingers and toes. In the nonarboreal species, these features may be greatly reduced, or absent. Distribution and habitat The European tree frog (Hyla arborea) is common in the middle and south of Europe, and its range extends into Asia and North Africa. North America has many species of the family Hylidae, including the gray tree frog (Hyla versicolor) and the American green tree frog (H. cinerea). The spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) is also widespread in the eastern United States and is commonly heard on spring and summer evenings. Behaviour and ecology Species of the genus Cyclorana are burrowing frogs that spend much of their lives underground. =Breeding= Hylids lay their eggs in a range of different locations, depending on species. Many use ponds, or puddles that collect in the holes of their trees, while others use bromeliads or other water-holding plants. Other species lay their eggs on the leaves of vegetation hanging over water, allowing the tadpoles to drop into the pond when they hatch. A few species use fast-flowing streams, attaching the eggs firmly to the substrate. The tadpoles of these species have suckers enabling them to hold on to rocks after they hatch. Another unusual adaptation is found in some South American hylids, which brood the eggs on the back of the female. The tadpoles of most hylid species have laterally placed eyes and broad tails with narrow, filamentous tips. =Feeding= Hylids mostly feed on insects and other invertebrates, but some larger species can feed on small vertebrates.

It is a spin-off from the 2003 film Daredevil, starring the Marvel Comics character Elektra Natchios (portrayed by Jennifer Garner). The story follows Elektra, an assassin who must protect a man and his prodigy daughter from another assassin who was hired by The Hand. For the screenplay, Zak Penn, Stuart Zicherman, and Raven Metzner received \\"written by\\" credit. Mark Steven Johnson received credit for \\"motion picture characters\\" and Frank Miller for \\"comic book characters\\". Filming started around May 2004 in Vancouver. The film was released on January 14, 2005. Upon its release, Elektra was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $56 million against a production budget of $43‚Äì65 million. It received negative reviews from critics, who found the script and storyline lacking, but many praised Garner's acting as well as the action sequences. Plot After being killed in Daredevil, Elektra Natchios is revived by blind martial arts master Stick. He teaches her the ancient art of Kimagure, which provides its practitioners with precognition as well as the ability to resurrect the dead. Elektra is expelled from the training compound because of her inability to let go of her rage and fear of seeing her mother's killer as a child. She leaves and uses her training to become a contract killer. Years later, McCabe, Elektra's agent, receives an unusually large offer from an anonymous client wishing to hire Elektra. The only stipulation: she must spend a few days in a rented home on the island where the assassination is to be performed before the names of the targets are revealed. During the wait, Elektra catches a girl named Abby trying to steal her mother's necklace. She sends her away, and later meets and befriends her father, Mark Miller. Abby invites Elektra to dinner on Mark's behalf. Elektra develops a romantic interest in Mark but soon learns that he and Abby are the targets she has been hired to kill. Elektra spares them and leaves, but returns in time to protect them from assassins sent by The Hand, a crime syndicate of ninja mercenaries. Roshi, master of The Hand, learns of the failed attempt and permits his son Kirigi to lead a new team of assassins to kill Elektra and return with Abby, referred to as \\"The Treasure\\". Elektra tries to leave Abby and Mark with Stick, but he scolds her and tells her to protect them herself. She takes Mark and Abby to McCabe's country house, but is followed by Kirigi, Typhoid, Stone, Kinkou, and Tattoo. Elektra flees with Mark and Abby through a secret underground exit to an orchard, while McCabe sacrifices himself to buy them time. Kirigi and the assassins hunt down the trio in the orchard. Elektra kills Stone, while Abby and Mark kill Kinkou with one of his own daggers. As Elektra is distracted by the revelation that Abby has martial arts skills, Typhoid gives Elektra the \\"Kiss of Death\\". Abby is captured by Kirigi. Stick and his Chaste ninjas arrive, forcing Kirigi, Typhoid, and Tattoo to retreat. Stick saves Elektra from death and takes them under his protection. Stick confirms that Abby is the \\"Treasure\\", a martial arts prodigy, whom the Hand seeks to use. Elektra learns that she was a Treasure herself, resulting in her mother becoming a casualty of the fight between The Chaste and The Hand. She also guesses that Stick set up the hit on Mark and Abby in order to test Elektra's propensity for compassion. Elektra astrally projects herself to a meeting with Kirigi and challenges him to a fight, the winner claiming Abby for their own purpose. Elektra returns to her childhood home to face Kirigi and realizes that the horned demon who killed her mother was actually Kirigi. Elektra is defeated by Kirigi. Abby arrives and engages him long enough for Elektra to recuperate. Elektra and Abby then escape and hide in a hedge maze, but Abby is captured by snakes dispatched by Tattoo. Elektra finds Tattoo and snaps his neck, releasing Abby. Elektra engages Kirigi a second time and kills him. Typhoid poisons and kills Abby, before Elektra throws her sai at Typhoid, killing her. Elektra desperately tries to wake Abby, then calms herself, lets go all of her rage, and successfully resurrects her using Kimagure. Elektra gets ready to leave. She and Mark share one final kiss. Elektra tells Abby to live a normal life and that they each gave each other's life back. Elektra leaves, hoping that Abby won't grow up to be like her. Stick appears and points out that Elektra didn't turn out so bad. Elektra bows to Stick to thank him. He bows to Elektra, then disappears. Cast Ben Affleck reprised his role as Matt Murdock / Daredevil in a cameo, but was cut from the final film. The scene was included on the DVD as a deleted scene. Production Garner reportedly did not want to do the film and only did it because she was legally required due to contractual obligations from Daredevil. The film was made during Jennifer Garner's hiatus from the television show Alias, and production was limited by that timeframe. In March 2005 producer Avi Arad told investors that Marvel had made a mistake rushing Elektra into release. \\"We will never do that again,\\" he said. Rob Bowman stated that the film was \\"literally 12 frames of film from an R-rating\\" due to MPAA objections to several death scenes. Reception =Box office= Elektra opened on January 14, 2005 in the United States in 3,204 theatres. In its opening weekend, it ranked fifth, taking $12,804,793. In its second weekend, it took $3,964,598, a drop of 69%. Domestically the total gross was $24,409,722, at the time the lowest for a film featuring a Marvel Comics character since Howard the Duck. The film had a worldwide total of $56,681,566. =Critical response= The film received largely negative reviews from film critics. , the film holds an approval rating of 11% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 166 reviews with an average rating of 3.83/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Jennifer Garner inhabits her role with earnest gusto, but Elektra tone-deaf script is too self-serious and bereft of intelligent dialogue to provide engaging thrills.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. He writes: \\"Plays like a collision between leftover bits and pieces of Marvel superhero stories. It can't decide what tone to strike.\\" Helen O'Hara at Empire magazine gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, and says \\"Despite oozing star quality, Garner struggles to rise above the limitations of the script.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety writes: \\"Elektra\\" proves no more than fitfully satisfying, a character-driven superhero yarn whose flurry of last-minute rewriting shows in a disjointed plot.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today writes \\"Her (Garner) grace and mystical abilities make for a lonely burden, and we are supposed to feel her pain. Instead, we feel our own for having to sit through this silly movie.\\" Puig concluded that Garner \\"is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader writes: \\"This doesn't exactly set the world on fire, but I was charmed by its old- fashioned storytelling, which is refreshingly free of archness, self- consciousness, or \\"Kill Bill\\"-style wisecracks.\\" =Accolades= Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe were nominated for Best Kiss at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. Garner was nominated in the category Choice Movie Actress: Action Adventure/Thriller at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards. =Legacy= Film critic Scott Mendelson blamed the film for ruining Jennifer Garner's career, and said it killed off the notion of a female lead superhero movie for a decade. In an email released because of the Sony Pictures hack, Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter cited Elektra as an example of an unprofitable female led superhero film. He wrote: \\"Very bad idea and the end result was very, very bad.\\" In 2016 Katharine Trendacosta at io9 reviewed the film and called it \\"Somehow So Much Worse Than You Remember\\" and said that the version of Elektra in Netflix's Daredevil could only be an improvement. Home media The DVD of Elektra was released on April 5, 2005. It featured several deleted scenes, including one featuring Ben Affleck reprising his role from Elektras predecessor, Daredevil (2003). It was released on VHS on May 2005. =Director's cut= An extended and slightly refined two-disc unrated director's cut DVD was released in October 2005, featuring a cut detailed for home video release. Unlike the Daredevil director's cut which added about thirty minutes of material not in the original theatrical release, this version only changed about seven minutes of footage, extending the total runtime by just three minutes.https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=2524 It was also criticized for poor video transfer. A Blu-ray of Elektra was released on October 19, 2009 for the United Kingdom (and France) only. The US version was released on May 4, 2010. It contains only the unrated director's cut of the film. Soundtrack Elektra: The Album was released in 2005 by Wind-up Records. As with many Wind-up soundtracks, almost none of the songs featured on the album were actually used in the film. \\"Sooner or Later\\" is played briefly in one scene and a remix not included on this album of \\"Hollow\\" is also played. The end credits feature \\"Wonder\\", \\"Photograph\\", and \\"Thousand Mile Wish (Elektra Mix)\\": but other than this, none of the songs on the album were used in the actual motion picture. A score album was released by Var√®se Sarabande containing selections of Christophe Beck's original music from the film. Video game Elektra was also supposed to have a video game based on the movie with support from the comics. The game was never released, as publishers felt it would not be popular enough. A game based on the film was released for mobile.

It is interrupted by the Casparian strip in roots, by air spaces between plant cells and by the plant cuticle. Structurally, the apoplast is formed by the continuum of cell walls of adjacent cells as well as the extracellular spaces, forming a tissue level compartment comparable to the symplast. The apoplastic route facilitates the transport of water and solutes across a tissue or organ. This process is known as apoplastic transport. The apoplast is important for all the plant's interaction with its environment. The main carbon source (carbon dioxide) needs to be solubilized in the apoplast before it diffuses through the plasma membrane into the cell's cytoplasm (symplast) and is used by the chloroplasts during photosynthesis. In the roots, ions diffuse into the apoplast of the epidermis before diffusing into the symplast, or in some cases being taken up by specific ion channels, and being pulled by the plant's transpiration stream, which also occurs completely within the boundaries of the apoplast. Similarly, all gaseous molecules emitted and received by plants such as plant hormones and other pheromones must pass the apoplast. In nitrate poor soils, acidification of the apoplast increases cell wall extensibility and root growth rate. This is believed to be caused by a decrease in nitrate uptake (due to deficit in the soil medium) and supplanted with an increase in chloride uptake. H+ATPase increases the efflux of H+, thus acidifying the apoplast. The apoplast is also a site for cell-to-cell communication. During local oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions can diffuse through the apoplast and transport a warning signal to neighbouring cells. In addition, a local alkalinization of the apoplast due to such a stress can travel within minutes to the rest of the plant body via the xylem and trigger systemic acquired resistance. The apoplast also plays an important role in resistance to aluminium toxicity and resistance. In addition to resistance to chemicals, the apoplast provides the rich environment for microorganisms endophytes which arises the abiotic resistance of plants. Exclusion of aluminium ions in the apoplast prevent toxic levels which inhibit shoot growth, reducing crop yields History The term apoplast was coined in 1930 by M√ºnch in order to separate the \\"living\\" symplast from the \\"dead\\" apoplast.M√ºnch, E (1930). Die Stoffbewegungen in der Pflanze. Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena. Apoplastic transport The apoplastic pathway is one of the two main pathways for water transport in plants, the other being symplastic pathway. In apoplastic transport, water and minerals flow in an upward direction via the apoplast to the xylem in the root. The concentration of solutes transported in aboveground organs is established through a combination of import from the xylem, absorption by cells, and export by the phloem. Transport velocity is higher in the apoplast than the symplast. This method of transport also accounts for a higher proportion of water transport in plant tissues than does symplastic transport. The apoplastic pathway is also involved in passive exclusion. Some of the ions that enter through the roots do not make it to the xylem. The ions are excluded by the plasma membranes of the endodermal cells.  Apoplastic colonization  It is well known that the apoplast in plants‚Äô tissues contains rich mineral nutrients, and it becomes the main factor for microorganisms to thrive at the apoplast. Even though there are apoplastic immunity systems, but there are pathogens that have effectors that can modulate the host immunity or suppress the immunity responses as known as effector-triggered susceptibility. Another factor that pathogens colonize the apoplastic space so frequent is because when they enter the plants from leaves, the first place they come across is the apoplastic space. Therefore, the apoplast is a popular biotic interface and also a reservoir for microbes. One of the common apoplastic disease appear in plants without restricted habitat or climate is black rot, caused by the gram-negative bacteria Xanthomonas campestris. Entophytic bacteria can cause severe problems in agriculture in a way of inhibiting plant growth by alkalizing the apoplast with their volatiles. In especially, the rhizobacteria has been found that its major component of the volatiles are phytotoxic, it is identified as 2-phenylethanol. 2-phenylethanol can influence the regulation of WRKY18 which is a transcription factor that engages in multiple plant hormones, one of them is abscisic acid (ABA) hormone. 2-phyenlethanol modulates the sensitivity of ABA through WRKY18 and WRKY40, but WRKY18 is the central mediator of the pathway of triggering cell death and modulation of ABA sensitivity influenced by 2-phyenlethanol. Therefore, it results in the inhibition of root growth, and the plants have no capacity to grow without having the roots absorb nutrients in soils. However, the microbial colonization in the apoplast is not always harmful to the plants, indeed, it can be beneficial to establish a symbiotic relationship with the host. One of the examples is the endophytic and phyllosphere microbes can indirectly promote plant growth and protect the plant from other pathogens by inducing salicylic acid (SA)and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways, and they are both parts of the pathogen associated molecular patterns triggered immunity (PTI). The productions of SA and JA hormones also modulate the ABA signaling to be the components on the defense gene expression, and there are a lot more responses with the involvement of other hormones to respond to different biotic and abiotic stress. In the experiment performed by Romero et al., they inoculated the known entophytic bacteria, Xanthomonas into Canola, a plant that grows in multiple habitats, and it is found its apopalstic fluids that are 99% identity to another bacteria, Pseudomonas viridiflava, by performing 16S rRNA sequences with the Genebank and reference strains. They further used the markers on the SA- responsive transcriptional factor and other specific genes such as lipoxygenase 3 as marker genes for JA signaling and ABA signaling to perform quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. It has shown Xanthomonas only activates the related gene of SA pathway, in comparison, Pseudomonas viridiflava is able to trigger the genes of both SA and JA pathway, which suggest Pseudomonas viridiflava originally in Canola can stimulate PTI by the accumulation of both signaling pathway to inhibit the growth of Xanthomonas. In conclusion, the apoplast acts as a crucial role in plants, involving in all kinds of regulations of hormone and transportation of nutrients, so once it has been colonized, the effect it brings cannot be neglected. See also *Symplast *Tonoplast *Vacuolar pathway Notes #Apoplast was previously defined as \\"everything but the symplast, consisting of cell walls and spaces between cells in which water and solutes can move freely\\". However, since solutes can neither freely move through the air spaces between plant cells nor through the cuticle, this definition has been changed. When referring to \\"everything outside the plasma membrane\\", the term \\"extracellular space\\" is in use. #The word apoplasm is also in use with similar meaning as apoplast, although less common.

Symplast cells have more than one nucleus. (Water and low molecular weight pass through pore in the adjacent cell walls)And cytoplasmic connection through pore are known as plasmodesmata.. The plasmodesmata allow the direct flow of small molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and ions between cells. Larger molecules, including transcription factors and plant viruses, can also be transported through with the help of actin structures. This allows direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm flow of water and other nutrients along concentration gradients. In particular, symplastic flow is used in the root systems to bring in nutrients from soil. It moves these solutes from epidermis cells through the cortex into the endodermis. Once solutes reach the endodermal cells through apoplastic flow, they are forced into the symplastic pathway due to the presence of the Casparian strip. Once the solutes are passively filtered, they eventually reach the pericycle, where it can be moved into the xylem for long distance transport. It is contrasted with the apoplastic flow, which uses cell wall transport.

November 3, 1710 Albany, New York ‚Äì December 28, 1792 Elizabethtown, Union County, New Jersey) was a Patriot during the American Revolution who was a wealthy merchant and who served as the 1st New York State Treasurer from 1776 to 1778. Early life Peter Van Brugh Livingston was the second surviving son of Philip Livingston (1686‚Äì1749), the 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor, and Catharine Van Brugh (b. 1689). His older brother was Robert Livingston (1708‚Äì1790) and his younger brothers included Philip Livingston (1716‚Äì1778), a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and William Livingston (1723‚Äì1790), a signer of the United States Constitution and the 1st Governor of New Jersey. Livingston graduated from Yale College in 1731, and settled in New York City. Livingston's mother was the only child of his namesake, Pieter Van Brugh (1666‚Äì1740), the Mayor of Albany, New York from 1699 to 1700 and from 1721 to 1723. His grandfather's sister, Catharina Van Brugh, married Hendrick van Rensselaer, the son of Jeremias van Rensselaer, patroon of Rensselaerswyck. Livingston's maternal great-grandfather, Johannes Pieterse van Brugh (1624‚Äì1697), was one of the early settlers of New Netherland and was prominently connected with the Dutch West India Company. His paternal grandparents were Alida Schuyler (1656‚Äì1727) and Robert Livingston the Elder (1654‚Äì1728), and his uncle was Robert Livingston (1688‚Äì1775) of Clermont. Career After his graduation from Yale, he became engaged in the shipping business with William Alexander, Lord Stirling. He was also engaged in the slave trade with his father. Livingston's mercantile interests involved activities in the West Indies, North Carolina, and Fort Niagara, where he was involved in the fur trade.Dunn, Walter Scott.

In 1755, he furnished the supplies for the expedition of Governor William Shirley to Acadia. In 1775, he was a member of the Committee of One Hundred. He was a delegate to the New York Provincial Congresses, and was President from May 1775 to August 1775 and from September 1776 to March 1777. He was also Chairman of the Committee of Safety from September 1776 to March 1777. In 1776, he was appointed Treasurer by the Provincial Congress, and remained in office until 1778, after the establishment of the State Government. Personal life His home in New York City was a large mansion on the east side of what is now Hanover Square, with grounds extending to the East River. Later he removed to Elizabethtown, N.J., and died there at the Liberty Hall. On November 3, 1739, Peter Van Brugh Livingston he married Mary Alexander (1721‚Äì1767), the daughter of James Alexander and Mary Spratt Provoost, and the sister of his business associate, Lord Stirling. Before her death in 1767, they had twelve children, including: * Philip Peter Livingston (1740‚Äì1810), who was known as \\"Gentleman Phil,\\" and who married Cornelia Van Horne (b. 1759). * Mary Livingston (1742), who died in infancy. * Catherine Livingston (1743‚Äì1775), who married Nicholas Bayard. * James Alexander Livingston (b. 1744). * Mary Livingston (b. 1746), who married Capt.

The opposition Social Democratic Party later used his comments against him during the presidential campaign. =Activism= The primary LGBT rights defender in Romania, ACCEPT, has advocated for partnership rights for same-sex couples as well as for same-sex marriage in Romania. The organisation launched a campaign to legalise same-sex unions in Romania during the Bucharest GayFest 2006, which lasted from 30 May to 4 June, and was organised under the theme of \\"Same-sex marriage and civil unions in Romania\\". This event provoked widespread debate over the issue in the media. LGBT activists from ACCEPT organised a public debate and seminar on same-sex unions on 31 May, and called on the Government of Romania to provide marriage or at least registered partnership for same-sex couples, offering its assistance in forming a legislative proposal. A treia edi≈£ie GayFest (The third edition of GayFest), HotNews, 25 May 2006 Romani≈£a Iordache, the president of ACCEPT, stated on 31 May 2006 that \\"Article 200 [the last anti-gay law] has been abrogated, but we [the LGBT community] still do not have equal rights, even though the Constitution guarantees this.\\" Homosexualii romani vor casatorie cu acte (Romanian gays want to marry legally), Libertatea, 31 May 2006 The spokesman of ACCEPT, Florin Buhuceanu, claimed that, \\"guaranteeing the equality of rights through the recognition of gay marriage... is just a step forward.\\"Romanians launch campaign to legalize same-sex marriage, AP/Dallas Voice, 1 June 2006 Romania's first religious same-sex marriage ceremony took place on 5 June 2006, following the Bucharest GayFest, when Florin Buhuceanu, the executive director of ACCEPT, married his Spanish partner of four years. The symbolic marriage, which has no legal status in Romania, was blessed by the Metropolitan Community Church in Bucharest, an international denomination which recognises same-sex unions and supports LGBT rights. The couple married officially later in 2006, in a civil marriage in Spain, where same-sex marriage is legal.

Previously, the law had only used the words \\"between spouses\\". The amendment was approved with 38 votes for, 10 votes against and 19 senators abstaining. \\"CƒÉsƒÉtoriile gay, interzise √Æn Rom√¢nia\\", Mediafax, 13 February 2008 It was not voted on in the Chamber of Deputies, and as new elections took place at the end of that year, the legislation died. In May 2009, a new Civil Code was proposed by the Government. The Parliamentary Subcommittee responsible for the Civil Code decided to amend the definition of marriage, mentioning explicitly that it must be \\"between a man and a woman\\". Furthermore, an amendment was passed stating that the Romanian state would not recognise foreign same-sex marriages. \\"Codul Civil interzice cƒÉsƒÉtoriile √Æntre homosexuali\\", Mediafax, May 14, 2009Romania has prohibited same-sex marriages Article 259 (1) of the Civil Code states that marriage is \\"the freely consented union between one man and one woman\\". In addition, Article 277 (1) of the code emphasizes that \\"marriage shall be prohibited between persons of the same sex\\". 2018 European Court of Justice ruling In 2018, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in favour of a Romanian man, Adrian Coman, who was seeking to have his marriage to his American husband Clai Hamilton recognised. They had married in 2010 in Belgium, where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2003. European Union law permits a non-EU spouse of an EU citizen to join their spouse in the member state where the European national resides. However, Romanian authorities refused to issue a residence permit to Hamilton, saying he could not be recognised as Coman's spouse because Romanian law prohibits same-sex marriages. The couple filed suit, arguing that the refusal was discrimination based on sexual orientation, which is banned in Romania. The Constitutional Court heard the case in 2016 and later decided to consult the ECJ on the matter. The ECJ began examining the case in November 2017.Romania Gay Marriage Case Could Have Outsize Impact in Europe, The New York Times, 21 November 2017 In January 2018, Advocate General Melchior Wathelet advised the court to rule in favour of the couple: Opinions of the Advocate General are not legally binding but are normally followed by the court.Gay spouses have rights in all EU countries, says European court official, The Guardian, 11 January 2018 The ECJ found in the couple's favour on 5 June 2018, ruling that EU member states may choose whether or not to allow same-sex marriage, but they cannot obstruct the freedom of residence of an EU citizen and their spouse. Furthermore, the court ruled that the term \\"spouse\\" is gender-neutral, and that it does not necessarily imply a person of the opposite sex. Coman welcomed the ruling, saying: \\"We can now look in the eyes of any public official in Romania and across the EU with certainty that our relationship is equally valuable and equally relevant for the purpose of free movement within the EU.\\"EU states must recognize foreign same-sex marriages: court, Reuters, 5 June 2018 The ruling was well received by White & Case, the law firm which represented the couple, as well as the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) and other human rights groups, but drew criticism from religious and conservative groups.Landmark EU marriage ruling hailed as big win for gay rights, Thomson Reuters Foundation News, 5 June 2018 The Romanian Orthodox Church called the ruling \\"anti-democratic\\".East European church leaders fret about same-sex marriage ruling, Crux: Covering all things Catholic, 9 June 2018 On 18 July 2018, the Romanian Constitutional Court ruled that the state must grant residency rights to the same-sex partners of European Union citizens.

Civil unions Registered partnerships have not been legislated for in Romania, despite several failed attempts in the past. =History= On 23 February 2008, P√©ter Eckstein-Kov√°cs, a parliamentarian from the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, proposed the legalisation of registered partnerships which would have allowed unmarried same-sex and opposite-sex couples a number of rights.

One bill recognised unions of same-sex and opposite-sex couples \\"for the purpose of setting up a shared private life and household\\". The other bill proposed shared rights for couples entering such a partnership and covered aspects such as succession rights, sanctions against domestic violence, the obligation to support an incapacitated partner, and fiscal facilities or social benefits granted by the state. Health-related rights In June 2019, the Chamber of Deputies voted in favour of amending patient rights legislation, to allow patients to designate any person over 18 years of age as their \\"legal representative\\" through a statutory declaration. This allows same-sex partners (among others) to visit their partners in hospital and to make medical decisions on their behalf. The initiator of the law specifically referred to the fact that 10% of Romanians live in de facto unions as one of the reasons for the reform. The law was promulgated by the President on 24 July 2019 and came into effect on 28 July 2019. While the law does not specifically mention same-sex couples, it provides a mechanism for same-sex couples to obtain equal visitation and medical decision-making rights to different-sex married couples, by appointing themselves as \\"legal representatives\\" through a notary public. Attempts to amend Constitution Article 48 of the Constitution of Romania states: Amending the Romanian Constitution requires approval by the people through a referendum. Until 2014, referendums required a 50% turnout to be valid,Referendum for Referendums by Corneliu Visoianu, Romania‚Äôs Constitutional Court invalidated the ballot as it did not reach the 50% threshold required by law. but changes to electoral law subsequently reduced this to 30%. =June 2013 attempts= On 5 June 2013, a parliamentary committee tasked with reviewing the Constitution voted to include sexual orientation as a protected ground against discrimination in the new Constitution. The same committee voted, the following day, to change the current marriage law form, which describes marriage as \\"a consensual union between spouses\\", to the more restrictive form, describing it \\"as a union between a man and a woman alone\\", thus banning same-sex marriage.Balkan Insight, Romania's New Constitution Bans Gay Marriage, 7 June 2013. Green Party MP Remus Cernea, who is a staunch supporter of LGBT rights and who introduced a draft law to the Senate in order to legalize civil unions, thought of the move to ban same-sex marriage as \\"clearly a democratic setback; Romania should now be included among the most homophobic countries in the world.\\" Dozens of NGOs protested the move and released a common statement arguing that the protection provision should remain in the new Constitution: Florin Buhuceanu, president of the LGBT rights defender NGO, ACCEPT, said: Csaba Asztalos, president of the National Council for Combating Discrimination, thought that the new amendments Faced with a series of backlashes from civil society and domestic and international organizations, such as ACCEPT and Amnesty International,Romania Insider, Amnesty worried that Romanian Constitution changes on definition of family might cause discrimination, 7 June 2013. the committee retracted both amendments. Save Romania Union was the only party with parliamentary representation that positioned against a potential referendum to amend the constitutional definition of the family and ban same-sex marriage in Romania. Since its establishment, several party members, including deputies and senators, have attended Bucharest Pride and Cluj Pride, respectively. =2018 referendum= The Romanian Government announced plans to hold a referendum in the fall of 2017, following a successful citizens' initiative by a group opposed to same- sex marriage, Coali»õia pentru Familie, which collected an estimated 3 million signatures in support of banning same-sex marriage. The Chamber of Deputies approved the initiative on 9 May 2017, in a 232-22 vote.Initiative changing family definition in Romanian Constitution, voted by the deputies However, no referendum was held that year. The Government proposed referendum dates of May and June 2018, though these passed without a vote.Romania: PSD head announces referendum on amending the Constitution, Independent Balkan News Agency, 25 July 2018 Eventually, the referendum was confirmed to be held on 6 and 7 October 2018. Less than two weeks out from the vote, on 27 September 2018, the Constitutional Court of Romania ruled that same-sex couples have the same rights to privacy and family life as heterosexual couples. The ruling, hailed as a landmark by LGBT advocacy groups the country, stated that legal rights and obligations should be equal under law. Nonetheless, the referendum proceeded as planned on 6 and 7 October 2018. It failed to achieve validity as the turnout was 21.1%, well below the 30% required under the law. The lowest turnout (8.5%) was recorded in Covasna County. The highest turnout (30.7%) was in Suceava County, the only county to surpass the 30% threshold. Referendum national pentru revizuirea Constitutiei Political viewpoints With the exceptions of Save Romania Union and the Green Party, none of Romania's major political parties, either in government or in opposition, explicitly supports same-sex marriage or registered partnerships, or has proposed any law regarding it, resulting in the debate about this issue in the political sphere being more reserved than in civil society and the media. On 6 June 2006, the Cotidianul newspaper conducted interviews with representatives of the five main political parties, asking them about their stance on same-sex marriage. Familia Florin ≈üi Raul nu prime≈üte credit cu buletinul, Cotidianul, 6 June 2006 Crin Antonescu, the leader of the parliamentary delegation of the National Liberal Party, part of the governing alliance, declined to give an official party view on the matter. Instead, he said that \\"both the party and myself have given proof that we are in favour of recognising sexual minorities. However, personally I am against marriage between people of the same sex\\". The leader of the Democratic Party, the other large governing coalition member, was similarly elusive, stating that: \\"Now is not the right moment to talk about this issue [same-sex marriage]. We now have other much more important things to do regarding European integration. Let's integrate firstly, and then we can see the way in which mentalities change. Eventually, we will discuss this issue then\\". Romania's EU accession took place in January 2007. Liviu Negoi≈£ƒÉ, the Democrat Mayor of Bucharest's Sector 3, stated that \\"if a law will exist [legalising same-sex marriage], I will respect it. As a mayor, I don't have any other choice. Personally, I respect the sexual choice of each person\\". Vanghelie: 'Sa se duca in Congo!' (Vanghelie: They should go to Congo!), Libertatea, 1 June 2006 The largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose stance on social issues is usually more conservative than that of the governing parties, stated that they would \\"not initiate and would not support such a legislative proposal\\". However, the party's official spokesperson also proclaimed that, \\"a public debate [on same-sex marriage] is necessary, in order to see in what way the standards regarding fundamental liberties can be improved in regard to people with another sexual orientation\\". Opposition was seen most clearly from the far-right, nationalist Greater Romania Party. The vice-president of the party stated that \\"clearly, we wouldn't initiate such a legislative proposal, since we're a Christian party. The sin of sodomy is one of the biggest [sins]\\". The Conservative Party was less vocal in its opposition to same-sex marriage, with Octavian Petrovici, the vice-president of the party's Bucharest division, stating about same-sex couples that \\"it's their own choice, and in the same way that we respect the option of every citizen, we respect the choice of these people. However, it is a long way from respecting a choice to making special laws, which do not match the values and principles that our party affirms\\". On 27 November 2006, the women's organisation of the Conservative Party adopted a resolution opposing same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption. The resolution declared that \\"the family has as its primary aim our continuity and we will continue to support its development, particularly since we will be confronted in the future with an accentuated process of aging and a significant reduction in the population. We reject categorically the legalisation of same-sex marriage\\". Vest Flash, Evenimentul Zilei, 27 November 2006 On 10 June 2007, after the annual Bucharest GayFest, the Conservative Party reiterated its position on same-sex marriage, stating: \\"The sexual options of each citizen are accepted and respected in Romania, but from here until the adoption of special laws for sexual minorities is too long a way. We support the definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman\\".

This population occurred in Barbary Coastal regions of Maghreb from the Atlas Mountains to Egypt and was eradicated following the spreading of firearms and bounties for shooting lions. A comprehensive review of hunting and sighting records revealed that small groups of lions may have survived in Algeria until the early 1960s, and in Morocco until the mid-1960s. Until 2017, the Barbary lion was considered a distinct lion subspecies. Results of morphological and genetic analyses of lion samples from North Africa published in 2008 showed that the Barbary lion does not differ significantly from lion samples collected in West and northern parts of Central Africa. It falls into the same phylogeographic group as the Asiatic lion., and is also closely related to lion populations in West Africa. The Barbary lion was also called \\"North African lion\\", \\"Berber lion\\", \\"Atlas lion\\", and \\"Egyptian lion\\". Characteristics Barbary lion zoological specimens range in colour from light to dark tawny. Male lion skins had short manes, light manes, dark manes or long manes. Head-to-tail length of stuffed males in zoological collections varies from , and of females around . Skull size varied from . Some manes extended over the shoulder and under the belly to the elbows. The mane hair was long. In 19th century hunter accounts, the Barbary lion was claimed to be the largest lion, with a weight of wild males ranging from . Yet, the accuracy of such data measured in the field is questionable. Captive Barbary lions were much smaller but kept under so poor conditions that they might not have attained their full potential size and weight. The colour and size of lions' manes was long thought to be a sufficiently distinct morphological characteristic to accord a subspecific status to lion populations. Mane development varies with age and between individuals from different regions, and is therefore not a sufficient characteristic for subspecific identification. The size of manes is not regarded as evidence for Barbary lions' ancestry. Instead, results of mitochondrial DNA research support the genetic distinctness of Barbary lions in a unique haplotype found in museum specimens that is thought to be of Barbary lion descent. The presence of this haplotype is considered a reliable molecular marker to identify captive Barbary lions. Barbary lions may have developed long-haired manes, because of lower temperatures in the Atlas Mountains than in other African regions, particularly in winter. Results of a long-term study on lions in Serengeti National Park indicate that ambient temperature, nutrition and the level of testosterone influence the colour and size of lion manes. Taxonomic history Map shows range of P. l. leo and P. l. melanochaita Felis leo was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a lion type specimen from Constantine, Algeria. Following Linnaeus's description, several lion zoological specimens from North Africa were described and proposed as subspecies in the 19th century: *Felis leo barbaricus described by the Austrian zoologist Johann Nepomuk Meyer in 1826 was a lion skin from the Barbary Coast. *Felis leo nubicus described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1843 was a male lion from Nubia that had been sent by Antoine Clot from Cairo to Paris and died in the M√©nagerie du Jardin des Plantes in 1841. In the 20th century, there has been much debate and controversy among zoologists on lion classification and validity of proposed subspecies: *In 1939, Glover Morrill Allen considered F. l. barbaricus and nubicus synonymous with F. l. leo. *Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the lion to the genus Panthera, when he wrote about the Asiatic lion. *In 1951, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott recognized only two lion subspecies in the Palearctic realm, namely the African lion Panthera leo leo and the Asiatic lion P. l. persica. *Some authors considered P. l. nubicus a valid subspecies and synonymous with P. l. massaica. *In 2005, P. l. barbarica, nubica and somaliensis were subsumed under P. l. leo. *In 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used P. l. leo for all lion populations in Africa. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group subsumed the lion populations in North, West and Central Africa and Asia to P. l. leo. =Genetic research= Results of a phylogeographic analysis using samples from African and Asiatic lions was published in 2006. One of the African samples was a vertebra from the National Museum of Natural History (France) that originated in the Nubian part of Sudan. In terms of mitochondrial DNA, it grouped with lion skull samples from the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and the northern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the historical Barbary lion was morphologically distinct, its genetic uniqueness remained questionable. In a comprehensive study about the evolution of lions in 2008, 357 samples of wild and captive lions from Africa and India were examined. Results showed that four captive lions from Morocco did not exhibit any unique genetic characteristic, but shared mitochondrial haplotypes with lion samples from West and Central Africa. They were all part of a major mtDNA grouping that also included Asiatic lion samples. Results provided evidence for the hypothesis that this group developed in East Africa, and about 118,000 years ago traveled north and west in the first wave of lion expansion. It broke up within Africa, and later in West Asia. Lions in Africa probably constitute a single population that interbred during several waves of migration since the Late Pleistocene. Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion specimen from Sudan clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita. Former distribution and habitat The last photograph of a wild lion in the Atlas Mountains, taken by Marcelin Flandrin on a flight from Casablanca to Dakar in 1925 Painting of a lion hunt in Morocco by Eug√®ne Delacroix, 1855, in the Hermitage Museum Historical accounts indicate that in Egypt lions occurred in the Sinai Peninsula, along the Nile, in the Eastern and Western Deserts, in the region of Wadi El Natrun and along the maritime coast of the Mediterranean. In the 14th century BC, Thutmose IV hunted lions in the hills near Memphis. The growth of civilizations along the Nile and in the Sinai Peninsula by the beginning of the second millennium BC and desertification contributed to isolating lion populations in North Africa. Historical sighting and hunting records from the 19th and 20th centuries show that lions inhabited the range countries of the Atlas Mountains from Tunisia to Morocco. In Libya, the Barbary lion persisted along the Mediterranean coast until the beginning of the 18th century, and was extirpated in Tunisia by 1890. In Algeria, the Barbary lion occurred in the forested hills and mountains between the Pic de Taza in the east, Ouarsenis in the west and the Chelif River plains in the north. Lions also inhabited the forests and wooded hills of the Constantine Province and south into the Aur√®s Mountains. In the 1830s, lions may have already been eliminated along the coast and near human settlements.. By the mid-19th century, the lion population had massively declined, since bounties were paid for shooting lions. The cedar forests of Chelia and neighbouring mountains harboured lions until about 1884. They disappeared in the B√¥ne region by 1890, in the Khroumire and Souk Ahras regions by 1891, and in Batna Province by 1893. The last known sighting of a lion in Algeria occurred in 1956 in Beni Ourtilane District. In Morocco, the last recorded shooting of a wild Barbary lion took place in 1942 near Tizi n'Tichka in the Atlas Mountains. A small remnant population may have survived in remote montane areas into the early 1960s. Behaviour and ecology In the early 20th century, when Barbary lions were not common anymore, they were sighted in pairs or in small family groups comprising a male and female lion with one or two cubs. Between 1839 and 1942, sightings of wild lions involved solitary animals, pairs and family units. Analysis of these sightings indicate that lions retained living in prides even when under increasing persecution, particularly in the eastern Maghreb. The size of prides was likely similar to prides living in sub-Saharan habitats, whereas the density of the Barbary lion population is considered to have been lower than in moister habitats. When Barbary stags and gazelles became scarce in the Atlas Mountains, lions preyed on herds of livestock that were rather carefully tended. They also preyed on wild boar and red deer. Sympatric predators in this area included the African leopard and Atlas bear. In captivity The lions kept in the menagerie at the Tower of London in the Middle Ages were Barbary lions, as shown by DNA testing on two well-preserved skulls excavated at the Tower between 1936 and 1937. The skulls were radiocarbon-dated to around 1280‚Äì1385 and 1420‚àí1480. In the 19th century and the early 20th century, lions were often kept in hotels and circus menageries. In 1835, the lions in the Tower of London were transferred to improved enclosures at the London Zoo on the orders of the Duke of Wellington. The lions in the Rabat Zoo exhibited characteristics thought typical for the Barbary lion. Nobles and Berber people presented lions as gifts to the royal family of Morocco. When the family was forced into exile in 1953, the lions in Rabat, numbering 21 altogether, were transferred to two zoos in the region. 3 of these were shifted to a zoo in Casablanca, with the rest being shifted to Mekn√®s. The lions at Mekn√®s were moved back to the palace in 1955, but those at Casablanca never came back. In the late 1960s, new lion enclosures were built in Temara near Rabat. Results of a mtDNA research revealed in 2006 that a lion kept in the German Zoo Neuwied originated from this collection and is very likely a descendant of a Barbary lion. Five lion samples from this collection were not Barbary lions maternally. Nonetheless, genes of the Barbary lion are likely to be present in common European zoo lions, since this was one of the most frequently introduced subspecies. Many lions in European and American zoos, which are managed without subspecies classification, are most likely descendants of Barbary lions. Several researchers and zoos supported the development of a studbook of lions directly descended from the King of Morocco's collection. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Addis Ababa Zoo kept 16 adult lions. With their dark, brown manes extending through the front legs, they looked like Barbary or Cape lions. Their ancestors were caught in southwestern Ethiopia as part of a zoological collection for Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. In March 2010, two lion cubs were moved to the Texas Zoo in Victoria, Texas, where efforts were made to preserve Barbary lions under the WildLink International conservation programme. Whether the cubs are of Barbary lion descent was not determined.Prince, A. (2010). Austin Zoo Says Goodbye to Lion Cubs . Austin Zoo and Animal Sanctuary, Austin. In 2011, the Port Lympne Animal Park in Kent received a Barbary lioness as a mate for the resident male.BBC (2011). Breeding hopes for Barbary lions at Port Lympne. BBC News. As of June 2016, Wisconsin Big Cat Rescue in Rock Springs, Wisconsin, has two female lions born in 2001 that have been shown by DNA testing to be Atlas lions. The Living Treasures Wild Animal Park in New Castle, Pennsylvania, claims to keep a pair of Barbary lions in the park's collection.Living Treasures Wild Animal Park (2011). . The Zoo des Sables d'Olonne, Vendee, France, also claims to have a male and female Atlas lion. Cultural significance The lion appeared frequently in early Egyptian art and literature. Statues and statuettes of lions found at Hierakonpolis and Koptos in Upper Egypt date to the Early Dynastic Period. The early Egyptian deity Mehit was depicted with a lion head. In Ancient Egypt, the lion-headed deity Sekhmet was venerated as protector of the country. She represented destructive power, but was also regarded as protector against famine and disease. Lion- headed figures and amulets were excavated in tombs in the Aegean islands of Crete, Euboea, Rhodes, Paros and Chios. They are associated with Sekhmet and date to the early Iron Age between the 9th and 6th centuries BC. The remains of seven mostly subadult lions were excavated at the necropolis Umm El Qa'ab in a tomb of Hor-Aha, dated to the 31st century BC. In 2001, the skeleton of a mummified lion was found in the tomb of Ma√Øa in a necropolis dedicated to Tutankhamun at Saqqara. It had probably lived and died in the Ptolemaic period, showed signs of malnutrition and had probably lived in captivity for many years. In Roman North Africa, lions were regularly captured by experienced hunters for venatio spectacles in amphitheatres.

The film is a fictionalised re-telling of the life of Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. It is the film debut of Tilda Swinton and Sean Bean. Plot Told in a segmented fashion, the film opens as Caravaggio (Nigel Terry) dies from lead poisoning while in exile, with only his long-time deaf-dumb companion Jerusaleme (Spencer Leigh) (who was given by his family to the artist as a boy) by his side. Caravaggio thinks back to his life as a teenage street ruffian (Dexter Fletcher) who hustles and paints. While taken ill and in the care of priests, young Caravaggio catches the eye of Cardinal Del Monte (Michael Gough). Del Monte nurtures Caravaggio's artistic and intellectual development but also appears to molest him. As an adult, Caravaggio still lives under the roof and paints with the funding of Del Monte. Caravaggio is shown employing street people, drunks and prostitutes as models for his intense, usually religious paintings (see the article on the painter for examples). He is depicted as frequently brawling, gambling, getting drunk and is implied to sleep with both male and female models. In the art world, Caravaggio is regarded as vulgar and entitled for his Vatican connections. One day, Ranuccio (Sean Bean), a street fighter for pay, catches Caravaggio's eye as a subject and potential lover. Ranuccio also introduces Caravaggio to his girlfriend Lena (Tilda Swinton), who also becomes an object of attraction and a model to the artist. When both Ranuccio and Lena are separately caught kissing Caravaggio, each displays jealousy over the artist's attentions. One day, Lena announces she is pregnant (although she does not state who the father is) and will become a mistress to the wealthy Scipione Borghese (Robbie Coltrane). Soon, she is found murdered by drowning. As the weeping Ranuccio looks on, Caravaggio and Jerusaleme clean Lena's body. Caravaggio is shown painting Lena after she dies and mournfully writhing with her body. Ranuccio is arrested for Lena's murder, although he claims to be innocent. Caravaggio pulls strings and goes to the Pope himself to free Ranuccio. When Ranuccio is freed, he tells Caravaggio he killed Lena so they could be together. In response, Caravaggio cuts Ranuccio's throat, killing him. Back on his deathbed, Caravaggio is shown having visions of himself as a boy and trying to refuse the last rites offered him by the priests. Production =Set design= In keeping with Caravaggio's use of contemporary dress for his Biblical figures, Jarman intentionally includes several anachronisms in the film that do not fit with Caravaggio's life in the 16th century. In one scene, Caravaggio is in a bar lit with electric lights. Another character is seen using an electronic calculator. Car horns are heard honking outside Caravaggio's studio and in one scene Caravaggio is seen leaning on a green truck. Cigarette smoking, a motorbike, and the use of a manual typewriter also featured in the film. =Production design= The production designer was Christopher Hobbs who was also responsible for the copies of Caravaggio paintings seen in the film. Details and awards Caravaggio was Jarman's first project with Tilda Swinton and was also her first film role. The cook Jennifer Paterson was an extra. The film was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement. Home media Caravaggio was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in July 2008. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the trailer, a gallery of production designs and storyboards, feature commentary by Gabriel Berestain, an interview with Christopher Hobbs titled Italy of the Memory, and interviews with Tilda Swinton, Derek Jarman, Nigel Terry.

Russian pyramid, also known as Russian billiard (, , ) is a form of pocket billiards played on a modified snooker table with narrower pockets. It is popular across Eastern Europe as well as countries of the former Soviet Union/Eastern Bloc. A variant with colored balls modeled on those of pool is known as Russian pool. In Western countries, the game is known as pyramid billiards, or simply pyramid within professional circles. Equipment *Table: Playing-surface sizes vary. The usual range (the foot measurements are traditional approximations, the metric more precise) include: 7 √ó 3.5 foot (198 √ó 99 cm); 8 √ó 4 ft (224 √ó 112 cm); 9 √ó 4.5 ft (254 √ó 127 cm); 10 √ó5 ft (295 √ó 147 cm); up to 12 √ó 6 ft (355 √ó 177.5 cm), the same size preferred for snooker, and the official tournament size. The used in Russian pyramid tables are significantly thinner than those of pool and snooker tables, but are occasionally heated, similar to carom billiards table. In the United States, it is common for amateur and non-professional players to play Russian pyramid on a regular pool table, often in pool halls or private homes. *Balls: There are sixteen balls (fifteen and a ), as in pool, but the numbered balls are white, and the cue ball is usually red or yellow. Up to in diameter, they are larger and heavier than Western billiard balls; the official tournament size is . Smaller balls ‚Äì e.g., , , and (regular pool ball size) ‚Äì are available for smaller table sizes. *Pockets: The are only 3 mm (approx. in) wider than the diameter of the ball. The , however, are 12-13 mm (approx. ‚Äì in) wider than the diameter of the ball. This makes the game's mechanics like an oversized version of snooker, requiring greater precision to pocket a ball in such tight pockets than in pool, which has a much larger pocket size in relation to the balls. *Cues: Due to larger ball size, the cues used for Russian pyramid are slightly thicker and heavier than those of pool cues, and the tip diameter is wider (up to 15 mm), in comparison to 10-13 mm used in pool cues. Specialty shots like and are usually more difficult to perform with a Russian pyramid cue, due to its heavier nature. These shots are also not allowed in official tournaments, doing so may result in a . Rule variations Russian pyramid ball at a corner pocket. The relative size of the ball and the pocket makes the game very challenging. There are several rule variations of Russian pyramid. All games begin with fifteen numbered white balls ed in a , as in straight pool, eight-ball and blackball. Players may pocket any object balls on the table regardless of number, and the first player to pocket eight or more balls wins the . In addition, shots do not have to be . Depending on the game variant some specific balls may have to be in specific positions within the rack. The first player firmly s the rack with the from just in front of the . The three most common varieties are the following, each of which has slight local variations on the rules: *Free pyramid (also known as American pyramid) :Any ball may be used as the cue ball. Players can pocket the ball they struck if it hits another ball first, with the goal being to () the struck ball off of one or more other balls into a pocket. Should the struck ball be pocketed without striking any other balls, the shot is a and that ball is behind the baulk line. *Dynamic pyramid (also known as Siberian pyramid or Nevsky pyramid) :Only one ball is the cue ball. Players can pocket the cue ball with a carom shot off another ball and then the scorer must choose an object ball to be taken off the table. The player then has and may place it anywhere on the table but may not pocket it until the next stroke, otherwise it is a foul. *Combined pyramid (also known as Moscow pyramid or combo pyramid) :Rules are the same as in dynamic pyramid, except that, after the cue ball is pocketed, the cue ball is spotted between the () and head/baulk, but not on top of that line; from here until the next stroke, balls can be only pocketed in the side and far-corner pockets. In pool, this part of the table is called the and the Russian equivalent is (dom), 'house'. *Classical pyramid :Rules are similar to fifteen-ball pool. The object is to score at least 71 points. For each correctly pocketed object ball, the player wins the number of points on the ball (except for 1-ball, which scores 11 points). The last remaining ball on the table, regardless of its number, is worth 10 points. The total number of points is 130.http://www.billiard-prime.com/en/poleznaya-informaciya/pravila- russkoy-piramidy/classic-piramid.html Russian Pyramid World Championship Since 2000, Russian Pyramid World Championships have been held for Russian pyramid. The world governing body for the sport, establishing published rules and equipment standards, is the International Pyramid Committee, with its largest regional affiliate being the European Pyramid Committee. In popular culture The so-called \\"American\\" version, free pyramid, adapts well to use in fiction because of its simple rules (i.e., the plot does not have to side- track into complicated gameplay explanation), and has featured prominently in notable Russian films such as The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed (1979) and The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers (1968). An episode of the popular animated television series Kikoriki has two characters playing the game. Main characters of Dead Man's Bluff, or Zhmurki (Russian: –ñ–º—É—Ä–∫–∏) play Russian pool in the bar scene. Nowadays, the game is increasingly popular to be simulated as a video game, especially mobile game on Android devices. Many developers and producers have developed various Russian pyramid video games, with varying degrees of realism. \\"Russian pool\\" pool ball. Colored numbered balls for playing eight-ball, nine-ball and other pool games on Russian billiards tables are also produced. The balls are 68 mm ( in) in diameter, like the standard onea for Russian pyramid, and thus much larger than the American-style balls they are patterned after (as illustrated in the comparison image).

It later became a major tourist attraction for the area, as the part of the caverns close to the lake shore is home to glowworms. The unofficial name used by the national caving association is Aurora. The caves are geologically young (estimated 12,000 years) and hence there is only one tiny stalactite.

Rogers was imprisoned and spent some years there. He was influenced by the Seventh Day Baptists and the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and opposed the Established Puritan church. Rogerenes initially held to a Seventh Day (Saturday) Sabbath, but over the years began to regard each day as equally holy. Their disdain for Sunday worship often brought them into sharp conflict with their neighbors. Increasingly they adopted a Pacifist stance, including war tax resistance,Gross, David (ed.)

Some of the Rogerenes left Connecticut and migrated to New Jersey settling in parts of present-day Morris County. One such group settled in what is now the Landing section of Roxbury Township, New Jersey near Lake Rogerine, then known as Mountain Pond in about 1700.

Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the behavior of metalloproteins as well as artificially introduced metals, including those that are non-essential, in medicine and toxicology. Many biological processes such as respiration depend upon molecules that fall within the realm of inorganic chemistry. The discipline also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behaviour of metalloproteins.Stephen J. Lippard, Jeremy M. Berg, Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry, University Science Books, 1994, As a mix of biochemistry and inorganic chemistry, bioinorganic chemistry is important in elucidating the implications of electron-transfer proteins, substrate bindings and activation, atom and group transfer chemistry as well as metal properties in biological chemistry. Composition of living organisms About 99% of mammals' mass are the elements carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur. The organic compounds (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water. The entire collection of metal- containing biomolecules in a cell is called the metallome. History Paul Ehrlich used organoarsenic (‚Äúarsenicals‚Äù) for the treatment of syphilis, demonstrating the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to medicine, that blossomed with Rosenberg's discovery of the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin (cis-PtCl2(NH3)2). The first protein ever crystallized (see James B. Sumner) was urease, later shown to contain nickel at its active site. Vitamin B12, the cure for pernicious anemia was shown crystallographically by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin to consist of a cobalt in a corrin macrocycle. The Watson- Crick structure for DNA demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers. Themes in bioinorganic chemistry Several distinct systems are of identifiable in bioinorganic chemistry. Major areas include: =Metal ion transport and storage= A diverse collection of transporters (e.g. the ion pump NaKATPase), vacuoles, storage proteins (e.g. ferritin), and small molecules (e.g. siderophores) are employed to control metal ions concentration and bio-availability in living organisms. Crucially, many essential metals are not readily accessible to downstream proteins owing to low solubility in aqueous solutions or scarcity in the cellular environment. Organisms have developed a number of strategies for collecting and transporting such elements while limiting their cytotoxicity. =Enzymology= Many reactions in life sciences involve water and metal ions are often at the catalytic centers (active sites) for these enzymes, i.e. these are metalloproteins. Often the reacting water is a ligand (see metal aquo complex). Examples of hydrolase enzymes are carbonic anhydrase, metallophosphatases, and metalloproteinases. Bioinorganic chemists seek to understand and replicate the function of these metalloproteins. Metal- containing electron transfer proteins are also common. They can be organized into three major classes: iron-sulfur proteins (such as rubredoxins, ferredoxins, and Rieske proteins), blue copper proteins, and cytochromes. These electron transport proteins are complementary to the non-metal electron transporters nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The nitrogen cycle make extensive use of metals for the redox interconversions. 4Fe-4S clusters serve as electron-relays in proteins. =Toxicity= Several metal ions are toxic to humans and other animals. The bioinorganic chemistry of lead in the context of its toxicity has been reviewed. =Oxygen transport and activation proteins= Aerobic life make extensive use of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese. Heme is utilized by red blood cells in the form of hemoglobin for oxygen transport and is perhaps the most recognized metal system in biology. Other oxygen transport systems include myoglobin, hemocyanin, and hemerythrin. Oxidases and oxygenases are metal systems found throughout nature that take advantage of oxygen to carry out important reactions such as energy generation in cytochrome c oxidase or small molecule oxidation in cytochrome P450 oxidases or methane monooxygenase. Some metalloproteins are designed to protect a biological system from the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and other reactive oxygen-containing molecules such as hydrogen peroxide. These systems include peroxidases, catalases, and superoxide dismutases. A complementary metalloprotein to those that react with oxygen is the oxygen evolving complex present in plants. This system is part of the complex protein machinery that produces oxygen as plants perform photosynthesis. Myoglobin is a prominent subject in bioinorganic chemistry, with particular attention to the iron-heme complex that is anchored to the protein. =Bioorganometallic chemistry= Bioorganometallic systems feature metal-carbon bonds as structural elements or as intermediates. Bioorganometallic enzymes and proteins include the hydrogenases, FeMoco in nitrogenase, and methylcobalamin. These naturally occurring organometallic compounds. This area is more focused on the utilization of metals by unicellular organisms. Bioorganometallic compounds are significant in environmental chemistry. Structure of FeMoco, the catalytic center of nitrogenase. =Metals in medicine= A number of drugs contain metals. This theme relies on the study of the design and mechanism of action of metal-containing pharmaceuticals, and compounds that interact with endogenous metal ions in enzyme active sites. The most widely used anti-cancer drug is cisplatin. MRI contrast agent commonly contain gadolinium. Lithium carbonate has been used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder. Gold antiarthritic drugs, e.g. auranofin have been commercialized. Carbon monoxide- releasing molecules are metal complexes have been developed to suppress inflammation by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide. The cardiovascular and neuronal importance of nitric oxide has been examined, including the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. (See also: nitrogen assimilation.) Besides, metallic transition complexes based on triazolopyrimidines have been tested against several parasite strains. =Environmental chemistry= Environmental chemistry traditionally emphasizes the interaction of heavy metals with organisms. Methylmercury has caused major disaster called Minamata disease. Arsenic poisoning is a widespread problem owing largely to arsenic contamination of groundwater, which affects many millions of people in developing countries. The metabolism of mercury- and arsenic-containing compounds involves cobalamin-based enzymes. =Biomineralization= Biomineralization is the process by which living organisms produce minerals, often to harden or stiffen existing tissues. Such tissues are called mineralized tissues. Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms, carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates. Other examples include copper, iron and gold deposits involving bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in magnetotactic bacteria (Fe3O4), gravity sensing devices (CaCO3, CaSO4, BaSO4) and iron storage and mobilization (Fe2O3‚Ä¢H2O in the protein ferritin). Because extracellular iron is strongly involved in inducing calcification, its control is essential in developing shells; the protein ferritin plays an important role in controlling the distribution of iron. Types of inorganic substances in biology =Alkali and alkaline earth metals= Like many antibiotics, monensin-A is an ionophore that tightly bind Na+ (shown in yellow). The abundant inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The most important ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate, and bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerves and muscles, as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules. =Transition metals= The transition metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms, with zinc and iron being most abundant. electronic-book electronic- These metals are used as protein cofactors and signalling molecules. Many are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin. These cofactors are tightly to a specific protein; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, cofactors always return to their original state after catalysis has taken place. The metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bound to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not being used. Cobalt is essential for the functioning of vitamin B12. electronic-book electronic- =Main group compounds= Many other elements aside from metals are bio-active. Sulfur and phosphorus are required for all life. Phosphorus almost exclusively exists as phosphate and its various esters. Sulfur exists in a variety of oxidation states, ranging from sulfate (SO42‚àí) down to sulfide (S2‚àí). Selenium is a trace element involved in proteins that are antioxidants. Cadmium is important because of its toxicity.

African economic history often focuses on explanations of poverty and obscures other aspects such as the achievements of African farmers, traders and states, including improvements in food security, and episodes of economic growth. Farms in Malawi, 2010. Ancient history Africa has the longest and oldest economic history. As soon as human societies came into existence, so did economic activity. Earliest humans were hunter gatherers living in small, family groups. Even then there was considerable trade that could cover long distances. Archaeologists have found that evidence of trade in luxury items like metals and shells across the entirety of the continent were the main trades of the Berber people, lived in dry areas and became nomadic herders, while in the savannah grasslands, cultivated crops and thus permanent settlement were possible. Agriculture supported large towns, and eventually large trade networks developed between the towns. =Origins of agriculture= The first agriculture in Africa began in the heart of the Sahara Desert, which in 5200 BC was far more moist and densely populated than today. Several native species were domesticated, most importantly pearl millet, sorghum and cowpeas, which spread through West Africa and the Sahel. The Sahara at this time was like the Sahel today. Its wide open fields made cultivation easy, but the poor soil and limited rain made intensive farming impossible. The local crops were also not ideal and produced fewer calories than those of other regions. These factors limited surpluses and kept populations sparse and scattered. North Africa took a very different route from the southern regions. Climatically it is linked to the Middle East and the Fertile Crescent, and the agricultural techniques of that region were adopted wholesale. This included a different set of crops, such as wheat, barley, and grapes. North Africa was also blessed by one of the richest agricultural regions in the world in the Nile River valley. With the arrival of agriculture, the Nile region became one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and Egypt home to one of the first civilizations. The drying of the Sahara created a formidable barrier between the northern and southern portions of the continent. Two important exceptions were Nubian Sudan, which was linked to Egypt by the Nile and Ethiopia, which could trade with the northern regions over the Red Sea. Powerful states grew up in these regions such as Kush in Nubia (modern day Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt) and Aksum in Ethiopia. Especially from Nubia, ideas and technologies from the Middle East and Europe reached the rest of Africa. Historians believe that iron working developed independently in Africa. Unlike other continents Africa did not have a period of copper and bronze working before their Iron Age. Copper is quite rare in Africa while iron is quite common. In Nubia and Ethiopia, iron, trade, and agricultural surpluses lead to the establishment of cities and civilizations. =The Bantu expansion= Ordinarily, in the sparsely populated areas, this same period saw the expansion of the Bantu speaking peoples. The Bantu expansion began in Southern Cameroon around 4000 years ago. Bantu languages are spoken there today and there is archaeological evidence for incoming Neolithic farmers in Northern Gabon c. 3800 BC. It is known that Bantu expansion was extremely rapid and massive, but its exact engine remains controversial. This period predated iron, which appears in the archaeological record by 2500 BC. One of the early expansions of Bantu was the migration of the Bubi to Fernando Po (Bioko). They were still using stone technology at first. The difficulties of cutting down the equatorial forest for farming have led to the suggestion that the primary expansion was along river valleys, a hypothesis supported by studies of fish names. Another factor may have been the arrival of southeast-Asian food crops, notably the AAB plantain, the cocoyam and the water-yam. Linguistic reconstructions suggest that the only livestock possessed by the proto-Bantu was the goat. Over the centuries the entire southern half of Africa was covered with the group, excluding only the Kalahari desert. Their expansion only ended relatively recently. In the year 1000, Arab traders described that the Bantu had not reached as far as Mozambique, and European settlers observed the Bantu expansion into South Africa under the Zulu and others, yet there's no archaeological evidence that supports their claims instead on the contrary the evidence indicates Bantu speakers's presence very much earlier by over 1800 years and over 1400 years before the first European settlement in the south African regions of Mozambique and South Africa respectively. The importation Bantu pastoralism reshaped the continent's economy. Sometime in the first millennium, an equally important change began as crops began to arrive from Southeast Asia. The Indian Ocean has always been far more open to trade than the turbulent Atlantic and Pacific. Traders could ride the monsoon winds west early in the year and return east on them later. It is guessed that these crops first arrived in Madagascar, which also adopted Southeast Asian languages, sometime between AD 300 and 800. From the island, the crops crossed to African Great Lakes region. They included many crops, the most important being the banana. The banana and other crops allowed for more intensive cultivation in the tropical regions of Africa, this was most notable in the Great Lakes region, and area with excellent soil, that saw many cities and states form, their populations being fed largely Trade routes Aksumite gold coin of Endubis. Saharan trade routes. While some level of trade had been ongoing, the rise of cities and empires made it far more central to the African economy. North Africa was central to the trade of the entire Mediterranean region. Outside of Egypt, this trade was mostly controlled by the Phoenicians who came to dominate North Africa, with Carthage becoming their most important city. The Greeks controlled much of the eastern trade, including along the Red Sea with Ethiopia. In this region a number of Greek trading cities that were established acted as a conduit for their civilization and learning. The Egyptian (and later, Roman) city of Alexandria (founded by Alexander the Great in 334 BC), was one of the hubs for Mediterranean trade for many centuries. Well into the 19th century Egypt remained one of the most developed parts of the world. Nubia in Sudan likewise traded with interior African countries such as Chad and Libya, as well as with Egypt, China, India and the Arabian peninsula. For most of the 1st millennium AD, the Axumite Kingdom in Ethiopia and Eritrea had a powerful navy and trading links reaching as far as the Byzantine Empire and India. Between the 14th and 17th centuries, the Ajuran Sultanate centered in modern-day Somalia practiced hydraulic engineering and developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century. On the east coast of the continent Swahili traders linked the region into an Indian Ocean trading network, bringing imports of Chinese pottery and Indian fabrics in exchange for gold, ivory, and slaves. Swahili Kingdoms created a prosperous trade empire, where occupied the territory of modern-day Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Swahili cities were important trading ports for trade with the Middle East and Far East.Wonders of the African World: The Swahili People In the interior of Africa, trade was far more limited. Low population densities made profitable commerce difficult. The massive barrier of the Congo rainforests were more imposing than the Sahara, blocking trade through the center of the continent. It was the arrival of the Islamic armies that transformed the economies of much of Africa. Though Islam had comparatively little impact on North Africa where large cities, literacy, and centralized states had been the norm, Muslims were far more effective at penetrating the Sahara than Christians had been. This was largely due to the camel, which had carried the Arab expansion and would soon after carry large amounts of trade across the desert. A series of states developed in the Sahel on the southern edge of the Sahara which made immense profits from trading across the Sahara. The first of these was the Kingdom of Ghana, reaching it peak in the 12th century. Soon, others such as the Mali Empire and Kanem- Bornu, also arose in the region. The main trade of these states was gold, which was plentiful in Guinea. Also important was the trans-Saharan slave trade that shipped large numbers of slaves to North Africa. =600‚Äì1600 AD= An Okpoho variety of Manilla from the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria. Many wealthy empires grew around coastal areas or large rivers that served as part of important trade routes. The kingdoms of Mali and Songhai Empire grew along the Niger River between 1200 and 1590. Berber traders from the Sahel‚Äîa region south of the Sahara Desert‚Äîtraded dates, copper, horses, weapons and cloth that they brought from north Africa in Camel trains. Trade with the Berber people, and other groups, drove the growth of the Ghana empire, which traded its gold, kola nuts, and slaves. West Africans created a demand for salt, which was collected at desert oases, and which they used to preserve food as well as for seasoning it. In 1324, Mansa Musa, the king of Mali, made a historically famous Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca. There was an enormous group organized to undertake the Hajj with the king. It included \\"60,000 men, including 1200 servants\\" and records show that Mansa Musa gave out so much gold in Egypt, that its economy became depressed. Between 1000 and 1500, the forests of West Africa also became part of trade networks, particularly under the reigns of the Yoruba kings. If√© was a vital trade town, along the route from the tropical forests to Djenn√©, a major trade centre in Sudan, near other large trade cities such as Timbuktu and Gao. If√©'s location also placed it near Benin and the Atlantic Ocean. Yoruba civilization was supported by cities surrounded by farmed land, but extensive trade development made it wealthy. Mural from Old Dongola, the former capital of Makuria, depicting a financial deal By 1000, the Bantu language-speaking people of Zimbabwe and Southern Africa developed extensive overseas trade with lands as far away as China and India, from which they received porcelain, beads, and Persian and Arab pots. They traded domesticated beef (rather than meat from game animals), iron, and ivory and gold. The city of Great Zimbabwe, founded around 1100, was the centre of the Shona kingdom until around 1400. Much trade in the forest kingdoms was done at the local level, typically by ordinary Yoruba people at local markets. In some towns these were held every 3 or 4 days. Cloth, vegetables, meat, and other goods were traded, and paid for using small seashells called cowries which were imported from East Africa. Bars of copper and iron, called manilas, were produced in standard shapes to be used as currency. Other items used in trade as a form of currency included salt, cloth, and bars of gold. Trade with the Middle East had begun as early as ancient Egypt. Islam was introduced to the Horn region early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. Zeila's two-mihrab Masjid al- Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century. The spread of Islam brought Arab traders as far as Morocco. The Adal Sultanate in the Horn region also maintained bilateral relations with the Ottoman Empire. The institutional framework for long-distance trade across political and cultural boundaries had long been strengthened by the adoption of Islam as a cultural and moral foundation for trust among and with traders. On the Swahili Coast to the southeast, the Sultan of Malindi sent envoys to the Chinese imperial palace in Nanjing Yongle bearing a giraffe and other exotic gifts. European influence =Early European colonization= John Thomson, 1813. The earliest European colonists settled in North Africa in ancient times. These colonists included Phoenicians and Greeks. Settlers from ancient Athens and other parts of Greece established themselves along the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. They were later followed by colonists of the Roman Empire. Rome's colonies \\"served as a prototype\\" for later European colonial movement into the continent. Portugal was the first European empire to penetrate deep into Sub-Saharan Africa to establish colonies. Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator advanced Portuguese exploration of Africa, driven by two desires: to spread Christianity, and to establish Africa as a bastion of Christianity against the Ottoman Empire, which was making many African converts to Islam. Africa was exploited for commercial purposes because of another Portuguese goal: to find a route to India, which would open the entire Indian Ocean region to direct trade with Portugal. Conquest of territory in Africa also meant that the Portuguese could use African gold to finance travel along this new trade route. The Portuguese began significant trading with West Africa in the 15th century. This trade was primarily for the same commodities the Arabs had bought‚Äîgold, ivory, and slaves. The Portuguese sold the Africans Indian cloth and European manufactured goods but refused to sell them guns. Soon, however, other European powers such as France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain were developing their own trade with Africa, and they had fewer restrictions. The major European imperial powers in Africa were Portugal, Great Britain, France, and to a lesser extent Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy. Portugal's presence in Africa as an imperial power lasted until the 1970s, when the last of its former colonies declared independence after years of war. The Atlantic Ocean had long been all but impenetrable to the galleys that plied the Mediterranean. That any ship needed to pass thousands of kilometers of waterless desert before reaching any populated regions also made trade impossible. These barriers were overcome by the development of the caravel in Europe. Previously, trade with Sub-Saharan Africa could only be conducted through North African middlemen. Now Europeans could trade directly with the Africans themselves. This valuable trade lead to rapid change in West Africa. The region had long been agriculturally productive and, especially in western Nigeria, densely populated. The massive profits from trade and the arrival of guns lead to significant centralization and a number of states formed in the region such as the Ashanti Confederacy and Kingdom of Benin. These states became some of the wealthiest and most advanced in Africa. Wealthy merchants began to send their children to European universities and their well armed standing armies could challenge European forces. Many West-African natives, such as Seedies and Kroomen, served on European ships, and received regular pay, which greatly enhanced their status back home. =Atlantic slave trade= Clearly, the slave trade enriched the segments of African society that traded in slaves. However, the modern historiography of slavery has swung between two poles on the question of its demographic and economic effects on Africa as a whole. Early historical accounts of the Atlantic slave trade were largely written for a popular audience by abolitionists and former slaves like Olaudah Equiano who emphasized its profoundly negative effects on African peoples. As the 19th century progressed, accounts of the negative impact of slavery were increasingly used to argue for European colonization of the continent. Conversely, there were those, like the British explorer and geographer William Winwood Reade, who drew on the accounts of slave traders to argue that the effects of slavery were positive.See Reade 1864. By the early 20th century, the view of slavery as a negative influence on Africa prevailed among professional academic historians in Europe and the United States. During the decolonization period following World War II, an influential group of scholars, led by J.D. Fage, argued that the negative effects of slavery had been exaggerated, and that the export of slaves had been offset by population growth. Walter Rodney, a specialist on the Upper Guinea Coast, countered that European demand for slaves had vastly increased the economic importance of the slave trade in West Africa, with catastrophic effects. Rodney, who was active in Pan-African independence movements, accused Fage of whitewashing the role of Europeans in Africa; Fage responded by accusing Rodney of nationalist romanticism.For a summary of the Fage-Rodney debate, see Inikori 1982, pp. 74‚Äì99. Debates on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade were further stimulated by the publication of Philip Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (1969), which argued that 9.566 million slaves were exported from Africa through the Atlantic trade. In the 1970s, the debate on the economic impacts of the Atlantic trade increasingly turned on demographic estimates of slave exports in relation to continental birth rates. Most scholars now believe that Curtin was too conservative in his calculation, with most estimates ranging between 11.5 million to 15.4 million.See Curtin 1972, Lovejoy 1983, Inikori and Engerman 1992 More recently, John K. Thornton has presented an argument closer to that of Fage, while Joseph Inikori, Patrick Manning and Nathan Nunn have argued that the slave trade had a long-term debilitating impact on African economic development.See Thornton 1998, Inikori 1982, Inikori 1992, Manning 1990, Nunn 2008. Manning, for example, arrived at the following conclusion, after accounting for regional variations in slave exports and assuming an annual African population growth rate of 0.5.%: the population of Africa would have been 100 million rather than 50 million in 1850, if not for the combined effects of the external and internal slave trades.Manning 1990, p. 85 Nunn, in a recent econometric analysis of slave- exporting regions in all parts of Africa, found \\"a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves taken from a country and its subsequent economic development.\\"Nunn, 2008, p. 168 Nunn argues, moreover, that this cannot be explained by poverty prior to the slave trade, because more densely populated and economically developed parts of Africa regressed behind previously less developed, non-slave exporting areas during the course of the Atlantic, trans-Saharan, Red Sea and Indian Ocean slave trades. Colonial era =1884‚Äì1945= The Berlin Conference (German: Kongokonferenz or \\"Congo Conference\\") of 1884‚Äì85 regulated European colonization and trade in Africa during the Imperialism period, and coincided with Germany's sudden emergence as an imperial power. Called for by Portugal and organized by Otto von Bismarck, first Chancellor of Germany, its outcome, the General Act of the Berlin Conference, can be seen as the formalization of the Scramble for Africa. The conference ushered in a period of heightened colonial activity by European powers, while simultaneously eliminating most existing forms of African autonomy and self-governance.Berlin Conference During this colonial time, the economy of Africa was re-arranged to serve Europe and Europeans, and the European industrial chain began in Africa and ended in European industrial warehouses. All of Africa would ultimately fall under European colonial rule by 1914, with the exceptions of Ethiopia and Liberia. The partitioning of African territory among European regimes often violated existing boundaries recognized by local Africans. Some of the independent African states affected by the partitioning of the continent included: * Al-Hajj Umar Ahmadu Sefu * Ankole * Asanti * Bagirmi * Barotse * Basutoland * Benin Kingdom * Bornu * Buganda * Bunyoro * Burundi * Chokwe * Dahomey * Empire of Sokoto * Jumbe * Karagwe * Matabele * Merina * Mirambo * Mlozi * Morocco * Msiri * Rwanda * Samori * (Mahdist State of the) Sudan * Yao Chiefs * Yoruba State * Wadai * (Sultanate of) Zanzibar * Zulu Empire Under colonial rule, the plantation system of farming was widely introduced in order to grow large quantities of cash crops, and employing cheap (often forced) African labor for export to European countries. Mining for gems and precious metals such as gold was developed in a similar way by wealthy European entrepreneurs such as Cecil Rhodes. The implementation and effects of these colonial policies could be brutal. One extreme example of exploitation of Africans during this period is the Congo Free State, administered under a form of \\"company rule\\". The Belgians, under Leopold II of Belgium, allowed businesses to use forced labour as they saw fit. The brutal conditions, famine and disease ended in the deaths of an estimated 10 million Congolese between 1885 and 1908. Belgian government commissions in the 1920s found that the population of Belgian Congo had fallen by as much as 50% under Congo Free State rule as a result of forced labor (largely for the purposes of rubber cultivation), massacre by colonial troops, famine and disease.See Hochschild 1998 In white settler colonies like Algeria, Kenya, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa and Southwest Africa (now Namibia), the most fertile lands were forcibly expropriated from the indigenous populations for use by white settlers. In these countries African farmers were pushed onto \\"native reserves,\\" usually located on arid, marginal lands. Slavery was also widely abolished by colonial powers. Economics Railway map of Africa, including tracks proposed and under construction, The Statesman's Yearbook, 1899. To some colonizers, such as the British, the ideal colony was based on an open economy, actively engaged in world trade through the export of raw materials and the import of finished goods. The British practiced a policy of light administration, enforcing relatively little regulation on their colonies, especially in non-economic matters. As long as British interests were achieved, native populations were given greater individual freedoms. However, other colonizers, such as the French, took a more active approach to governance, encouraging or even requiring their subjects to more fully assimilate into French culture. Colonizers were under heavy political pressure to make their colonies immediately and continuously profitable. In almost all cases, this constraint led to a shortage of long- term investment from the mother countries into the economic development in their colonies. While these countries did finance some major infrastructure projects designed to facilitate trade, this was primarily to aid in the immediate extraction of valuable resources, and there was little to no investment into growing local business. Another reason colonial governments allowed local economies to lag behind was that competitive local industries would have reduced the colonies‚Äô trade dependence on the central economies in Europe. For the colonies to be integrated into the world economy and imperial trade network, the colonial governments needed the local citizens to engage in market activity, rather than simply subsistence agriculture. One method that colonial powers used to urge the native populations into participating in the larger economy was the requirement that taxes be paid in official currency. This made subsistence farming less feasible, as the producers then needed to sell at least some surplus in the market to obtain the currency needed for the payment of taxes. Many times colonial powers collected these taxes through the assistance of local African chiefs, who were politically and financially supported by the colonial governments in exchange for their assistance in enforcing these governments‚Äô policies, especially for policies that could be unpopular. Thus, the colonizers themselves avoided some degree of animosity from their subjects by using these established chiefs as proxies to enforce many of their coercive policies. Today, many African economies are affected by the legacy of colonialism. In agriculture, the plantation systems that they introduced were highly unsustainable and caused severe environmental degradation. For example, cotton severely lowers soil fertility wherever it is grown, and areas of West Africa that are dominated by cotton plantations are now unable to switch to more profitable crops or even to produce food because of the depleted soil. Recently, more countries have initiated programs to change to traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture such as shifting cultivation and bush fallow in order to grow enough food to support the population while maintaining soil fertility which allows agriculture to continue in future generations.

In the aftermath of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, 'Western' powers were averse to the idea of using outright conquest to annex territory. At the same time, agitation against colonial rule was becoming persistent in Africa. Between 1945 and 1948 there was a series of strikes and protests, in Senegal, Tanzania, on the French West African railway system, and along West Africa's Gold Coast. African countries gradually won their independence (with colonial-era boundaries intact), in most cases without prolonged violent conflict (exceptions include the Cameroon, Madagascar and Kenya). As the Cold War continued, African governments could count on support from either Western governments or Communist patrons, depending upon their ideology. The early years of independence went relatively smoothly for most African countries. This economic resilience eroded for the most part over the next several decades. Many arguments have been made to identify factors to explain the economic decline of many African countries. The tendency towards single-party rule, outlawing political opposition, had the result of keeping dictators in power for many years, perpetuating failed policies. Loans from foreign governments became crippling burdens to some countries that had difficulty even paying the interest on the loans. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that between 1970 and 2002 \\"sub-Saharan Africa received $294 billion in loans, paid out $268 billion in debt service, and yet still owes $300 billion\\". Conflicts such as the Second Congo War, which alone killed an estimated 2.7‚Äì5.4 million people, have set African economies back. [Staff] (20100120) \\"DR Congo war deaths 'exaggerated'\\" BBC News At various points during the late 20th century, the following debts were incurred by African governments (amounts are in billions of US dollars): * Nigeria (33) * South Africa (22) * Democratic Republic of the Congo (13) * Sudan (9) * Ethiopia (8) By the 1980s, political conflict had erupted into civil war in some countries, and the political instability kept some economies mired for many years. Some African governments faced practical problems in implementing industrial change as they attempted rapid modernization of their economies; costing and mismanagement problems in agricultural, manufacturing, and other sectors meant the failure of many projects. One result was African countries becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign food imports. A heavy blow to the economies of many African countries came from the 1973 OPEC oil embargo. Arab OPEC member countries opposed Israel during the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. OPEC embargoed oil exports to many Western governments as retaliation for their having supported Israel in the War. 40 African countries were dependent upon oil imports from OPEC, and when the price of oil rose rapidly from the embargo, African exports became too expensive for many foreign markets. Poverty A major question in the economic history of Africa is focusing on explanations for the relative poverty of the continent. Economists today use different ways to explain this phenomenon usually either an external or internal approach. ;External approach External approaches usually focus on institutional patterns within economies. They try to explain Africa's economic development as subject to European institutional decisions of the past. European colonial governments had no incentive to create institutions fostering economic development in African colonies, but rather economic extraction of given resources. Even today, African institutions still depend on these early decisions. For example, in Africa, property rights are not established or enforced in a way promoting economic activity. ;Internal approach Here two distinct ways have to be differentiated: The first one, similar to the external approach, focuses on property right distributions in Africa. These usually emerge from the setup of the society, being more collective than individualist with tribes or families playing an important role in Africa. Thereby the distribution of property rights is an obstacle to economic development. Also, there are few incentives to change this setup into an economically more advantageous setting. For rulers it is often the rational choice to stick to this property rights setup, thereby being able to extract more from their dominion than by fostering economic development. The second internal approach focuses directly on resource endowments within the specific regions. Labor scarcity until the 20th century combined with a relatively low quality of soils lead to an extensive way of farming, largely relying on vast amounts of land rather than on intensive use of labor on the land. Combined with bad institutions from precolonial or colonial times this economic setup hinders the extensive use of technology and thereby slowing down or even preventing economic development. Modern era Port of Cape Town, South Africa. Most African economies, especially sub-Saharan Africa stagnated during this time and the period ended with many of Africa's national economies in ruins partly due to lop-sided trade with the rest of the world. Some have argued that economic decline has been caused by the meddling in the internal affairs of African states by the IMF and World Bank.Structural Adjustment ‚Äì a Major Cause of Poverty ‚Äì Global Issues Africa also experienced major governance deficiencies, mismanagement and corruption, and this accelerated poverty further. The wealthy elite in Africa in the late 20th century was characterized by civil servants functioning as \\"gatekeepers\\", holding positions with authority to approve foreign aid, humanitarian assistance, and private investment (typically foreign). Bribery and corruption became entrenched in some countries. Environmental and political catastrophe combined in several famines during the 1970s and 1980s in Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania and Mozambique. The impact of drought and desertification of a large part of the continent came to widespread public attention by the early 21st century. Railway projects were important in mining districts from the late 19th century. Large railway and road projects characterize the late 19th century. Railroads were emphasized in the colonial era, and roads in ‚Äòpost-colonial‚Äô times. Jedwab & Storeygard find that in 1960‚Äì2015 there were strong correlations between transportation investments and economic development. Influential political include pre-colonial centralization, ethnic fractionalization, European settlement, natural resource dependence, and democracy.Remi Jedwab & Adam Storeygard, \\"Economic and Political Factors in Infrastructure Investment: Evidence from Railroads and Roads in Africa 1960‚Äì2015\\" Economic History of Developing Regions 34#2 (Summer 2019) Pages: 156-208 DOI: 0.1080/20780389.2019.1627190 data covers 43 sub-Saharan countries. abstract Africa's economy only began to take off in the early 2000s as the political situation improved, national governments began to crack down on corruption and patronage, macroeconomic growth plans aimed at improving living conditions began to be implemented, and millions of Africans continued to flock to the cities in search of jobs and other amenities.

Currently, Matutano produces for the Iberian Peninsula snacks as Ruffles, Cheetos, Lays and Doritos among other brands.  History  The company originates in the 1950s, when Catalonian businessman Luis Matutano Jover founded in Barcelona a factory of snacks based on potatoes, a business his family exploited since 1873. Its production level was fairly modest until 1965 when the company's owner associated with the food group Pet Milk from United States to form the original Matutano brand, with an initial staff of 42 employees and 8 delivery routes. In 1969 the company bought Rick SA founded by Augusto Aboitiz Baroja, with a production factory in Burgos, and the company started to expand to whole Spain. In 1971 the multinational Frito Lay, part of PepsiCo, got the whole shares of the company and introduced most of their products in the Spanish market, as Cheetos (1975), Fritos (1976), Boca Bits (1981), Doritos (1984) and Ruffles (1986). In 1975 the characteristic logo of Matutano was adopted, a smiling face, and the company's image became popular. During the decades of 1970s and 1980s the company became the leader of Spanish market in potato chips and snacks, and started its expansion in Portugal. With the arrive of Lays potatoes in 1997, Matutano changed its corporate image of all its products to adopt the Frito Lay logo. But the change was a failure, and in 2009 PepsiCo put back the smiling face as its corporate identity. The company motto is: Y hoy ¬øHas sonre√≠do? (Have you smiled today?)

Early life and education  Cisneros is the son of Diego Cisneros and Albertina Cisneros (n√©e Rend√≠les Mart√≠nez). Cisneros's father, Diego Cisneros, was in business in Caracas from 1929 and received the Pepsi concession for Venezuela in 1940, before going on to gain the concession for private TV channel Venevisi√≥n in 1961. The Cisneros family was the first-wealthiest in South America on the 2006 Forbes ranking. Cisneros graduated from Suffield Academy in Connecticut in 1963. He graduated from Babson College in Massachusetts in 1968.  Grupo Cisneros  Grupo Cisneros is one of the largest privately held media entertainment organizations in the world. The company has been headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, since 2000. Cisneros became President of Grupo Cisneros when he was 25 years old. Cisneros‚Äô wealth comes from his holdings in media, entertainment, telecommunications and consumer products companies. Grupo Cisneros is one of the largest privately held Spanish-language media and entertainment companies. Until the buyout of Univision, the United States‚Äô leading Spanish-language television network, Cisneros was one of the biggest shareholders of the Company. He also owns Venevision International, which produces and distributes media and entertainment products throughout the world, and Venevisi√≥n, a Venezuelan television network. Since 1980 the Group has owned the Miss Venezuela contest and since 2001 also the Leones del Caracas baseball team. Long an advocate of free enterprise Cisneros has for many years been expanding his operations outside of Venezuela and into overseas markets, including the U.S., Spain and more recently China. One of his major accomplishments has been a major role in the international development of telenovelas - emotion-packed melodramas based on the harsh realities of life in Latin America that are now broadcast to about 2 billion people around the world. In August 2013, Gustavo Cisneros appointed his daughter Adriana Cisneros de Griffin as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cisneros. Cisneros has been developing Tropicalia, a multibillion-dollar resort in Miches, northwest of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Its opening is scheduled for 2021. He has been listed among the world's richest men according to Forbes magazine, which estimated his fortune at US$1.1 billion in 2019. His wealth has decreased from its 2014 peak of US$4.4 billion.  Politics  Although Cisneros and Hugo Ch√°vez were originally friends and Cisneros contributed to Ch√°vez's first presidential campaigns, Cisernos has been accused of involvement in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt against Ch√°vez after their relationship became strained because of Ch√°vez's confrontation of the media. Cisneros has been questioned about his relationship with Ch√°vez.  Philanthropy  '''' Cisneros supports two philanthropic entities: Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros and Fundaci√≥n Cisneros. Fundaci√≥n Cisneros runs a wide range of educational and cultural programs aimed at improving the lives of Latin Americans. These include the AME program for professional development of Latin American educators, visual arts education and awareness based on the Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros; PPV, a visual thinking curriculum for Latin American school children, and traveling art exhibits showcasing the talents of Latin American artists for North America and European audiences. Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros is a privately held Latin American art organization based in Venezuela and New York City. Patricia and Gustavo Cisneros began collecting Latin American abstraction after their marriage, in 1970. Over the years, it has grown to more than 2,000 pieces, including about 200 Spanish colonial objects. In addition, the couple have amassed a vast holding of ethnographic material from the Amazon. Based in New York and Caracas, the Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros today also includes works by Uruguay's Joaqu√≠n Torres-Garc√≠a, Brazil's Lygia Clark and Venezuelan modern masters Jesus Soto, Alejandro Otero, and Carlos Cruz-Diez. The Cisneros Foundation was moving toward building a permanent institution in Caracas in the late 1990s until Hugo Chavez was elected president. In 2007, the foundation encountered resistance from the Chavez government when lending works by Venezuelan painter Armando Reveron (1889-1954) to New York's Museum of Modern Art for the museum's first retrospective devoted to a single Latin American artist in 50 years.Chris Kaul (January 28, 2009), An art trove ends its nomadic phase Los Angeles Times.

A work of Christian existentialism, the book is about Kierkegaard's concept of despair, which he equates with the Christian concept of sin, which he terms, \\"the sin of despair.\\" Summary Anti-Climacus introduces the book with a reference to John 11:4: \\"This sickness is not unto death.\\" This quotation comes from the story of Lazarus, in which Jesus raises a man from the dead. However, Anti- Climacus raises the question: would not this statement still be true even if Jesus had not raised Lazarus from the dead? While the human conception of death is the end, the Christian conception of death is merely another stop along the way of the eternal life. In this way, for the Christian, death is nothing to fear. Instead, the inability to die is what is to be feared. The true \\"Sickness unto Death,\\" which does not describe physical but spiritual death, which stems from not embracing one's self, is something to fear according to Anti-Climacus. This sickness unto death is what Kierkegaard calls despair. According to Kierkegaard, an individual is \\"in despair\\" if he does not align himself with God or God's plan for the self. In this way, he loses his self, which Kierkegaard defines as the \\"relation's relating itself to itself in the relation.\\" Kierkegaard defines humanity as the tension between the \\"finite and infinite\\", and the \\"possible and the necessary\\", and is identifiable with the dialectical balancing act between these opposing features, the relation. While humans are inherently reflective and self- conscious beings, to become a true self one must not only be conscious of the self but also be conscious of being grounded in love, viz the source of the self in \\"the power that created it.\\" When one either denies this self or the power that creates and sustains this self, one is in despair. There are three kinds of despair presented in the book: being unconscious in despair of having a self, not wanting in despair to be oneself, and wanting in despair to be oneself. The first of these is described as \\"inauthentic despair,\\" because this despair is born out of ignorance. In this state, one is unaware that one has a self separate from its finite reality. One does not realize that there is a power that created and continues to create one, and accepts finitude because one is unaware of the possibility of being more inherent in selfhood. The second type of despair is refusing to accept the self outside of immediacy; only defining the self by immediate, finite terms. This is the state in which one realizes that one has a self, but wishes to lose this painful awareness by arranging one's finite life so as to make the realization unnecessary. This stage is loosely comparable to Sartre's bad faith. The third type is awareness of the self but refusal to acknowledge one's dependence on love, i.e., the power that created one. In this stage, one accepts the eternal and may or may not acknowledge love, but refuses to accept an aspect of the Self that one in reality is, that is to say, the self that one is in love. Kierkegaard identifies this type of demonic despair as the most heightened form of despair. To not be in despair is to have reconciled the finite with the infinite, to exist in awareness of one's own self and of love's power. Specifically, Kierkegaard defines the opposite of despair as faith, which he describes by the following: \\"In relating itself to itself, and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.\\" People commonly ascribe the name \\"God\\" to the \\"power that created\\" the self, but Anti-Climacus's text is more subtle than this orthodox viewpoint. Kierkegaard certainly was thinking of God, but what it means to have a personal relation with God, and how God is love are the real subjects of this book. While the book is, in many ways, a phenomenology of prayer, it is just as much a phenomenology of what a Romantic-despite-himself could offer to the future of human maturity by way of a relational view of the self as grounded in creative love. Relation to other works The Sickness Unto Death has strong existentialist themes. For example, the concepts of the finite and infinite parts of the human self translate to Heidegger's concept of 'facticity' and Sartre's concept of 'transcendence' in Being and Nothingness. Kierkegaard's thesis is, of course, in other ways profoundly different from Sartre, most obviously because of Kierkegaard's belief that only religious faith can save the soul from despair. This particular brand of existentialism is often called Christian existentialism. Some have suggested that the opening of the book is an elaborate parody of the often bafflingly cryptic philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Hegel; however, some scholars, such as Gregor Malantschuk, have suggested otherwise (Armed Neutrality and An Open Letter, Simon and Schuster, 1969, pp. 65‚Äì6 and n. 7 on pp. 165‚Äì6).In Louise Erdrich's \\"The Bingo Palace\\" on page 238, the Character Lipsha finds the book randomly on the shelf of the Fargo public library while looking for his father, who is an escaped convict In popular culture * The Polish minimalist composer Tomasz Sikorski wrote a piece of music inspired by the work, which includes a recitation of Kierkergaard's text. * The sixteenth episode of the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, The Sickness Unto Death, And Then..., is named after the book. Much of the series' philosophical and psychological subtext is influenced by, and makes reference to, the pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer and the existentialism of S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre. * The manga The Sickness Unto Death (\\"Shi ni Itaru Yamai\\"), by Asada Hikari, uses Kierkegaard's ideas of despair within a story about multiple personality disorder. * Sickness Unto Foolish Death is the sixth song on the original soundtrack for the video game Silent Hill 3, composed by Japanese musician Akira Yamaoka.

More than 300 Patriots were killed in the battle. After the battle, settlers claimed that the Iroquois raiders had hunted and killed fleeing Patriots, then committed ritual torture against 30 to 40 who had surrendered, until they died. Background John Butler In 1777, British general John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign to gain control of the Hudson River during the American Revolutionary War. He was weakened by loss of time and men after the Battle of Oriskany and was forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga in October. News of his surrender prompted France to enter the war as an American ally. The British were concerned that the French might attempt to retake parts of New France which they had lost in the French and Indian War, so they adopted a defensive strategy in Quebec. They recruited Loyalists and enlisted Indian allies to conduct a frontier war along the northern and western borders of the Thirteen Colonies.Nester, p. 189 Colonel John Butler recruited a regiment of Loyalists, Seneca chiefs Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter recruited primarily Seneca warriors, and Joseph Brant recruited mostly Mohawks, for a guerrilla war against the American frontier settlers. By April 1778, the Senecas were raiding settlements along the Allegheny and Susquehanna rivers, and the three groups met at the Indian village of Tioga, New York, in early June. Butler and the Senecas decided to attack the Wyoming Valley, while Brant and the Mohawks targeted settlements farther north.Nester, p. 191 American military leaders, including George Washington and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, sought to recruit Iroquois primarily as a diversion to keep the British busy in Quebec. These recruitment attempts, however, met with more limited successes. The Oneidas and Tuscaroras were the only tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy to become Patriot allies. Battle The British forces arrived in the valley on June 30, having alerted the settlers to their approach by killing three men working at an unprotected gristmill on June 28. The next day, Colonel Butler sent a surrender demand to the militia at Wintermute's (Wintermoot) fort. Terms were arranged in which the defenders would surrender the fort with all their arms and stores and would then be released on the condition that they not bear arms again during the war. On July 3, however, the British saw that the defenders were gathering in great numbers outside of Forty Fort. William Caldwell was engaged in destroying Jenkin's fort with the American militia a mile away, so Butler organized an ambush. He ordered Fort Wintermute to be set on fire, and the Patriots believed that it signified a British retreat and advanced rapidly. Butler told the Seneca to lie flat on the ground so as not to be seen. The militia advanced to within a hundred yards of the British rangers and fired three volleys at them. The Seneca rose to their feet, fired one time, and then charged to engage in hand-to-hand combat. The battle lasted about 45 minutes. An order to reform the Patriot line instead turned into a frantic rout, as the inexperienced militiamen panicked and began to run. It became a deadly race from which only about 60 Patriots escaped. The Loyalists and Iroquois killed almost all who were captured, and only five prisoners were taken alive. Butler reported that his Indian allies had taken 227 scalps.Cruikshank, pg. 47 The next morning, Colonel Nathan Denison agreed to surrender Forty Fort and two other posts, along with what remained of his militia. Butler paroled them on their promise to take no part in further hostilities. The British spared non-combatants, although they molested a few inhabitants after the forts' surrender.Graymont, p. 172 Colonel Butler wrote: > But what gives me the sincerest satisfaction is that I can, with great > truth, assure you that in the destruction of the settlement not a single > person was hurt except such as were in arms, to these, in truth, the Indians > gave no quarter.Cruikshank, p. 49 An American farmer wrote: \\"Happily these fierce people, satisfied with the death of those who had opposed them in arms, treated the defenseless ones, the woman and children, with a degree of humanity almost hitherto unparalleled\\".Commager, p. 1010 According to one source, 60 Patriot bodies were found on the battlefield and another 36 on the line of retreat. All were buried in a common grave. Aftermath Butler's Rangers' uniform Butler reported only two Loyalist Rangers and one Indian killed out of 1,000 men, and eight Indians wounded. He claimed that his force took 227 scalps, burned 1,000 houses, and drove off 1,000 cattle plus many sheep and hogs. Only about 60 of the 300 militiamen and 60 Continentals escaped the disaster,Boatner (1994), p. 1227 though Graymont states about 340 killed. The Seneca Indians were angered by the accusations of atrocities which they said they had not committed, and at the militia taking up arms after being paroled. Later that year, Joseph Brant under the command of Butler further retaliated in the Cherry Valley massacre.Graymont, p. 174 The American public were outraged by reports of the massacres of prisoners and atrocities at Wyoming. Afterward, Colonel Thomas Hartley arrived with Hartley's Additional Continental Regiment to defend the valley to try to harvest the crops.Boatner (1994), p. 1226.Wright (1989), p. 322. They were joined by a few militia companies, including that of Captain Denison. In September, Hartley and Denison ascended the east branch of the Susquehanna with 130 soldiers, destroying Indian villages as far as Tioga and recovering a large amount of plunder taken during the raid. They skirmished with the hostile Indians and withdrew when they learned that Joseph Brant was assembling a large force at Unadilla.Boatner (1994), p. 1226 Connecticut Continentals led by Captain Jeremiah Blanchard and Lieutenant Timothy Keyes held a fort in Pittston, several miles away from the battlefield. A group of British soldiers took over the fortress on July 4, 1778, one day after the Battle of Wyoming, and some of it was destroyed. Two years later, the Continentals stormed the fortification and recaptured it, and it remained under Patriot control until the end of the war. In summer 1779, the Sullivan Expedition commissioned by General George Washington methodically destroyed 40 Iroquois villages and an enormous quantity of stored corn and vegetables throughout upstate New York. The Iroquois never recovered from the damage inflicted by Sullivan's soldiers, and many died of starvation that winter. The tribes allied with the British continued to raid Patriot settlements until the end of the war.Boatner (1994), pp. 1075-1076 Legacy The massacre was depicted by the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell in his 1809 poem \\"Gertrude of Wyoming\\". Because of the atrocities involved, Campbell described Joseph Brant as a \\"monster\\" in the poem, although it was later determined that Brant was not present.Graymont, pg. 162 Brant was at Oquaga on the day of the attack. The western state of Wyoming received its name from the U.S. Congress when it became Wyoming Territory in 1868. The battle and massacre is commemorated each year by the Wyoming Commemorative Association, a local non-profit organization, which holds a ceremony on the grounds of the monument dedicated to the battle. The Wyoming Monument is the site of a mass grave containing the bones of many of the victims of the battle and massacre. The commemorative ceremonies began in 1878, to mark the 100th anniversary of the battle and massacre. The principal speaker at the event was President Rutherford B. Hayes. During the 100th anniversary commemoration, the people of Wyoming Valley used the motto \\"An honest tale speeds best when plainly told\\" in an effort to promote the historical account of the battle.Francavilla, Lisa. The Wyoming Valley Battle and 'Massacre': Images of a Constructed American History (2002): ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Web. The annual program has continued each year since then on the grounds. One hundred and seventy-eight names of Patriots killed in the battle are listed on the Wyoming Monument, and the names of about a dozen militia who were killed or died in captivity a day or so prior to the main battle. A possible explanation for the difference between the number of names on the monument (178) and the reported number of scalps taken in the battle (227) is that allegedly numerous civilians (perhaps as many as 200)‚Äîinstead of surrendering to Colonel Butler‚Äîelected to flee and died of exposure in a swamp known as the \\"Shades of Death\\" after the battle.

Description  Formed along New Zealand's Marlborough Fault System, they can be seen as the northernmost extension of the Southern Alps in the South Island. Named the Looker-on mountains, by Captain James Cook, they take their name from the town of Kaikoura at the southern extreme of the more eastern range, the Seaward Kaik≈çuras.

The cipher has 10 rounds, and uses key- dependent S-boxes and masks used to select the tables for use in different rounds of the cipher. Cusick found an attack on one round, and Biham and Shamir (1991) used differential cryptanalysis to attack one round with 2300 encryptions. Biham and Shamir also found a way of recovering three masks for up to four rounds faster than exhaustive search. A prize of US$5,000 was offered for the best attack on one round of REDOC-II, and $20,000 for the best practical known-plaintext attack. REDOC III is a more efficient cipher. It operates on an 80-bit block and accepts a variable-length key of up to 20,480 bits. The algorithm consists only of XORing key bytes with message bytes, and uses no permutations or substitutions.

Early years Mass√≥ was born and raised in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education. His parents were Rafael Mass√≥ V√°zquez and Francisca Gonz√°lez Pad√≠n. He was a hard working young man who admired the Puerto Rican political leader Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. He helped support his family working in the local hardware store. After graduating from high school he enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico.\\"Sepultan al gestor de la cadena de Ferreterias Masso\\"; El Nuevo Dia; page 4; January 15, 2007 First Masso Hardware Store In 1951, Mass√≥ opened his first hardware store, Ferreter√≠a Masso (Masso Hardware Store) in San Lorenzo, which became a successful venture. He married Carmen Tuly Aponte in 1953. In 1954 he established his first cinder block factory. In 1959, Mass√≥ ventured into the construction business and built the Mass√≥ Subdivision in San Lorenzo. In 1961, he opened Caguas' Lumber Yard in Caguas. In 1967, the Mass√≥ Cement Factory moved to much larger facility in Gurabo. Casas Mass√≥ In 1974, with the need of affordable housing in Puerto Rico, Mass√≥ developed a concept of selling low cost houses, made out of wood, known as Modelos Mass√≥ or Casas Mass√≥ (Masso Models). The idea was to supply customers with the necessary elements to build a low cost home. The all-inclusive packages included floor plans, building materials and construction loans. In 1981, Mass√≥ acquired two Carlos Armstrong Hardware Stores in Ponce and in 1983, he opened the Cayey Home Center in Cayey. In 1984 Mass√≥ built 550 residences in San Lorenzo, which is now known as \\"Mass√≥ City\\" and, in 1986, he built 67 residences in the Cerro Gordo sector of San Lorenzo. In 1992, Mass√≥ introduced the new Casas Mass√≥ which were made of cement, with the same concept as the first models. In 1993, he set up a Super Mass√≥ Hardware Store consisting of 55,000 square feet (5,100 m¬≤) and offering over 60,000 products in Caguas. In 1996, Mass√≥ Enterprises was involved in a project which built 169 residences in Paseo San Lorenzo. In 1997 Mass√≥ acquired six Builder's Square Stores in Caguas, Bayamon, Carolina, Ponce and Mayaguez. These were renamed Plaza Mass√≥. In 1995, the Mass√≥ Hardware Store introduced Auto-Express in which the customer used a drive-through to make purchases. This concept increased sales by 15%. Gildo Mass√≥ introduced new models of the Casas Mass√≥ in 2001 and 2003. Mass√≥ Enterprises has over $65 million in annual sales. The company also has the training center\\"Mass√≥ School for all employees. Later years Gildo Mass√≥ was named Business Man of the Year in 2004 and the VIP of the Week by Chrysler Corp. A devoted Catholic and to the fulfillment of his religious obligations, Gildo was a supporter and advocate of Cursillos de Cristiandad Movement for more than 40 years, both in the Archdiocese of San Juan and the Diocese of Caguas. He designed and generously directed the construction of both Casas de Cursillos in each diocesan community.

The median eminence is a small swelling on the tuber cinereum, posterior to and atop the pituitary stalk; it lies in the area roughly bounded on its posterolateral region by the cerebral peduncles, and on its anterolateral region by the optic chiasm. As one of the seven areas of the brain devoid of a blood‚Äìbrain barrier, the median eminence is a circumventricular organ having permeable capillaries. Its main function is as a gateway for release of hypothalamic hormones, although it does share contiguous perivascular spaces with the adjacent hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, indicating a potential sensory role. Physiology The median eminence is a part of the hypothalamus from which regulatory hormones are released. It is integral to the hypophyseal portal system, which connects the hypothalamus with the pituitary gland. The pars nervosa (part of the posterior pituitary gland) is continuous with the median eminence of the hypothalamus via the infundibular stalk. Parvocellular neurons from the hypothalamus terminate in the median eminence of the hypothalamus. The median eminence is the structure where secretions of the hypothalamus (releasing and inhibiting regulatory hormones, known as \\"hypophysiotropic hormones\\") collect before entering the portal system emptying into the general circulation. Such hypophysiotropic hormones include: CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor), GnRH (gonadotropin- releasing hormone), TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), GHRH (growth hormone- releasing hormone), and DA (dopamine). These hypophysiotropic hormones stimulate or inhibit the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary. Further, anatomical evidence exists for bidirectional communication between the median eminence and the arcuate and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.

Of these 51 keywords, 49 are in use and 2 are not in use. Due to their special functions in the language, most integrated development environments for Java use syntax highlighting to display keywords in a different colour for easy identification. List ;\`abstract\` : A method with no definition must be declared as abstract and the class containing it must be declared as abstract. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. Abstract methods must be implemented in the sub classes. The abstract keyword cannot be used with variables or constructors. Note that an abstract class isn't required to have an abstract method at all. ;\`assert\` (added in J2SE 1.4) :Assert describes a predicate (a true‚Äìfalse statement) placed in a Java program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place. If an assertion evaluates to false at run-time, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort. Optionally enable by ClassLoader method. : ;\`boolean\` :Defines a boolean variable for the values \\"true\\" or \\"false\\" only. By default, the value of boolean primitive type is false. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`boolean\`. ;\`break\` :Used to end the execution in the current loop body. ;\`byte\` :The \`byte\` keyword is used to declare a field that can hold an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`byte\`. ;\`case\` :A statement in the \`switch\` block can be labeled with one or more \`case\` or \`default\` labels. The \`switch\` statement evaluates its expression, then executes all statements that follow the matching \`case\` label; see \`switch\`. ;\`catch\` :Used in conjunction with a \`try\` block and an optional \`finally\` block. The statements in the \`catch\` block specify what to do if a specific type of exception is thrown by the \`try\` block. ;\`char\` :Defines a character variable capable of holding any character of the java source file's character set. ;\`class\` :A type that defines the implementation of a particular kind of object. A class definition defines instance and class fields, methods, and inner classes as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class. If the superclass is not explicitly specified, the superclass is implicitly . The class keyword can also be used in the form Class.class to get a Class object without needing an instance of that class. For example, String.class can be used instead of doing new String().getClass(). ;\`const\` :Unused but reserved. ;\`continue\` :Used to resume program execution at the end of the current loop body. If followed by a label, \`continue\` resumes execution at the end of the enclosing labeled loop body. ;\`default\` :The \`default\` keyword can optionally be used in a switch statement to label a block of statements to be executed if no \`case\` matches the specified value; see \`switch\`. Alternatively, the \`default\` keyword can also be used to declare default values in a Java annotation. From Java 8 onwards, the \`default\` keyword can be used to allow an interface to provide an implementation of a method. ;\`do\` :The \`do\` keyword is used in conjunction with \`while\` to create a do-while loop, which executes a block of statements associated with the loop and then tests a boolean expression associated with the \`while\`. If the expression evaluates to \`true\`, the block is executed again; this continues until the expression evaluates to \`false\`. ;\`double\` :The \`double\` keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit double precision IEEE 754 floating-point number. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`double\`. ;\`else\` :The \`else\` keyword is used in conjunction with \`if\` to create an if-else statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the expression evaluates to \`true\`, the block of statements associated with the \`if\` are evaluated; if it evaluates to \`false\`, the block of statements associated with the \`else\` are evaluated. ;\`enum\` (added in J2SE 5.0) :A Java keyword used to declare an enumerated type. Enumerations extend the base class . ;\`extends\` :Used in a class declaration to specify the superclass; used in an interface declaration to specify one or more superinterfaces. Class X extends class Y to add functionality, either by adding fields or methods to class Y, or by overriding methods of class Y. An interface Z extends one or more interfaces by adding methods. Class X is said to be a subclass of class Y; Interface Z is said to be a subinterface of the interfaces it extends. :Also used to specify an upper bound on a type parameter in Generics. ;\`final\` :Define an entity once that cannot be changed nor derived from later. More specifically: a final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable can occur at most once as a left-hand expression on an executed command. All methods in a final class are implicitly \`final\`. ;\`finally\` :Used to define a block of statements for a block defined previously by the \`try\` keyword. The \`finally\` block is executed after execution exits the \`try\` block and any associated \`catch\` clauses regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught, or execution left method in the middle of the \`try\` or \`catch\` blocks using the \`return\` keyword. ;\`float\` :The \`float\` keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit single precision IEEE 754 floating-point number. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`float\`. ;\`for\` :The \`for\` keyword is used to create a for loop, which specifies a variable initialization, a boolean expression, and an incrementation. The variable initialization is performed first, and then the boolean expression is evaluated. If the expression evaluates to \`true\`, the block of statements associated with the loop are executed, and then the incrementation is performed. The boolean expression is then evaluated again; this continues until the expression evaluates to \`false\`. :As of J2SE 5.0, the \`for\` keyword can also be used to create a so-called \\"enhanced for loop\\", which specifies an array or object; each iteration of the loop executes the associated block of statements using a different element in the array or \`Iterable\`. ;\`goto\` :Unused ;\`if\` :The \`if\` keyword is used to create an if statement, which tests a boolean expression; if the expression evaluates to \`true\`, the block of statements associated with the if statement is executed. This keyword can also be used to create an if-else statement; see \`else\`. ;\`implements\` :Included in a class declaration to specify one or more interfaces that are implemented by the current class. A class inherits the types and abstract methods declared by the interfaces. ;\`import\` :Used at the beginning of a source file to specify classes or entire Java packages to be referred to later without including their package names in the reference. Since J2SE 5.0, \`import\` statements can import \`static\` members of a class. ;\`instanceof\` :A binary operator that takes an object reference as its first operand and a class or interface as its second operand and produces a boolean result. The \`instanceof\` operator evaluates to true if and only if the runtime type of the object is assignment compatible with the class or interface. ;\`int\` :The \`int\` keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`int\`. ;\`interface\` :Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract or default methods, constant (\`static final\`) fields and \`static\` interfaces. It can later be implemented by classes that declare the interface with the \`implements\` keyword. As multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, interfaces are used to circumvent it. An interface can be defined within another interface. ;\`long\` :The \`long\` keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`long\`. ;\`native\` :Used in method declarations to specify that the method is not implemented in the same Java source file, but rather in another language. ;\`new\` :Used to create an instance of a class or array object. Using keyword for this end is not completely necessary (as exemplified by Scala), though it serves two purposes: it enables the existence of different namespace for methods and class names, it defines statically and locally that a fresh object is indeed created, and of what runtime type it is (arguably introducing dependency into the code). ;\`package\` :Java package is a group of similar classes and interfaces. Packages are declared with the \`package\` keyword. ;\`private\` :The \`private\` keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; private members can only be accessed by other members of their own class. ;\`protected\` :The \`protected\` keyword is used in the declaration of a method, field, or inner class; protected members can only be accessed by members of their own class, that class's subclasses or classes from the same package. ;\`public\` :The \`public\` keyword is used in the declaration of a class, method, or field; public classes, methods, and fields can be accessed by the members of any class. ;\`return\` :Used to finish the execution of a method. It can be followed by a value required by the method definition that is returned to the caller. ;\`short\` :The \`short\` keyword is used to declare a field that can hold a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. This keyword is also used to declare that a method returns a value of the primitive type \`short\`. ;\`static\` :Used to declare a field, method, or inner class as a class field. Classes maintain one copy of class fields regardless of how many instances exist of that class. \`static\` also is used to define a method as a class method. Class methods are bound to the class instead of to a specific instance, and can only operate on class fields. (Classes and interfaces declared as \`static\` members of another class or interface are actually top-level classes and are not inner classes.) ;\`strictfp\` (added in J2SE 1.2) :A Java keyword used to restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations to ensure portability. ;\`super\` :Inheritance basically used to achieve dynamic binding or run-time polymorphism in java. Used to access members of a class inherited by the class in which it appears. Allows a subclass to access overridden methods and hidden members of its superclass. The \`super\` keyword is also used to forward a call from a constructor to a constructor in the superclass. :Also used to specify a lower bound on a type parameter in Generics. ;\`switch\` :The \`switch\` keyword is used in conjunction with \`case\` and \`default\` to create a switch statement, which evaluates a variable, matches its value to a specific \`case\`, and executes the block of statements associated with that \`case\`. If no \`case\` matches the value, the optional block labelled by \`default\` is executed, if included. ;\`synchronized\` :Used in the declaration of a method or code block to acquire the mutex lock for an object while the current thread executes the code. For static methods, the object locked is the class's \`Class\`. Guarantees that at most one thread at a time operating on the same object executes that code. The mutex lock is automatically released when execution exits the synchronized code. Fields, classes and interfaces cannot be declared as synchronized. ;\`this\` :Used to represent an instance of the class in which it appears. \`this\` can be used to access class members and as a reference to the current instance. The \`this\` keyword is also used to forward a call from one constructor in a class to another constructor in the same class. ;\`throw\` :Causes the declared exception instance to be thrown. This causes execution to continue with the first enclosing exception handler declared by the \`catch\` keyword to handle an assignment compatible exception type. If no such exception handler is found in the current method, then the method returns and the process is repeated in the calling method. If no exception handler is found in any method call on the stack, then the exception is passed to the thread's uncaught exception handler. ;\`throws\` :Used in method declarations to specify which exceptions are not handled within the method but rather passed to the next higher level of the program. All uncaught exceptions in a method that are not instances of \`RuntimeException\` must be declared using the \`throws\` keyword. ;\`transient\` :Declares that an instance field is not part of the default serialized form of an object. When an object is serialized, only the values of its non-transient instance fields are included in the default serial representation. When an object is deserialized, transient fields are initialized only to their default value. If the default form is not used, e.g. when a serialPersistentFields table is declared in the class hierarchy, all \`transient\` keywords are ignored. ;\`try\` :Defines a block of statements that have exception handling. If an exception is thrown inside the \`try\` block, an optional \`catch\` block can handle declared exception types. Also, an optional \`finally\` block can be declared that will be executed when execution exits the \`try\` block and \`catch\` clauses, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. A \`try\` block must have at least one \`catch\` clause or a \`finally\` block. ;\`void\` :The \`void\` keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value. ;\`volatile\` :Used in field declarations to guarantee visibility of changes to variables across threads. Every read of a volatile variable will be read from main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache. Methods, classes and interfaces thus cannot be declared volatile, nor can local variables or parameters. ;\`while\` :The \`while\` keyword is used to create a while loop, which tests a boolean expression and executes the block of statements associated with the loop if the expression evaluates to \`true\`; this continues until the expression evaluates to \`false\`.

The year before, the city of Savannah, Georgia, had been captured by a British expeditionary corps under Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald Campbell. The siege itself consisted of a joint Franco-American attempt to retake Savannah, from September 16 to October 18, 1779. On October 9 a major assault against the British siege works failed. During the attack, Polish nobleman Count Casimir Pulaski, leading the combined cavalry forces on the American side, was mortally wounded. With the failure of the joint attack, the siege was abandoned, and the British remained in control of Savannah until July 1782, near the end of the war. In 1779, more than 500 recruits from Saint-Domingue (the French colony which later became Haiti), under the overall command of French nobleman Charles Hector, Comte d'Estaing, fought alongside American colonial troops against the British Army during the siege of Savannah. This was one of the most significant foreign contributions to the American Revolutionary War. This French-colonial force had been established six months earlier and included hundreds of soldiers of color in addition to white soldiers and a couple of enslaved black men. Background Following the failures of military campaigns in the northern United States earlier in the American Revolutionary War, British military planners decided to embark on a southern strategy to conquer the rebellious colonies, with the support of Loyalists in the South. Their first step was to gain control of the southern ports of Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina. An expedition in December 1778 took Savannah with modest resistance from ineffective militia and Continental Army defenses. The Continental Army regrouped, and by June 1779 the combined army and militia forces guarding Charleston numbered between 5,000 and 7,000 men. General Benjamin Lincoln, commanding those forces, knew that he could not recapture Savannah without naval assistance; for this he turned to the French, who had entered the war as an American ally in 1778. French Admiral the Comte d'Estaing spent the first part of 1779 in the Caribbean, where his fleet and a British fleet monitored each other's movements. He took advantage of conditions to capture Grenada in July before acceding to American requests for support in operations against Savannah. On September 3‚Äîan uncharacteristically early arrival as there was still substantial risk of seasonal hurricanes‚Äîa few French ships arrived at Charleston with news that d'Estaing was sailing for Georgia with twenty-five ships of the line and 4,000 French troops. Lincoln and the French emissaries agreed on a plan of attack on Savannah, and Lincoln left Charleston with over 2,000 men on September 11.

General Augustine Prevost, in command of these troops from his base at Savannah, was caught unprepared when the French fleet began to arrive off Tybee Island near Savannah and recalled the troops stationed at Beaufort and Sunbury to aid in the city's defense. Captain Moncrief of the Royal Engineers was tasked with constructing fortifications to repulse the invaders. Using 500‚Äì800 African-American slaves working up to twelve hours per day, Moncrief constructed an entrenched defensive line, which included redoubts, nearly long, on the plains outside the city. Vessels The British Royal Navy contributed two over-age frigates, and . They landed their guns and most of their men to reinforce the land forces. In addition, the British also deployed the armed brig and the armed ship , the latter from the East Florida navy. There were two galleys, and Thunder, also from East Florida. Lastly, the British armed two merchant vessels, Savannah and Venus.Buker (1979). Siege A map of the siege D'Estaing began landing troops below the city on September 12, and began moving in by September 16. Confident of victory, and believing that Maitland's reinforcements would be prevented from reaching Savannah by Lincoln, he offered Prevost the opportunity to surrender. Prevost delayed, asking for 24 hours of truce. Owing to miscommunication about who was responsible for preventing Maitland's movements, the waterways separating South Carolina's Hilton Head Island from the mainland were left unguarded, and Maitland was able to reach Savannah hours before the truce ended. Prevost's response to d'Estaing's offer was a polite refusal, despite the arrival of Lincoln's forces. On 19 September, as Charles-Marie de Trolong du Rumain moved his squadron up the river, he exchanged fire with Comet, Thunder, Savannah, and Venus. The next day the British scuttled Rose, which was leaking badly, just below the town to impede the French vessels from progressing further. They also burnt Savannah and Venus. By scuttling Rose in a narrow part of the channel, the British effectively blocked it. Consequently, the French fleet was unable to assist the American assault. Germaine took up a position to protect the north side of Savannah's defenses. Comet and Thunder had the mission of opposing any attempt by the South Carolinian galleys to bombard the town. Over the next few days, British shore batteries assisted Comet and Thunder in engagements with the two South Carolinian galleys; during one of these, they severely damaged Revenge. The French commander, rejecting the idea of assaulting the British defenses, unloaded cannons from his ships and began a bombardment of the city. The city, rather than the entrenched defenses, bore the brunt of this bombardment, which lasted from October 3 to 8. \\"The appearance of the town afforded a melancholy prospect, for there was hardly a house that had not been shot through\\", wrote one British observer.Morrill, p. 60 When the bombardment failed to have the desired effect, d'Estaing changed his mind, and decided it was time to try an assault. He was motivated in part by the desire to finish the operation quickly, as scurvy and dysentery were becoming problems on his ships, and some of his supplies were running low. While a traditional siege operation would likely have succeeded eventually, it would have taken longer than d'Estaing was prepared to stay. =Attack= Casimir Pulaski death near Savannah, by Stanis≈Çaw Kaczor-Batowski, 1933 Against the advice of many of his officers, d'Estaing launched the assault against the British position on the morning of October 9. The success depended in part on the secrecy of some its aspects, which were betrayed to Prevost well before the operations were supposed to begin around 4:00 am. Fog caused troops attacking the Spring Hill redoubt to get lost in the swamps, and it was nearly daylight when the attack finally got underway. The redoubt on the right side of the British works had been chosen by the French admiral in part because he believed it to be defended only by militia. In fact, it was defended by a combination of militia and Scotsmen from John Maitland's 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders, who had distinguished themselves at Stono Ferry. The militia included riflemen, who easily picked-off the white-clad French troops when the assault was underway. Admiral d'Estaing was twice wounded, and Polish cavalry officer Casimir Pulaski, fighting with the Americans, was mortally wounded. By the time the second wave arrived near the redoubt, the first wave was in complete disarray, and the trenches below the redoubt were filled with bodies. Attacks intended as feints against other redoubts of the British position were easily taken. The second assault column was commanded by the Swedish Count Curt von Stedingk, who managed to reach the last trench. He later wrote in his journal, \\"I had the pleasure of planting the American flag on the last trench, but the enemy renewed its attack and our people were annihilated by cross-fire\\". He was forced back by overwhelming numbers of British troops, left with some 20 men‚Äîall were wounded, including von Stedingk. He later wrote, \\"The moment of retreat with the cries of our dying comrades piercing my heart was the bitterest of my life\\". After an hour of carnage, d'Estaing ordered a retreat. On October 17, Lincoln and d'Estaing abandoned the siege. Aftermath and legacy The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war. While Prevost claimed Franco-American losses at 1,000 to 1,200, the actual tally of 244 killed, nearly 600 wounded and 120 taken prisoner, was severe enough. British casualties were comparatively light: 40 killed, 63 wounded, and 52 missing. Sir Henry Clinton wrote, \\"I think that this is the greatest event that has happened the whole war,\\" and celebratory cannons were fired when the news reached London.Morrill, p. 64 It was perhaps because of the siege's reputation as a famous British victory that Charles Dickens chose the siege of Savannah as the place for Joe Willet to be wounded (losing his arm) in the novel Barnaby Rudge. Three currently-existing Army National Guard units (118th FA,Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 118th Field Artillery. 131st MPDepartment of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 131st Military Police Company. and 263rd ADADepartment of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 263rd Air Defense Artillery.) are derived from American units that participated in the siege of Savannah. There are only thirty current U.S. Army units with lineages that go back to the colonial era. =Battlefield archaeology= In 2005, archaeologists with the Coastal Heritage Society (CHS) and the LAMAR Institute discovered portions of the British fortifications at Spring Hill, the site of the worst part of the Franco-American attack on October 9. The find represents the first tangible remains of the battlefield. In 2008, the CHS/LAMAR Institute archaeology team discovered another segment of the British fortifications in Madison Square. A detailed report of that project is available on line in pdf format from the CHS website. CHS archaeologists are currently finalizing a follow-up grant project in Savannah, which examined several outlying portions of the battlefield. These included the position of the Saint-Domingue reserve troops at the Jewish Burying Ground west of Savannah. An archaeology presentation and public meeting took place in February 2011 to gather suggestions for managing Savannah's Revolutionary War battlefield resources. Archaeologist Rita Elliott from the Coastal Heritage Society revealed Revolutionary War discoveries in Savannah stemming from the two \\"Savannah Under Fire\\" projects conducted from 2007 to 2011. The projects uncovered startling discoveries, including trenches, fortifications, and battle debris. The research also showed that residents and tourists are interested in these sites. Archaeologists described the findings and explored ways to generate economic income which could be used for improving the quality-of-life of area residents.

Henri Christophe, who later declared himself to be the king of (northern) Haiti, while a republic was established in southern Haiti, was 22-years old at the time and may have been among these troops. Many other less-famous individuals from Saint-Domingue served in this regiment and formed the officer class of the rebel armies in the Haitian Revolution, especially in the northern province around today's Cap-Ha√Øtien, where the unit was recruited.

Pelorus Jack was usually spotted in Admiralty Bay between Cape Francis and Collinet Point, near French Pass, a notoriously dangerous channel used by ships travelling between Wellington and Nelson. How he got his name is uncertain. It is recorded in the book Breverton's nautical curiosities : a book of the sea that he was named after the pelorus, a marine navigational instrument. However, Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, says the name came from Pelorus Sound because it was at the entrance to that stretch of water where he would regularly meet ships to accompany them. Pelorus Jack was shot at from a passing ship, and was later protected by a 1904 New Zealand law.  Appearance  Pelorus Jack was approximately long and was of a white color with grey lines or shadings, and a round, white head. Although its sex was never determined, it was identified from photographs as a Risso's dolphin, Grampus griseus. This is an uncommon species in New Zealand waters, and only 12 Risso's dolphins have been reported in that area. Pelorus Jack. Photographed by A. Pitt.  History  Pelorus Jack guided the ships by swimming alongside a water craft for 20 minutes at a time. If the crew could not see Jack at first, they often waited for him to appear. Despite his name, he did not live in nearby Pelorus Sound; instead, he would often guide ships through dangerous passages of French Pass. However, some local residents familiar with his habits claim that he never went through French Pass itself but stayed near the Chetwode Islands. Pelorus Jack was first seen around 1888 when it appeared in front of the schooner Brindle when the ship approached French Pass, a channel located between D'Urville Island and the South Island. When the members of the crew saw the dolphin bobbing up and down in front of the ship, they wanted to kill him, but the captain's wife talked them out of it. To their amazement, the dolphin then proceeded to guide the ship through the narrow channel. And for years thereafter, he safely guided almost every ship that came by. With rocks and strong currents, the area is dangerous to ships, but no shipwrecks occurred when Jack was present.Robbins, John (2011) Diet for a New America H J Kramer, . Many sailors and travellers saw Pelorus Jack, and he was mentioned in local newspapers and depicted in postcards. Jack was last seen in April 1912. There were various rumours connected to his disappearance, including fears that foreign whalers might have harpooned him. However, research suggests that Pelorus Jack was an old animal; his head was white and his body pale, both indications of age, so it is likely that he died of natural causes. Since 1989, Pelorus Jack has been used as a symbol for the Interislander, a ferry service across the Cook Strait, and is incorporated into the livery of the ships in the fleet.New Zealand's Cook Strait Rail Ferries, New Zealand Maritime Record = Shooting incident = In 1904, someone aboard the SS Penguin tried to shoot Pelorus Jack with a rifle. Despite the attempt on his life, Pelorus Jack continued to help ships. According to folklore, however, he no longer helped the Penguin, which shipwrecked in Cook Strait in 1909.Pelorus Jack fact sheet at the Museum of WellingtonThe Quest for Wild Dolphins = Protection = Following the shooting incident, a law was proposed to protect Pelorus Jack. He became protected by Order in Council under the Sea Fisheries Act on 26 September 1904. Pelorus Jack remained protected by that law until his disappearance in 1912. It is believed that he was the first individual sea creature protected by law in any country. Cultural references Kipa Hemi Whiro of NgƒÅti Kuia identified Pelorus Jack with Kaikai-a-waro, a sea-god or taniwha who had guided his ancestor Matua-hautere across Cook Strait from the North Island to settle in the South Island many generations earlier. \\"Pelorus Jack\\" is a Scottish Country dance, (dance instructions) named in honour of the dolphin. This dance features a set of alternating tandem half-reels (or heys) where two people act as one but swap who leads at the reel ends, this is now known as a Dolphin Reel. Arthur Ransome mentions Pelorus Jack as accompanying ships and receiving protection in his 1932 novel Peter Duck. However, the character of Peter Duck incorrectly locates the dolphin as living in Sydney Harbour. Singer/Songwriter Andrea Prodan tells the tale of the dolphin in the song 'Pelorus Jack' in his 1996 all-vocal record Viva Voce. Two bulldogs, named Pelorus Jack I (1913-1916) and Pelorus Jack II (1916-1919), served as mascots of HMS New Zealand, the battlecruiser that the New Zealand government paid to have built for the Royal Navy.

Life and career  Malskat was a painter from K√∂nigsberg. In 1951 he was employed by Dietrich Fey, whose firm was commissioned to restore the frescoes of cathedral of Marienkirche in L√ºbeck. The cathedral had been severely damaged in World War II bombings and left neglected after the war, so the medieval frescoes on its walls had nearly disappeared. The church had received donations worth DM 150,000 for restoration and Fey's company did the work behind closed doors. The work was finished September 2, 1951. The restorers were praised for their good work. The frescoes were unveiled during the seven-hundredth anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Marienkirche; dignitaries present included various government ministers, including Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. The West German government printed 2 million postage stamps depicting the frescoes. The next year Malskat announced that he had painted the frescoes himself. When he was ignored, he told his own lawyer to sue both Fey and himself. Both men were eventually arrested. The trial began in 1954. Evidence included Malskat's other forgeries of works of Marc Chagall and Toulouse-Lautrec. One estimate of the total value of his forgeries is over 15 million Euros in today's money. Malskat told that when the work had begun, the walls had been nearly empty of frescoes; he proved it by presenting a film depicting the unpainted walls. Instead of restoring the original frescoes, Malskat had whitewashed the walls and painted them over. New pictures included various anachronisms like an image of a turkey, which had not reached Europe at the time the original frescoes had been painted. Malskat had modelled various religious figures on his sister Freyda, actresses like Marlene Dietrich and even historical figures like Rasputin. Fey was sentenced for 20 months and Malskat for 18. The frescoes were washed off the church walls. After Malskat was released, he began to paint in his own name. He painted decorations on restaurants and inns, including the Tre Kronor Inn in Stockholm. He also arranged exhibitions of his works in northern Germany. He died in Wulfsdorf near L√ºbeck. A fictionalised version of Malskat's painting of the Marienkirche frescoes appears in the G√ºnter Grass novel The Rat. Malskat's forgeries are a major theme of the novel, as a symbol of the alleged corruption of post-war Germany.

She was the first Russian woman to command a military unit. Early life Maria Frolkova was born to a peasant family in Nikolsko in July 1889. Her father was a sergeant in the imperial army who fought in the Russo-Turkish War. She left home at sixteen to marry Afanasy Bochkarev. They moved to Tomsk, Siberia, where they worked as labourers. Her husband abused her, causing her to leave him. She found a job as a servant to employers who coerced her into working in their brothel. They moved her to Sretensk where Maria began a relationship with a local Jewish man named Yakov (or Yankel) Buk. She and Buk opened a butcher shop, but in May 1912 Buk was arrested for larceny and sent to Yakutsk. Bochkareva followed him into exile, primarily on foot, where the couple established another butcher shop. Buk was caught stealing again and sent to Amga in 1913. Once again Bochkareva followed him. Buk began drinking heavily and became abusive. Military career Bochkareva and Emily Pankhurst with women of the Women's Battalion of Death, 1917 At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Bochkareva left Buk and returned to Tomsk. In November, she was rejected by the 25th Tomsk Reserve Battalion of the Imperial Russian Army. The commander suggested that she try joining the Red Cross instead. She joined the army by securing the personal permission of Tsar Nicholas II. After three month' training, she began front-line duty with the 5th Corps, 28th Regiment of the Second Army, stationed at Polotsk. She was decorated for rescuing fifty wounded soldiers from the field. After she was wounded in the arm and leg, Bochkareva worked as a medical sister until she returned to the front as a corporal in charge of eleven men. She suffered another injury that left her paralyzed for four months. After she recovered, she returned to the front as a senior non- commissioned officer delivering supplies to a platoon of seventy men. Men of the regiment treated her with ridicule or sexually harassed her until she proved her courage in battle. Eventually, she became exhausted from her physical injuries and lost interest in her military post. She was discharged in the spring of 1917. After the abdication of the Tsar in early 1917 due to the February Revolution, she proposed to Mikhail Rodzianko the creation of an all-female combat unit that she claimed would fix the Army's morale problem. She believed that it would shame the men into again supporting the war effort. Once she agreed to lead the unit, her proposal was approved by Army Commander- in-Chief Brusilov, and she approached Minister of War Alexander Kerensky. Although female recruitment went against army regulations, the all-female battalion was granted special dispensation. This was the first women's battalion to be organised in Russia. Bochkareva's 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death initially attracted around 2,000 women volunteers, but the commander's strict discipline drove all but around 300 out of the unit. The rushed training of the battalion was led by twenty-five male instructors from the Volunskii Regiment of the Petrograd Military District. The battalion was blessed at Saint Isaac's Cathedral on June 25, 1917. After a month of training, Bochkareva and her unit became attached to the First Siberian Corps and was sent to the Russian western front to participate in the Kerensky Offensive, where Bochkareva was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. The unit was involved in one major battle‚Äînear the town of Smarhon. The women of the unit performed well in combat, but the vast majority of male soldiers, already demoralised, had little inclination to fight. Bochkareva herself was wounded in the battle and sent back to Petrograd to recuperate. Bochkareva was only marginally involved in the creation of other women's combat units formed in Russia during the spring and summer of 1917. Her unit was at the front at the time of the October Revolution and did not participate in the defence of the Winter Palace‚Äîanother women's unit did, the 1st Petrograd Women's Battalion. Bochkareva's unit disbanded after facing increasing hostility from the remaining male troops at the front. Bochkareva returned to Petrograd where she was briefly detained by the Bolsheviks. She secured permission to rejoin her family in Tomsk but returned to Petrograd again in early 1918. She claims to have then received a telegram asking her to take a message to General Lavr Kornilov, who was commanding a White Army in the Caucasus. After leaving Kornilov's headquarters, she was again detained by the Bolsheviks and, after they learned of her connection with the Whites, was scheduled to be executed. She was rescued, however, by a soldier who had served with her in the Imperial Army in 1915 and who convinced the Bolsheviks to stay her execution. She was granted an external passport and allowed to leave the country. Bochkareva then made her way to Vladivostok, where she left for the United States by the steamship Sheridan in April 1918. United States and Britain Sponsored by socialite Florence Harriman, Bochkareva arrived in San Francisco and made her way to New York City and Washington, D.C. She was granted a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson on July 10, 1918, during which she begged the president to intervene in Russia. Wilson was apparently so moved by her emotional appeal that he responded with tears in his eyes and promised to do what he could.Jerome Landfield to Secretary Breckenridge Long, July 13, 1918. Department of State communique, Long Papers, box 38, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, Washington, DC. While in New York, Bochkareva dictated her memoirs, Yashka: My Life As Peasant, Exile, and Soldier, to a Russian emigre journalist named Isaac Don Levine. After leaving the United States, she traveled to Great Britain where she was granted an audience with King George V. The British War Office gave her 500 rubles of funding to return to Russia. Return to Russia and execution Bochkareva arrived in Arkhangelsk in August 1918 and attempted to organise another unit, but failed. In April 1919, she returned to Tomsk and attempted to form a women's medical detachment under White Army Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, but before she could complete this task she was recaptured by the Bolsheviks. She was sent to Krasnoyarsk where she was interrogated for four months. Ultimately, she was sentenced to death and executed as an \\"enemy of the working class\\". She was shot by the Cheka on May 16, 1920. Legacy Maria Bochkareva is one of the heroines of the Russian film Battalion directed by Dmitriy Meshiev and released to cinemas in February 2015. In 2018 the New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

He was born in Viipuri in 1888 and was the youngest child. When his father died in 1903, the family moved to Helsinki, where he got interested in football. He was a member of the Finland football team which played at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, losing 4‚Äì0 to England in the semi final. Niska joined his first ship in 1908. When the First World War broke out, he went to navigation school and graduated the following year ‚Äì thought he never got his papers. He was married twice and divorced both women. He had two children. The well-known Finnish musician Ilkka Lipsanen is his grandson. In 1919, when Finnish prohibition came into force, he acquired a large supply of now-illegal liquor. High society in Helsinki soon found out whom they could ask for refreshments. When the supply begun to run out, he bought a boat and begun to smuggle liquor from Estonian and German ships who waited outside Finnish territorial waters. Later he also smuggled liquor from Sweden, where it was legal but tightly controlled. Over the years he used various tricks to dodge police boats ‚Äì and sometimes the bullets of their machine guns ‚Äì during his trips between Turku, Helsinki, Tallinn and Stockholm and in the √Öland archipelago. He never shot back. In one case he unloaded his cargo right in the heart of Helsinki while people were distracted during the visit of Gustav V of Sweden. In one stage he was sentenced for a year in prison for resisting police. He claimed to the end of his days that he was innocent. Niska was eventually wanted both in Sweden and Finland. He was sentenced for short periods in both countries. In prison he became a model prisoner and was often released early for good behavior. In 1932 Niska was exiled from Sweden and he spent time in Riga, Tallinn and Danzig. He spoke at least Finnish, Swedish, German and English. In 1938, prior to World War II, Niska begun to smuggle something else ‚Äî Jewish refugees from Germany to the relative neutrality of Finland. His own estimate was 151 Jews. He used stolen and forged passports and various devious plots to get Jews from Germany through the Netherlands and Estonia. Reportedly he sometimes refused payment. When his network was exposed in 1939, he fled to Estonia and found that the Soviet Union had occupied the country. According to his own story, he fled back to Finland in a rowboat. Niska fought in Laatokka during the Winter War. There is no clear knowledge of what he did during the Continuation War. In the mid-1940s Niska tried to finance the building of a new boat by giving interviews about his life ‚Äì he needed the money and knew he could afford to ask. In 1951 Niska went through surgery in Antwerpen but did not pay the bill ‚Äì he was in serious debt in that time. In 1953 he was diagnosed with brain tumor and lost his speech and power of movement. He died on 28 May 1954. Publications He wrote two books, Yli vihre√§n rajan (Over the green border) and Mina √§ventyr (My adventures).

Originally named Bocaccio, she was renamed Charr on 24 September 1942 and launched 28 May 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. W. F. Orkney; and commissioned 23 September 1944, Commander F. D. Boyle in command. First war patrol, December 1944 ‚Äì March 1945 Pacific-bound, Charr cleared New London 5 November 1944, and reached Pearl Harbor 9 December. On 30 December, she was bound for action waters, as she sailed on her first war patrol off the northeast coast of Indo- China. On 29 January 1945, daring to lie at anchor in broad daylight for 4 hours one mile (1.6 km) off the coast, Charr sent two men ashore in a rubber boat to rescue a downed aviator. A second rescue mission came at the close of her patrol, when she escorted the badly damaged Dutch submarine HNLMS Zwaardvisch through the Java Sea and Lombok Straits to Fremantle, Australia, where the two submarines arrived 3 March. Second war patrol, March ‚Äì May 1945 After refit, Charr cleared on her second war patrol, cruising in the Flores, Java, and South China Seas, and along the southern coast of Taiwan. She sailed for part of the patrol in coordination with and , and with them conducted an epic 4-day chase of the Japanese cruiser Isuzu and her three escorts. Finally, early in the morning of 7 April 1945, Charr maneuvered into firing position to find Isuzu down by the stern and listing, evidence of successful attack by Gabilan. Charr fired a spread of torpedoes, scoring three hits to send the cruiser to the bottom. Three days later, 10 April 1945, Charr made contact with another target, a coastal freighter, which she sank on the surface by gunfire. The submarine then headed on for a dangerous assignment, calling for intricate maneuvering, when she laid a minefield off Pulo Island on 14 April and 15 April. She put in at Subic Bay from 20 April to 24 April to reload torpedoes, then sailed on to patrol off Formosa on lifeguard duty, during which she rescued one downed pilot. Third war patrol, June ‚Äì July 1945 After refitting at Subic Bay from 21 May to 14 June 1945, Charr put out on her third war patrol, cruising in the Gulf of Siam with three other submarines. At this late date in the war, targets were few, for Charr's sister submarines, as well as air and surface forces, had broken the back of Japan's navy and merchant fleet. The wolf pack however, did find a target in the I-351 on 15 July. After Charr and the other wolfpack members had aided in cornering the Japanese submarine, sent her to the bottom. Post-war service Charr remained at Fremantle from 26 July to 29 August 1945, then sailed for repairs at Pearl Harbor and training at Guam until 30 January 1946 when she reached San Diego, her newly assigned home port. From this port, she made simulated war patrols to the Far East in 1947 and 1948, operating along the West Coast at other times. On several occasions, she carried members of the Naval Reserve on 2-week cruises, and assisted with training for briefer periods from 1949 through July 1951 when she entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a \\"Fleet Snorkel\\" conversion which streamlined her appearance and equipped her with a snorkel, thus enhancing her underwater cruising range. With her conversion completed 19 November 1951, she prepared for overseas deployment, and on 26 March 1952, she sailed to support United Nations forces in Korea, conducting patrols throughout the Far East. She returned to San Diego 2 October 1952 for local operations, which continued to include occasional training cruises for the Naval Reserve. Charr again cruised in the Far East from 11 June to 7 December 1954, training air and surface forces in antisubmarine warfare, and conducting patrols. On 9 November, she played hostess to Chiang Kai-shek on his first cruise in a submarine. Upon her return to the west coast, she resumed her normal operating schedule, and did not return to the western Pacific again until 22 March 1957 to 14 October 1957. A highlight of her next period of service was an exercise with ships of the Canadian Navy in the fall of 1958, which was followed by preparations for her 1959 Far Eastern cruise, completed between 6 May and 28 October. Through 1960, she continued operations from San Diego. On September 26, 1961, a broken coupling allowed sea water to flood the engine room of the Charr while submerged to 100 feet 150 miles off the coast of California. Heroic crewmen sealed themselves in the engine room and maintained power to rapidly bring the Charr to the surface. That incident made the news and headlines of the day and the two crewmen received Navy Commendations.http://ussnautilus.org/blog/charrs-troubles/ Charr was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine (AGSS-328) in 1966. She was decommissioned, 28 June 1969, stricken from the Naval Register, 20 December 1971, and sold for scrap, 17 August 1972. Honors and awards Of Charr's three war patrols, the second was designated a \\"successful war patrol\\", for which she received one battle star.

It is the northern part of Waziristan, a mountainous region of northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan and covering . The capital city of North Waziristan is Miranshah.  Overview and history  North Waziristan comprises the area west and south-west of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa between the Kurram River (Tochi) to the north and the Gomal River to the south. Miranshah is district headquarter of North Waziristan. The city of Bannu lies immediately to the east, while the largest town on the Afghan side of the border is Khost. North Waziristan is divided into the three subdivisions of Mirali, Miranshah, and Razmak. The three subdivisions are further divided into nine Tehsils: Datta Khel Tehsil, Dossali Tehsil, Gharyum Tehsil, Ghulam Khan Tehsil, Mir Ali Tehsil, Miran Shah Tehsil, Razmak Tehsil, Shewa Tehsil, Spinwam Tehsil. = British (1894‚Äì1947) = The British entered Waziristan in 1894. After the British military operations in 1894‚Äì95, Waziristan was divided into two \\"agencies\\", North Waziristan and South Waziristan. The two parts have quite distinct characteristics, though both tribes are subgroups of the Wazir tribe, after which the region is named, and speak a common Waziristani dialect. They have a famed reputation as formidable warriors, and known for their hospitality. The tribes are divided into sub- tribes governed by male village elders who meet in a tribal jirga. Socially and religiously, Waziristan is an extremely conservative area. Women are carefully guarded, and every household must be headed by a male figure. Tribal cohesiveness is strong because of \\"Collective Responsibility Acts\\" in the Frontier Crimes Regulation. In 1910, North Waziristan Agency was constituted as a full-fledged agency with its headquarters at Miranshah. It is inhabited by the Wazir and Dawar tribes. The agency lies from 32.35 degrees to 33.22 degrees north latitude and 69.22 degrees to 70.38 degrees east longitude. It is bounded on the north by Afghanistan, Kurram Agency and Hangu District, on the east by tribal areas adjoining the Bannu and Karak Districts, on the south by South Waziristan Agency and on the west also by Afghanistan. The total area of the agency is . = War on Terror = In 2014, about 98,640 people were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb, a military offensive conducted by the Pakistan Armed Forces along the Pak-Afghan Border.North Waziristan IDPs figure reaches 800,000. Dawn. July 8, 2014. In 2018, it became a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan with merger of the entire FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after the Parliament's approval. Geography Map of agencies and frontier regions in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan Geographically, the whole of Waziristan is a single unit. However, for administrative convenience it has been split into two agencies: North and South Waziristan. The area has been described as a land of high and difficult hills with deep and rugged defiles. The mountains of North Waziristan are geographically separate from the larger mountain systems of Koh-e-Sufaid in the north and Sulaiman in the south. The Waziristan hills were subject to igneous activity during the late Cretaceous period. The highly mineralised zone of Razmak is connected with it. The mountains and hills form a rampart between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The average height of the Waziristan hills is above sea level. The important ranges in the Waziristan hills are Derwesta, Laran, Vizhda, Ingame, Shoidar(highest peak Shuiar Sar of NWA is part of this range; visible from Cadet College Razmak also), Shawal, Eblunkai, Alexandra, Muzdak and Zakha. The Tochi River flowing through the agency has formed the Tochi Pass, through which armies, people and cultures have moved in and out of this region. The Tochi Pass connects Ghazni, Afghanistan with Bannu, Pakistan. The Tochi River has carved a large and important valley which is bounded by hills and mountains on all sides except the eastern side. It is about in length and opens up into the Indus Valley near Bannu. The Tochi valley is fertile and cultivable. Ketu and Kurram are the two minor rivers which flow in the northern part of the agency. There are five notable rivers: Tochi, Kaitu, Kurram, Khaisor, and Shaktue. Some notable streams are Kishi Aigad, Chashma Aigad, Saidgi Algad, Kanungo Aigad, Sagga Aigad, Tauda China Algad, Damoma Algad, Tarkhobi Algad, Suedar Aigad.  Administration  North Waziristan District is currently subdivided into nine tehsils. * Datta Khel Tehsil * Dossali Tehsil * Gharyum Tehsil * Ghulam Khan Tehsil * Mir Ali Tehsil * Miran Shah Tehsil * Razmak Tehsil * Shewa Tehsil * Spinwam Tehsil * Shawal Tehsil Mining The following minerals have been found in the area: *Copper associated with volcanics at Boya and Manzarkhel Spinkamar (east of Shora- Algad) *Manganese associated with cherts *Chromite associated with serpentinites. There are only two mining sites of chromite: at Syed Abad (Mohammad Khel); and Saidgi. *Gold and diamond mines in Muhammad Khel *In some hills, ordinary stones are mined for construction of buildings, etc. Nowadays chromite and copper mining have occurred at Razmak Malakan village. Climate The climate of the area is cold in winter and warm in summer. Summer season starts from May and continues until September. June is generally the warmest month. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of June are 31 and 18 degrees Celsius, respectively. Winter starts in October and continues until April. December, January, and February are the cold months. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures during the month of January are 10 and ‚àí2 degrees Celsius, respectively. Rainfall is low except in the Razmak area where the rainfall is slightly higher. Archeological Finds In 1966 Ahmad Hasan Dani located Buddhist sites from the area: > Coins of the Parthian and Kusana rulers have been found previously in the > Shertala plain. Some archeological finds were reported by Sir Aurel Stein. > In fact we also located during our visit a Buddhist Stupa site not far from > Spinwam. But nothing definite is known about the early history of this > region. > The Tochi Valley inscriptions for the first time attest to the presence of > the Shahi rulers here ... '' Ethnic groups and tribes The chief tribes in North Waziristan are the Utmanzai, Wazirs and Dawars. There are small tribes, like the Gurbaz, Kharsins, Saidgis and Malakshis Mahsuds, and Bangashs. These tribes, except the Saidgis, are Pakhtuns. According to the tribal annals, they are descendants of Karlan, who are descended from Qais Abdur Rashid. Some historians believe that they are ethnically Semites. The traditions of the tribesmen, however, indicate that they are descendants of Karlan and are, therefore, generally accepted as being a tribe of Karlanri Pakhtuns. The Saidgis are the descendants of a Syed who accompanied the founder of the Wazir tribe. The Wazirs dominate the hilly tracts: Khaisora, Sherathala Plain, Spinwam Mirali, Shewa, Kaitu Valley, Razmak, lower stretches of the Kurram River, upper parts of Tochi Valley beyond Kharakamar and alongside the Tochi Valley such as Anghar kalay, Spalga, Mir Khon Khel. They are divided into three main sections: Ibrahim Khel, Wali Khel, and Mohmit Khel. These sections are further divided into several sub-sections. The Dawars are divided into two main sections: Tor Gund and Spin Gund. The inhabitants of village Tappi, village Miranshah, and Issuri Haidar Khel are Tor Gund and the remaining are Spin Gund. In the time of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the total number of Dawars was 12,000 (3,000 Tor Gund 9,000 Spin Gund), and Waziris were 60,000. The traditional jirga of Spin Gund are still called \\"lazariza\\" (the meeting of all the 9,000 Spin Gund). Those living under the administrative control of Miranshah tehsil are known as \\"Upper Dawars\\". Those living under the administrative control of Mirali tehsil are known as Lower Dawars. They have settled in the fertile Tochi valley, mostly on the left bank of the Tochi River, from Khajuri to Kharkamar. They are more educated as compared to Wazirs because most of the educational institutions are in the Dawar area. The Kharsins are affiliated with Bora Khel and Madda Khel Wazirs. They live near the Durand Line to the northwest of the agency flanked by Madda Khel Wazirs and Saidgis. Mahsuds are the cousins of Wazirs; both have common ancestor: Wazirs. A section of Mahsuds called Bahlol Zai Malakshai occupy a small portion of Razmak surrounded by Bora Khel and Tori Khel Wazirs. The Saidgis occupy Zoi valley, Shawal. Dawegar and Dande plain near the Durand Line. The Kabulkhel contains Miami, Malakshahis, Pipali'Saifali are located in Shewa tehsil. Kabulkhel has two regions in Waziristan: Shawal and Shawa. They migrate to Shawal in summer. Dress and ornaments The common dress of tribesmen consists of shirt, trousers, waist-coat, sheet of cloth, turban, and Chappal. A Wazir woman wears a sleeved blouse or petticoat and a long heavy shirt, locally famous as Staar Khat with trousers. She covers her head and body with a sheet of cloth. A married woman wears coloured trousers while an unmarried woman wears simple trousers. For festivals and marriages, Wazir women put on colourful and ornamented blouses and multi-coloured frocks sometimes made of cloths. To further adorn themselves, the women put on rectangular pieces of silver and gold that hang on their forehead and side- ways down to ear. While the dress of Dawars are almost the same as the Wazirs, although there are some differences due to regional, and climate variations. Dawar wear almost all kind of dresses usually used throughout Pakistan. Food The staple food of the tribesman is wheat or maize bread. Milk is consumed in its various forms. Roasted meat larmin is relished. The people of Waziristan generally like a fried goat dish called pulawo, served in hilly areas. Dwelling The Dawars live in houses close together in a compact area. Large joint Waziri families live either in one house called ket or kot or in houses adjacent to one another, but separated from the houses of the other families. A walled enclosure of mud or mud and stones three to five metres (16.4 ft) high is called a kot. Most kots have a fort-like structure, with a tower in the centre, which is used as a strategic point for fighting with the enemy when hostilities break out. Every section in a village has a Masjid and a common sitting place. One or more households have a private guest house hujra attached to the house. In a house, there may be one or several rooms. Wazirs people mostly live near mountainous areas and they have a generally different lifestyle from the Dawar tribes, who live near rivers and on plains. Occupation Due to the rugged nature of the terrain and their lack of education, many inhabitants believe they must depend upon government services. Many emigrate abroad to earn livelihoods. Local people have also invested in transportation-related businesses. Wazir tribes generally run businesses, while Dawar tribes are more heavily employed through government services, particularly in education sector and civil services. Emigres from Waziristan tend to prefer medical and engineering education and travel all around the country. Places of interest Miranshah is the headquarters of North Waziristan Agency, It is connected with Bannu and other important places in the agency by metalled roads. This town houses the offices of all government departments in the agency and also serves as a market centre for people of the area. Razmak and Shawaal Valleys are both summer resorts for the local Waziristanis and beautiful tourist spots for tourists, thousands of tourists visit here annually. Razmak Cadet College is one of the most famous and historical educational institutions of the country, and students from all corners of the country come to study here. Administrative setup The agency is under the general charge of a Political Agent who administers civil, criminal and revenue cases in accordance with Frontier Crimes Regulation and Customary Law. The North Waziristan Agency consists of three sub-divisions and nine Tehsils. The Miranshah sub-division comprises the Miranshah, Ghulam Khan, and Datta Khel tehsils. The Mirali sub-division contains the Mirali, Spinwam, and Shewa tehsils. The Razmak sub-division consists of the Razmak, Dossali, and Garyum tehsils. Each of the sub-divisions is headed by an Assistant Political Officer/Assistant Political Agent. The Political Agent is assisted by three Assistant Political Agents in criminal cases and other official work including matters maintaining law and order in the agency. Assistant Political Agents assist the Political Agent in tackling problems of the agency. They perform their duties like a Liaison Officer between the Political Agent and the tribes. They also decide cases of minor criminal nature and civil suits. A new post of Additional Political Agent has been established who looks after the developmental sector of the whole agency. The need was felt for reason of high level intervention in developmental sector by both governmental and non- governmental organizations. In addition to these duties the Additional Political Agent acts as Political Agent in his absence. Furthermore, all the Line Directorates work under supervision of Additional Political Agent. Political Tehsildars and Political Naib- Tehsildars are in charge of Tehsils and their main duty is to control the tribes and maintain law and order within their own areas. They are answerable to the Political Agent through the Assistant Political Agent. They deal with all cases occurring in the protected area of their respective Tehsils. Land revenue administration in some parts of the agency is carried on exactly on the same lines as in the settled districts of Pakistan. The Frontier Crimes Regulation is applicable in this area. Cases occurring in the unprotected area are decided by the tribes themselves through their elders who are known as Maliks and Motabars. The Maliki system introduced by British government was the same in North Waziristan Agency as functioning in other FATA. Maliks use to work like a medium between administration and the Qaum or tribe. A Maliki is hereditary and devolves on the son and his son so on and so both for which regular benefits and subsidies are sanctioned from time to time. Lungi system known as Sufaid Resh is slightly lower form of Maliki. In North Waziristan Agency there are 1,620 Maliks and Lungi holders. Pakistan's new Waziristan strategy On 4 June 2007, the National Security Council of Pakistan met to decide the fate of Waziristan and take up a number of political and administrative decisions to control \\"Talibanization\\" of the area. The meeting was chaired by president Pervez Musharraf and it was attended by the Chief Ministers and Governors of all four provinces. They discussed the deteriorating law and order situation and the threat posed to state security. The government decided to take a number of actions to stop the \\"Talibanization\\" and crush the armed militancy in the Tribal regions and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The NSC of Pakistan has decided the following actions will be taken to achieve the goals: *Deployment of unmanned reconnaissance planes *Strengthening law-enforcement agencies with advanced equipment *Deployment of more troops to the region *Operations against militants on fast-track basis *Focused operations against militant commanders *Action against madrassahs preaching militancy *Appointment of regional coordinators *Fresh Recruitments of police officers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa The ministry of interior has played a large part in the information gathering for the operations against militants and their institutions. The Ministry of Interior has prepared a list of militant commanders operating in the region and they have also prepared a list of seminaries for monitoring.

The population was 874 in 2001,Office for National Statistics: Census 2001: Parish Headcounts: Ceredigion Retrieved 19 January 2010 but fell to 819 at the 2011 census. Nonconformism The village is associated with Daniel Rowland (born here in 1713) and the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century. Rowland served as curate at Nantcwnlle and Llangeitho. The village chapel, built in 1760, became famous throughout Wales as a Calvinistic Methodist centre and thousands visited it to hear the preaching. Rowland was buried in the village and there is a memorial column to him. Two larger, replacement chapels were built in 1764 and 1814. Llangeitho saw several further periods of religious revival in that century. The strongest was in 1762, when rejoicing, dancing and jumping for joy earned the Welsh Methodists the nickname \\"Jumpers\\". William Williams Pantycelyn wrote in defence of the celebrations. The village was also the childhood home of David Martyn Lloyd-Jones. A local character in around 1885: Bet Fach at age 92. Language Like much of Ceredigion, Llangeitho was a stronghold of the Welsh language, but in the 1970s, newcomers to the village contributed to a decline in the proportion of habitual Welsh speakers from 83 per cent in 1971 to 55 per cent ten years later. The second figure recurred in 2011. The 17th-century poet and minstrel Dafydd Llwyd Mathau is thought to have come from the Llangeitho area. About north of the village is the mansion of Cwrt Mawr, where the antiquary J. H. Davies (1871‚Äì1926) built up a valuable collection of Welsh-language manuscripts, known as the Cwrtmawr manuscripts. He donated them to the National Library of Wales, where they remain. Church The village church, across the river to the north of the village, is on an ancient site, but the current church was entirely rebuilt in 1821, retaining nothing of the medieval fabric, which included a double rood screen and three arches. National Monuments Record of Wales The church and parish are named after St Ceitho. The water of St Ceitho's Spring is said to have the peculiarity that it is cool in summer and tepid in winter.

Early years Michael Coleman was born in Knockgrania, in the rural Killavil district, near Ballymote, County Sligo, Ireland. His father, James Coleman, was from Banada in County Roscommon, and a respected flute player. Michael was the seventh child of James and Beatrice, and the surviving half of a pair of twins. As a child he learned step dancing and fiddle playing, and performed at local houses. His elder brother Jim had a high reputation but was never recorded. In his formative years Michael was influenced by Uilleann pipers (a type of bagpipe), including Johnny Gorman. He left school in 1908, at the age of 17. He competed at the Sligo Feis Ceoil in 1909 and again in 1910, and was placed joint third on both occasions. In 1914 he moved to Manchester, England to live with his older brother Pat, but returned home after several months. Immigration to the United States In October 1914, at the age of twenty- three, Coleman sailed to America with his friend John Hunt. Initially he stayed with his aunt in Lowell, Massachusetts and briefly joined the Keith Theatres vaudeville circuit. In 1917, he settled in New York City, and married Marie Fanning, originally from County Monaghan, Ireland. They had one child, Mary. Between 1921 and 1936 he recorded roughly eighty commercial 78-rpm records for many record labels, including Shannon, Vocalion Records, Columbia Records, Okeh Records, New Republic, Pathe, O'Beirne de Witt, Victor Records, Brunswick Records, and Decca Records. Some of these were re-issued under the Intrepid, Coral Records, and Ace of Hearts labels. Coleman was usually accompanied by one of the following pianists: Kathleen Brennan, Arthur P. Kenna, John Muller, Eileen O‚ÄôShea, Edward Lee, and Ed Geoghegan. However, on three 1934 78 discs (six sides) for the Decca label, Coleman was accompanied by tenor guitar player Michael \\"Whitey\\" Andrews. Flute players Tom Morrison and Michael Walsh, and piccolo player Paddy Finlay, separately accompanied Coleman on a few of his 1920s recordings. In 1944 Coleman recorded ten tracks for the Decca controlled World Broadcasting Company. These were Coleman's final studio recordings, but they were never issued commercially. Throughout the 1940s Coleman recorded four solo aluminum acetates for a private collector, and made radio broadcasts. Coleman was the most famous exponent of what is today known as the Sligo fiddle style, which is fast and flamboyant, and heavily ornamented with fingered \\"rolls\\" and bowed triplets. Coleman was also an excellent dancer and performer. Coleman danced and played the fiddle at the same time, as confirmed by his daughter Mary, on the Irish film, From Shore to Shore. James Morrison, Paddy Killoran and Paddy Sweeney were other famed Sligo fiddlers who also recorded in New York in the 1920s and '30s. Other notable mentions are Hugh Gillespie and Andy McGann who were both students and friends of Coleman. While these musicians shared a basic approach and much common repertoire, there were noticeable differences in their playing. Coleman in particular employed extensive melodic variations, and his settings of tunes such as \\"The Boys of the Lough,\\" \\"Bonny Kate\\" and \\"Lord Gordon's\\" have become part of the standard Irish fiddle repertoire. Some of Coleman's records were reissued on British labels and others reached Ireland as American imports, heavily influencing a new generation of fiddlers in Sligo and elsewhere. Coleman died in New York City, and is buried in St. Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. Legacy Coleman's influence on traditional fiddle playing is substantial. Every generation since has been influenced by his recordings either directly or indirectly. Most notably, he has influenced fiddle players such as Lad O'Beirne, Martin Wynne, Ben Lennon, Martin Byrnes, Ti-Jean Carignan and many others. In 1974, a monument was erected by the Coleman Traditional Society. It is close to his birthplace, on the Tubbercurry to Gurteen road. Nearby is the Coleman Heritage Centre, a music archive and a replica of the house where he lived. The monument bears this inscription: :\\"Michael Coleman. Master of the fiddle. Saviour of Irish traditional music. Born near this spot in 1891. Died in exile 1945.\\" In March 2015, the U.S. Library of Congress chose its annual list of sound recordings for inclusion in its National Recording Registry.

Located in the centre of the island's northern coast, it stretches along of coastline and is across at its widest point. It is an arm of the Tasman Sea, lying on the western approach to Cook Strait. At the bay's western extremity, the land around the bay is rough and densely forested. Separation Point, the westernmost point of the bay, is located in Abel Tasman National Park and separates Tasman Bay from its smaller neighbour, Golden Bay. To the east, the land is also steep, with the westernmost points of sea-drowned valleys of the Marlborough Sounds. D'Urville Island sits to the northeast of Tasman Bay's easternmost point. Arrow Rock is situated off the coast of Nelson. The coast of Tasman Bay in Motueka The land between these two extremes is more gently rolling, and also includes the coastal plains around the mouth of the Waimea River at the bay's southernmost point. Other rivers entering the sea along the coast of the bay include the Riwaka, the Motueka and Serpentine Rivers. The long low form of Rabbit Island is located close to the bay's south coast. Tasman Bay contains the rare rock formation known as the Boulder Bank. The fertile land around the centre of the bay's coast is extensively cultivated and known for its horticultural crops such as apples, kiwifruit, olives, grapes and hops. In the middle of the twentieth century the Tasman Bay area produced large crops of tobacco. There is a tobacco museum in Motueka. It is also the most densely populated part of the South Island's north coast, and several towns and the city of Nelson are all located close to the shore. These towns include Motueka, Riwaka and Richmond. History The location's original name, Blind Bay, was given by Captain Cook in 1770. The name of the bay was officially altered to Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere in August 2014.

The carillon is managed and maintained by the National Capital Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. It has 57 bells, ranging nearly 5 octaves from the 6,108kg bass bell in F# to the 8kg treble bell in D.  History  The carillon was a gift from the British Government to the people of Australia to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the national capital, Canberra. The structure was the subject of a limited competition between three selected Australian architects and three selected British architects. Assessors of the competition were Lord Holford, Sir Donald Gibson and Sir John Overall (Chairman of the National Capital Development Commission). The winners were the Western Australian firm of Cameron Chisholm Nicol. The Carillon was designed in 1967, built during 1969 and completed in 1970. The three columns of the design symbolise the British and Australian Governments and the City of Canberra. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened the National Carillon on 26 April 1970. The Carillon has a symbolic value in the link between Britain and Australia. It also has some historic value for its association with the commemoration of the 50th Jubilee of the founding of Canberra. The tower stands tall. The concept was developed in 1968 by Don Ho, an architect at Cameron Chisholm Nicol. The carillon bells and mechanism were designed and constructed by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. The Carillon is a good example of the late twentieth century Brutalist style. Its use of strong shapes which are boldly composed, the diagonal line of the roofs, large areas of blank wall, use of precast non load-bearing wall panels and strongly vertical windows and openings are all features of this style. =2019 Upgrade= In 2019 the carillon was upgraded with a new clavier, a fully replaced transmission and the addition of 2 new bells to add the lowest semitone and a new highest bell. The new lowest semitone bell was called the Ngunnawal bell, in recognition of the first peoples of the Canberra region. This bell weighs just over 5 tonnes and sounds the note G. The other bell added was a new lightest bell to extend the rage of the instrument to nearly 5 octaves. This work was carried out by John Taylor & Co. The work was delayed by the onset of the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.  Characteristics  Carillons must have at least 23 bells to be considered as such, and the National Carillon has 57. It was initially installed with 53, and increased to 55 during refurbishments in 2003-4. Each bell weighs between and . The bells span four and a half octaves chromatically. John Douglas Gordon, after whom the Aspen Island footbridge is now named, played the inaugural recital. The carillon features moderate-size function facilities for small gatherings offering views over Lake Burley Griffin and central Canberra. The carillon is in regular use, chiming every quarter-hour and playing a short tune on the hour along with tours and recitals on many days. For example, there is usually a recital of carols on Christmas Eve each year with music being played for around an hour at dusk. The best place to listen to the carillon is suggested to be within of the building though the sound can usually be heard much further away in the Parliamentary Triangle, Kingston and Civic. =Links to memorials= The adjacent National Workers Memorial was constructed with the idea that people attending would hear the sound of bells from the carillon, which would assist them in remembering their loved ones.

Methodist preachers such as Daniel Rowland, William Williams and Howell Harris were heavily influential in the movement. The revival led eventually to the establishment of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists as a denomination (now more commonly known as the Presbyterian Church of Wales) and it also revitalised older dissenting churches. Beginnings The revival's immediate beginnings are usually traced back to the religious conversion of Howell Harris at Talgarth church in 1735. While listening to the Rev. Pryce Davies preaching on the necessity of partaking of Holy Communion Harris came to the conviction that he had received mercy through the blood of Christ. He began to tell others about this and to hold meetings at his home at Trefeca for these followers. Many consider Griffith Jones (1684-1761), the rector of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire to have been a forerunner of the Methodist movement in Wales. Through his circulating schools he taught thousands in Wales to read the Bible and created a generation of people which would be receptive to Methodist ideas. He himself also preached in the open air as later Methodist leaders would do. In fact, the newly converted Harris visited him for spiritual guidance and direction, and it was through his preaching that Daniel Rowland was converted and began to preach Methodist ideas. The other major leader of the early revival was William Williams, Pantycelyn. He was converted in 1737 as he listened to Harris preaching in Talgarth churchyard. Jumpers Following the Llangeitho revival of 1762 members of the revival were often known as Jumpers on account of their habit of jumping for joy. This nickname particularly stuck after William Pantycelyn wrote Llythyr Martha Philopur at y Parchedig Philo Evangelius eu hathro (Martha Philopur's letter to the Reverend Philo Evangelius her teacher) followed by Atteb Philo-Evangelius i Martha Philopur (Philo-Evangelius's reply to Martha Philopur). These texts attempted to teach and defend the practices of the revival including that of jumping. The nickname juxtaposed them with Quakers (who 'quaked') and Shakers (who 'shook'). A movement Rowland and Harris had been at work for eighteen months before they met at Defynnog church in 1737. This led to a friendship that lasted, with a ten-year break in fellowship, until Harris's death in 1773. Methodist leaders met regularly to organise their work and to agree on matters of common interest. Harris and Williams undertook major preaching journeys, starting in South Wales but later venturing north. As they preached they made converts, whom they then gathered together into organised groups of fellowships (known as seiadau (societies) in Welsh). As more and more converts were made, more and more evangelists were also created, and by 1750 there were over 400 such fellowship groups in Wales . These groups were closely supervised by the leaders and were built up into a significant and powerful network within the Church of England. Rowland concentrated his efforts on Llangeitho which became a centre for the movement. On Communion Sundays thousands of the members of the seiadau would travel there to receive the sacrament. A Calvinist movement The Welsh Methodist revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was Calvinist rather than Arminian. At the beginning the leaders worked with John Wesley, but gradually they parted company from Wesley and became associated with George Whitfield and his patron, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. Welsh Methodists and other denominations The Methodist revival began within the Church of England in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it. But its success meant that Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1823. The Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older nonconformist churches, or dissenters -- the Baptists and the Congregationalists -- who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was a predominantly a nonconformist country. Sources * .

Geography Banana is located at the intersection of the Dawson and Leichhardt highways, west of the shire's administrative centre, Biloela. History Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. The station property of Banana was gazetted in 1855, and an 1859 map shows a police station marked on the planned site for Banana. The name derives from an old dun-coloured working bullock, called Banana, used by local stockmen to help them when herding some of the wilder cattle into the yards.From series of articles published under the title Queensland place names and obelisks by Sydney May (formerly Honorary Secretary of the Queensland Place Names Committee) in Local Government, June 1957 - November 1964 At the time of the Canoona rush, gold was found in Banana's Gully (as it was then called) and a town of at least 2,000 people sprang up there. The post office at Banana was established on 1 September 1861.Porter, Harry S. (1954) Queensland Numeral Cancellations, p. 13. Melbourne: The Hawthorn Press Banana Provisional School opened on 18 September 1871 and was upgraded to Banana State School on 16 February 1874. The school closed in 1935, but reopened on 25 January 1960. In 1880, the local government area Banana Division (later the Shire of Banana) was established with its headquarters in Banana (taking its name from the town). However, in 1930 the shire headquarters became Rannes and the shire offices were physically relocated from Banana to Rannes. Since 1946, the shire has its headquarters in Biloela. The mobile library service commenced in 2004. In the 2011 census, Banana had a population of 377 people. Economy The beef industry is still a mainstay of the town and area, along with coal and agriculture. Education Bull statue, Banana State School, 2014 Banana State School is a government primary (P-6) school at 36 Bramston Street (). In 2012, there were 37 students enrolled with 3 teachers (2.5 full- time equivalent). There is no secondary school in Banana; the nearest are in Moura to the west and Biloela to the east. Amenities Banana Uniting Church, 2014 Banana has a Uniting Church at 39 Bowen Street (Leichhardt Highway) at the corner with North Street (). Banana Shire Council operate a fortnightly mobile library service to Banana and the school. The Banana branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at 123 Bramston Street.

The testing methodology is used to determine if a waste is characteristically hazardous, i.e., classified as one of the \\"D\\" listed wastes by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The extract is analyzed for substances appropriate to the protocol. List of \\"D\\" wastes published by US EPA Background In the United States, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 led to establishment of federal standards for the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste. RCRA requires that industrial wastes and other wastes must be characterized following testing protocols published by EPA. Part of \\"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods.\\" Document no. SW-846. TCLP is one of these tests. Application of test The Environmental Compliance Supervisor at a typical municipal landfill (as defined by RCRA Subtitle D) uses TCLP data to determine whether a waste may be accepted into the facility. If TCLP analytical results are below the TCLP D-list maximum contamination levels (MCLs) the waste can be accepted. If they are above these levels the waste must be taken to a hazardous waste disposal facility and the cost of disposal may increase from about $50.00/ton to as much as $1200.00/ton. As extremely contaminated material is expensive to dispose, grading is necessary to ensure safe disposal and to avoid paying for disposal of \\"clean fill.\\" The TCLP procedure is generally useful for classifying waste material for disposal options. Spent abrasive or soil from a construction site usually needs to have a TCLP for lead done to determine where the waste goes next. Procedure TCLP comprises four fundamental procedures: * Sample preparation for leaching * Sample leaching * Preparation of leachate for analysis * Leachate analysis In the TCLP procedure the pH of the sample material is first established, and then leached with an acetic acid / sodium hydroxide solution at a 1:20 mix of sample to solvent. For example, a TCLP jug may contain 100g of sample and 2000 mL of solution. The leachate mixture is sealed in extraction vessel for general analytes, or possibly pressure sealed as in zero-headspace extractions (ZHE) for volatile organic compounds and tumbled for 18 hours to simulate an extended leaching time in the ground. It is then filtered so that only the solution (not the sample) remains and this is then analyzed.

It can be defined as a Dirichlet series, it has an Euler product expansion, it satisfies a functional equation, it has an analytic continuation to a meromorphic function on the complex plane C with only a simple pole at s = 1, and its values encode arithmetic data of K. The extended Riemann hypothesis states that if Œ∂K(s) = 0 and 0 < Re(s) < 1, then Re(s) = 1/2. The Dedekind zeta function is named for Richard Dedekind who introduced it in his supplement to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's Vorlesungen √ºber Zahlentheorie. Definition and basic properties Let K be an algebraic number field. Its Dedekind zeta function is first defined for complex numbers s with real part Re(s) > 1 by the Dirichlet series :\\\\zeta_K (s) = \\\\sum_{I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{O}_K} \\\\frac{1}{(N_{K/\\\\mathbf{Q}} (I))^{s}} where I ranges through the non-zero ideals of the ring of integers OK of K and NK/Q(I) denotes the absolute norm of I (which is equal to both the index [OK : I] of I in OK or equivalently the cardinality of quotient ring OK / I). This sum converges absolutely for all complex numbers s with real part Re(s) > 1\\\\. In the case K = Q, this definition reduces to that of the Riemann zeta function. =Euler product= The Dedekind zeta function of K has an Euler product which is a product over all the prime ideals P of OK :\\\\zeta_K (s) = \\\\prod_{P \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{O}_K} \\\\frac{1}{1-N_{K/\\\\mathbf{Q}}(P)^{-s}},\\\\text{ for Re}(s)>1. This is the expression in analytic terms of the uniqueness of prime factorization of the ideals I in OK. For Re(s) > 1, Œ∂K(s) is non-zero. =Analytic continuation and functional equation= Erich Hecke first proved that Œ∂K(s) has an analytic continuation to the complex plane as a meromorphic function, having a simple pole only at s = 1\\\\. The residue at that pole is given by the analytic class number formula and is made up of important arithmetic data involving invariants of the unit group and class group of K. The Dedekind zeta function satisfies a functional equation relating its values at s and 1 ‚àí s. Specifically, let ŒîK denote the discriminant of K, let r1 (resp. r2) denote the number of real places (resp. complex places) of K, and let :\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathbf{R}(s)=\\\\pi^{-s/2}\\\\Gamma(s/2) and :\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathbf{C}(s)=2(2\\\\pi)^{-s}\\\\Gamma(s) where Œì(s) is the Gamma function. Then, the functions :\\\\Lambda_K(s)=\\\\left\\\\Delta_K\\\\right^{s/2}\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathbf{R}(s)^{r_1}\\\\Gamma_\\\\mathbf{C}(s)^{r_2}\\\\zeta_K(s)\\\\qquad \\\\Xi_K(s)=\\\\tfrac12(s^2+\\\\tfrac14)\\\\Lambda_K(\\\\tfrac12+is) satisfy the functional equation :\\\\Lambda_K(s)=\\\\Lambda_K(1-s).\\\\qquad \\\\Xi_K(-s)=\\\\Xi_K(s)\\\\; Special values Analogously to the Riemann zeta function, the values of the Dedekind zeta function at integers encode (at least conjecturally) important arithmetic data of the field K. For example, the analytic class number formula relates the residue at s = 1 to the class number h(K) of K, the regulator R(K) of K, the number w(K) of roots of unity in K, the absolute discriminant of K, and the number of real and complex places of K. Another example is at s = 0 where it has a zero whose order r is equal to the rank of the unit group of OK and the leading term is given by :\\\\lim_{s\\\\rightarrow0}s^{-r}\\\\zeta_K(s)=-\\\\frac{h(K)R(K)}{w(K)}. It follows from the functional equation that r=r_1+r_2-1. Combining the functional equation and the fact that Œì(s) is infinite at all integers less than or equal to zero yields that Œ∂K(s) vanishes at all negative even integers. It even vanishes at all negative odd integers unless K is totally real (i.e. r2 = 0; e.g. Q or a real quadratic field). In the totally real case, Carl Ludwig Siegel showed that Œ∂K(s) is a non-zero rational number at negative odd integers. Stephen Lichtenbaum conjectured specific values for these rational numbers in terms of the algebraic K-theory of K. Relations to other L-functions For the case in which K is an abelian extension of Q, its Dedekind zeta function can be written as a product of Dirichlet L-functions. For example, when K is a quadratic field this shows that the ratio :\\\\frac{\\\\zeta_K(s)}{\\\\zeta_{\\\\mathbf{Q}}(s)} is the L-function L(s, œá), where œá is a Jacobi symbol used as Dirichlet character. That the zeta function of a quadratic field is a product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet L-function is an analytic formulation of the quadratic reciprocity law of Gauss. In general, if K is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group G, its Dedekind zeta function is the Artin L-function of the regular representation of G and hence has a factorization in terms of Artin L-functions of irreducible Artin representations of G. The relation with Artin L-functions shows that if L/K is a Galois extension then \\\\frac{\\\\zeta_L(s)}{\\\\zeta_K(s)} is holomorphic (\\\\zeta_K(s) \\"divides\\" \\\\zeta_L(s)): for general extensions the result would follow from the Artin conjecture for L-functions.Martinet (1977) p.19 Additionally, Œ∂K(s) is the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function of Spec OK and the motivic L-function of the motive coming from the cohomology of Spec K. Arithmetically equivalent fields Two fields are called arithmetically equivalent if they have the same Dedekind zeta function. used Gassmann triples to give some examples of pairs of non- isomorphic fields that are arithmetically equivalent. In particular some of these pairs have different class numbers, so the Dedekind zeta function of a number field does not determine its class number.

He has been a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council since March 1996, representing East Yarra Province 1996-2006 (until it was abolished) and the Southern Metropolitan Region from 2006 onwards. He was state Minister for Health from 2010 to 2014 under Premiers Ted Baillieu and Denis Napthine. Early career Davis was born in Millicent, South Australia and studied in Melbourne, Victoria. He was educated at Kingswood College (Box Hill). He studied applied science at the Phillip Institute of Technology (now part of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). Davis also later studied philosophy at the University of Melbourne. He worked as a chiropractor and maintained a private practice until being elected to the Legislative Council in 1996. Political career Davis had become involved with the Liberal Party during the early 1990s, serving as a delegate on several party committees, and acting as a delegate to the party's State Council between 1993 and 1995. This was to ultimately result in receiving preselection for the safe Liberal seat of East Yarra at the 1996 state election. After the Liberal Party's defeat at the 1999 state election, Davis became the Chair of the Opposition Waste Watch Committee. In this position, he was one of the Labor government's strongest critics, regularly making claims of perceived abuses. In 2000, he became the Parliamentary Secretary for Scrutiny of Government. Davis almost lost his seat of East Yarra in the 2002 election, but became Shadow Minister for Health, replacing Ron Wilson, who had lost his seat in the 2002 election. In September 2004 Davis announced that if elected, a Liberal government would ban smoking in pubs and clubs. This was followed by a decision from the state government weeks later to the same effect. Davis was often an opponent of Robert Doyle's leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party. In 2005 Doyle transferred Davis to the lower-profile environment portfolio. In May 2006, after Doyles' resignation and replacement by Ted Baillieu, Davis was once again promoted and given Baillieu's former portfolio of planning. Following the 2006 election, Davis was again promoted by Baillieu to the position of Shadow Minister for State and Regional Development. In January 2008 he was elected Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council. Between February 2008 and November 2009, Davis was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Environment and Climate Change and in November 2009, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing, maintaining his responsibility for Scrutiny of Government.

Hawthorn Tri Club Rob de Castella was an outstanding track athlete as a teenager and trained under Pat Clohessy from the age of 11. Marathon career =1981 Fukuoka Marathon= De Castella first came to international attention when he won the 1981 Fukuoka Marathon in a time of 2:08:18, which was the fastest time recorded for an out- and-back course. It was not initially known to be a world best time, because his time was 5 seconds slower than the time set by Alberto Salazar in the 1981 New York City Marathon. It later emerged that the New York course was about 148 metres short. De Castella's time was later ratified as the world record. =1982 Commonwealth Games Marathon= De Castella was the favourite to win the marathon at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. At the start of the race, Tanzanians Gidamis Shahanga and Juma Ikangaa raced to the lead and were 50 m ahead of the pack after five minutes. After the 20 km mark, this gap had widened to several hundred meters. By the 23 km mark, Ikangaa had taken the lead from his compatriot, with de Castella in the main pack some 250 m behind, but closing. de Castella passed the now tiring Shahanga at the 38 km mark, and in the next kilometre drew level with Ikangaa then took the lead. However Ikangaa was not done yet, and re-took the lead slightly. The duel continued for the remainder of the race. Eventually de Castella pulled away, and won by 80 m in a time of 2:09:18, 12 seconds ahead of Ikangaa. Briton Mike Gratton finished third in 2:12:06, and Shahanga faded to finish 6th.

The race was also televised live back to Australia. De Castella's time was, at that point, the fourth fastest in history. =1984 Olympic Games= De Castella was the favourite for the 1984 Summer Olympics marathon. He ran comfortably in the main group until about 33 kilometres, when he slowed down to drink water. At the same time, the leading runners picked up speed and de Castella suddenly found himself out of contention. He accelerated during the final kilometres to finish fifth. =1986 Commonwealth Games= De Castella defended his Commonwealth Games title in Edinburgh, winning in 2:10:15. Cross country running In addition to marathon running, de Castella was also an accomplished cross country runner. He won the Australian national title once as a junior and four times as a senior, along with five other podium finishes.

Choosing to move rather than rebuild, he now lives in a nearby suburb. He later helped with the taskforce established for the reconstruction of areas worst affected by the fires. From 1990 to 1995, de Castella was the director of the Australian Institute of Sport and subsequently became executive director of Focus On You, a company focusing on corporate and community health and fitness. He has also been actively involved in other organisations dedicated to encouraging healthy living for both children and adults. He also fronts the Indigenous Marathon Project.

He was also 6-time Australian 6 Metre class champion (1946, 1947, 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956), 4-time Australian Dragon class champion (1951/52, 1952/53, 1953/54, and 1954/55), and 2-time Australian 5.5 Metre class champion (1956 and 1959). He also won 20 Victorian yachting championships. As an athlete, he represented Australia in four Olympic Games, 1948 London (Star class), 1952 Helsinki (Dragon class), 1956 Melbourne (Bronze Medal, 5.5 Metre class), and 1960 Rome (5.5 Metre class). He was also manager of the Australian Yachting Team for the London and Helsinki Games. At the Rome Olympic Games he became the first athlete to have represented Australia in four Olympic games, and in recognition of that fact was given the honour of being the Australian flag-bearer for the opening ceremony. Jock first international foray in yachting occurred in 1937, when he was invited to compete in two regattas held by the Royal Yacht Squadron (UK), one at Torbay and the other the Coronation Regatta held at Cowes. At the later he won the Coronation Cup for International 14 ft Dinghies in a boat owned by Sir Fitzroy Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. He also finished in third place in the 1948 World Star Championship held after the London Olympics at Cascais in Portugal, came third in the 1959 European Dragon Championship at Trieste in Italy, and second the 1959 German Dragon Championships at Lake K√∂nigssee in Germany. He achieved international public recognition when he skippered Australia's first challenge for the America's Cup in Gretel in 1962. Although defeated 4 to 1 by Weatherly, Gretel's victory in the second race was the first by a challenger since 1934, and is widely recognised as the first of the events that resurrected the America's Cup as an international sporting competition. He also skippered Dame Pattie, Australia's second America's Cup challenger, in 1967, which was beaten 4‚Äì0 by the highly controversial defender Intrepid. He also represented Australia multiple times as an ocean racing skipper in the Admiral's Cup (England) and the Clipper Cup (Hawaii), managed two successful Australian campaigns for the International Catamaran Challenge Trophy (the 'Little America's Cup'), and sailed in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race 11 times. Between 1972 and 1980 he was a member of the Olympic Fund Raising Committee. Jock Sturrock was recognised as the 1962 Australian of the Year, the 1962 Australian Yachtsman of the Year, and the 1962 Australian Sportsperson of the Year (the Lindy Trophy). In 1975 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to yachting.It's an Honour: MBE In 1985 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame as an 'Athlete Member', and in 1994 was elevated to a 'Legend of Australian Sports'. In June 2018 Jock was posthumously recognised by The Australian Sailing Team's Alumni Program as the first sailor to represent Australia in an Olympic class boat at an Olympic Games or World Championships and achieve a top 10 performance, by the awarding of the No.1 Barranjoey Medal. In October 2018 he was inducted into the Australian Sailing Hall of Fame. Military Service Jock served in the 46th Battalion of the Australian Army from 1940 to 1945, rising in rank from Private to Captain within his first two years. In 1942 he was seconded as a Liaison Officer to HQ 3rd Division 2AIF, trained for long-range specialist reconnaissance, intelligence gathering and sabotage behind enemy lines, and was appointed Adjutant to LHQ Tactical School (Jungle Warfare) on Rainy Mountain near Kuranda in Queensland. During 1943 and 1944 he saw active service in Papua New Guinea on three separate occasions, serving as an Intelligence Officer with both HQ New Guinea Force and HQ 3rd Division 2AIF during the war against the Japanese 51st Division at the Battle of Wau and the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. His duty was the gathering of intelligence from outlying spotter posts behind enemy lines, and carrying orders and intelligence back and forth along the Black Cat Track and the Buisaval Track between front-line troops and HQ. It also included a 5-week period in July 1943 when he was promoted in the field to Major and traversed the Bitoi River Track alone to act as Senior Liaison Officer with the United States Army's 41st Division 162nd Regiment at Nassau Bay. As the direct result of his army service Jock was hospitalised on five occasions: once for a broken ankle during training in Queensland, and in PNG twice for Dengue Fever, once for a concussion received when a US reconnaissance plane he was in crashed in the jungle between Nassau Bay and Wau, and finally for a broken leg received when a suspension bridge over the Bitoi River collapsed during a night-time crossing. This last event lead to him being invalided out of active service and returning to Melbourne, and affected his mobility for the rest of his life. Other Tributes Tributes to Jock include streets named after him: 'Sturrock Place' in the Canberra suburb of Gordon, and 3 'Sturrock Courts' in the Melbourne suburbs of Berwick, Mill Park and Altona Meadows; and the 'Jock Sturrock Bridge' in Noosaville, Queensland.

B. Widener (1834‚Äì1915). He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Harvard College in 1907, where he was a member of Hasty Pudding Theatricals and the Owl Club. Widener's godfather was the British banking magnate, Charles Mills, the 2nd Baron Hillingdon. Along with his parents, in April 1912 Widener boarded the Titanic at Cherbourg, France bound for New York City. As the ship sank Widener's mother and her maid were rescued, but Widener, his father, and his father's valet perished. In 1915, Widener's mother donated the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library to Harvard in his memory. Two buildings at the Hill School are also dedicated to Widener, and stained glass windows at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania are dedicated to Widener and his father. A Harvard legend holds that in order to spare others her son's fate, Widener's mother insisted (as a condition of her gift) that future Harvard graduates be required to learn to swim. However, while Harvard indeed implemented a swimming test in the 1920s (later dropped), this had nothing to do with Widener. Book collecting Widener was a member of the Grolier Club.

The attack garnered widespread media coverage as a fatality of a violent trend known as happy slapping and due to the belief that the attack was motivated by homophobia. In December 2005, four youths were found guilty of Morley's manslaughter. A fifteen-year-old girl, Chelsea O'Mahoney (aged fourteen at the time of the incident) was sentenced to an 8-year custodial sentence. Her co-defendants Reece Sargeant (21), Darren Case (18) and David Blenman (17), all from Kennington, South London, were sentenced to 12 years each. They had been prosecuted for murder, but the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter as they are permitted to do. Background Morley was known in the gay community of London as \\"Sinders\\". He was a manager at the Admiral Duncan pub when it was the target of a nail bomb attack in 1999 as part of the attacks against London's minorities by David Copeland. Morley suffered burns during the attack. Friends of Morley said he spent the weeks following the attack visiting and comforting those who had been more seriously injured in hospital. At the time of his death, he was working at another gay bar, Bromptons, located in Earls Court. Attack The attack on Morley was one of eight that the group carried out in the early hours of 30 October, but they had decided amongst themselves that they would attack people on the evening of 29 October. A 15-year-old associate of the group told police they planned to beat up \\"tramps, druggies or just people on the street.\\" Morley was the only fatality. The attacks were carried out between 2.30am and 3.20am. At 3.10am the group encountered Morley and his friend Alastair Whiteside sitting on a bench near London's Hungerford Bridge. O'Mahoney told Morley they were making a documentary on happy slapping and to \\"pose for the camera\\". They proceeded to attack the pair and stole Whiteside's mobile phone. After stealing the phone they continued to attack Morley and Whiteside. Whiteside's witness testimony stated that the girl, O'Mahoney, finished Morley off by kicking him two or three times in the head, \\"like a football.\\" After this attack the group continued to attack three more people. Morley was taken to St. Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth, where he was operated on, but was pronounced dead at 7.40pm. A post-mortem found he had suffered 44 injuries, including five fractured ribs. He died of a hemorrhage from a ruptured spleen and fractured ribs. The pathologist said the injuries were more consistent with those seen after a car accident or someone who had fallen from a great height.CCTV still of the attack against Wayne Miller No CCTV images saw O'Mahoney film the attack on Morley (as is the case with happy slap attacks) however she appears to be doing so in CCTV images of the final attack of the night against a homeless man, Wayne Miller. An extensive forensic investigation failed to find pictures or videos of the attacks on any of the assailants' mobile phones. On 23 January 2006 Sargeant, Case and Blenman were sentenced to twelve years in prison and O'Mahoney to eight years. O'Mahoney had been described as a \\"child of heroin addicts\\" with a \\"particularly chaotic and fragmented life\\". The other members of the gang were described as \\"immature and vulnerable to peer pressure\\". Memorial Over 1,000 people attended a vigil in commemoration of Morley's life at St Anne's Church, Soho on 5 November 2004. Speeches were given by his friends, and one on behalf of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Those who could not get into the church due to overcrowding stood in the street with candles. Morley's friend said, \\"This is the second time he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but for all of us here today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts.\\" Livingstone said, \\"David Morley was well known and well loved in London's lesbian and gay community.\\" References External links * * Category:2004 deaths Category:2004 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2004 in LGBT history Category:2004 in London Category:Murder in London Category:Deaths by beating in the United Kingdom Category:Filmed killings Category:English manslaughter victims Category:Gay men Category:LGBT people from England Category:Violence against LGBT people in the United Kingdom Category:Place of birth missing Category:October 2004 events in the United Kingdom Category:1967 births Category:History of the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Violence against gay men Category:Violence against men in the United Kingdom ","title":"Killing of David Morley"},{"id":"1131318","text":"Sir Bernard Thomas Heinze, AC (1 July 189410 June 1982) was an Australian conductor, academic, and Director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music. He conducted all the orchestras run by the ABC, most particularly the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, of which he was chief conductor from 1933 to 1950. Also, he was chief conductor of the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic from 1927, becoming Honorary Life Conductor in the 1960s, and continuing his association with the RMP until 1978. In addition he was guest conductor of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra in 1939. Discouraged by Australian audiences' lack of interest in music, he founded Children's Concerts. He also initiated the Young Performers Awards, which continue to showcase emerging international talent.ABC: Dimensions in Time He introduced Australian audiences to the works of Anton Bruckner, Dmitri Shostakovich, B√©la Bart√≥k and William Walton, and promoted Australian composers. In 1949 he became the first Australian ever to be knighted for services to music. Through teaching and performance, not least via broadcasting, he played a central role in his country's artistic activities. In his later years he was, quite simply, the most influential single man in Australian music, one critic having declared: 'there is not a fibre of our musical life that has not been modified by his career.' Biography Bernard Heinze was born in Shepparton, Victoria on 1 July 1894, the son of Benjamin Heinze, a German-born watch-maker and jeweller, and his Yorkshire-born wife, Minnie Heinze, n√©e Greenwell. Educated at St Patrick's Catholic College, Ballarat, Heinze received violin lessons at an early age, under the guidance of Walter Gude (1904‚Äì12) first in Ballarat, and later at the University of Melbourne under Franklin Peterson, before being awarded the (Sir William) Clarke Scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London (1913). World War I interrupted Heinze's studies and his career was put on hold; he received a commission in May 1916 with the British Royal Garrison Artillery Special Reserve Regiment and fought at Arras, Ypres, the Somme and Passchendaele. With the advent of peace, Heinze studied in Paris at the Schola Cantorum, under Vincent d'Indy. He returned home in 1923. When only 32 years old, he succeeded William Laver as Ormond Professor of Music at the University of Melbourne. He held this professorship till 1957, and played a crucial role in the creation of the Faculty of Music. Thus he influenced governmental education policy for the successful introduction of music to the state curriculum. One of Heinze's great achievements came with the advent of wireless radio. As director-general of music with the new National Broadcasting Service at 3LO-3AR (forerunner to the ABC), he was able to inspire a generation of Australians to the love of orchestral music that was until then largely a luxury confined to the upper classes. Heinze envisaged a central professional full-time orchestra in Melbourne. After Alberto Zelman's death in 1927, he was offered the conductorship of the Melbourne Philharmonic Society (later the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic); many of the players of the RMP's orchestra also played in Fritz Hart's Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. This led to the loss of the RMP Orchestra's separate identity. From 1932 to 1937, Heinze was co-chief conductor of the MSO with Hart, and sole chief conductor until 1950. The MSO was renamed the Victorian Symphony Orchestra in 1949, reverting to its original name in 1964. In 1929 Heinze was appointed music adviser to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. There he oversaw the inception of its State orchestras, celebrity concerts, youth concerts and fine music broadcasting. His last appointment of significance was as director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music (1956‚Äì66) succeeding Sir Eugene Goossens, who had resigned in scandal. After leaving the directorship in 1966, Heinze continued to conduct the main Australian orchestras on a regular basis until the late 1970s. He also conducted overseas orchestras: on 14 January 1947, he was the conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in the professional concerto debut of the 14-year-old Glenn Gould, who played Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.Glenn Gould site He died on 10 June 1982, aged 87, in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, survived by his wife Valerie n√©e Hennessy. Honours Bernard Heinze became a Fellow of the Royal College of Music in 1931. He was knighted in 1949, the first Australian musician to receive this honour. Sir Bernard was named the 1974 Australian of the Year. On Australia Day 1976, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his services to Australian music.It's an Honour: AC Sir Bernard Heinze Memorial Award The Sir Bernard Heinze Memorial Award was inaugurated following the death of Sir Bernard Heinze in 1982, and is given annually to a person who has made an outstanding contribution to music in Australia.

The series was adapted in 1985 into an anime film directed by Rintaro and animated by Madhouse. The screenplay was adapted by Mori Masaki, and character designs were created by Moribi Murano, who also illustrated the novel series. Takuo Noda directed the animation, and the music was composed by Ry≈´d≈ç Uzaki and Eitetsu Hayashi. The story begins during the Bakumatsu period of Japan in the last years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It continues through the pre-Meiji period and refers to historical events such as the Boshin War, including the involvement of foreign governments, the Naval Battle of Hakodate and the Meiji Restoration. There are also references to historical figures such as Captain Kidd, Saig≈ç Takamori, And≈ç Sh≈çzan, Oguri Kozukenosuke (Tadamasa), Geronimo, and Mark Twain. Plot Jiro, a young boy of Japanese and Ainu descent, is a foundling raised by a kindly innkeeper and her daughter in the village of Sai on the Shimokita Peninsula One evening, a shinobi kills Jiro's adoptive mother and sister while he is away. When he returns home, he finds their bodies and a strange dagger. The angry villagers accuse him of the murders, and rather than face a brutal crucifixion for the grave crime of parricide, Jiro escapes with the dagger. He encounters a buddhist monk called Tenkai who works for the Shogunate as an Oniwaban (Secret Police). Tenkai takes the boy to confront the man who supposedly killed his family and provokes him into delivering the killing blow. To cover his tracks, Tenkai has the village is set ablaze and the villagers slaughtered. Tenkai takes Jiro to his temple on the island of Ezo, and has his subordinates Shingo and Sanpei train him in the ways of the Ninja. Years later, Jiro leaves to find answers to the mystery of his family and his father, Tarouza. Meanwhile, Tenkai has him followed. Jiro comes across a group of Japanese men beating up an old Ainu man and he quickly dispatches them. The old man dies of his injuries, but his son Uraka takes Jiro to his home village of Shinopirika-Kotan, unaware the old man's assailants are agents of Tenkai. At Kotan, the village elder recognizes Jiro's dagger as the Dagger of Kamui which was originally owned a former village chieftain. It was given to a Japanese ninja who married the chieftain's daughter, Oyaruru. Years later, Oyaruru returned to Kotan alone, but eventually left the village to live upriver by herself. Jiro finds Oyaruru and learns she is his biological mother. She reveals that Tenkai dispatched Tarouza to the mountain Kamui Nupuri to find a rumored treasure large enough to keep the Shogunate in power. However Tarouza, broke all contact with Tenkai and married Oyaruru. When Tenkai caught up with them, he slashed the face of the infant Jiro and sent him floating downriver in their canoe. Tarouza fought Tenkai's men on the cliff above, but lost an eye to a primitive grenade and his sword arm to Hanzou, then appeared to fall to his death. Jiro comes to the horrifying realization that Tenkai had tricked him, and that the man he stabbed was his father. During their evening meal, Jiro and Oyaruru collapse from a paralysis potion and Oyaruru is killed with the Dagger of Kamui. Implicated in her murder, Jiro is imprisoned, but Uraka returns to help free him. Jiro finally realizes that Tenkai has been manipulating him for years into following his father's footsteps, searching for the treasure, and plans his revenge against Tenkai. Travelling north, Jiro is befriended by the elderly Andou Shouzan and a young Ainu girl. She helps find secret instructions to find a great treasure which are hidden with the hilt of the sword of Kamui. However, Jiro is tracked down by three of Tenkai's formidable assassins whom he defeats, but not before they kill Shouzan. The Ainu girl helps Jiro escape, but she kills herself when confronted by the following Tenkai. With the aid of the sailor Sam, Jiro books passage on Captain Drasnic's ship to the United States. On board, he is attacked by Oyuki, one of Tenkai's shinobi but he defeats her. He then saves her from drowning and they develop a strong bond. After arriving in America, Jiro, Sam and Oyuki become separated and Jiro travels on alone. Jiro befriends Chico, a French-born Indian woman and shelters with her tribe. He then encounters Mark Twain on the way the Los Angeles, heading for the island of Santa Caterina which is apparently the location of Captain Kidd's treasure. Jiro eventually finds a small treasure on the island, but Tenkai and his shinobi have followed him there with Oyuki. Tenkai suddenly reveals that Sanpei is a Satsuma and an associate of Tarouza who was also Oyuki's father, making her Jiro's half sister. Oyuki angrily she stabs Tenkai through the heart with the dagger, although he manages to fatally wound her before he dies. Jiro then finds the real treasure below in a hidden cavern. Later, Chico reappears and shows Jiro similar copy of the treasure's location. She reveals her real name is Julie Rochelle, the daughter of French spies also seeking the treasure, and that her father and Tenkai killed each other. Jiro now realizes that Tenkai has been using body doubles. He returns to Japan where he uses Captain Kid's treasure to help fund the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate by the combined Satsuma- Choushuu forces. In 1869, at the Citadel of Hakodate, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army close in on the last remaining Shogunate rebels. After a massive naval bombardment, Jiro wanders through the rubble and bodies, eventually encountering Tenkai. They engage in battle, during which Jiro kills Tenkai by impaling him through his cranium with the dagger. Jiro leaves Hakodate as the Imperial forces capture the city, but not before paying a silent farewell to Sanpei and his master, the samurai Saig≈ç Takamori.

He then began studying the ways of the ninja under the tutelage of Tenkai. As he grew to adulthood, Jiro gathered pieces to the mystery of the disappearance of his father, and he began to devise a trap to snare Tenkai.

(1967) Airplane Aerodynamics, 4th edition ‚Äì page 51, Pitman Publishing Corp., New York It is not practical or necessary for an aircraft to have an airspeed indicating system and an altitude indicating system that are exactly accurate. A small amount of error is tolerable. It is caused by the location of the static vent that supplies air pressure to the airspeed indicator and altimeter.  Static system  All aircraft are equipped with a small hole in the surface of the aircraft called the static port. The air pressure in the vicinity of the static port is conveyed by a conduit to the altimeter and the airspeed indicator. This static port and the conduit constitute the aircraft's static system. The objective of the static system is to sense the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. In an ideal static system the air pressure fed to the altimeter and airspeed indicator is equal to the pressure of the air at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying. As the air flows past an aircraft in flight, the streamlines are affected by the presence of the aircraft, and the speed of the air relative to the aircraft is different at different positions on the aircraft's outer surface. In consequence of Bernoulli's principle, the different speeds of the air result in different pressures at different positions on the aircraft's surface.‚ÄùIt is virtually impossible to find a position where the static pressure is always exactly the same as the pressure in the free airstream away from the aircraft‚Äù. Kermode, A.C., Mechanics of Flight, 10th edition ‚Äì page 65 The ideal position for a static port is a position where the local air pressure in flight is always equal to the pressure remote from the aircraft, however there is no position on an aircraft where this ideal situation exists for all angles of attack. When deciding on a position for a static port, aircraft designers attempt to find a position where the error between static pressure and free-stream pressure is a minimum across the operating range of angle of attack of the aircraft. The residual error at any given angle of attack is called the position error.‚ÄùThe amount by which the local static pressure at a given point in the flow field differs from free-stream static pressure is called the position error of the installation.‚Äù Measurement of Static Pressure on Aircraft NACA, TR-1364, p.646 Position error affects the indicated airspeed and the indicated altitude. Aircraft manufacturers use the aircraft flight manual to publish details of the error in indicated airspeed and indicated altitude across the operating range of speeds. In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between indicated airspeed and calibrated airspeed. In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between indicated airspeed and equivalent airspeed.  Pitot system  Bernoulli's principle states that total pressure (or stagnation pressure) is constant along a streamline.Providing the streamline does not enter a boundary layer, pass through a shock wave or undergo a major change in height so that gravitational potential energy changes are significant. These three factors are absent when considering the Pitot-static system in a subsonic aircraft. There is no variation in stagnation pressure, regardless of the position on the streamline where it is measured. There is no position error associated with stagnation pressure. The pitot tube supplies pressure to the airspeed indicator. Pitot pressure is equal to stagnation pressure providing the pitot tube is aligned with the local airflow, it is located outside the boundary layer, and outside the wash from the propeller. Pitot pressure can suffer alignment error but it is not vulnerable to position error.  Aircraft design standards  Aircraft design standards specify a maximum amount of Pitot- static system error. The error in indicated altitude must not be excessive because it is important for pilots to know their altitude with reasonable accuracy for the purpose of traffic separation. US Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 23,Airworthiness Standards: Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, and Commuter Category Airplanes ¬ß23.1325(e) includes the following requirement for the static pressure system: *The system error, in indicated pressure altitude, ..., may not exceed ¬± per speed for the [operating speed range for the aircraft]. The error in indicated airspeed must also not be excessive. Part 23, ¬ß23.1323(b) includes the following requirement for the airspeed indicating system: *The system error, including position error, ..., may not exceed three percent of the calibrated airspeed or , whichever is greater, throughout the [operating speed range for the aircraft].  Measuring position error  For the purpose of complying with an aircraft design standard that specifies a maximum permissible error in the airspeed indicating system it is necessary to measure the position error in a representative aircraft. There are many different methods for measuring position error. Some of the more common methods are: * use of a GNSS receiver while flying a triangular course * trailing conduit with static source, stabilized by a plastic cone * tower fly- by with photographs of the passing aircraft taken from the tower to accurately show the height of the aircraft above or below the tower * trailing bob with both Pitot and static sources  See also  * Airspeed * Altitude * Global Positioning System * Pitot-static system * Reduced vertical separation minima  References  = Bibliography = * Clancy, L.J.

H. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers published. Specifically, he ‚Ä≥acted as a reader for the firm of Duckworth. Garnett went through the manuscript, censoring some passages and cutting others until the novel was ten per cent shorter. He did not negotiate these changes with Lawrence, but sent the manuscript direct to the printers....

This was the first unexpurgated edition. Lawrence accepted the changes, saying ‚Ä≥It's got to sell, I've got to live.‚Ä≥Sons and Lovers, Cambridge University Press, 1992, p. 3. Early life and family Edward Garnett was born on 5 January 1868 in London. His father, Richard Garnett (1835-1906), was a writer and librarian at the British Museum. On 31 August 1889 he married Constance Black, known for her translations of Russian literature; the writer David Garnett (1892-1981) was their son. Career Garnett had only a few years' formal education at the City of London School, leaving at the age of 16, but he educated himself further by reading widely. He gained a high reputation at the time for a mixture of good sense and sensitivity in relation to contemporary literature. His influence through his encouragement of leading authors exceeded by far that of his own writing. His literary contacts and correspondents spread far and wide, from Petr Kropotkin to Edward Thomas. He worked as an editor and reader for the London publishing houses of T. Fisher Unwin, Gerald Duckworth and Company, and then Jonathan Cape. He brought together in 1898 Joseph Conrad, an Unwin author to whom he acted as a mentor as well as a friend, and Ford Madox Ford; they collaborated in the first few years of the twentieth century. Garnett befriended D. H. Lawrence, and for a time influenced him in the direction of realist fiction. He also had a role in getting T. E. Lawrence's work published. One of his failures was to turn down for Duckworth James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, in 1915. He was a strong supporter of John Galsworthy, and The Man of Property in the Forsyte Saga was dedicated to him. He also championed American writers Stephen Crane and Robert Frost and Australia's Henry Lawson, and helped the Irish writer Liam O'Flaherty. His play The Breaking Point was not allowed a licence for dramatic performance in London under the censorship system of the time (Lord Chamberlain's office). Its publication was permitted, and in 1907 Garnett published the play, which dealt with an unmarried mother, together with an open letter to the censor. The letter was in fact written by the critic William Archer. This was one battle in a campaign being waged at the time, under the leadership of Bernard Shaw, to free the stage.

BitTorrent.org. Retrieved 8 October 2018. It supports four different types of values: * byte strings, * integers, * lists, and * dictionaries (associative arrays). Bencoding is most commonly used in torrent files, and as such is part of the BitTorrent specification. These metadata files are simply bencoded dictionaries. While less efficient than a pure binary encoding, bencoding is simple and (because numbers are encoded as text in decimal notation) is unaffected by endianness, which is important for a cross-platform application like BitTorrent. It is also fairly flexible, as long as applications ignore unexpected dictionary keys, so that new ones can be added without creating incompatibilities. Encoding algorithm Bencode uses ASCII characters as delimiters and digits. * An integer is encoded as ie. Leading zeros are not allowed (although the number zero is still represented as \\"0\\"). Negative values are encoded by prefixing the number with a hyphen-minus. The number 42 would thus be encoded as , 0 as , and -42 as . Negative zero is not permitted. * A byte string (a sequence of bytes, not necessarily characters) is encoded as :. The length is encoded in base 10, like integers, but must be non-negative (zero is allowed); the contents are just the bytes that make up the string. The string \\"spam\\" would be encoded as . The specification does not deal with encoding of characters outside the ASCII set; to mitigate this, some BitTorrent applications explicitly communicate the encoding (most commonly UTF-8) in various non-standard ways. This is identical to how netstrings work, except that netstrings additionally append a comma suffix after the byte sequence. * A list of values is encoded as le . The contents consist of the bencoded elements of the list, in order, concatenated. A list consisting of the string \\"spam\\" and the number 42 would be encoded as: . Note the absence of separators between elements, and the first character is the letter 'l', not digit '1'. * A dictionary is encoded as de. The elements of the dictionary are encoded with each key immediately followed by its value. All keys must be byte strings and must appear in lexicographical order. A dictionary that associates the values 42 and \\"spam\\" with the keys \\"foo\\" and \\"bar\\", respectively (in other words, ), would be encoded as follows: . There are no restrictions on what kind of values may be stored in lists and dictionaries; they may (and usually do) contain other lists and dictionaries. This allows for arbitrarily complex data structures to be encoded. Features & drawbacks Bencode is a very specialized kind of binary coding with some unique properties: * For each possible (complex) value, there is only a single valid bencoding; i.e. there is a bijection between values and their encodings. This has the advantage that applications may compare bencoded values by comparing their encoded forms, eliminating the need to decode the values. * Many BE codegroups can be decoded manually. Since the bencoded values often contain binary data, decoding may become quite complex. Bencode is not considered a human-readable encoding format. * Bencoding serves similar purposes as data languages like JSON and YAML, allowing complex yet loosely structured data to be stored in a platform independent way. However, this uniqueness can cause some problems: * There are very few bencode editors * Because bencoded files contain binary data, and because of some of the intricacies involved in the way binary strings are typically stored, it is often not safe to edit bencode files in text editors.

The main goals of preclinical studies are to determine a starting, safe dose for first-in-human study and assess potential toxicity of the product, which typically include new medical devices, prescription drugs, and diagnostics. On average, only one in every 5,000 compounds that enters drug discovery to the stage of preclinical development becomes an approved drug. Types of preclinical research Each class of product may undergo different types of preclinical research. For instance, drugs may undergo pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) (PD), pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug) (PK), ADME, and toxicology testing. This data allows researchers to allometrically estimate a safe starting dose of the drug for clinical trials in humans. Medical devices that do not have drug attached will not undergo these additional tests and may go directly to good laboratory practices (GLP) testing for safety of the device and its components. Some medical devices will also undergo biocompatibility testing which helps to show whether a component of the device or all components are sustainable in a living model. Most preclinical studies must adhere to GLPs in ICH Guidelines to be acceptable for submission to regulatory agencies such as the Food & Drug Administration in the United States. Typically, both in vitro and in vivo tests will be performed. Studies of drug toxicity include which organs are targeted by that drug, as well as if there are any long-term carcinogenic effects or toxic effects causing illness. Animal testing The information collected from these studies is vital so that safe human testing can begin. Typically, in drug development studies animal testing involves two species. The most commonly used models are murine and canine, although primate and porcine are also used. =Choice of species= The choice of species is based on which will give the best correlation to human trials. Differences in the gut, enzyme activity, circulatory system, or other considerations make certain models more appropriate based on the dosage form, site of activity, or noxious metabolites. For example, canines may not be good models for solid oral dosage forms because the characteristic carnivore intestine is underdeveloped compared to the omnivore's, and gastric emptying rates are increased. Also, rodents can not act as models for antibiotic drugs because the resulting alteration to their intestinal flora causes significant adverse effects. Depending on a drug's functional groups, it may be metabolized in similar or different ways between species, which will affect both efficacy and toxicology. Medical device studies also use this basic premise. Most studies are performed in larger species such as dogs, pigs and sheep which allow for testing in a similar sized model as that of a human. In addition, some species are used for similarity in specific organs or organ system physiology (swine for dermatological and coronary stent studies; goats for mammary implant studies; dogs for gastric and cancer studies; etc.). Importantly, the regulatory guidelines of FDA, EMA, and other similar international and regional authorities usually require safety testing in at least two mammalian species, including one non-rodent species, prior to human trials authorization. =Ethical issues= Animal testing in the research-based pharmaceutical industry has been reduced in recent years both for ethical and cost reasons. However, most research will still involve animal based testing for the need of similarity in anatomy and physiology that is required for diverse product development. No observable effect levels Based on preclinical trials, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) on drugs are established, which are used to determine initial phase 1 clinical trial dosage levels on a mass API per mass patient basis. Generally a 1/100 uncertainty factor or \\"safety margin\\" is included to account for interspecies (1/10) and inter-individual (1/10) differences.

At the 2011 census, its population was 526,182, in 160,761 families. The city is nicknamed the \\"Industrial Capital of Iran\\". As a major industrial city, Arak hosts several industrial factories inside and within a few kilometers outside the city, including the factory of Machine Sazi Arak and the Iranian Aluminium Company. These factories produce nearly half of the needs of the country in steel, petrochemical, and locomotive industries. As an industrial city in a developing country, Arak suffers from air pollution. Etymology =Ar√¢k= The term Ar√¢k remains from a name given to the region since the medieval period. It derives from Arabic al- øIrƒÅq, meaning \\"root\\", itself derived possibly from Akkadian Uruk (, Erech). But new research has shown that the word Arak has the same roots with the words Iran and Arran, and the name Iraq is an Arabicized Persian word. During the Seljuk era, a region comprising the whole territory of Media (northwestern Iran) and the lower part of Mesopotamia was referred to as Iraq; with the Median part called  øEr√¢q-e  øAjam (\\"Iraq of the Ajam\\"), and the Mesopotamian part called  øEr√¢q-e  øArab (\\"Iraq of the Arab\\").C. Edmund Bosworth, =Solt√¢n √Çb√¢d= The term Solt√¢n √Çb√¢d is a Persian compound word. Solt√¢n, deriving from Arabic sul·π≠ƒÅn (\\"power\\", \\"authority\\"), is a Near Eastern noble title given to a powerful governor. Modern Persian √¢b√¢d, meaning \\"settlement\\" or \\"abode\\", derives from Middle Persian ƒÅpƒÅt (\\"populous\\"). However, according to linguist Sasha Lubotsky, the Persian term ƒÅbƒÅd might derive from Proto-Iranian *ƒÅpƒÅta (\\"protected\\"), rooting from Proto-Indo-European *peh‚ÇÇ- (\\"to protect\\"). History Originally named Soltan Abad, the modern-day city of Arak was founded in 1808 by Yusef Khan-e Gorji, a pro-Iranian warlord of Georgian origin who was given refuge by Qajar ruler Agha Mohammad Khan following a territorial dispute with his cousins, who were supported by Russian empress Catherine the Great. Between 1795 and 1797, Yusef Khan-e Gorji, renamed Yusef Khan-e Sepahdar by the Qajar ruler, settled his army in the fertile but poorly-controlled territory that would become the modern-day Arak. Hostile tribes in the region had operated autonomously from the Qajar rule. With the Shah's approval, Yusef Khan diverted the main river to drive out the hostiles and build the war fortress of Soltan Abad to act as a buffer. According to early modern historians, Yusef Khan built the city with the aid of effluents. Until 1892, the town remained a military base and fortress. The fortress of Soltan Abad had a thick wall surrounded by 7-meter-deep moats. Eight towers were constructed around the town and the governmental building was established in its northern part. In 1891, shops, gardens, and government buildings of Soltan Abad were repaired by the order of deputy governor Mirza Hasan (Etemad os-Saltane). Large parts of the city were formerly annexed as personal property to the pre-existing army commanders, and were then ultimately turned over to the state around 1918‚Äì1922. Beginning by the last quarter of the 19th century, the city achieved major developments in carpet industry, and eventually became Iran's most important center of carpet production for export markets, continuing up until at least 1940. National Garden Square in 1969. Under the reign of Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty, the city was renamed Arak. Modern factories for vegetable oil, soap, sugar beet, and wool industries were established within the city. Arak also became an important station for the Trans-Iranian Railway, a major railway project directed by Reza Shah which was completed in 1938. In 1972, two major state-owned enterprises were established in the city, including an aluminum smelter and a heavy engineering plant. The aluminum smelter was built under the Regional Cooperation for Development project of the Central Treaty Organization, in cooperation with the company of Reynolds and Reynolds. The engineering plant was processed with equipment and technical advice from the Soviets, in return of gas sales to the Soviet Union. The city officially became a metropolis on April 6, 2013, after the merger with Karahrud and Senjan.ÿ™ÿ®ÿØ€åŸÑ €å⁄© ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ÿØ€å⁄Øÿ± ÿ®Ÿá ⁄©ŸÑÿßŸÜ ÿ¥Ÿáÿ±-ÿ≥Ÿá ÿ¥ŸÜÿ®Ÿáÿå 25 ÿ™Ÿäÿ± -ÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ€åŸàÿ≤1392 15:57 Geography Arak is surrounded by mountains in the south, west, and east, and its average altitude is about 1750m above sea level.

Early life and football career Sono was born in Queenstown, Eastern Cape. When he was eight years old, his father Eric Bhamuza Sono, who was a midfielder for the Orlando Pirates football team in the early 1960s, died as a result of a car crash. Soon after, his mother abandoned him.Matsilela Ephraim ‚ÄúJomo‚Äù Sono ‚Äì SA History Consequently, Sono was left in the care of his ailing grandparents; as they were very poor, he had to resort to selling apples and peanuts at football games and train stations to clothe himself, buy food for his grandparents and pay school fees. Both his grandparents were born in the then Northern Transvaal at Valdezia village outside Makhado in Limpopo Province.Who¬¥s Who SA Sono's football career had an unusual beginning; during a match that he attended one of the Orlando Pirates‚Äô regular players was absent and Sono was requested to stand in for him. He soon gained fame for his all-round ability, dribbling and accurate passing skills. It was during this time that he was given the nickname of Jomo (which means \\"burning spear\\") by an Orlando Pirates fan, who saw in him the same leadership qualities as those of Jomo Kenyatta, the then president of Kenya. After he had accomplished everything that he set out to do at Orlando Pirates, Sono went to the United States of America, where, in 1977, he played for the New York Cosmos, where one of his team-mates was the legendary player Pel√©. In 1978, he moved to the Colorado Caribous. At the end of the season, the Caribous moved to become the Atlanta Chiefs where Sono played with a fellow South African footballer, Patrick \\"Ace\\" Ntsoelengoe. Sono completed his stint in North America playing for the Toronto Blizzard, playing three summers, 1980 through 1982. Sono also taught and gave demonstrations at Clemson University Soccer Camp for youths. Sono spent time with Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon and Italian club Juventus, but was unable to obtain work permits for permanent contracts. Club owner and coach After his football career in the USA ended, Sono returned to South Africa, where he purchased the Highlands Park club in Johannesburg in 1982, renaming it Jomo Cosmos in honour of his old team. Under his ownership, the club went on to achieve several successes: it won the National Soccer League in 1987, the Bobsave Super Bowl in 1990, the Cola Cola Cup in 2002 and the Super Eight in 2003. Sono has also taken a leading role in discovering and developing new football talent, especially from rural areas. Some of the players whom Sono recruited and then went on to play for the South African national team and European clubs include Philemon Masinga, Helman Mkhalele, Sizwe Motaung and Mark Fish. Indeed, his recruits formed the core of the South African squad that won the 1996 African Nations Cup; Sono was also a technical advisor to the team's head coach Clive Barker during the tournament. In 1998, Sono was appointed as caretaker coach of the Bafana Bafana just before the African Nations Cup tournament in Burkina Faso in the place of Clive Barker, who had been sacked just before the event. Under Sono, the team reached the final of the tournament, where they lost to Egypt. Taking the short time that he had to prepare with the team into account, it was considered a remarkable feat. After a disappointing performance by the South African national squad during the 2002 African Nations Cup in Mali, Sono was again appointed a technical director to the team. However, the head coach of the team at that time, Carlos Queir√≥z, felt that his position was being undermined by this appointment and resigned. Sono was again appointed as caretaker coach, this time for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. During the World Cup, the South African squad did not progress beyond the first round; however, they did score five goals and achieved one win, one draw and a 3‚Äì2 loss against pre-tournament favourites Spain. The South African captain, Lucas Radebe, credited Sono with much of the team's performance, saying that he had instilled a good spirit within the team and that he had ensured a very positive atmosphere among the squad.Trainer Jomo Sono ‚Äì der ‚Äúschwarze Prinz‚Äù Sono is the longest-serving coach in the South African Premier League and also sits on the board of the Premier Soccer League. He has also built up a reputation as a successful businessman; in addition to making a substantial profit by developing players and selling them to European teams, he also owns a number of businesses and is a chairman of numerous companies. On 22 October 2009 it was announced that he had returned to the South African Football Association, and one day later on 23 October 2009 he took the job as Technical Director.Safa duo jet out to sign Parreira Honours Sono was voted 49th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

Client-centered Therapy: Its Current Practice, Implications and Theory. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1951. Its founder, Carl Rogers, writes: > The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. It is that > the individual has within him or her self vast resources for self- > understanding, for altering her or his self-concept, attitudes, and self- > directed behaviour‚Äîand that these resources can be tapped if only a > definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be > provided.Rogers, Carl R. \\"Client-centered Approach to Therapy\\", in I. L. > Kutash and A. Wolf (eds.), Psychotherapist's Casebook: Theory and Technique > in Practice. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Rogers believed that unconditional positive regard is essential for healthy development and tried to establish it as a therapeutic component. Through providing unconditional positive regard, humanistic therapists seek to help their clients accept and take responsibility for themselves. Humanistic psychologists believe that by showing the client unconditional positive regard and acceptance, the therapist is providing the best possible conditions for personal growth to the client. By definition, it is essential in any helping relationship to have an anticipation for change. In the counseling relationship, that anticipation presents as Hope‚Äîan optimism that something good and positive will develop to bring about constructive change in the client's personality. Thus, unconditional positive regard means that the therapist has and shows overall acceptance of the client by setting aside their own personal opinions and biases. The main factor in unconditional positive regard is the ability to isolate behaviors from the person who displays them.Lisa Fritscher: Unconditional Positive Regard Rogers gives this description and personal experience: > For me it expresses the primary theme of my whole professional life, as that > theme has been clarified through experience, interaction with others, and > research. This theme has been utilized and found effective in many different > areas until the broad label 'a person-centred approach' seems the most > descriptive. The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. > It is that the individual has within him or her self vast resources for > self-understanding, for altering her or his self-concept, attitudes, and > self-directed behaviour--and that these resources can be tapped if only a > definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided. David G. Myers says the following in his textbook, Psychology: Eighth Edition in Modules: > People also nurture our growth by being accepting‚Äîby offering us what Rogers > called unconditional positive regard. This is an attitude of grace, an > attitude that values us even knowing our failings. It is a profound relief > to drop our pretences, confess our worst feelings, and discover that we are > still accepted. In a good marriage, a close family, or an intimate > friendship, we are free to be spontaneous without fearing the loss of > others' esteem. Unconditional positive regard can be facilitated by keeping in mind Rogers' belief that all people have the internal resources required for personal growth. Rogers' theory encouraged other psychologists to suspend judgement and to listen to a person with an attitude that the client has within himself/herself the ability to change, without actually changing who he/she is. History The concept of unconditional positive regard was developed by Carl Rogers in 1956. During this time, Rogers was working as a clinical psychologist with children at a mental health clinic in Rochester, New York. While working at the clinic, Rogers became influenced by Jessie Taft, a social worker who believed that the relationship between the therapist and the patient was the most influential part of treatment. This appealed to Rogers and led to his development of client-centred therapy. Client-centered therapy requires four characteristics of the therapist in order to promote the highest level of growth. These include empathy, unconditional positive regard, congruence, and attitude versus technique. Rogers defined unconditional positive regard by individually explaining the key elements of the term. He explained that unconditional means, \\"No conditions of acceptance...It is at the opposite pole from a selective evaluating attitude.\\" He wrote that positive means, \\"A warm acceptance of the person. A genuine caring for the client.\\" In reference to regard he wrote that, \\"One regards each aspect of the client's experience as being part of that client. It means a caring for the client, but not in a possessive way or in such a way as simply to satisfy the therapist's own needs. It means caring for the client as a separate person, with permission to have his [or her] own feelings, his [or her] own experiences.\\" In Roger's book, On Becoming A Person,Rogers, Carl. On Becoming a Person, pages 283-84. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 1961. Rogers gives credit to Stanley Standal for officially coining the term unconditional positive regard.Standal, Stanley. The need for positive regard: A contribution to client-centred theory. Unpublished PhD. thesis, University of Chicago. 1954. Research implications Since its emergence in 1956, unconditional positive regard has received little attention in psychological research. Lietaer, G.(1984) conducted research on the controversy surrounding unconditional positive regard. He stated that unconditional positive regard is one of the most questioned aspects of client-centred therapy. Purton, C. (1998) examined the relationship between spirituality and unconditional positive regard. Further research needs to be conducted on the effects of unconditional positive regard. The research could include, but is not limited to, the effects of unconditional positive regard on different psychological disorders, among different generations, different racial or ethnic groups, and different genders. Examples There are real examples of how a therapist can use unconditional positive regard. In the article by C.H. Patterson, there are two specific examples of a therapist and client dialogue. In the first dialogue between the therapist and the client, there is absolutely no evidence of unconditional positive regard used. This causes the client to become shut down and unresponsive toward the therapist. The therapist does not engage in a respectful therapeutic manner, which causes less trust for the client. > Therapist: ....another part here too, that is, if they haven't got a lot of > schooling, there may be a good argument, that, that they-are better judges, > you know. > Client: Yeah... > Therapist: Now, I'm not saying that that's necessarily true. I'm just > saying that's reality. > Client: Yeah. > Therapist: And you're in a position that you can't argue with them. Why is > it that these people burn you up so much? > Client: They get by with too many things... > Therapist: Why should that bother you? > Client: 'Cause I never got by with anything. > Therapist: They're papa figures, aren't they? However, in the second dialogue between the client and therapist, the therapist uses the unconditional positive regard theory. This seems to work much better for the client. The client is able to better understand the therapeutic methods and have a meaningful therapy session. The therapist works with respect as the main aspect, which only leads to positive outcomes. The more real-life examples from Patterson's article gives an idea of how successful unconditional positive regard can be if used appropriately and correctly. > Client: ...ever recovering to the extent where I could become self- > supporting and live alone I thought that I was doomed to hospitalization for > the rest of my life and seeing some of the people over in the main building, > some of those old people who are, who need a lot of attention and all that > sort of thing, is the only picture I could see of my own future, just one of > complete hopelessness, that there was any... > Therapist: Mhm Therapist: (Interrupting) You didn't see any hope at all, > did you? > Client: Not in the least. I thought no one really cared and I didn't care > myself, and I seriously-uh-thought of suicide; if there'd been any way that > I could end it all completely and not become a burden or extra care, I would > have committed suicide, I was that low. I didn't want to live. In fact, I > hoped that I-I would go to sleep at night and not wake up, because I, I > really felt there was nothing to live for. (Therapist: Uh-huh [very > softly]). Now I, I truly believe that this drug they are giving me helps me > a lot, I think, I think it is one drug that really does me good. (Therapist: > Uh hm). > Therapist: But you say that, that during that time you, you felt as though > no one cared, as to what (Client: That's right) what happened to you. > Client: And, not only that, but I hated myself so that I didn't deserve to > have anyone care for me. I hated myself so that I not only felt that no one > did, but I didn't see any reason why they should. Criticism Criticisms have been made regarding the overall effect of the therapy. Ruth Sanford discusses the value of unconditional positive regard in relationships, asking whether it is possible to show unconditional positive regard to the everyday person you may meet on the street or at a nearby market. According to Sanford, in deeper and more meaningful relationships it is possible to show unconditional positive regard to another individual. However, she questions whether a person can actually demonstrate unconditional positive regard in shallow, less meaningful relationships where the two people do not fully know each other. Sanford argues that unconditional positive regard is not an all-or-nothing concept, but instead falls along a continuum between short-term relationships and deeper long-term personal relationships.Sanford, R. (1984). Unconditional positive regard: A misunderstood way of being. Albert Ellis has criticized unconditional positive regard stating that such an attitude is, in fact, conditional.\\" Even Carl Rogers, who presumably emphasized unconditional positive regard, actually held that the individual can accept himself only when someone else, such as the therapist, accepts him or loves him unconditionally; so that his self-concept is still dependent on some important element outside himself.\\"Ellis, Albert (1973). Humanistic Psychotherapy: The Rational-Emotive Approach. New York.: McGraw-Hill Book Company. p. 65. While Ellis strongly supported unconditional positive regard of clients, he believed they could, and had better, accept themselves and adopt unconditional positive regard of themselves whether or not their therapist or anyone else does. To be maintainable as a large-scale sociological behavior, people would have to adopt a position of tolerance which does not reject the value of other persons based upon \\"repugnant but harmless\\" behaviors and beliefs in others. Effect on psychology Because it is one part of a larger therapeutic approach, the effect of unconditional positive regard on psychology must be viewed through the context of humanistic psychology, which in the 1960s spawned the widespread human potential movements. By making the positive therapist-client relationship a part of the cure, it also presented a step away from the Freudian tradition which saw the therapist-client relationship as means to an end. Unconditional positive regard as part of humanistic therapy is still highly regarded by certain therapists, who believe it to be the curative factor in this type of therapy.

Tuxedo is a transaction processing system or transaction-oriented middleware, or enterprise application server for a variety of systems and programming languages. Developed by AT&T; in the 1980s, it became a software product of Oracle Corporation in 2008 when they acquired BEA Systems. Tuxedo is now part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware. History From the beginning in 1983, AT&T; designed Tuxedo for high availability and to provide extremely scalable applications to support applications requiring thousands of transactions per second on commonly available distributed systems. The original development targeted the creation and administration of operations support systems for the US telephone company that required online transaction processing (OLTP) capabilities. The Tuxedo concepts derived from the Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS). Tuxedo supported moving the LMOS application off mainframe systems that used Information Management System (IMS) from IBM on to much cheaper distributed systems running (AT&T;'s own) Unix. The original Tuxedo team comprised members of the LMOS team, including Juan M. Andrade, Mark T. Carges, Terrence Dwyer, and Stephen Felts. In 1993 Novell acquired the Unix System Laboratories (USL) division of AT&T; which was responsible for the development of Tuxedo at the time. In September 1993 it was called the \\"best known\\" distributed transaction processing monitor, running on 25 different platforms. In February 1996, BEA Systems made an exclusive agreement with Novell to develop and distribute Tuxedo on non- NetWare platforms, with most Novell employees working with Tuxedo joining BEA. In 2008, Oracle Corporation acquired BEA Systems, and TUXEDO was marketed as part of the Oracle Fusion Middleware product line. Tuxedo has been used as transactional middleware by a number of multi-tier application development tools. The Open Group used some of the Tuxedo interfaces as the basis of their standards such as X/Open XA and XATMI. The Tuxedo developers published papers about it in the early 1990s. Later it became the basis of some research projects. Features * Standards based APIs - SCA, The Open Group XATMI, Object Management Group CORBA * Communication types - Synchronous, Asynchronous, Conversational, Unsolicited Notifications, Publish/subscribe * Typed buffers ** FML/FML32 - Self-describing fielded buffers similar to Abstract Syntax Notation One or Fast Infoset ** XML ** STRING and multibyte strings MBSTRING ** CARRAY binary blobs ** VIEW/VIEW32 externally described records ** RECORD representing COBOL record structures * Transaction Management - Global Transactions - Two-phase commit protocol - X/Open XA * /D - Clustering - Domains * /WS - Remote Clients * WTC - Weblogic Tuxedo Connector * Java clients - Jolt * Java EE (J2EE) Integration - Tuxedo JCA Adapter * Bidirectional SOAP and REST Web Services - SALT * /Q - Transient (in memory) and Persistent Queues (also called Reliable Queues) * Data Dependent Routing (DDR) * Event Broker (also called publish and subscribe messaging) * Security - Authentication, Authorization, Auditing, and Public key infrastructure based message signing and encryption * Programmed Administration and SNMP support * System and application performance monitoring - TSAM Plus * Load balancing, server spawning and decay * Mainframe connectivity - TMA * Supports C, C++, COBOL, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java applications on most Unix platforms, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and other proprietary platforms such as OpenVMS and AS400 (IBM System i). =Messaging core= Tuxedo is at its core a message routing and queuing system. Requests are sent to named services and Tuxedo uses memory-based inter-process communication facilities to queue the requests to servers. The requester is unaware of where the server that actually processes the request is located or how it is implemented. In essence, Tuxedo provided the elements of service- oriented architecture (SOA) decades before the phrase was coined. Tuxedo can use the content of the message to determine what servers should be utilized to receive the request by means of data-dependent routing. =Clustering= The heart of the Tuxedo system is the Bulletin Board (BB). This is a shared memory segment that contains the configuration and state of a Tuxedo domain. Servers, services, transactions, and clients are all registered in the BB providing a global view of their state across the machines within a domain. To coordinate updates to the BB a process called the Bulletin Board Liaison (BBL) runs on each machine to keep the local copy of the BB up-to-date. A master machine runs a process called the \\"Distinguished Bulletin Board Liaison\\" that coordinates the updates to the BB. This allows each machine to have a view of what servers, services, transactions, and clients are on each machine within the domain. Another process on each machine called the Bridge is responsible for passing requests from one machine to another. This allows Tuxedo to spread load across the various machines within a domain and allows servers and services to be running on multiple machines. In addition, the BBL and Bridge monitor each other and restart the other should one fail. In the advent of a failure of the master machine, another machine designated as a backup master can take over the function of master machine. Also, since machines within a single domain can be of different architectures (x86, IA32, SPARC, P-Series, etc.), the Bridge is also responsible for handling differences in things like endianness. On Oracle Exalogic Tuxedo leverages the RDMA capabilities of InfiniBand to bypass the bridge. This allows the client of a service on one machine to directly make a request of a server on another machine. =Flexible buffer formats= Tuxedo applications can utilize a variety of message formats depending upon the type of data that is to be passed. One of the most popular formats is the FML buffer format which is much like a binary XML or ASN.1 format. FML buffers can contain an arbitrary number of named fields of arbitrary type. Fields can be repeated and nested. As it is a self-describing binary format, the processing of fields incurs very little overhead in comparison to the parsing necessary to support something like XML. VIEW buffers are essentially records, C structures, or COBOL copybooks. A VIEW buffer has an external description which allows Tuxedo to access the fields within it if necessary for things like data dependent routing. Other buffer formats include XML, CARRAY (opaque binary data), STRING, and MBSTRING (a string buffer containing multibyte characters.) Tuxedo can automatically and transparently convert FML buffers to and from XML buffers. There is also support for user-developed buffer types (for example JamFlex buffers defined by Tuxedo version of Panther RAD toolset). =Communication concentrators= For remote clients (Java, CORBA, or /WS), Tuxedo provides communication concentrators called listener/handlers that handle the remote network communication. Clients connect to these communication concentrators, which act as proxies for the clients. As clients make requests, the listener/handler uses the local Tuxedo infrastructure to make the request on the behalf of the client. Tuxedo then load balances the requests across the servers within the domain that offer the service even if the server is not on the local machine. This is in contrast to most Java EE application servers where load balancing is done by the client making requests to different machines with the cluster. =Gateways= To facilitate the sharing of services across domains, Tuxedo provides domain gateways. A domain gateway allows importing and exporting services from remote domains. This allows the local domain to see services on remote domains as though they were local services. The domain gateways are responsible for propagating security and transaction context to the remote domain. Besides connecting Tuxedo domains together, domain gateways exist for mainframe systems using TCP/IP, IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), or the OSI protocols, and Java Platform, Enterprise Edition application servers. For the mainframe gateways, each system sees the services imported from the remote system as local services and use the local systems infrastructure to interact with those services. This means that Tuxedo sees a CICS transaction as a Tuxedo service, and CICS sees a Tuxedo service as a CICS transaction. =Failure recovery= The BBL on each machine monitors the state of all servers and can automatically restart failed servers. It can also detect hung servers and kill/restart them as required. The BRIDGE process in a clustered environment monitors to BBL, so there are no single points of failure. Any transactions that are affected by a server or machine failure and that have not completed the prepare phase are rolled back. Transactions that have completed the prepare phase but not the commit phase will be committed as part of the Tuxedo boot sequence. =Transaction monitoring and coordination= Tuxedo applications can request that all service invocations and their associated updates to any resources controlled by resource managers (such as databases) be controlled by a transaction. Once the application begins a transaction, all subsequent service invocations and nested invocations are included as part of that transaction, even those services that were executed on remote domains. Tuxedo then coordinates the commit processing with the resource managers to ensure atomic updates to all affected resources. Transactions can be controlled by the application or automatically controlled by the Tuxedo configuration, i.e., container managed transactions. =Queuing subsystem= Tuxedo provides a queuing subsystem called /Q. This facility provides transient and persistent queues that allows applications to explicitly enqueue and dequeue messages from named queues. Queues can be ordered by message availability time, expiration time, priority, LIFO, FIFO, or a combination. Queues are managed by an XA compliant resource manager allowing queue operations to participate in distributed transactions. An automated queue forwarding server is provided that will remove entries from a queue and invoke an associated Tuxedo services, placing the reply message on an associated reply queue. =Event subsystem= The event subsystem within Tuxedo provides support for unsolicited events as well as brokered events. Unsolicited events allow Tuxedo applications to send out-of-band notifications to clients that aren't necessarily waiting for a response. Brokered events allow application to subscribe to events of interest and when another application posts an event, all applications subscribed to that event receive it. This allows applications to use an event driven model instead of the more typical request/response model. As well this provides a publish and subscribe messaging model that can be combined with /Q. Add-on Products Oracle offers a number of add-on products to Tuxedo. =Mainframe re-hosting= In March 2010, Oracle announced two new products. Application Runtime for CICS and Batch along with the associated Oracle Tuxedo Application Rehosting Workbench allows the migration of IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS) and batch applications onto Tuxedo on distributed systems. By providing automated conversion tools, CICS equivalent API pre-processor macro expansion, and a JES-2 like Batch execution environment, the migration of mainframe applications is greatly simplified. =SALT= This product provides a bi- directional web services SOAP/HTTP(S) gateway. This gateway allows Tuxedo services to be accessed by external SOAP clients without making any changes to the Tuxedo service. Likewise, Tuxedo applications can call an external web service as though it were a local Tuxedo service. The latest version of SALT supports WS-AtomicTransactions and modules for Apache Web Server, Oracle HTTP Server, and Oracle iPlanet Web Server, that allows the creation of dynamic web content by calling Tuxedo services. In version 12.1.3 SALT added support for RESTful services. =TSAM Plus= This product provides centralized monitoring capabilities for multiple Tuxedo domains. TSAM Plus agents are deployed on the machines in a Tuxedo domain. These agents collect metric data from the running Tuxedo processes based on a configured policy, and send the data back to the TSAM Plus Manager where it is used historically or in real time. TSAM Plus provides configuration information, call path, call pattern, service execution, transaction, and more monitoring metrics. TSAM Plus also monitors Tuxedo ART CICS and Batch applications. An additional component of TSAM Plus is a plug-in for Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control that provides full operation, configuration, administration, and management of a Tuxedo application. =Tuxedo Mainframe Adapters (TMA)= This product provides a set of gateway processes that run on Tuxedo that communicate with a mainframe using its native protocols. This gateway provides bidirectional integration between mainframe and Tuxedo platforms and makes Tuxedo appear as a remote CICS or IMS region to the mainframe, and the remote CICS or IMS region as another Tuxedo domain to the local Tuxedo application. =JCA Adapter= The Tuxedo JCA adapter provide a JCA 1.5 compliant Resource Adapter that can be deployed to any Java EE (J2EE) 1.5 or later JCA container. The adapter supports both the JCA Common Client interface or CCI, as well as the JATMI interface supported by the Oracle WebLogic Tuxedo Connector component of Oracle WebLogic Server. Message inflow and outflow is supported along with distributed transaction support. =Tuxedo Message Queue= Provides enterprise messaging capabilities that combines the features of Oracle MessageQ with Tuxedo. This extends the existing /Q message queuing facility of Tuxedo by providing things like delivery notification, offline messaging, and store and forward capability.

Early life and family Brogden was born in Balmain and raised in Sydney. His father Gilbert Arthur Brogden, a carpenter, was born in Taranaki, New Zealand in 1933 and emigrated to Australia in 1960. His mother, Judith Anne (n√©e Bourne), was a secretary. He was educated at St Joan of Arc, Haberfield, St Patrick's College, Strathfield and the University of Sydney where he gained a Master of Public Affairs (MPA). His wife Lucy is an organisational psychologist, Patron of Partners in Depression, Patron of the Sydney Women's Fund, Commissioner of the National Mental Health Commission and Governor of Queenwood School for Girls. They have three children. Political career John Brogden joined the Liberal Party in his final year of high school in 1986. Between 1989 and 1994 he was an adviser to Attorney General John Hannaford, Premier John Fahey and Police Minister Ted Pickering. From 1992 to 1993 he was President of the NSW Division of the Young Liberals, and a member of the NSW Division's State Executive. In 1994, he served a year as Treasurer of the Young Liberal Movement of Australia and ran unsuccessfully for preselection in the state seat of Vaucluse.The Liberals, Episode I, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1994. He rejoined the State Executive in 1995 elected as a Metropolitan Representative. From 1994 to 1995 Brogden was a consultant at public affairs company Cosway Australia. From 1995 to 1996 he was a Senior Adviser at the Credit Union Services Corporation (CUSCAL). Brogden was elected to the NSW Legislative Assembly as the Member for Pittwater in May 1996 in a by election following the resignation of former Fahey Government Minister Jim Longley. In 1999 he was promoted to the Shadow Ministry as the Shadow Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Sydney Water and Youth Affairs. In the leadup to the 2003 election, Opposition Leader Kerry Chikarovski was struggling in the polls against Premier Bob Carr. On 25 March 2002, Brogden announced a challenge. Three days later on 28 March 2002, he succeeded in a 15‚Äì14 vote, becoming the youngest ever leader of a state or federal Liberal Party. What was not known at the time was that state Liberal director Scott Morrison had a plan to have Chikarovski replaced by Malcolm Turnbull, with the plan abandoned as a result of Brogden's successful challenge. Turnbull and Morrison went on to be elected to Federal Parliament and in 2015 Turnbull became Prime Minister and Morrison his Treasurer. Morrison succeeded Turnbull as Prime Minister in 2018. On becoming Opposition Leader, he resigned from his previous portfolios, but took on the new shadow ministries of Ethnic Affairs and Treasury. At the 2003 election the Liberal won one seat from Labor and lost one to Labor. Notwithstanding the electoral defeat, Brogden improved his and the party's standing in the polls over the next two years. For part of 2005 the Coalition was in front of Labor , with many people believing that Brogden would win the 2007 election, especially when Bob Carr resigned from politics and Morris Iemma was elected as the new Premier. Meanwhile, Brogden confronted the government over a number of issues, often focussing on health and police corruption. He aggressively pursued the Carr government over its involvement in the Orange Grove affair, in which a shopping centre was shut down, allegedly for zoning reasons, amidst claims of political pressure from The Westfield Group, which ran a neighbouring shopping centre. Despite the improvement in the opposition's opinion-poll ratings during 2004 and early 2005, Brogden's hopes that he would gain the premiership in 2007 were not to be fulfilled. He came under fire for offensive behaviour at a function in Sydney on 29 July 2005. At this function, he was quoted by the media as having described Helena Carr, the Premier's Malaysian-born wife, as a \\"mail-order bride\\". More specifically, Brogden said Carr could \\"ship his mail-order bride back to where she came from, for all I care\\". Brogden later publicly apologised for this remark. He was also accused of unwelcome sexual advances to two unnamed female journalists at the same function (ABC's Lateline reported that he \\"propositioned\\" one journalist, and pinched another's buttocks). Brogden alleged that Alex Hawke (a future Liberal member of the federal parliament) was responsible for leaking information to the media. As a result of the controversy, Brogden resigned as Leader of the NSW Opposition on 29 August. Nevertheless, he announced his intention to remain as the Member for Pittwater. The next day, 30 August, police attended Brogden's electorate office at around 10.30 pm, after concerns were raised by members of his family. They found him apparently unconscious in a back room, having slit his wrists, apparently in a drug- and alcohol-induced stupor. When the Sydney Morning Herald called Brogden's deputy Barry O'Farrell at about 11 pm to question him about possible leadership contention, he told them, \\"Excuse me if I say I don't care about the leadership at the moment, but I am following an ambulance with John Brogden inside. He has attempted self-harm. It sort of puts things in perspective, doesn't it?\\". Brogden was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital that night, and discharged the following day into respite care at a nearby psychiatric facility. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Brogden's actions were a suicide attempt. On 1 September, Brogden and his wife issued a short statement thanking people who had sent messages of support, and inviting people wishing to help further to donate to beyondblue, an organisation dedicated to supporting people with depression, anxiety and suicide related experiences. Brogden resigned from parliament on 28 September. A by-election was held for the seat of Pittwater, which was won by Pittwater Council mayor Alex McTaggart, running as an independent. At the 2007 state election McTaggert was defeated by Liberal candidate Rob Stokes, a former adviser to Brogden. Business career In May 2018, Brogden was appointed as Chief Executive Officer at Landcom. Prior to this appointment, he was Chairman of the Board at UrbanGrowth NSW/Landcom from 2012 to 2018. Prior to this he was the Managing Director & CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors from 2015 to 2017, the CEO of the Financial Services Council from 2009 to 2015 and the CEO of Manchester Unity from 2006 to 2008. Brogden is also Chairman of Lifeline Australia and Chairman of Furlough House Retirement Village. He also holds also holds honorary positions as the Patron of Kookaburra Kids, Sailability Pittwater, Bilgola Surf Lifesaving Club and Avalon Beach Surf Lifesaving Club. Brogden's previous non-executive directorships include Abacus Australian Mutuals (Chairman) from 2006 to 2009, BBI ‚Äì The Australian Institute of Theological Education (Chairman), NIA Pty Limited (health.com.au) from 2011 to 2015, Sydney Ports Corporation from 2010 to 2012, Australian Private Health Insurance Association and the Australian Friendly Societies Association.

Suzerainty differs from sovereignty in that the tributary state is technically independent, but enjoys only limited self-rule. Although the situation has existed in a number of historical empires, it is considered difficult to reconcile with 20th- or 21st-century concepts of international law, in which sovereignty either exists or does not. While a sovereign state can agree by treaty to become a protectorate of a stronger power, modern international law does not recognise any way of making this relationship compulsory on the weaker power. Suzerainty is a practical, de facto situation, rather than a legal, de jure one. Imperial China Historically, the Emperor of China saw himself as the centre of the entire civilised world, and diplomatic relations in East Asia were based on the theory that all rulers of the world derived their authority from the Chinese emperor. The degree to which this authority existed evolved from dynasty to dynasty. However, even during periods when political power was distributed evenly across several Chinese political entities, Chinese political theory recognised only one legitimate emperor, and asserted that his authority was paramount throughout the world. Diplomatic relations with the Chinese emperor were made on the theory of tributary states, although tributary relations in practice would often result in a form of trade, under the theory that the emperor in his kindness would reward the tributary state with gifts of equal or greater value. This system broke down in the 18th and 19th centuries in two ways. First, during the 17th century, China was ruled by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, which ruled over a multi-ethnic empire and justified their rule through different theories of rulership. While not contradicting traditional Chinese theories of the emperor as the universal ruler, the Qing dynasty made a distinction between areas of the world where they ruled and areas where they did not. Second, the system further broke down as China was confronted by Western powers whose theories of sovereignty were based on their own version of international law and relations between separate states. =Unequal treaties= China felt forced to accept a series of \\"unequal treaties\\" including the Treaty of Nanking (1842), the Treaty of Tientsin (1858), and the Convention of Peking (1860), whereby China was made to open new ports, including Canton, Amoy, and Shanghai. These treaties allowed the British to annex Hong Kong and resulted in the establishment of international settlements in ports that were controlled by foreigners. They also required China to permanently accept diplomats at the capital Peking, provided for free movement for foreign ships in Chinese rivers, imposed European regulation of Chinese tariffs, and opened the interior region to Christian missionaries. Numerous regions of China such as Taiwan, Outer Manchuria, Outer Northwest China and Macau were ceded to Japan, Russia and Portugal through a series of \\"unequal treaties\\" imposed on China after the Chinese were defeated in wars. Since the 1920s, the \\"unequal treaties\\" have been a centrepiece of Chinese grievances against the West. For centuries, China had claimed suzerain authority over numerous adjacent areas. The areas had internal autonomy but were theoretically under the protection of China in terms of foreign affairs. By the 19th century, the relationships were nominal, and China exerted little or no actual control. Foreign powers rejected the Chinese concept and eventually seized these areas from Chinese influence. Japan took Korea and the Ryukyu Islands, France took Vietnam, and Britain took Upper Burma. One way that the European states attempted to describe the relations between the Qing dynasty and its outlying regions was in terms of suzerainty, although this did not completely match the traditional Chinese diplomatic theory. Since the Great Game, the British Empire had regarded Tibet as under Chinese \\"suzerainty\\", but in 2008 the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called that word an \\"anachronism\\" in a statement, and joined the rest of the European Union and the United States in recognizing Tibet as a part of China. Ancient Israel and Near East Suzerainty treaties and similar covenants and agreements between Middle Eastern states were quite prevalent during the pre-monarchic and monarchy periods in Ancient Israel. The Hittites, Egyptians, and Assyrians had been suzerains to the Israelites and other tribal kingdoms of the Levant from 1200 to 600 BC. The structure of Jewish covenant law was similar to the Hittite form of suzerain. Each treaty would typically begin with an \\"Identification\\" of the Suzerain, followed by an historical prologue cataloguing the relationship between the two groups \\"with emphasis on the benevolent actions of the suzerain towards the vassal\\". Following the historical prologue came the stipulation. This included tributes, obligations and other forms of subordination that would be imposed on the Israelites. According to the Hittite form, after the stipulations were offered to the vassal, it was necessary to include a request to have copies of the treaty that would be read throughout the kingdom periodically. The treaty would have divine and earthly witnesses purporting the treaty's validity, trustworthiness, and efficacy. This also tied into the blessings that would come from following the treaty and the curses from breaching it. For disobedience, curses would be given to those who had not remained steadfast in carrying out the stipulations of the treaty. =Hittite suzerainty treaty form= Below is a form of a Hittite Suzerainty Treaty. * Preamble: Identifies the parties involved in the treaty, the author, the title of the sovereign party, and usually his genealogy. It usually emphasises the greatness of the king or dominant party. * Prologue: Lists the deeds already performed by the Suzerain on behalf of the vassal. This section would outline the previous relationship the two groups had up until that point with historical detail and facts that are very beneficial to scholars today, such as scholar George Mendenhall who focuses on this type of covenant as it pertained to the Israelite traditions. The suzerain would document previous events in which they did a favor that benefitted the vassal. The purpose of this would show that the more powerful group was merciful and giving, therefore, the vassal should obey the stipulations that are presented in the treaty. It discusses the relationship between them as a personal relationship instead of a solely political one. Most importantly in this section, the vassal is agreeing to future obedience for the benefits that he received in the past without deserving them. * Stipulations: Terms to be upheld by the vassal for the life of the treaty; defines how the vassal is obligated and gives more of the legalities associated with the covenant. * Provision for annual public reading: A copy of the treaty was to be read aloud annually in the vassal state for the purpose of renewal and to inform the public of the expectations involved and increase respect for the sovereign party, usually the king. * Divine witness to the treaty: These usually include the deities of both the Suzerain and the vassal, but put special emphasis on the deities of the vassal. * Blessings if the stipulations of the treaty were upheld and curses if the stipulations were not upheld. These blessings and curses were generally seen to come from the gods instead of punishment by the dominant party for example. * Sacrificial Meal: Both parties would share a meal to show their participation in the treaty. India =British paramountcy= The British East India Company conquered Bengal in 1757, and gradually extended its control over the whole of India. It annexed many of the erstwhile Indian Kingdoms (hereafter \\"states\\") but entered into alliances with the others. Some states were created by the East India Company itself through the grant of jagirs to influential allies. The states varied enormously in size and influence, with Hyderabad at the upper end with 16.5 million people and an annual revenue of 100 million rupees and states like Babri at the lower end with a population of 27 people and annual revenue of 80 rupees. These states were subject to the 'paramountcy' of the British Crown. The term was never precisely defined but it meant that the Indian states were subject to the suzerainty of the British Crown exercised through the Viceroy of India. The principle was asserted in a letter by Lord Reading to the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1926, \\"The sovereignty of the British Crown is supreme in India and therefore no ruler of an Indian State can justifiably claim to negotiate with the British Government on an equal footing.\\" This meant that the Indian states were Crown dependencies or protectorates of the British Indian government. They could not make war or have any direct dealings with foreign states. Neither did they enjoy full internal autonomy. The British government could and did interfere in their internal affairs if the imperial interests were involved or if it proved necessary in the interest of good governance. In some cases, the British government also deposed the Indian princes. Scholars hold that the system of Paramountcy was a system of limited sovereignty only in appearance. In a reality, it was a system of recruitment of a reliable base of support for the Imperial State. The support of the Imperial State obviated the need for the rulers to seek legitimacy through patronage and dialogue with their populations. Through their direct as well as indirect rule through the princes, the colonial State turned the population of India into 'subjects' rather than citizens. The Government of India Act 1935 envisaged that India would be a federation of autonomous provinces balanced by Indian princely states. However, this plan never came to fruition. The political conditions were oppressive in several princely states giving rise to political movements. Under pressure from Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian National Congress resolved not to interfere directly but called on the princes to increase civil liberties and reduce their own privileges. With the impending independence of India in 1947, the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten announced that the British paramountcy over the Indian states would come to an end. The states were advised to 'accede' to one of the new Dominions, India and Pakistan. An Instrument of Accession was devised for this purpose. The Congress leaders agreed to the plan with the condition that Mountbatten ensure that the majority of the states within the Indian territory accede to India. Under pressure from the Governor-General, all the Indian states acceded to India save two, Junagadh and Hyderabad. The two states acceded later, under coercion from India. Jammu and Kashmir, which shared a border with India as well as Pakistan, acceded to India when a Pakistan-backed invasion threatened its survival. =Sikkim= Following the independence of India in 1947, a treaty signed between the Chogyal of Sikkim Palden Thondup Namgyal, and the Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru gave India suzerainty over Kingdom of Sikkim in exchange for it retaining its independence. This continued until 1975, when the Sikkimese monarchy was abolished in favour of a merger into India. Sikkim is now one of the states of India. =Lakshadweep (Laccadives)= Located in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep is a Union territory of India off the coast of the southwestern state of Kerala. The Aminidivi group of islands (Amini, Kadmat, Kiltan, Chetlat and Bitra) came under the rule of Tipu Sultan in 1787. They passed on to British control after the Third Anglo-Mysore War and were attached to the South Canara district. The rest of the islands became a suzerainty of the Arakkal Kingdom of Cannanore in return for a payment of annual tribute. After a while, the British took over the administration of those islands for non-payment of arrears. These islands were attached to the Malabar district of the Madras Presidency. In 1956, the States Reorganisation Act separated these islands from the mainland administrative units, forming a new union territory by combining all the islands. Pakistan The princely states of the British India which acceded to Pakistan maintained their sovereignty with the Government of Pakistan acting as the suzerain until 1956 for Bahawalpur, Khairpur, and the Balochistan States, 1969 for Chitral and the Frontier States, and 1974 for Hunza and Nagar. All these territories have since been merged into Pakistan. South African Republic After the First Boer War (1880‚Äì81), the South African Republic was granted its independence, albeit under British suzerainty. During the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), the South African Republic was annexed as the Transvaal Colony, which existed until 1910, when it became the Province of Transvaal in the Union of South Africa. Second World War German Empire Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the German Empire received a very short-lived suzerainty over the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. New monarchies were created in Lithuania and the United Baltic Duchy (which comprised the modern countries of Latvia and Estonia). The German aristocrats Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (in Lithuania), and Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (in the United Baltic Duchy), were appointed as rulers. This plan was detailed by German Colonel General Erich Ludendorff, who wrote, \\"German prestige demands that we should hold a strong protecting hand, not only over German citizens, but over all Germans.\\" Historical suzerainties The Ottoman Empire: * Moldavia * Romania * Serbian Despotate * Principality of Transylvania * Principality of Upper Hungary * Republic of Ragusa * Walachia * Principality of Bulgaria The Qing dynasty: * MongoliaDickinson, Edwin De Witt, The Equality of States in International Law, p239 * Tibet * Korea * Japan (before the Meiji Restoration) * Ryukyu Kingdom * Vietnam * Myanmar * Thailand In Europe: *Habsburg control, as Holy Roman Emperor, over Liechtenstein (1719‚Äì1918), previously Schellenberg (1499‚Äì1719) and County of Vaduz (1322‚Äì1719) * Ireland, under the control of the High King of Ireland. * Neuch√¢tel (claimed by Prussia until 1857) * Wernigerode (Prussia) * Piombino (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) In Indonesia: * Kingdom of Larantuka The Republic of Mexico: * The American Southwest See also *Associated state *Client state *Hegemony *Imperialism *List of recipients of tribute from China *List of tributary states of China *Mandala (Southeast Asian history) *Overking *Puppet state *Satellite state *Satrap *Tributary system of China *Vassal state References =Inline citations= = Sources cited =  * * Category:States by power status Category:Types of country subdivisions Category:International law Category:Independence Category:Sovereignty ","title":"Suzerainty"},{"id":"1131385","text":"Volkach is a town in the district of Kitzingen in the Regierungsbezirk Unterfranken (Lower Franconia) in Bavaria, Germany.

In many respects, the VOC was possibly in fact the first historical model of the mega-corporation.Brook, Timothy: Vermeer's Hat: The Seventeenth Century and the Dawn of the Global World. (Bloomsbury Press, 2008, pp. 288, ) It was also in fact a proto- conglomerate company rather than a pure trading company or shipping company. Megacorporation, mega-corporation, or megacorp, a term popularized by William Gibson, derives from the combination of the prefix mega- with the word corporation. It has become widespread in cyberpunk literature. It refers to a corporation (normally fictional) that is a massive conglomerate (usually private), holding monopolistic or near-monopolistic control over multiple markets (thus exhibiting both a horizontal and a vertical monopoly). Megacorps are so powerful that they can ignore the law, possess their own heavily armed (often military-sized) private armies, be the operator of a privatized police force, hold \\"sovereign\\" territory, and even act as outright governments. They often exercise a large degree of control over their employees, taking the idea of \\"corporate culture\\" to an extreme. Such organizations as a staple of science fiction long predate cyberpunk, appearing in the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 1968), Thea von Harbou (Metropolis, 1927), Robert A. Heinlein (Citizen of the Galaxy, 1957), Robert Asprin (The Cold Cash War, 1977), and Andre Norton (the Solar Queen novels). The explicit use of the term in the Traveller science fiction roleplaying game from 1977 predates Gibson's use of it. Real-life examples Although the term itself arose out of science fiction, certain real-life corporations, such as colonial-era chartered companies and zaibatsu, have achieved or approached megacorporation status in various ways. The private Dutch East India Company, for example, operated 40 warships and had 10,000 private soldiers to monitor its farflung spice empire, while the British East India Company controlled a large colonial empire in the mid-19th century before the company was dissolved and its territories absorbed into the British Empire. The Hudson's Bay Company was once the world's largest landowner, exercising legal control and a trading monopoly on its territory known as Rupert's Land which consisted of 15% of the North American land mass. Today many countries have competition laws (also known as antitrust laws) to prevent real-life corporations from having mega-corporation characteristics. On the other hand, some countries protect a certain industry deemed important by mandating that only a single company, usually state-owned, can operate in it. An example of the latter is Saudi Arabia, which gains the majority of its government revenues through its mega-corporation Saudi Aramco.

Xiangsheng (), also known as crosstalk, is a traditional performing art in Chinese comedy, and one of the most popular elements in Chinese culture. It is typically performed as a dialogue between two performers, or rarely as a monologue by a solo performer (similar to most forms of stand-up comedy in Western culture), or even less frequently, as a group act by multiple performers. The Xiangsheng language, rich in puns and allusions, is delivered in a rapid, bantering style, typically in the Beijing dialect (or in Mandarin Chinese with a strong northern accent). The acts would sometimes include singing, Chinese rapping, and musical instruments. According to Canadian Xiangsheng comedian Dashan (Mark Rowswell), the closest English Xiangsheng-equivalent is \\"Who's on First?\\", a sketch by Abbott and Costello.  Format  Modern Xiangsheng comprises four classic skills: * Speaking (simplified Chinese: ËØ¥; traditional Chinese: Ë™™; pinyin: shu≈ç): to tell a story, which is the pragmatic mechanism of the humor (i.e. making jokes or using tongue-twisters). * Imitating (simplified Chinese: Â≠¶; traditional Chinese: Â≠∏; pinyin: xu√©): includes Kouji, accents, dialects, and other sounds, as well as imitating the \\"singing\\" and actions of specific characters in traditional Chinese operas such as Peking opera, Pingxi, and Bangzi. * Teasing (Chinese: ÈÄó; pinyin: d√≤u): to make a joke‚Äîtease is the soul of Xiangsheng. * Singing (Chinese: Âî±; pinyin: ch√†ng): only Taiping lyrics can be considered as singing in Xiangsheng. Xiangsheng is most commonly performed by two actors. The leading actor is called Dougen (simplified Chinese: ÈÄóÂìè; traditional Chinese: ÈÄóÂìè; pinyin: d√≤ug√©n) and the supporting actor is called Penggen (simplified Chinese: ÊçßÂìè; traditional Chinese: ÊçßÂìè; pinyin: pƒõngg√©n). History = Origins = Xiangsheng is generally thought to have originated in the late Qing Dynasty, particularly during the rules of the Xianfeng Emperor and the Tongzhi Emperor in the mid-1800s, although its roots may extend as far back as the Ming Dynasty. It began as a form of street performance, incorporating joke-telling, comedic banter, imitations, or borrowing from other performance arts, such as Peking opera, all with the express purpose of making audiences laugh. By the early days of the Republic of China, Xiangsheng had evolved into a more modern format. It was performed in teahouses, theaters, and, eventually, on radio and television. There are three major sources of Xiangsheng: Beijing Tianqiao, Tianjin Quanyechang, and the Nanjing Confucius Temple. The origins of certain modern-day Xiangsheng pieces can be traced back well over 100 years, though in many cases, the original author is unattributed. Many skits in \\"traditional Xiangsheng\\" have evolved through generations of performers successively revising material, retaining the general structure or \\"heart\\" of a piece while updating specific references with more modern material. One of the earliest Xiangsheng pioneers is a person known by name of Zhang Sanlu (), who performed during the mid-19th century. Originally a performer of Ba Jiao Gu (drum-song) (), Zhang eventually switched to doing imitations and telling humorous stories. Later artists considered Zhang to have been one of the first Xiangsheng performers. = Xiangsheng in Chinese Mainland = After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the popularity of Xiangsheng increased. Previously seen as relatively low-class street performing, Xiangsheng became regarded as a proletarian art form. Because it was performed in Mandarin Chinese, Xiangsheng became a useful tool for promoting the use of Mandarin Chinese throughout China. In the 1950s, Hou Baolin led a group of Xiangsheng performers to reform Xiangsheng, removing language and content that was considered \\"vulgar\\" and generally making it more \\"politically correct\\". Hou later became widely regarded as a master of Xiangsheng. He is often regarded as \\"China's Charlie Chaplin\\".Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. As with many forms of performance art, Xiangsheng was banned during the Cultural Revolution. It experienced a huge resurgence in the mid-1970s, with many skits satirizing the Gang of Four and excesses of this period. With the popularization of television in the 1980s, Xiangsheng became a standard feature of the annual New Year's Gala of China Central Television (CCTV), as well as other popular performing arts shows in China. Xiangsheng entered a period of decline in the 1990s, caused largely by increased official sensitivity towards political and social satire following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, as well as the lack of performance venues outside of sanitized state-run television programming. Many performers called for a return of performing Xiangsheng in teahouses and small theaters, which had traditionally been the main venues for Xiangsheng performances but were almost never used at the time. A new generation of Xiangsheng performers emerged from this movement, including Guo Degang. Guo has been credited with renewing interest among young millennial audiences, who found Xiangsheng to be boring and didactic. Guo's rise to fame, while representing a very traditionalist movement, pitted him against more mainstream, establishment performers, such as Jiang Kun.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. In recent years, to appeal to younger audiences, animators have created animated versions of various skits using audio from past broadcasts. The animated versions often use humor in a literal sense, illustrating scenes or stories described by the performers. There are some variety shows for young Xiangsheng actors to promote themselves like \\"Xiangsheng Has New Talents\\" (Chinese: Áõ∏Â£∞ÊúâÊñ∞‰∫∫) and \\"Happy Comedian\\" (Chinese: Ê¨¢‰πêÂñúÂâß‰∫∫), both hosted by Guo Degang. = Xiangsheng in Taiwan = In 1949, a group of Xiangsheng performers followed the Republic of China's retreat to Taiwan. The same year, Chen Yian (Chinese: Èô≥ÈÄ∏ÂÆâ), Wei Longhao (Chinese: È≠èÈæçË±™), and Wu Zhaonan met and hosted a Xiangsheng show on the Broadcasting Corporation of China and Taiwan Police Radio (Chinese: Ë≠¶ÂØüÂª£Êí≠ÈõªÂè∞). After 1967, he began collecting data to produce \\"Xiangsheng Collections\\", \\"Xiangsheng Highlight\\", \\"Xiangsheng Anecdote\\", and \\"Rediscovery of Xiangsheng\\". Initially, Xiangsheng's main audience was internal immigrants, mainly from military dependents' villages. In 1985, performance workshop Biao Fang (Chinese: Ë°®ÊºîÂ∑•‰ΩúÂùä) launched That Night, We Speak Xiangsheng (Chinese: ÈÇ£‰∏ÄÂ§úÔºåÊàëÂÄëË™™Áõ∏ËÅ≤), a play performed by Li Liqun (Chinese: ÊùéÁ´ãÁæ§) and Li Guoxiu (Chinese: ÊùéÂúã‰øÆ), which caused a stir. In 1989, Biao Fang launched the stage play Tonight, Who Speaks Xiangsheng? (Chinese: ÈÄô‰∏ÄÂ§úÔºåË™∞‰æÜË™™Áõ∏ËÅ≤), which was performed by Li Liqun (Chinese: ÊùéÁ´ãÁæ§), Jin Shijie (Chinese: ÈáëÂ£´ÂÇë), and Chen Lihua (Chinese: Èô≥Á´ãËèØ). Numerous other plays were produced, including: * Taiwan Bizarre Talk (1991; performed by Li Liqun), * That Night, We Speak Xiangsheng (Chinese: ÈÇ£‰∏ÄÂ§úÔºåÊàëÂÄëË™™Áõ∏ËÅ≤; 1993; performed by Li Liqun and Feng Yugang (Chinese: È¶ÆÁøäÁ∂±)), * Another Night, They Speak Xiangsheng (1997; performed by Feng Yugang, Zhao Ziqiang (Chinese: ËµµËá™Âº∫), and Bu Xueliang (Chinese: ÂçúÂ≠∏‰∫Æ), and * Millennium Night, We Speak Xiangsheng (2000; performed by Zhao Ziqiang, Jin Shijie, and Ni Minjan). In 2005, This Night, Women Speak Xiangsheng‚Äîperformed by Fang Fang (Chinese: ÊñπËä≥), Deng Chenghui (Chinese: ÈÑßÁ®ãÊÖß), and Xiao Ai (Chinese: Ëï≠Ëâæ)‚Äîwas launched. Although all these plays were claimed to be Xiangsheng, they were actually theater performances. In April 1988, Feng Yugang and Song Shaoqing (Chinese: ÂÆãÂ∞ëÂçø) formed Comedians Workshop, which aimed to merge theater with Xiangsheng. Huang Shiwei (Chinese: ÈªÑÂ£´‰ºü) joined in 2001. On July 8, 2004, Comedians Workshop assisted Dream Theater to perform Give Me a Tape. In 1993, Liu Zengqi (Chinese: ÂäâÂ¢ûÈçá) and Lin Wenbin (Chinese: ÊûóÊñáÂΩ¨) founded the Taipei Musical Art Troupe. In addition to Xiangsheng, they also introduced many Chinese traditional Quyi (a traditional form of Chinese art), such as Shuanghuang (Chinese: ÂèåÁ∞ß), Pingshu (Chinese: ËØÑ‰π¶), Shulaibao (Chinese: Êï∞Êù•ÂÆù), Kuaiban (Chinese: Âø´Êùø‰π¶), Jingyun drum (Chinese: ‰∫¨ÈüµÂ§ßÈºì), Meihua drum (Chinese: Ê¢ÖËä±Â§ßÈºì), Xihe drum (Chinese: Ë•øÊ≤≥Â§ßÈºì), Danxian (Chinese: ÂçïÂº¶), and Taiping lyrics (Chinese: Â§™Âπ≥Ê≠åË©û), which have also promoted the exchange of performances between Taiwan and Mainland China. On August 26, 1999, Wu Zhaonan announced the establishment of Wu Zhaonan's Xiangsheng Club. Only direct disciples of Wu Zhaonan could become official members. In addition to Xiangsheng, it also introduced Quyi, including Shuanghuang (Chinese: ÂèåÁ∞ß), Pingshu (Chinese: ËØÑ‰π¶), Shulaibao (Chinese: Êï∞Êù•ÂÆù), Kuaiban (Chinese: Âø´Êùø‰π¶), Danxian (Chinese: ÂçïÂº¶), Taiping lyrics (Chinese: Â§™Âπ≥Ê≠åË©û), and Peking opera. = Xiangsheng in Hong Kong = Northern Xiangsheng has been popular in Hong Kong since the Zhongyuan period. As early as the Qing Dynasty, storytellers from China brought Xiangsheng to South Guangdong and Hong Kong. After Hong Kong was ceded as a British colony,Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. the development of Xiangsheng entered a unique period of localization. In the early years of the Republic of China, Hong Kong's Xiangsheng mainly performed in the street, and most Xiangsheng artists were jugglers, such as Pingshu and Kouji. Xiangsheng performers came from all walks of life. They were knowledgeable and enjoyed chatting, thus using Xiangsheng to make a living. In the 1940s and 50s, Hong Kong cinema began to develop rapidly, and Xiangsheng began to integrate into emerging media. In old Hong Kong movies, Xiangsheng-inspired comedy began to integrate into early Hong Kong cinema, mostly in the form of monologues and characters teasing each other. In 1957, the first Chinese- language TV media in the world was created; it was called Rediffusion Television Limited and was the predecessor of Asia Television. Xiangsheng became a fixed performance for variety shows. In 1967, Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) was created, and the variety show Enjoy Yourself Tonight was launched. Xiangsheng began to appear in several variants in the variety show, such as the host's speech and the show to show lines. = Xiangsheng in Malaysia (Overseas Chinese) = After the Chinese Civil War, a number of performers from South China traveled to Malaysia for development (before Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia). Feng Xiang (Chinese: ÂÜØÁøî), Bai Yan, and Lu Ding performed Xiangsheng in this region. In the multi-language environment of Malaysia, \\"Malaysian Xiangsheng\\" became different from Xiangsheng in mainland China and Taiwan. Since Mandarin Chinese is not a mainstream language in Malaysia, there are few professional performers in Malaysia. = As social commentary = The small scale and popularity of Xiangsheng make it second only to word of mouth in reflecting popular concerns. Hou Baolin and others have said that Xiangsheng items are \\"works of comic nature which use satire and humour as their principal base. The cross talks use witty speech, bitter, ridiculous ridicule, in order to achieve the purpose of arrogant \\"big laugh\\" and entertaining people. Its earliest form was derived from the juggling of \\"Yuyou\\". In these jokes, artists often pinned their mockery and whipping against the rulers. Their satirical content strikes home at contemporary malpractices and also often includes political satire.\\" The role of Xiangsheng in the social commentary was seen after the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976, when Xiangsheng performances provided the first open criticisms of the gang. After 1976, Xiangsheng has also satirized corrupt officials and members of the Communist Party of China, although criticism of the party as an entity remains off-limits.  Xiangsheng classifications  = By number of actors = * Dankou Xiangsheng: a monologue by a solo performer * Duikou Xiangsheng: a dialogue between two performers * Qunkou Xiangsheng: a group act with at least three performers = By content = * Ironic Xiangsheng: performers criticize themselves, others, or concepts, such as Hou Baolin's Walking in the dark (Chinese:Â§úË°åËÆ∞) (criticizes people who do not follow the traffic rules), Jiang Kun and Li Wenhua's Photograph (criticizes the social phenomenon during the Cultural Revolution). * Complimentary Xiangsheng: performers praise themselves, others, or concepts, such as Ma Ji's The New Peach Garden (praises socialism), Hou Yuewen's Story of Beijing‚ÄìKowloon railway (praises the constructor of Beijing‚ÄìKowloon railway) * Entertaining Xiangsheng: performers aim to entertain, such as Speaking in tongues = By chronology = * Tradition Xiangsheng: in the Late Qing Dynasty * New Xiangsheng: after 1949 * Contemporary Xiangsheng: after 1980 = By genre = * Ma Sect Xiangsheng: the representative personage Ma Sanli, Ma Zhiming (Chinese: È©¨ÂøóÊòé) * Chang Sect Xiangsheng: the representative personage Chang Lianan, Chang Baokun (Chinese: Â∏∏ÂÆùÂ†É) * Hou Sect Xiangsheng: the representative personage Hou Baolin * Liu Sect Xiangsheng: the representative personage Liu Baorui (Chinese: ÂàòÂÆùÁëû) Notable performers *Zhang Sanlu () is considered to have been one of the fathers of Xiangsheng. Zhang was born in Beijing in the late Qing Dynasty. His disciples include Zhu Shaowen, A Yantao, and Shen Chunhe. *A Yantao () better known by his stage name A Er (Èòø‰∫å) or A Cier (ÈòøÂà∫‰∫å), was a Xiangsheng performer of Manchu descent. His disciples include En Xu, Gao Wenkui, Chun Changlong, and Shen Zhushan. A Yaotao was born in Beijing to a rich family of the Sumuru clan belonging to the Eight Banners. During his childhood years, he developed an interest in traditional Chinese opera and experimented with several different vocal techniques. Later, his family came down in the world. In order to support his family, he studied under Zhang Sanlu and became a second-generation Xiangsheng performer. *Shen Chunhe, better known by his stage name Shen Er (Ê≤à‰∫å), told stories before performing Xiangsheng. He studied under Zhang Sanlu and became a second-generation Xiangsheng performer. His disciples include Wei Kunzhi, Wang Youdao, Li Changchun, Gao Wenyuan, Feng Kunzhi, and Yu Erfu. *Zhu Shaowen (1829‚Äì1903), known by his stage name Qiongbupa (Á©∑‰∏çÊÄï), was one of the fathers of Xiangsheng. He was born in Beijing, and his ancestral home was Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Zhu was honored as one of the \\"Eight Oddities of Tianqiao\\" (Â§©Ê°•ÂÖ´ÊÄ™).

Lancelott (1840) Cavatina (Italian diminutive of cavata, the producing of tone from an instrument, plural cavatine) is a musical term, originally meaning a short song of simple character, without a second strain or any repetition of the air. It is now frequently applied to any simple, melodious air, as distinguished from brilliant arias or recitatives, many of which are part of a larger movement or scena in oratorio or opera. One famous cavatina is the 5th movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in B-flat major, Opus 130.Grove, George (ed.) (1900). \\"Cavatina\\". A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. 1, p. 328.

It is located on the north side of the Black Isle. The village is south-east of Dingwall and about north of Inverness. Village View towards Dingwall from Culbokie There is one school, a shop/post office, a public house (the Culbokie Inn) and Findon Hall Community Centre. Culbokie has a range of community and youth groups, including Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Badminton, Playgroup, Football and a Senior Citizens club. It is known for its spectacular scenery and its old world ambiance including an authentic water pump from the early 19th century. Since the mid-2000s, the village has expanded significantly and this has resulted in a mismatch of developments. It is unusual in that there is agricultural land separating the east from the west end of the village, in effect making it two entities. The Culbokie Inn The village is a commuter location for people who work in Inverness. The new Culbokie Primary School opened at Easter 2007.  Community Trust  In 2014, The Culbokie Community Trust was formed following a consultation with the villagers. The village has seen a rapid growth in population due to new housing developments. Despite this, there was no extra facilities built. A major issue that was raised was the fact that there is no health centre nearby for the village and surrounding area. In 2015, The Trust purchased of land adjacent to the current village shop and post office. The first phase of development is planned to include the building of a new community hub. The new hub intends to house a cafe, meeting rooms and a healthcare room. Part of the land is earmarked for affordable housing and as of late-2018 plans have been submitted to the Highland Council for consideration. Other projects begun by the Trust include; a monthly community market, which sells everything from fresh food to art, and projects in the nearby Culbokie Woods.

Founded in Hope, Arkansas, in 1946 as 'Klipsch and Associates' by Paul W. Klipsch, the company produces loudspeaker drivers and enclosures, as well as complete loudspeakers for high end, high fidelity sound systems, public address applications, and personal computers. On January 6, 2011, Audiovox announced that the company had signed a \\"term sheet to purchase all the shares of Klipsch Group Inc\\". The sale was completed March 1, 2011. Horn loading Since its inception, Klipsch has promoted the use of horn-loaded speakers as part of its goal to produce speakers which: *Are high in efficiency (more formally called \\"sensitivity\\"), meaning that they can be driven by relatively low-powered amplifiers *Are low in modulation distortion, which Paul Klipsch believed was very important *Have wide dynamic range, meaning that they accurately reproduce both soft and loud sounds *Exhibit controlled directivity, meaning that the radiation pattern is directional, rather than diffuse *Have a flat frequency response, meaning that there is no unnatural emphasis in the bass, mid-range or treble. The company advocates the superiority of horns for the aforementioned properties, but historically horns have a reputation for a coloring of the sound sometimes described as \\"honkiness\\". The exact causes of this coloration are still being researched, but one cause is vibration of the horn material itself. Early Klipsch designs utilized metal-throated horns whose material could be energized by the sound within, creating a \\"ring\\" or \\"buzz.\\" Klipsch subsequently introduced horns of braced fiberglass which were said to alleviate resonances that colored the earlier, metal designs. Other causes of \\"honkiness\\" are acoustic resonances and reflections when the horn shape causes poor transitions in the acoustic wave expanding from the horn driver. In addition to the direct acoustic effects, these resonances and reflections transform into peaks and dips in the electrical impedance, making problems for the passive crossover network. In 1989, Klipsch introduced a midrange horn with a tractrix flare which was said to reduce \\"honkiness\\" and create a more open sound quality, compared to earlier designs. Klipsch also moved away from silk diaphragms to different driver-diaphragm materials like phenolic, aluminum and titanium, to inject a purer sound into the horn in the first place. Midrange horns made entirely of formed wood were used into the 1950s. Historically, Klipsch speakers were designed based on principles originating at Bell Labs in the 1930s. Objectives included wide soundstage and frequency range from about 30 Hz to 15 kHz, and the speakers were designed to be placed in a room with no single dimension a multiple of another. For competitors who disregarded this old research, Klipsch made a special \\"Bullshit\\" button, inspired by Paul Klipsch's extensive usage of the word. Products =The Klipschorn= Klipschorn speaker system The Klipschorn, or K-Horn, loudspeaker is the flagship product of Klipsch Audio Technologies. It was patented by founder Paul W. Klipsch in 1946 and has been in continuous production in the company's Hope, Arkansas, plant since then‚Äîthe longest run in speaker production history. Although the Klipschorn's basic design is more than sixty years old, it has received periodic minor modifications. A \\"knockoff\\" (Model K) was offered for years in kit form through Seattle kit manufacturer SpeakerLab. The Klipschorn's large (51‚Äù H (129 cm) x 31‚Äù W (79 cm) x 28‚Äù D (72 cm)) enclosure houses a three-way design: separate drivers‚Äîthe woofer, the squawker, and the tweeter, respectively‚Äîhandle the bass, midrange, and treble portions of the sound signal. Two rectangular horn lenses coupled to compression drivers handle the midrange and treble, while a 15‚Äù cone woofer is mounted in a folded bass bin compartment below. The folds open at the rear of the horn cabinet structure, utilizing the room walls and floor as continuations of horn structure, thereby increasing the effective length and size of the horn, thus lowering its cut- off frequency and, likewise, its lowest usable tone. The body of the speaker cabinet forms a horn. The ‚ÄúK-Horn‚Äù shape is like a baseball diamond: the pointy rear is open and exposed, the flat front covered with a wood panel and the top enclosed in cloth. The speaker sits in the corner of two adjoining walls, using the walls and floor boundaries as extensions of the horn. Technically speaking, the K-Horn's folded bass \\"corner horn\\" can be described as a bifurcated trihedral (floor and two walls to form the trihedral corner) exponential wave transmission line. This design results in extremely high efficiency. One watt RMS produces a 105 decibel per meter sound pressure level (SPL), which is approximately 14‚Äì20 decibels higher than conventional speakers. Such sensitivity requires less amplifier power to achieve the same loudness. (Paul Klipsch demonstrated that the Klipschorn could reproduce concert-level dynamics powered by as little as 1 watt per channel.) The K-Horn encourages the use of low powered amplifiers. The growing popularity in the audiophile community of single-ended valve (vacuum tube) amplifiers has sparked renewed interest in the Klipschorn and other highly sensitive Klipsch models. Utilizing the room walls and floor boundaries as extensions of the bass horn helps extend the speaker's frequency response down into the 35 Hz range, considerably lower than would be possible otherwise. Because of the folded horn, the woofer cone moves no more than a few millimeters. As the only speaker in the world to be in continuous production for 60 years, the Klipschorn has remained relatively unchanged since its inception. Circa 1970, diode overload protection was added across voice coils to prevent burnout from clipping produced by an overdriven amplifier. The midrange horn was originally made entirely from formed wood. Some fibreglass bells were used on the midrange horn, as well as metal, in the late 1950s. Eventually the midrange horn was changed from metal to braced fiberglass, and the tweeter was front mounted in the 1980s. Both of these changes reduced the already low distortion. In 2005, the company made some minor cosmetic and functional revisions to this legendary speaker, including the elimination of the inset collar, or spacer, between the upper and lower cabinets for a cleaner appearance. A horizontal wall seal was added to improve the low frequency horn's connection to the wall. The crossover, which includes some equalization, was revoiced in the early 2000s. In 2006, Klipsch offered the 60th Anniversary Klipschorn, a separate model from the standard Klipschorn. In 2016, Klipsch released the 70th Anniversary Klipschorn with a fully enclosed horn. The release was limited to 70 pairs. =Other legacy speakers= Other noteworthy Klipsch speakers include: *La Scala *Belle Klipsch *Cornwall *Chorus *ProMedia *Heresy *Forte * Quartet *Legend *Reference Two of these models, the La Scala and the Belle Klipsch, are fully horn-loaded and have extremely high sensitivity similar to the Klipschorn, but their \\"W\\"-shaped folded bass horns do not require corner placement in the listening room. The La Scala II, which uses the same drivers as the Klipschorn but has a smaller bass chamber and less bass extension, was voted into Stereophile magazine's \\"Recommended Components\\" in the \\"A\\" class for speakers with restricted extreme low frequency. Other models, including the Cornwall and Heresy, use horn tweeters and midranges in conjunction with direct-radiating woofers and also have unusually high sensitivity (although not as high as the fully horn-loaded models). All of the models cited above feature separate horn-loaded tweeter and midrange. As of 2006, the majority of current Klipsch models are two-way designs, utilizing a tractrix horn for the upper midrange and treble. Wood finishes available were Macassar ebony, zebrawood, rosewood, teak, cherry, oak oil, oak lacquer, walnut oil, walnut lacquer, raw birch, birch lacquer, and black lacquer. Many dealerships displayed wood samples to let customers view and custom-order the veneers. The Klipsch factory would then specifically match the woodgrain on the tops and sides so pairs of speakers would be identical to each other. In a letter sent to its dealers around 1990, Klipsch cited concern over the responsible use of exotic woods from the rainforests and as a result retired the ebony, zebrawood, rosewood and teak veneers. =Current speakers= The Palladium line, introduced in 2007, is a high-end luxury line of premium speakers. These are sold through special qualified dealers only. The three Icon Series lines (X, W, and V) are diverse products designed to satisfy a variety of tastes and budgets. X=Modern Technology, Contemporary Beauty; W=Modern Technology, Classic Beauty; V=Modern Technology, Value Driven Performance. The trademark of all three is the use of the new 90-degree by 90-degree XT Tractrix horn. The Synergy line is sold by major mass-market retailers. The Reference line tends to be carried by audio specialty stores and custom installers. One feature of the Reference line is the use of the trademark Cerametallic woofers. These are a combination of materials that produce a very stiff, highly controlled cone movement. The newer (2015) Reference Premier series continues improvements with their Hybrid Tractrix Horn, Linear Travel Suspension (LTS) Titanium Tweeter, Spun Copper Cerametallic Woofers, and an all new Tractrix Port for the cleanest, most powerful low frequency response on the market. THX Ultra II series is a line of dedicated theater speakers and subwoofer. The Klipschorn, La Scala II, Cornwall III, and Heresy III comprise the Heritage line, which is available through select authorized Klipsch dealers and Klipsch direct, often by special order. Multi-media speakers The company also manufactures products for multimedia purposes; its ProMedia line of computer speakers has been sold since 1999, and it produces iPod-marketed speakers like the iGroove (with an angled form-factor). Klipsch used in theaters Klipsch also features its speaker designs in the Hard Rock Cafe line of restaurants and in several AMC and Regal theaters. Krikorian Theatres have digital sound featuring the Klipsch KMX sound system. Theaters such as Hollywood's BM Theater house are using Klipsch theater systems for the 18000 audience capacity movie house. On a smaller scale, cinemas like Golden Village (Singapore) used Klipsch custom speakers for their GV Grand and IMAX theaters. =Headphones= \\"In Ear\\" headphones or earphones using balanced armature technology were launched in November 2007. These headphones use patented Contour Ear Gels, invented by Mark Blanchard of Klipsch Group, which are anatomically designed to accurately fit inside the human ear canal. These oval shaped silicone tips reduce ear fatigue by minimizing pressure to any one area of the ear canal wall. The patented ear tips are designed to be inserted in the ear canal to acquire an air seal for noise isolation and a proper frequency response. In addition to several in-ear Image models, Klipsch launched its first on-ear model, the Image ONE, in 2010. Group subsidiaries and acquisitions Klipsch Group, Inc., the parent company of Klipsch Audio Technologies, also owns the Danish loudspeaker firm Jamo, and in 2006 acquired the brands of Mirage, Athena and Energy speakers from Audio Products International (API) of Canada. In 2001 it acquired the company Mondial Designs, manufacturers of electronics under the Aragon and Acurus brand names, but subsequently discontinued those product lines. In 2009, electronic engineers Ted Moore and Rick Santiago left Klipsch and founded Indy Audio Labs. They purchased the Aragon and Acurus component designs and brands from Klipsch. Both Aragon and Acurus components today are designed and manufactured in Indiana. =Jamo= Jamo is a Danish manufacturer of loudspeakers. The company was founded in 1968 by Preben Jacobsen and his brother-in-law, Julius Mortensen. The company name is derived from the founders' surnames. At one point, Jamo employed more than 400 workers at its factory in Glyng√∏re and grossed hundreds of millions of dollars; in 1994, it was Europe's largest speaker manufacturer.

The OEI's membership is composed of all of the sovereign states of Ibero-America and the Iberian Peninsula, as well as Equatorial Guinea. All members are Portuguese and Spanish speaking nations, in addition to Andorra, which is predominantly Catalan speaking, though the organization does not include all the Iberophone nations of the world.  History  The OEI was founded in 1949 as an international agency, the Office of Latin American Education, as a result of the first Latin American Education Congress in Madrid. In 1954 the second congress was held in Quito, where it was decided that the OEI would become an intergovernmental organization of sovereign states. On March 15, 1957, at the third Education Congress in Santo Domingo, the first statutes of the OEI became effective until 1985. In 1979, the fourth congress met in Madrid; in 1983 the fifth congress took place in Lima. In May 1985, an extraordinary meeting of the congress was held in Bogot√°, where it was decided to change the name of the OEI to its present name (keeping its acronyms and extending its objectives); the Latin American Education Congress became the General Assembly. At the December 1985 directive council meeting in Panama, its members agreed to the present statutes of the OEI, replacing the 1957 text and approving the organization's regulations. Since the 1991 Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, the OEI has promoted conferences of ministers of education and the execution of the educative, scientific and cultural programs delegated to it.  Objectives  The purpose of the OEI is to promote intergovernmental cooperation among its member nations, primarily in the fields of education, science, technology and the arts. Its General Secretariat is located in Madrid. Financing of OEI operations and programs is derived from obligatory quotas and voluntary contributions from the governments of member nations and private cultural and educational institutions and foundations. * To contribute to the fortification of knowledge, mutual understanding, integration, solidarity and peace among the Ibero-American peoples, and to spread education, science, technology and culture * To encourage the development of education and culture for peace by preparing people to preserve freedom, solidarity and human rights, supporting change which make these possible * To collaborate in the interchange of economic, political and cultural influences between Europe and Ibero-America * To collaborate with its members ensure that their education systems are compassionate, democratic (socially fair) and productive, preparing for working life * To collaborate in the diffusion of a common culture, respecting the uniqueness of its member states, encouraging global advances in science and technology while retaining cultural identity * To facilitate relationships among science, technology and society in the Ibero-American countries and citizen understanding of their effects * To promote the equitable distribution of cultural, technological and scientific concepts * To promote lateral cooperation among member states and between the states and other regional institutions * To contribute to the spread of the Spanish and Portuguese languages, encouraging bilingual education while preserving the multicultural identity of the Ibero-American communities with a multilingual culture  Structure  400pxthumbrightThe Iberophone nations of the world: The OEI consists of three bodies: the General Assembly, the Directive Council and the General Secretariat. =General Assembly= The General Assembly, the supreme authority of the organization, is composed of representatives (or delegations) from member States. It establishes OEI policies, evaluates and approves the organization's plan of activities, program and global budget, fixes annual dues and chooses the secretary-general. =Directive Council= The Directive Council is delegated by the General Assembly to control the OEI's government and administration. Made up of the member states' ministers of education (or their representatives), it is governed by the education minister of the country in which the next General Assembly meeting will be held. Its primary function is to analyze and approve the report of activities, programs, the biennial budget and the OEI's financial statement. =General Secretariat= The General Secretariat is delegated by the General Assembly as executive director of the OEI, representing it to governments, international organizations and other institutions.

The Mishmis occupy the northeastern tip of the central Arunachal Pradesh in Upper and Lower Dibang Valley, Lohit and Anjaw Districts.

Taraon, also called Digaru Mishmis, are distributed in the hill and the foothills between the Dibang, Digaru and the Lohit rivers. Kamans are also known as the Miju Mishmis; they live between the Lohit and the Kambang rivers in the foothills and in the Mishmi Hills on both sides of the Lohit river right up to the frontiers to Rima.

InstallShield is primarily used for installing software for Microsoft Windows desktop and server platforms, though it can also be used to manage software applications and packages on a variety of handheld and mobile devices.  Features  InstallShield generates a .msi file which can be used on the destination computer in order to install the payloads from the source computer where it was created. It is possible to specify questions, set prerequisites and registry settings that the user will be able to choose at the installation time.  Development  InstallShield was originally developed by The Stirling Group, a company founded in 1987 by Viresh Bhatia and Rick Harold, who had first met when they were computer science students at Northwestern University. Their first office was a small room in the basement of an old library building in Roselle, Illinois. They were to market a geographic mapping software, but it was never released. By 1990, The Stirling Group was selling a package of six products called the Shield Series. In that same year, the company also released the InstallShield product to developers. In 1993, The Stirling Group moved into larger offices in Schaumburg, Illinois and changed the companies name to Stirling Technologies, Inc. InstallShield became particularly well known after Microsoft endorsed it for use in Windows 95, and by 1997 Stirling Technologies estimated that it was being used in 85 to 90 percent of all software products written for Windows. Since 1996, the company operated under the InstallShield name until Macrovision acquired the business in 2004 for $76 million in cash plus an additional $20 million based on meeting sales targets. Limited versions of InstallShield were at various times bundled with popular software development packages such as Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, Borland Delphi 2006, and Borland C++Builder. On 1 April 2008, the Macrovision Software Business Unit (including the InstallShield brand) was sold to private equity firm Thoma Cressey Bravo, forming a new company called Acresso Software. In October 2009, Acresso Software changed its name to Flexera Software. In May 2020, Flexera Rebranded its Division Serving Software and IoT Companies to Revenera.

Animal rights protest In October 2004, an extremist group of animal rights campaigners stole Gladys Hammond's body from the village's graveyard. A group called the Animal Rights Militia claimed responsibility for the act as an attempt to force the closure of the nearby Darley Oaks Farm, owned and run by family members, where guinea-pigs were bred for medical research. On 23 August 2005 the farm's owners announced that they would be ceasing breeding of animals in the hope that Mrs Hammond's remains would be returned. Following a police investigation, arrests were made and on 10 April 2006 three men pleaded guilty to blackmail. They were subsequently given substantial prison terms.

The script, which was developed by Buddhist monks, made it possible to record Korean words through its equivalent meaning or sound in Chinese. The term \\"idu\\" may refer to various systems of representing Korean phonology through Chinese characters called hanja, which were used from the early Three Kingdoms to Joseon periods. In this sense, it includes hyangchal, the local writing system used to write vernacular poetry and gugyeol writing. Its narrow sense only refers to the \\"idu\\" proper or the system developed in the Goryeo period (918‚Äì1392), and first referred to by name in the Jewang Ungi.  Background  The idu script was developed to record Korean expressions using Chinese graphs borrowed in their Chinese meaning but it was read as the corresponding Korean sounds or by means of Chinese graphs borrowed in their Chinese sounds. This is also known as hanja and was used along with special symbols to indicate indigenous Korean morphemes, verb endings and other grammatical markers that were different in Korean from Chinese. This made both the meaning and pronunciation difficult to parse, and was one reason the system was gradually abandoned, to be replaced with hangul, after the invention of such in the 15th century. In this respect, it faced problems analogous to those that confronted early efforts to represent the Japanese language with kanji, due to grammatical differences between these languages and Chinese. In Japan, the early use of Chinese characters for Japanese grammar was in man'y≈çgana, which was replaced by kana, the Japanese syllabic script. Characters were selected for idu based on their Korean sound, their adapted Korean sound, or their meaning, and some were given a completely new sound and meaning. At the same time, 150 new Korean characters were invented, mainly for names of people and places. Idu system was used mainly by members of the Jungin class. One of the primary purposes of the script was the clarification of Chinese government documents that were written in Chinese so that they can be understood by the Korean readers. Idu was also used to teach Koreans the Chinese language. The Ming legal code was translated in its entirety into Korean using idu in 1395. The same script was also used to translate the Essentials of agriculture and sericulture (Nongsan jiyao) after it was ordered by the King Taejong in 1414.

He also donated much money to university education and research in several countries, and was the \\"silent partner\\" who structured the capital flight from post-Boer War South Africa to Rhodesia, and the Rhodes Scholarship, named after his employee, Cecil Rhodes. Beit's assets were structured around the so-called Corner House Group, which through its holdings in various companies controlled 37 per cent of the gold produced at the Witwatersrand's goldfields in Johannesburg in 1913.See chapter 12 in R√∂nnb√§ck & Broberg (2019) Capital and Colonialism. The Return on British Investments in Africa 1869-1969 (Palgrave Studies in Economic History)  Life and career  Leopold von Kalckreuth Born and brought up in Hamburg, Germany, he was the eldest son and second of six children of an affluent Jewish-German citizen of Hamburg. His younger siblings included Otto Beit. Alfred Beit was an unpromising scholar and was apprenticed to Jules Porg√®s & Cie, the Amsterdam diamond firm where he developed a talent for examining stones. Beit made his first fortune in property speculation. Responding to a demand for business premises, he bought a piece of land and built twelve corrugated iron sheds for offices and rented eleven out monthly and kept one for himself. Twelve years later he sold the land for a considerable profit. Beit was sent to Kimberley, South Africa in 1875 by his firm to buy diamonds‚Äîfollowing the diamond strike at Kimberley. He became a business friend of Cecil Rhodes through his role in the Kimberley Central Company. Beit was captivated by Rhodes' talk of 'big schemes'. Together, they proceeded to buy out digging ventures and to eliminate opposition such as Barney Barnato. He rapidly became one of a group of financiers who gained control of the diamond-mining claims in the Central, Dutoitspan, and De Beers mines. Rhodes was the active politician and Beit provided a lot of the planning and financial backing. Beit's diamond interests were mainly concentrated on Kimberley mine. He focused his main attention on the Kimberley Central Company aiming to expand its interests. He had a major role in the rise of Kimberley Central Company. In 1886 Beit extended his interests to the newly discovered goldfields of the Witwatersrand and met with great success. In his business ventures there he made use of financiers Hermann Eckstein and Sir Joseph Robinson. He founded the Robertson Syndicate and the firm of Wernher, Beit & Co. He imported mining engineers from the US and was among the first to adopt deep-level mining. Rhodes purportedly was granted concessions by Lobengula, as a result of which Beit founded the British South Africa Company in 1888. Beit became life-governor of De Beers and also a director of numerous other companies such as Rand Mines, Rhodesia Railways and the Beira Railway Company. His South-African assets formed the basis for the Corner House Group, which both controlled holding-companies like the Rand Mines and acted as an important network for several of the leading Randlords of the time. In 1888 Beit moved to London when he felt he was better able to manage his financial empire and support Rhodes in his Southern African ambitions. Beit moved into Tewin Water, Tewin, near Welwyn, a large Regency house with Victorian additions and 7,000 acres (28 km2), and a few miles away Julius Wernher bought Luton Hoo, with 5,218 acres (21.1 km2). In the 1890s, he had a mansion built in Park Lane ‚Äì Aldford House. Inspired by Rhodes' imperialist vision, he took part in the planning and financing of the unsuccessful Jameson Raid of late 1895 which was intended to trigger a coup in the South African Republic in the Transvaal. As a result of this debacle, Rhodes resigned as Prime Minister, and both he and Beit were found guilty by the House of Commons inquiry. Beit was obliged to resign as director of the British South Africa Company,Robert I. Rotberg, 1988, The Founder: Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power, Oxford University Press, p. 547. but was elected vice-president a few years later. With the death of Rhodes in 1902, Beit, as one of the trustees, helped control the enormous estate, currently being helped by the Oppenheimer family of De Beers and Anglo-American. Beit never married and had no children. He died at Tewin Water on 16 July 1906 after seeing a rapid deterioration in his health. He left an estate of ¬£8,049,886 (equivalent to ¬£ billion in ).  The Beit Trust and other donations  Imperial College, London During his lifetime, Beit made generous donations for scientific work and education. In 1905 he founded a chair of colonial history at the University of Oxford, which is now the Beit Professor of History of the British Commonwealth.University of Oxford, Faculty of History. URL http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/staff/postholder/brown_jm.htm In 1906 he made the donation of two million mark to the stock capital of the Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung, a charity dedicated to spend its interest for the benefit of a precursor of the University of Hamburg. In his will he set up the Beit Trust through which he bequeathed large sums of money (¬£1,200,000) for infrastructure development in the former Northern and Southern Rhodesia, later modified to university education and research in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. Significant infrastructure projects financed by the Trust include the Birchenough Bridge in the former Southern Rhodesia, named after Sir Henry Birchenough, chairman of the Beit Trust from 1931 until 1937 and whose ashes are buried beneath the structure of the bridge. Ralph Freeman, the bridge's designer, was also the structural designer on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and consequently the two bridges bear a close resemblance, although Birchenough is only two-thirds as long as the Australian bridge. It was built by Dorman Long and completed in 1935. At a length of 1,080 feet (329 m) it was the third longest single-arch suspension bridge in the world at the time. In recognition of his bequests the Royal School of Mines, a faculty of Imperial College London, erected a large memorial to Beit flanking the entrance to its building. The Imperial College residential halls on Prince Consort Road was named Beit Hall after him.

This is a savoury, juicy apple with strong acidity at first, which then mellows as the fruit matures during September, but the flesh softens soon thereafter. When picked early, it makes a sweet and delicate stewed apple, but then can be used as a dessert apple. James Grieve apples used to be grown all over Europe and were delivered to the city markets via train or horse-and-cart, but because they bruised easily they had to be carefully packed in laundry-type wicker baskets filled with straw. The fruit cannot sustain modern supermarket handling, and so they are now only grown in gardens and for direct sale to consumers. Nonetheless, James Grieve is considered a good apple because it is exceptionally tasty, it produces fruit every year, it is disease-resistant, and it is a good polleniser for other apples.

It was largely a continuation of the First Sudanese Civil War of 1955 to 1972. Although it originated in southern Sudan, the civil war spread to the Nuba mountains and the Blue Nile. It lasted for 22 years and is one of the longest civil wars on record. The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan six years after the war ended. Roughly two million people died as a result of war, famine and disease caused by the conflict. Four million people in southern Sudan were displaced at least once (and normally repeatedly) during the war.

Background and Causes The Sudanese war is often characterized as a fight between the central government expanding and dominating peoples of the periphery, raising allegations of marginalization. Kingdoms and great powers based along the Nile River have fought against the people of inland Sudan for centuries. Since at least the 18th century, central governments have attempted to regulate and exploit the undeveloped southern and inland Sudan. Some sources describe the conflict as an ethnoreligious one where the Muslim central government's pursuits to impose sharia law on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war.Tibi, Bassam (2008). Political Islam, World Politics and Europe. Routledge. p. 33. \\"The shari'a was imposed on non-Muslim Sudanese peoples in September 1983, and since that time Muslims in the north have been fighting a jihad against the non-Muslims in the south.\\" Douglas Johnson has pointed to an exploitative governance as the root cause. When the British governed Sudan as a colony they administered the northern and southern provinces separately. The south was held to be more similar to the other east- African colonies ‚Äî Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda ‚Äî while northern Sudan was more similar to Arabic-speaking Egypt. Northern Arabs were prevented from holding positions of power in the south with its African traditions, and trade was discouraged between the two areas. However, in 1946, the British gave in to northern pressure to integrate the two areas. Arabic was made the language of administration in the south, and northerners began to hold positions there. The southern elite, trained in English, resented the change as they were kept out of their own government.What's happening in Sudan?, Sudanese Australian Integrated Learning (SAIL) Program. Archived 27 December 2005 on the Internet Archive. Retrieved 10 April 2007. After decolonization most power was given to the northern elites based in Khartoum, causing unrest in the south. The British moved towards granting Sudan independence, but they failed to give enough power to Southern leaders. Southern Sudanese leaders weren't even invited to negotiations during the transitional period in the 1950s. In the post-colonial government of 1953, the Sudanization Committee only included 6 southern leaders, though there were some 800 available senior administrative positions. The second war was partially about natural resources. Between the north and the south lie significant oil fields and thus significant foreign interests (the oil revenue is privatized to Western interests as in Nigeria). The north wanted to control these resources because they are situated on the edge of the Sahara desert, which is unsuitable for agricultural development. Oil revenues make up about 70% of Sudan's export earnings, and contribute to the development of the country which, unlike the south, does not depend on international aid. Due to numerous tributaries of the Nile river and heavier precipitation in the south of Sudan they have superior water access and fertile land. There has also been a significant amount of death from warring tribes in the south. Most of the conflict has been between Nuer and Dinka but other ethnic groups have also been involved. These tribal conflicts have remained after independence. For example, in January 2012 3,000 Murle people were massacred by the Nuer. The first civil war ended in 1972, with the Addis Ababa Agreement. Part of the agreement gave religious and cultural autonomy to the south. Civil War =Before 1985= Addis Ababa Agreement ended Map of Sudan at the time of the civil war The Addis Ababa Accords incorporated in the Constitution of Sudan; the violation of the agreement led to the second civil war. A number of mutinies by former Anyanya took place in 1974, 1975, and February 1976, the March 1975 mutiny at Akobo seeing 200 killed, 150 soldiers executed, and 48 more sentenced to imprisonment for up to 15 years. The first violations occurred when President Jaafar Nimeiry attempted to take control of oil fields straddling the north-south border. Oil had been discovered in Bentiu in 1978, in southern Kurdufan and Upper Blue Nile in 1979, the Unity oilfields in 1980 and Adar oilfields in 1981, and in Heglig in 1982. Access to the oil fields meant significant economic benefit to whoever controlled them. Islamic fundamentalists in the north had been discontented with the Addis Ababa Agreement, which gave relative autonomy to the non- Islamic majority Southern Sudan Autonomous Region. The fundamentalists continued to grow in power, and in 1983 President Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state, terminating the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region. Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was founded in 1983 as a rebel group, to reestablish an autonomous Southern Sudan by fighting against the central government. While based in Southern Sudan, it identified itself as a movement for all oppressed Sudanese citizens, and was led by John Garang. Initially, the SPLA campaigned for a United Sudan, criticizing the central government for policies that were leading to national \\"disintegration\\". In September 1985 announced the end of the state of emergency and dismantled the emergency courts but soon promulgated a new judiciary act, which continued many of the practices of the emergency courts. Despite Nimeiry's public assurances that the rights of non-Muslims would be respected, southerners and other non-Muslims remained deeply suspicious. =1985‚Äì1991= On 6 April 1985, senior military officers led by Gen. Abdul Rahman Suwar ad-Dahhab mounted a coup. Among the first acts of the new government was to suspend the 1983 constitution, rescind the decree declaring Sudan's intent to become an Islamic state, and disband Nimeiry's Sudan Socialist Union. However, the \\"September laws\\" instituting Islamic Sharia law were not suspended. A 15-member transitional military council was named, chaired by Gen. Suwar ad-Dahhab, in 1985. In consultation with an informal conference of political parties, unions, and professional organizations‚Äîknown as the \\"Gathering\\"‚Äîthe military council appointed an interim civilian cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Dr. Al-Jazuli Daf'allah. Elections were held in April 1986, and a transitional military council turned over power to a civilian government as promised. The government was headed by Prime Minister Sadiq al- Mahdi of the Umma Party. It consisted of a coalition of the Umma Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (formerly the NUP-National Unionist Party), the National Islamic Front (NIF) of Hassan al-Turabi, and several southern region parties. This coalition dissolved and reformed several times over the next few years, with Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and his Umma Party always in a central role. Negotiation and escalation In May 1986, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government coalition began peace negotiations with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by Col. John Garang. In that year the SPLA and a number of Sudanese political parties met in Ethiopia and agreed to the \\"Koka Dam\\" declaration, which called for abolishing Islamic Sharia law and convening a constitutional conference. In 1988, the SPLA and the DUP agreed on a peace plan calling for the abolition of military pacts with Egypt and Libya, freezing of Sharia law, an end to the state of emergency, and a cease-fire. However, during this period the second civil war intensified in lethality, and the national economy continued to deteriorate. When prices of basic goods were increased in 1988, riots ensued, and the price increases were cancelled. When Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi refused to approve a peace plan reached by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in November 1988, the DUP left the government. The new government consisted essentially of the Umma Party and the fundamentalist National Islamic Front (NIF). In February 1989, the army presented Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi with an ultimatum: he could move toward peace or be removed. He chose to form a new government with the DUP, and approved the SPLA/DUP peace plan. A constitutional conference was tentatively planned for September 1989. Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation On 30 June 1989, however, military officers under then Col. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, with National Islamic Front (NIF) instigation and support, replaced the Sadiq al- Mahdi government with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (RCC), a military junta of 15 military officers (reduced to 12 in 1991) assisted by a civilian cabinet. As General al-Bashir he became: president; chief of state; prime minister; and chief of the armed forces. The RCC al- Bashir military government banned trade unions, political parties, and other \\"non-religious\\" institutions. About 78,000 members of the army, police, and civil administration were purged in order to reshape the government. Criminal Act of 1991 In March 1991, a new penal code, the Criminal Act of 1991, instituted harsh punishments nationwide, including amputations and stoning. Although the southern states were officially exempt from these Islamic prohibitions and penalties, the 1991 act provided for a possible future application of Islamic Shari‚Äôa law in the south. In 1993, the government transferred most non-Muslim judges from the south to the north, replacing them with Muslim judges in the south.U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE \\"SUDAN HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES\\", 1994, Section 1b, paragraph 4. Retrieved 7 February 2010 The introduction of Public Order Police to enforce Shari‚Äôa law resulted in the arrest, and treatment under Shari‚Äôa penalties, of southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north. =Conduct of the war: 1991‚Äì2001= The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) was in control of large areas of Equatoria, Bahr al Ghazal, and Upper Nile provinces and also operated in the southern portions of Darfur, Kordofan, and Blue Nile provinces. The government controlled a number of the major southern towns and cities, including Juba, Wau, and Malakal. An informal cease-fire in May broke down in October 1989. In July 1992, a government offensive seized southern Sudan, and captured the SPLA headquarters in Torit. Both the government regular armed forces and notorious militia (known as the People's Defense Forces, PDF) were used to attack and raid villages in the South and the Nuba Mountains.Sabit A.

Sudan's governments have a long history of using proxies in Southern Sudan, and the North‚ÄìSouth border areas, to fight their wars and preserve their regular forces. These militias were recruited locally, and with covert ties to the national government. Many of the Khartoum-aligned groups were created and then armed by the NIF in a deliberate ‚Äòdivide and rule‚Äô strategy.Claire Mc Evoy and Emile LeBrun, Uncertain Future: Armed Violence in Southern Sudan, HSBA Working Paper No. 20, April 2010, p.13 The widespread activity of insurgent and pro-government militants and increasing lawlessness in southern Sudan resulted in the militarization of many communities. Ethnic violence became widespread, and all sides targeted civilians to destroy the power bases and recruitment centers of their rivals. Those who could formed self-defense groups, and these were often based on familial and tribal links as these were the only ones most southern people could still rely on. In this way, groups like the Nuer White Army and Dinka Titweng (\\"cattle guard\\") militias came into existence. Even though they were originally intended to just defend civilian communities, they often became brutal gangs which targeted civilians of other ethnicities. The government and rebel groups exploited these tensions and self-defense groups, using them to destabilize their enemies. The Sudanese Armed Forces became infamous for brutally suppressing all civil dissidents. People suspected of disloyalty or rebel sympathies were arrested and taken to prisons and barracks, where they were tortured and executed. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands of people were murdered at the infamous \\"White House\\", the Giada barracks in Juba alone. At the same time, the SPLA ruthlessly crushed all internal and external opposition as far as possible, including other rebel factions such as the Anyanya II insurgents and critics in its own ranks. Garang became infamous for his authoritarian leadership style, and ordered the torture and execution of several dissenting SPLA commanders. Over time, a growing number of SPLA members became wary of his rule, and began to conspire against him. SPLA infighting In August 1991, internal dissent among the rebels led opponents of Garang's leadership, most importantly Riek Machar and Lam Akol, to attempt a coup against him. It failed, and the dissidents split off to form their own SPLA faction, the SPLA-Nasir. On 15 November 1991, Machar's SPLA-Nasir alongside the Nuer White Army carried out the Bor massacre, killing an estimated 2000 Dinka civilians. In September 1992, William Nyuon Bany formed a second rebel faction, and in February 1993, Kerubino Kwanyin Bol formed a third rebel faction. On 5 April 1993, the three dissident rebel factions announced a coalition of their groups called SPLA United at a press conference in Nairobi, Kenya. Sudanese alignments In 1990‚Äì91, the Sudanese government supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This changed American attitudes toward the country. Bill Clinton's administration prohibited American investment in the country and supplied money to neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions. The US also began attempts to \\"isolate\\" Sudan and began referring to it as a rogue state. Since 1993, the leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya have pursued a peace initiative for Sudan under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), but results have been mixed. Despite that record, the IGAD initiative promulgated the 1994 Declaration of Principles (DOP) that aimed to identify the essential elements necessary to a just and comprehensive peace settlement; i.e., the relationship between religion and the state, power- sharing, wealth-sharing, and the right of self-determination for the south. The Sudanese Government did not sign the DOP until 1997 after major battlefield losses to the SPLA. SPLA alignments In 1995, the opposition in the north united with parties from the south to create a coalition of opposition parties called the National Democratic Alliance. This development opened a northeastern front to the civil war, making it more than before a center-periphery rather than simply a north-south conflict. The SPLA, DUP, and Umma Parties were the key groups forming the NDA, along with several smaller parties and northern ethnic groups. In 1995, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda stepped up their military assistance to the SPLA to the point of sending active troops into Sudan. Eritrean and Ethiopian military involvement weakened when the two countries entered a border conflict in 1998. Uganda's support weakened when it shifted its attention to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Frontlines in Southern Sudan, June 2001 By 1997, seven groups in the government camp, led by former Garang lieutenant Riek Machar, signed the Khartoum Peace Agreement with the NIF, thereby forming the largely symbolic South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) umbrella. Furthermore, the government signed the Nuba Mountains, and Fashoda agreements with rebel factions. These included the Khartoum agreements that ended military conflict between the government and significant rebel factions. Many of those leaders then moved to Khartoum where they assumed marginal roles in the central government, or collaborated with the government in military engagements against the SPLA. These three agreements paralleled the terms and conditions of the IGAD agreement, calling for a degree of autonomy for the south and the right of self-determination. Nevertheless, the SPLA made major advances in 1997 due to the success of Operation Thunderbolt, an offensive during which the South Sudanese separatists seized most of Central and Western Equatoria from the government. In July 2000, the Libyan/Egyptian Joint Initiative on the Sudan was made moot, calling for the establishment of an interim government, power-sharing, constitutional reform, and new elections. Southern critics objected to the joint initiative because it neglected to address issues of the relationship between religion and the state and failed to mention the right of self-determination. It is unclear to what extent this initiative will have a significant impact on the search for peace, as some critics view it as more aimed at a resolution among northern political parties and protecting the perceived security interests of Egypt in favour of the unity of the Sudan. =Peace agreement= Peace talks between the southern rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004, although skirmishes in parts of the south continued. A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed on 9 January 2005 in Nairobi. The terms of the peace treaty were: *The south had autonomy for six years, followed by a referendum on independence (the Southern Sudanese independence referendum, 2011). *Both sides of the conflict would have merged portions of their armed forces into a 39,000-strong force after six years (the Joint Integrated Units), if the Southern Sudanese independence referendum had turned out against secession. *Oil revenues were divided equally between the government and SPLA during the six-year autonomy period. *Jobs were split according to varying ratios (central administration: 70 to 30, Abyei/Blue Nile State/Nuba Mountains: 55 to 45, both in favour of the government). *Islamic Sharia law was applied in the north, while terms of use of Sharia in the south were decided by the elected assembly. The status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations. According to the SPLA, about 2 million people had died in southern Sudan alone due to the war. Foreign interventions In 1999, Egypt and Libya initiated the Egypt-Libya Initiative (ELI). By this time the peace process of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) had reached a stalemate. ELI's main purpose had been to bring members of the non-Southern opposition (especially opposition in the north) aboard the talks. However, as ELI avoided contentious issues, such as secession, it lacked support from the SPLA, but the NDA leadership accepted it. By 2001, ELI had been unable to bring about any agreement between the parties. In September 2001, former U.S. Senator John Danforth was designated Presidential Envoy for Peace in the Sudan. His role was to explore the prospects that the US could play a useful catalytic role in the search for a just end to the civil war, and enhance humanitarian services delivery that can help reduce the suffering of the Sudanese people stemming from war related effects. Following an internal outcry, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government in March 1989 agreed with the United Nations and donor nations (including the US) on a plan called Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), under which some 100,000 tons of food was moved into both government and SPLA-held areas of the Sudan, and widespread starvation was averted. Phase II of OLS to cover 1990 was approved by both the government and the SPLA Sudan faced a 2-year drought and food shortage across the entire country. The US, UN, and other donors attempted to mount a coordinated international relief effort in both north and south Sudan to prevent a catastrophe. However, due to Sudan's human rights abuses and its pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf War, many donors cut much of their aid to the Sudan. In a similar drought in 2000‚Äì01, the international community again responded to avert mass starvation in the Sudan. International donors continue to provide large amounts of humanitarian aid to all parts of the Sudan. The US government's Sudan Peace Act of 21 October 2002 accused Sudan of genocide for killing more than 2 million civilians in the south during the civil war since 1983. Arms suppliers Sudan relied on a variety of countries for its arms supplies. Following independence, the army was trained and supplied by the British. However, after the 1967 Six-Day War, relations were cut off, as were relations with the United States and West Germany. From 1968 to 1972, the Soviet Union and COMECON nations sold large numbers of weapons and provided technical assistance and training to Sudan. At this time the army grew from a strength of 18,000 to roughly 50,000 men. Large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery were acquired, and they dominated the army until the late 1980s. Relations cooled between the two sides after the 1971 Sudanese coup d'√©tat attempt by Hashem al Atta, and the Khartoum government sought to diversify its suppliers. The Soviet Union continued to supply weapons until 1977, when their arms aid to the Marxist military junta in Ethiopia during the Ogaden War angered the Sudanese sufficiently to cancel their deals and expell Soviet military advisors. The People's Republic of China was the main supplier in the late 1970s. Egypt was the most important military partner in the 1970s, providing missiles, personnel carriers, and other military hardware. At the same time military cooperation between the two countries was important. U.S.-aligned countries resumed supplying Sudan in the mid-1970s. The United States began selling Sudan a great deal of equipment around 1976, hoping to counteract Soviet support of Marxist Ethiopian government, Libyans and Somalia (before 1977). Military sales peaked in 1982 at US$101 million. West Germany established an ammunitions factory in Khartoum and introduced vast quantities of automatic small arms to Sudan.\\"'Africa's arms dump': following the trail of bullets in the Sudans\\". The Guardian. 2 October 2014. After the start of the second civil war, American assistance dropped, and was eventually cancelled in 1987.Sudan ‚Äì Foreign Military Assistance, Library of Congress Country Study (TOC), research completed June 1991. Retrieved 10 April 2007. In November 1993, Iran was reported to have financed Sudan¬¥s purchase of some 20 Chinese ground-attack aircraft. Iran pledged $17 million in financial aid to the Sudanese government, and arranged for $300 million in Chinese arms to be delivered to the Sudanese army. Meanwhile, the rebel SPLA was supplied weapons through or by Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The Israeli embassy in Kenya also supplied anti-tank missiles to the rebels. Child soldiers Armies from all sides enlisted children in their ranks. The 2005 agreement required that child soldiers be demobilized and sent home. The SPLA claimed to have let go 16,000 of its child soldiers between 2001 and 2004. However, international observers (UN and Global Report 2004) have found demobilized children have often been re-recruited by the SPLA. As of 2004, there were between 2,500 and 5,000 children serving in the SPLA. Rebels have promised to demobilize all children by the end of 2010. The goal was met. The Nuer White Army, a minor participant in the war in the Greater Upper Nile region, consisted largely of armed Nuer youths, but it was principally self-organised and often operated autonomously of both elders' authority and the dictates of the major factions.

He was one of the first presenters of Czech drama, and was especially influential in the foundation of comedic Czech theatre. Klicpera was born in Chlumec nad Cidlinou. After graduating from a gymnasium (a European secondary school) in 1813, he moved to Prague. There he studied philosophy in 1816 and medicine in 1818. In June 1819 he was made a professor at a gymnasium in Hradec Kr√°lov√©. In 1850 he became schoolmaster of a Prague gymnasium. He was skilled in writing chivalric plays and patriotically-themed historical dramas that became the foundation of modern Czech drama. He is also recognized for his farces (in Czech fra≈°ky), in the Plautine tradition. He also wrote historical romance stories, plays from his own era, and plays with fairy tale motifs. Klicpera supported the advancement of Czech theatre through the publication of plays in the Klicpera's theatre edition. He died in Prague and is buried in the city's Ol≈°any Cemetery.

The platform was dissolved around 2011 because of internal problems and loss of funding from the city authorities of Vienna. In a 3-day convention at the K√ºnstlerhaus in October 2004 netznetz.net activists discussed and gathered opinions on the practices, collaborations and future of digital Vienna. The motto \\"Bring Your Own Devices\\" was a call beyond the individual scenes to both past and future participants, and offered access to new techniques and strategies in horizontal working situations. netznetz.net suggested a new approach for the distribution of net culture funding to Vienna's city government.  Funding model  Netznetz (also: Netznetz Mana) was a system for the distribution of municipal grants developed and run by netznetz in which the participants distributed their own funding according to certain democratically agreed rules and aided by custom software. It was run largely independent of the city government which provides the funds. The system was striving for guaranteed and dispersed distribution of funding in the sector while the parameters of the distribution were meant to remain flexible, providing a dynamic scope. The aim was to encourage project- based collaborations by distributing various smaller grants. Therefore, everybody who was involved in the sector was subject to the principle of permanent reconfiguration of the system and the network. The modular funding structure ‚Äì developed in a drawn-out process of discourse and with the contribution of more than 30 groups ‚Äì was boldly presented by the community and accepted by the municipal Commissioner for the Arts. Netznetz.net gathering at K√ºnstlerhaus, Vienna (October 2004) According to the new plan, 50% of the funding (250,000 euro, roughly US$300,000) was reserved for infrastructure (backbone projects), newbies (microgrants), and common representation (annual convention) and was to be distributed by the administration together with the community during the course of an open space conference. The other half of the funding was to be distributed among the community by the community itself in the form of network grants, facilitating the everyday work of contributors, which is usually not supported at all in conventional arts endowment systems. The process to come up with an ideal system of self-governance amongst the artists was challenging. Many members of the scene were skeptical. Critics feared that the system would lead to increased competition and hostilities between participants, favor well- marketed projects over substantiated ones or that too much trust is placed in as-yet-unproven software. Proponents of the idea cited its independent, democratic, open and non-bureaucratic tendencies as advantages, and stated that it was designed to reward collaboration. In spring 2009 the City of Vienna started an external evaluation process that decided the future of the self-governed funding model. As a result, parts of the direct community voting mechanisms were replaced by a jury, which is being elected by the community. netznetz was closed in 2011.

Scheil, Paris 1913, vol XIV (died ) was the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon.  Biography  His name, along with the length of his reign, are recorded in the Canon of Ptolemy, and some scholars point to three separate namesakes mentioned in a list of reigning kings held by the Sumerian civilization existent 2,000 years prior, leaving the timeline of his reign unclear. No surviving cuneiform documents record his life or deeds, suggesting that the men mentioned in both lists may have instead shared a family name, or had a common ancestor with Awil-Marduk. Berossus writes that he was murdered in a plot orchestrated by Nergal-sharezer, his successor and brother-in-law.Josephus, Apion 1.20 Berossus also notes that \\"he governed public affairs after an illegal and impure manner,\\" possibly an allusion to actions that infuriated the priestly class,Hirsch 1901-1906 including reforms made to the policies of Nebuchadnezzar.Oded 2007 One such reform is recorded in the Hebrew Bible,, Jeremiah 52:31 where Evil-Merodach ( ) is remembered for releasing the Jewish king Jehoiachin from prison after 37 years in captivity. Later Jewish and Christian texts expand the Biblical account. Josephus and the Avot of Rabbi Natan state that the king believed that Jehoiachin was held by his father without cause, and thus decided to release him upon the latter's death. Josephus assigned eighteen years to his reign,Antiquities of the Jews by Flavius Josephus, Book X, chapter 11, paragraph 2, line 9. and later in his rebuttal to Apion over the comparison of the antiquity of the Jews to the Greeks, Josephus quotes Berossus assigning a reign of two years.Against Apion by Flavius Josephus, Book 1, paragraph 20 Seder Olam Rabbah assigned twenty- three years to his reign.Transactions of the Chronological Institute of London, T. Richards 1861, volume II, part 2, page 120-121 Leviticus Rabbah 18:2 states that Evil-Merodach was made king while Nebuchadnezzar was still living, and was punished for this act of rebellion by his father, who had him imprisoned. In Esther Rabbah, Evil-Merodach, owing to his father's actions before his death, is heir to a bankrupt treasury. From the Jewish encyclopedia: Son of Nebuchadnezzar, and third ruler of the New Babylonian empire; reigned from 561 to 560 BC. His name in Babylonian is \\"Amil-Marduk\\" or \\"Avel-Marduk\\"= \\"man,\\" or \\"servant, of Marduk.\\" No personal or historical inscriptions of his reign have been discovered, and there are only two sources of information concerning him‚Äîthe Hebrew Scriptures and Berosus. According to the Bible (Jer. lii. 31; II Kings xxv. 27 et seq.), he released in the year of his accession, the imprisoned king Jehoiachin, invited him to his table, clothed him with royal raiment, and elevated him above all other captive kings that were in Babylon. Tiele, Cheyne, and Hommel are of the opinion that perhaps Neriglissar, Evil-merodach's brother-in-law, who is praised for his benevolence, was instrumental in the freeing of the Judean king. Gr√§tz, on the other hand, conjectures the influence of the Jewish eunuchs (referring to Jer. xxxix. 7 and Daniel). Berosus, however, says that Evil-merodach ruled \\"unjustly and lewdly.\\" Possibly his treatment of the exiled king was held by the priestly, or national, party to have been unlawful; or it may be that the memory of some injury rankled in the mind of the priestly writer, or writers, of his history (Winckler, \\"Gesch. Babyloniens und Assyriens,\\" p. 314). Evilmerodach was unable to counteract the danger arising from Median immigration. The party opposed to him soon succeeded in dethroning him, and he was assassinated by order of Neriglissar, who succeeded him.evil-merodach Jewish encyclopedia The chronology of the three Babylonian kings is given in the Talmud as follows: Nebuchadnezzar reigned forty-five years, Evil-merodach twenty-three, and Belshazzar was monarch of Babylonia for two years, being killed at the beginning of the third year on the fatal night of the fall of Babylon (Talmud Bavli, Meguila 11b). The references in the Talmud and the Midrash to Belshazzar all emphasize his tyrannous oppression of his Jewish subjects. Several passages in the Prophets are interpreted as though referring to him and his predecessors. In the passage, \\"As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him\\" (Amos 19), the lion represents Nebuchadnezzar, and the bear, equally ferocious if not equally courageous, is Belshazzar (Esther Rabba, Introduction). The three Babylonian kings are often mentioned together as forming a succession of impious and tyrannous monarchs who oppressed Israel and were therefore foredoomed to disgrace and destruction. The verse in Isaiah xiv 22, \\"And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant and son and grandchild, saith the Lord,\\" is applied to the trio. \\"Name\\" refers to Nebuchadnezzar, \\"remnant\\" to Evil- merodach, \\"son\\" is Belshazzar, and \\"grandchild\\" Vashti (ib.). The command given to Abraham to cut in pieces three heifers as a part of the covenant established between him and his God, is thus elucidated, \\"And he said unto him, take unto me three heifers\\" (Genesis xv. 9 [A. V. \\"a heifer of three years old\\"]).

As far as the casting for this production was concerned, Michael Connors had earlier been the star of a 1959‚Äì60 crime series, Tightrope!, and the following year, after streamlining his stage name to \\"Mike Connors\\", starred as the long-running private eye, Mannix (1967‚Äì75), while Dorothy Provine was one of the stars in The Alaskans (1959‚Äì60) and The Roaring 20's (1960‚Äì62). Two years earlier, Provine and Connors played key supporting roles as second leads in the 1964 Jack Lemmon‚ÄìRomy Schneider comedy vehicle Good Neighbor Sam.

While Connors portrayed a Sean Connery-type American superspy, Dorothy Provine played her role with an upper-class British accent similar to Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward of the Thunderbirds TV series. Her character rode a gadget- filled Rolls Royce driven by an Aloysius Parker-type chauffeur played by Terry-Thomas. The movie was filmed on location in Rio de Janeiro and Rome with Dino De Laurentiis spending a lot of money on production. Connors also recalled that he did the stuntwork of dangling from a rope ladder attached to a helicopter flying off the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio when the local stuntman refused to do it. Connors said that they were the only film company ever granted permission to film at the landmark. Reception A review of the film (bylined \\"Murf.\\") in the January 11, 1967 issue of Variety stated, \\"Undoubtedly, there will be some people who will enjoy \\"Kiss the Girls And Make Them Die,\\" but fact is that producer Dino De Laurentiis has made a limp, banal spy spoof, inept in all departments.

Michael Weldon's Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film (1983 edition, page 407) agrees with the denigrators, giving it a plot outline that ends with the words, \\"[T]he worst Bond imitation known to man.

Nature 179, 997-99. He applied the idea to the origin of different skin colours in human races, and from the context it seems he thought it might be applied more widely.

The origin of species by means of natural selection. Murray, London, 4th and subsequent editions, in the preliminary 'Historical sketch'.  Life  Wells was born in Charleston on 24 May 1757, the second son of Mary and Robert Wells, a printer. His parents were Scots who had settled in South Carolina in 1753. He is the brother of Louisa Susannah Wells and Helena Wells. He was sent to school in Dumfries, Scotland in 1768, at the age of 11, and after completing his preparatory school studies he attended the University of Edinburgh for a year. Wells returned to Charleston in 1771 and became a medical apprentice under Dr Alexander Garden, a naturalist and physician, who himself was a pupil of Charles Alston, Director of the Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh. In 1775, soon after the commencement of the American War of Independence, he left Charleston suddenly, and went to London in England. He had been called upon to sign a paper the object of which was to unite the people in a resistance to the claims of the British Government. This he would not do. In 1776 he returned to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine graduating with his medical degree in 1778. In the autumn he returned to London, and attended a course of William Hunter's lectures, took instructions in practical Anatomy, and became a surgeon's pupil at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1779 he went to Holland as a surgeon of the British Army attached to a Scottish regiment. There he received ill-treatment from his commanding officer, and resigned his commission. On the day on which he received his dismissal from the service, he challenged the officer to a duel: the officer refused to respond. Wells then moved to Leiden in the Netherlands and matriculated at the University of Leiden Feb. 19, 1780.Album Studiosorum Academiae Lugduno Batavae MDLXXV- MDCCCLXXV, kol. 1133.Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden university / by Edward Peacock, F.S.A. - London : For the Index society, by Longmans, Green & co. 1883, p. 103, 1133.

Serjeants' Inn, off Chancery Lane, in the early 1800s, where Wells died. Early in 1781 he returned to Carolina to put his family's affairs in order. He was \\"at the same time an officer in a corps of volunteers; a printer, a bookseller, and a merchant, a trustee for some of his father's friends in England for the management of affairs of considerable importance in Carolina; and on one occasion exercised, at the instance of the Colonel Commandant of the militia, the office of Judge Advocate, in conducting a prosecution in a general court martial of militia officers.\\" Gentleman's Magazine, November 1817. When the British withdrew from Charleston in December 1782, he traveled to St. Augustine, Florida. There he published the East Florida Gazette, the first weekly newspaper printed in Florida. Other publications during the British period of Florida included the Address of the principal inhabitants of East Florida. He returned to England in 1784 to practice medicine. In 1790 he was appointed one of the Physicians to the Finsbury Dispensary, and remained so until 1798. In 1793 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1798 he was elected Assistant Physician to St Thomas's Hospital; and in 1800 became one of the Physicians. From about 1800, his health was uncertain, and he led a more limited life which was nevertheless fairly productive in medical research. Wells was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1814. His proposers were William Miller, Lord Glenlee, John Playfair, and Baron Hume nephew of David Hume the philosopher. In the same year the Royal Society of London awarded him the Rumford Medal for his Essay on Dew. He died on 18 September 1817 at Serjeant's Inn in London, after suffering symptoms of heart malfunction (auricular fibrillation).William Dock. The lure of medical history: William Charles Wells. California and Western Medicine, 31, 340-341. He is buried at St Bride's Church. His parents, Robert and Mary Wells, are buried nearby. A tablet was erected by Louisa Susannah Wells \\"as a tribute of duty to her parents and of affection to her brother.\\"  Wells' recognition of natural selection  Wells was the elder of three British medical men who formulated evolutionary ideas in the period 1813-1819\\\\. He was, arguably, the most successful in this endeavour; the others were James Cowles Prichard and William Lawrence. In 1813 a paper by Wells was read before the Royal Society; it was published in 1818. This was Two Essays... with some observations on the causes of the differences of colour and form between the white and negro races of men. By the Late W.C. Wells‚Ä¶with a Memoir of his life, written by himself. Wells was clearly interested in how different races might have arisen.Wade N.J. 2003. Destined for distinguished oblivion: the scientific vision of William Charles Wells (1752‚Äì1817). Springer.Wells, Kentwood D. 1973. William Charles Wells and the races of man. Isis 64, 215.Zirkle, Conrad 1941. Natural selection before the Origin of Species. Proc Am Phil Soc 84, 71-123. After some preliminary remarks on the different races of man, and of the selection of domesticated animals, he observes that: :\\"[What was done for animals artificially] seems to be done with equal efficiency, though more slowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which would occur among the first scattered inhabitants, some one would be better fitted than the others to bear the diseases of the country. This race would multiply while the others would decrease, and as the darkest would be the best fitted for the [African] climate, at length [they would] become the most prevalent, if not the only race.\\" Wells W.C. 1818. Two essays: upon a single vision with two eyes, the other on dew. Constable, London. This contains an appendix entitled An account of a female of the white race of mankind, part of whose skin resembles that of a negro, with some observations on the cause of the differences in colour and form between the white and negro races of man. It is this last part which contains the idea of natural selection. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were not aware of this work when they published their theory in 1858, but later Darwin acknowledged: :\\"In this paper he [Wells] distinctly recognizes the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated; but he applies it only to man, and to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and, secondly, that agriculturalists improve their domesticated animals by selection; and then he adds, but what is done in this latter case by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country which they inhabit.\\" Credit for the first appreciation of natural selection could therefore go to Wells rather than to Edward Blyth or Patrick Matthew. The triumph is limited to the extent of being applied only to skin colour, and not, as Darwin and Wallace did, to the whole range of life. A form of the idea had already been set out by an earlier Edinburgh author, James Hutton, but in that case the effect was limited to improvement of varieties rather than the formation of new species.,  Wells' work on dew  In the 1780s, Wells and a few others had the idea that dew and frost occurred when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of water vapor in the air caused by just the right combination of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and heat conductivity of materials. Wells' inquiry into the nature of dew were widely cited in the 1830s as an outstanding example of inductive scientific inquiry.Preface to An Essay on Dew and Several Appearances Connected with It, edited, with annotations by L. P. Casella (London: 1866) Sir John Herschel used it as the primary illustration in his Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy, calling the theory, \\"one of the most beautiful specimens we can call to mind of inductive experimental enquiry lying within a moderate compass.\\" In 1836, the Encyclopedia Metropolitana reported, \\"We know of no work in our day which has been more universally admired than the Treatise of Dr. Wells, certainly none that practically exemplifies in a purer and better form the admirable inductive system which it was the object of Bacon to teach.\\" John Tyndall and William Whewell praised it similarly.

The RPA's main role was overseeing the operation of the Luas system, along with the planning of new Luas and Metro lines for Dublin as laid out under the Irish Government's Capital Investment Plan.

Oneirophrenia is often confused with an acute case of schizophrenia due to the onset of hallucinations. The severity of this condition can range from derealization to complete hallucinations and delusions. Oneirophrenia was described for the first time in the 1950s but was studied more in the 1960s. Although it is still cited in diagnostic manuals of psychiatry, such as DSM-IV and in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), oneirophrenia as a separate entity is out of fashion nowadays. Symptoms Oneirophrenia is often described as a dream-like state that can lead to hallucinations and confusion. Feelings and emotions are often disturbed but information from the senses is left intact separating it from true schizophrenia. Causes Oneirophrenia can result from long periods of sleep deprivation or extreme sensory deprivation. The hallucinations in oneirophrenia are increased or derive under decreased sensory input. Psychoanalysts, such as Claudio Naranjo, in the sixties have described the value of ibogaine-induced oneirophrenia for inducing and manipulating free fantasy and dream-like associations in patients under treatment. It can also be caused by drugs such as ibogaine, which has previously been used to induce the dream like state in some forms of treatment. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= Oneirophenia and schizophrenia are often confused although there are distinct differences between the conditions. Oneirophrenia has some of the characteristics of schizophrenia, such as a confusional state and clouding of consciousness, but without presenting the dissociative symptoms which are typical of that disorder. Oneiophrenia often begins with the inability to focus on things while schizophrenia frequently starts with a traumatic event. Persons affected by oneirophrenia have a feeling of dream-like derealization which, in its extreme form, may progress to delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, it is considered a schizophrenia-like acute form of psychosis which remits in about 60% of cases within a period of two years. It is estimated that 50% or more of schizophrenic patients present oneirophrenia at least once. Treatments Oneirophrenic patients are resistant to insulin and when injected with glucose, these patients take 30 to 50% longer to return to normal glycemia. The meaning of this finding is not known, but it has been hypothesized that it may be due to an insulin antagonist present in the blood during psychosis. However, there is currently no known treatment for oneirophrenia. History Oneirophrenia was studied in the 1950s by the neurologist and psychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna (1896‚Äì1964), also known as the discoverer of one of the forms of shock therapy, using the drug metrazol. Although oneirophrenia was recognized as a specific condition in the 1950s, it was not studied in depth until the 1960s. During its beginning stages oneirophrenia was studied very closely with schizophrenia as an acute form due to the relationship between their symptoms. It wasn't until greater research that oneirophrenia became its own mental disease.

The show returned to CBS Radio only days later, making its longest continued run from January 2, 1950 to October 13, 1967 as a 30-minute show running weekdays at various times. Sponsors included Pillsbury from 1950 to 1952, and Lever Brothers from 1952 to 1956. During its first season, the soundtrack from the TV show was run immediately on radio following the telecast. =Television= Linkletter and Guedel first spun off the format to television with the prime-time ABC show Life with Linkletter, which ran October 6, 1950 to April 25, 1952.McNeil, pp. 480-481 Under the title Art Linkletter's House Party, the show premiered on CBS Television on September 1, 1952 and had become television's longest- running daytime variety show by the time it completed its run on September 5, 1969. The show ran first at 2:45 pm ET for only fifteen minutes, but by February 1953 it aired from 2:30 pm to 3:00 pm ET, remaining in that time slot for 15 years. From 1968 to 1969, the show aired as a morning show titled The Linkletter Show. Linkletter had a similar but unrelated prime-time TV series, The Art Linkletter Show, on NBC television from February 18 to September 16, 1963. Following CBS' cancellation of the daytime TV show, NBC Television revived the old ABC series Life With Linkletter, this time co-hosted by Linkletter and his son Jack Linkletter. This aired on weekday afternoons from December 29, 1969, to September 25, 1970. A new, syndicated version of the show, called House Party with Steve Doocy, ran during 1990.McNeil, pp. 393-394 Synopsis Hosted by Linkletter, House Party featured everything from household hints to hunts for missing heirs. A humorous monologue by Linkletter could be followed by an audience participation quiz to win prizes, musical groups, informal celebrity interviews and guest speakers from assorted walks of life. One popular long running feature of the program was \\"Guess What's In The House\\", a game in which studio audience members would be given clues to the contents of a small model of a split level home placed on a center stage podium. A similar concept was later adapted for the \\"What's Inside The Box\\" segment on the game show \\"Let's Make A Deal\\". Ideas for the show were devised by producer John Guedel and his father, Walter, but Linkletter never used scripts or rehearsed. The show's best-remembered segment was \\"Kids Say the Darndest Things\\", in which Linkletter interviewed schoolchildren between the ages of five and ten. During the segment's 27-year run, Linkletter interviewed an estimated 23,000 children. The popularity of the segment led to a TV series with the same title hosted by Bill Cosby on CBS-TV from January 1998 to June 2000. Books 1957 edition illustrated by Charles Schulz The show's popularity led to the books Kids Say the Darndest Things (Prentice-Hall, 1957) with House Party mentioned in the front cover blurb. It was followed by Kids Still Say the Darndest Things! (Bernard Geis, 1961), both illustrated by Peanuts cartoonist Charles M. Schulz.

Biography Born in Albany, New York, Anthony enlisted in the Army on February 1, 1875 and served two five-year enlistments before joining the Marine Corps at Brooklyn, New York, on July 18, 1885. He served ashore (at the New York Navy Yard) and afloat (in the armored cruiser Brooklyn) before reporting for duty on May 12, 1897 in the Marine guard of the battleship Maine. An explosion rocked Maine as she lay at anchor in Havana Harbor on the night of February 15, 1898. As she began to settle, Private Anthony, who was on watch at the time, hastened immediately forward toward the captain's cabin to inform him of the event. In the darkness, the Marine bumped into Captain Charles D. Sigsbee as the latter groped his way toward the outer hatch of the superstructure. Anthony apologized and made his report \\"that the ship has blown up and is sinking.\\" The two men then proceeded together toward the quarterdeck. \\"The special feature in this case of service performed by Private Anthony,\\" Sigsbee later recounted in a letter to John D. Long, the Secretary of the Navy, \\"is that, on an occasion when a man's instinct would lead him to safety outside the ship, he started into the superstructure and toward the cabin, irrespective of the danger. Maines former captain then recommended that the Marine be promoted to sergeant, which was accomplished on April 14, 1898. Anthony had meanwhile joined the Marine guard of the cruiser Detroit on March 5, 1898 and served in that ship until transferred to duty at the Marine Barracks, New York Navy Yard, on September 10, of that year. Upon expiration of his enlistment, Anthony was honorably discharged at New York on June 26, 1899 with the rank of sergeant major. Anthony died in New York City on November 24, 1899 and was buried at Evergreens Cemetery in Brooklyn five days later. Namesake USS Anthony (DD-172) and USS Anthony (DD-515) were named for him.

Its capital city is Donostia-San Sebasti√°n. Gipuzkoa shares borders with the French department of Pyr√©n√©es- Atlantiques at the northeast, with the province and autonomous community of Navarre at east, Biscay at west, √Ålava at southwest and the Bay of Biscay to its north. It is located at the easternmost extreme of the Cantabric Sea, in the Bay of Biscay. It has of coast land. With a total area of , Gipuzkoa is the smallest province of Spain. The province has 89 municipalities and a population of 720,592 inhabitants (2018), from which more than half live in the Donostia-San Sebasti√°n metropolitan area. Apart from the capital, other important cities are Irun, Errenteria, Zarautz, Mondrag√≥n, Eibar, Hondarribia, O√±ati, Tolosa, Beasain and Pasaia. The oceanic climate gives the province an intense green colour with little thermic oscillation. Gipuzkoa is the province of the Basque Country where the Basque language is most extensively used: 49.1% of the population spoke Basque in 2006.  Etymology  The first recorded name of the province was Ipuscoa in a document from the year 1025. During the following years, and in various documents, several similar names appear, such as Ipuzcoa, Ipu√ßcha, Ipuzka, among others. The full etymology the word Gipuzkoa has not been fully ascertained, but links have been made with the Basque word Giputz, containing the root ip- which is related to the word ipar (north), ipurdi (back) and ipuin (tale). According to this, ipuzko (one of the several first known denominations) might refer to something \\"to the north\\" or \\"in the north\\".  Denominations  = Gipuzkoa = Gipuzkoa is the Basque spelling recommended by the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, and it is commonly used in official documents in that language. The Basque spelling is also mandatory in official texts from the various Spanish public administrations, even in documents written in Spanish. It is the spelling most frequently used by the Spanish-language media in the Basque Country. It is also the spelling used in the Basque version of the Spanish constitution and in the Basque version of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country. Gipuzkoa is also the only official spelling approved for the historical territory by the Juntas Generales of the province. = Guip√∫zcoa = Guip√∫zcoa is the spelling in Spanish, and it has been determined by the Association of Spanish Language Academies as being the only correct use outside official Spanish documents, where the use of the Basque spelling is mandatory.The change in the official Spanish policy regarding the naming of Gipuzkoa dates only from 2011, while the last (and first) edition of the Panhispanic dictionary of doubts dates from 2005. The specific case of the spelling of Guip√∫zcoa is therefore not included. However, the articles for L√©rida and Gerona indicate that this will be the criterion followed for the Guip√∫zcoa article in the edition that is currently under elaboration. It is also the Spanish spelling used in the Spanish version of the Constitution and in the Spanish version of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country. Geography and demographics At Gipuzkoa is the smallest province in Spain. The province has 88 municipalities and 709,607 inhabitants (2011), a quarter of whom live in the capital, San Sebasti√°n. Other important towns are Irun, Errenteria, Zarautz, Arrasate, O√±ati with an old university, Eibar, Tolosa which was the provincial capital for a short time, Beasain, Pasaia, the main port and Hondarribia, an old fort town across from the French Atlantic coast. Gipuzkoa is hilly and green linking mountain and sea, and heavily populated with numerous urban nuclei that dot the whole territory. The conspicuous presence of hills and rugged terrain has added to a special leaning towards hiking, nature and mountains on the part of Gipuzkoans. Some mountains have an emblematic or iconic significance in the local tradition, their summits being topped with crosses, memorials and mountaineer postboxes. In addition, pilgrimages which have gradually lost their former religious zeal and taken on a more secular slant are sometimes held to their summits. Some renowned mountains are Aiako Harria, Hernio, Txindoki, Aizkorri and Izarraitz, amongst others. The Aralar Natural Park is a conservation area on the border of Gipuzkoa and Navarre in the Aralar Range.\\"Aralar Natural Park\\" Guip√∫zcoa Department of Sports and Eternal Activities. Website in English. Accessed 12 November 2013 The rivers of Gipuzkoa are distinctly different from other Bay of Biscay rivers. They arise in the hilly Basque inland landscape (Basque Mountains), flow in a south- north direction, forming close, narrow valleys before joining the ocean. The rivers extend for a short length with only a small fluctuation in the volume of water thanks to the stable rainfall all year round, and they show an abrupt drop between origin and mouth as far as the length of the river is concerned. From west to east the rivers are the Deba, Urola, Oria, Urumea, Oiartzun and Bidasoa. Except for a narrow strip extending east from the hamlet Otzaurte (Zegama) and the tunnel of San Adrian, the province drains its waters to the Atlantic basin. Infrastructure Bay of Biscay, San Sebastian and Hernani in Gipuzkoa San Sebastian and Pasaia flanked at either side by Mounts Jaizkibel and Larrun Aralar, with Aratz and the Aizkorri ridge in the background The region's communication layout is in step with its geographical features, with the main lines of infrastructure along a north -south axis up to recent times along the rivers heading to the ocean. Accordingly, the inland Way of St. James, i.e. the Tunnel Route penetrated the province via Irun and turned south-west along the Oria River towards the provincial limits at the tunnel of San Adrian. This stretch was in operation up to 1765 when the Royal Road moved to the western Deba Valley. A minor St. James route crossed Gipuzkoa east to west along the coast. Currently, the main road cutting through Gipuzkoa largely follows that layout, i.e. the N-1 E-5 from Irun to Donostia and on to Altsasu all along the Oria River for the most part (gateway to Navarre through the pass of Etxegarate). Also, the major Irun-Madrid railway runs close to the river up to its very origin on the slopes of Aizkorri at train stop Otzaurte in Zegama. By 1973 engineering works for the Bilbao-Behobia A-8 E-70 motorway had been completed, with the new road cutting across the valleys east to west and turning into the main axis between Donostia and Bilbao, besides enabling heavy load traffic to access the west and south of Spain as a toll road. The regional railway network Euskotren also follows along the coast from east to west, while it proves impractical for long distance on the grounds of its tortuous layout and as it serves small towns. The railway network reaches the border town Hendaia before it changes to SNCF. Within the Donostialdea region, the Metro Donostialdea provides service. The stretch of the A-15 motorway serving Gipuzkoa and Pamplona opened in 1995 embroiled in controversy under protest and an attack campaign led by ecologists, Basque leftist nationalists and eventually ETA. Conflict resolved after a deal about the definitive layout was struck. In January 2010, following a scheme drawn up by the regional government of Gipuzkoa to improve provisions for the ever-increasing road traffic, the Maltzaga-Urbina AP-1 motorway stretch leading to Gasteiz was completed, providing likewise access to the industrial areas of Arrasate and Bergara, the gateway to √Ålava by village Landa. AP-1 and N-1 E-5 are connected by a highway east to west from Bergara and Beasain. European traffic to south of Spain avoids Donostia's metropolitan area by means of the southern outer road ring. The AVE high-speed rail is currently under construction, with an Y-type layout and links to the SNCF network in Hendaia (NE), Vitoria (SE), Bilbao (W) and Pamplona (S) to be completeted by 2022. Contractors were appointed, works are in place although past schedule, while strong opposition (ecologists, Basque leftist nationalists,...) and serious financial tensions made its future uncertain. The only airport in Gipuzkoa serving just domestic flights is the San Sebastian Airport located in Hondarribia, while the air transportation needs are usually served by the nearby Bilbao and Biarritz airports. Cultural traits Gipuzkera, a dialect of the Basque language spoken in most of the region, shows a considerable vitality and holds a prominent position among other dialects. The Basque cultural element is apparent, including traditional dances and singing, bertsolaritza, trikiti and txistu music, baserris dotting the rural landscape, town festivals, and its signature heavy sculptures (stone, steel, iron) from the industrial tradition, all blending with the latest Basque, Spanish and international pop culture events and design trends centred in major urban areas (Donostia, Tolosa, etc.). Traditionally a Catholic province, its patron saints are Ignatius of Loyola, born in the neighborhood of Loyola (Azpeitia) and founder of the Society of Jesus, and Our Lady of Arantzazu. The region has produced many famous Basque athletes for example: Jose Maria Olazabal (golfer), Jos√© √Ångel Iribar and Xabi Alonso (footballers), Abraham Olano and Domingo Perurena (cyclists), Edurne Pasaban and Alberto I√±urrategi (mountaineers), I√±aki Urdangarin (handball player), Maite Z√∫√±iga (runner) and Paulino Uzcudun (boxer).

He was one of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina's most important predecessors and possibly his mentor. As ' of St Philip Neri's Oratory and the Capella Giulia at St Peter's, he was composing music at the very center of the Roman Catholic Church, during the turbulent reforms of the Counter-Reformation and as part of the new movements that began to flourish around the middle of the century. His music reflects these changes. Early life: Florence Animuccia was born in Florence around the beginning of the 16th century. The exact date is variously given as the end of the 15th century, , , and . His brother Paolo Animuccia was also a celebrated composer. However, little is known about their training and work during this period. Giovanni's first and second book of madrigals show similarities with, and may have been modeled on, the music of his slightly older contemporary Francesco Corteccia, court composer to Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. Animuccia and Corteccia were the only significant composers writing madrigals in Florence at the time and both composers published books of madrigals around 1547. (Animuccia's '‚ÄîMadrigals and Motets for Four and Five Voices‚Äîwas published at Venice in 1548.) Animuccia's name is also mentioned in association with Florentine literary circles, suggesting that he was involved with cultural life in Florence.Nosow, The Debate on Song in the Accademia Fiorentina, p. 210 Animuccia's second book of madrigals was published in 1551 after his arrival in Rome. Rome After his arrival in Rome in 1550, Animuccia was employed by Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza. Early on, through his association with Florentine circles (in particular the exiled Altoviti family), Animuccia met his fellow Florentine St Phillip Neri. =Music for the oratory= St Phillip Neri founded a religious congregation called the Oratory. The Oratory began in the early 1550s as small and informal meetings for religious discussion and prayer; these meetings soon began to attract large numbers of people.Smither, A History of the Oratorio, p. 42 In 1558, when Phillip obtained a larger room to hold the meetings in, the practice of singing of laudi spirituali was introduced. Singing laudi was a popular practice in Florence following the legacy of Girolamo Savonarola who strongly encouraged its use, and it is natural therefore that Phillip would incorporate this practice into his meetings.Wilson, Lauda. Grove Music Online. Although the precise date is unknown, Animuccia was involved with music for these meetings from early on and remained ' of the Oratory until his death. Neri was so pleased with Animuccia that he said he had \\"seen [his] soul... fly upwards towards heaven\\". The Oratory was able to attract many musicians who volunteered their services; this included the famous singer Francesco Soto de Langa from the Capella Sistina, the composer Palestrina, and probably the composer Tom√°s Luis de Victoria who lived in the same house as St. Phillip Neri for five years.Smither, A History of the Oratorio, pp. 56-57 Animuccia published two books of laudi for use in the Oratory in 1563 and 1570. His work formed the basis of the oratorios that did not descend from the polyphonic Gregorian \\"Passions\\". Animuccia's Florentine influence is evident as some of his texts originate from Florence.Smither, A History of the Oratorio, p. 57. Stylistically the two books are rather different. Animuccia's first book contains simple settings of Italian laudi which are homophonic throughout, and were probably sung by amateur singers as part of Phillip Neri's early devotional meetings.Lockwood, The Counter Reformation, p. 197. The music in Animuccia's second book of laudi is much more madrigal-like;Smither, A History of the Oratorio, p. 70 he uses a greater variety of textures, sonorities, and languages (Latin and Italian). His reasons for the change in style are stated in his dedication: > The oratory having increased, by the grace of God, with the coming together > of prelates and of most important gentlemen, it seemed to me fitting in this > second book to increase the harmony and the combination of parts, varying > the music in diverse ways, now setting it to Latin words and now to the > vernacular, sometimes with a greater number of voices and sometimes with > fewer, with verses now of one kind and now of another, concerning myself as > little as possible with imitations and complexities, in order not to obscure > the understanding of the words. By this time, the number of people attending the Oratory had increased significantly, and Animuccia wished to offer more complex music to \\"woo influential people through music into churches.\\" Effects of the Counter- Reformation on Animuccia's music Animuccia was employed as the ' of the Capella Giulia at St. Peter's Basilica on the Vatican from January 1555, following Palestrina's promotion by Pope Julius III to the Capella Sistina.Steele, Animuccia's response to the events of 1564, p. 6 Animuccia's most important composition for this period was his ' (; 1567). The importance of this book of Masses is due to the fact that its style of composition was directly affected by the liturgical reforms that took place at the Council of Trent through the influence of the Reform Commission in Rome. He held the office until his death at Rome in 1571, succeeded by Palestrina who was his friend and probably his pupil. =The Council of Trent and the Reform Commission= The final session of the Council of Trent closed in 1563. One of the primary concerns of the council in its latter stages was the reform of the liturgy, in particular the reform of ‚Äòabuses of the Mass‚Äô.Monson, The Council of Trent Revisited, p. 5. To carry out the Council's recommendations in Rome, a Reform Commission was set up, headed up by Cardinals Carlo Borromeo and Vitellozzo Vitelli.Lockwood, Counter Reformation, p. 86 The main issues that Cardinals Borromeo and Vitelli sought to address regarding music were ‚Äòintelligibility‚Äô (i.e., that Masses should be composed so words could be clearly understood) and the use of secular music in Mass settings. In 1565, the diary of the papal chapel choir recorded that Cardinal Vitelli requested that the choir assemble at his house for a private test of some Mass settings to see whether the words could be understood.Lockwood, Counter Reformation. p. 87 =Animuccia‚Äôs response= Animuccia, as ' of the Capella Giulia, would no doubt have been aware of this test; it is unsurprising therefore that in 1566 there is a record of him being paid \\"for the composition of five masses [written] according to the requirements of the Council [of Trent].\\" Animuccia's ' was published at Rome a year later. In his dedication he writes: > ‚Ä¶I have sought to adorn these divine praises of God in such a way that the > music may disturb the hearing of the text as little as possible, but > nevertheless in such a way that it may not be entirely devoid of artifice > and may contribute in some measure to the listener‚Äôs pleasure.Lockwood, > Counter Reformation, p. 196 All the Masses are freely composed plainsong paraphrases - which fulfills the requirement of the eradication of secular influences. Animuccia's presentation of an ‚Äòintelligible‚Äô style is only evident in the Gloria and the Credo,Steele, Animuccia's response. p. 7 and even here he seems reluctant to strip all ‚Äòartifice‚Äô from the music. Instead he alternates homophonic phrases with polyphonic phrases. In his book of Masses Animuccia is consciously trying to compose music that reconciles, as he sees it, the two polarities in this issue of composing ‚Äòintelligible‚Äô music: that of making the text audible, yet at the same time sounding beautiful ‚Äì therefore fulfilling the music's most important function of drawing the listener deeper into prayer and closer to God. Other significant stylistic features of Animuccia's composition style include variations in vocal textures and color by varying voice groupings, and instances of word painting.Steele, Animuccia's response. p. 9-10 Other works composed by Animuccia in this period include some madrigali spirituali (1565) and a collection of hymns, motets, Masses and Magnificats (1568). Legacy The stylistic features described in Animuccia's masses and laudi can be seen as antecedent to the way choral music would develop from the end of the 16th century into the 17th century. In particular his use of different voice groupings can be seen as a very early example of the polychoral technique (')Carver, Chori Spezzati, p. 107 which became very popular in Rome shortly after Animuccia's death.Carter, Music in Late Renaissance & Early Baroque Italy, p. 109 Although Animuccia's contribution to liturgical musical at this time was soon eclipsed by choral works of his contemporaries Palestrina and Victoria, his music remains an important example as to one of the ways in which a composer sought to deal with the issues which arose after the Council of Trent. As well as this, his significant contribution to the early musical life of the Oratory set precedence for future developments of music written for this setting, which would eventually include the development of the oratorio.

In 2007 it had a population of 16, but with the expansion of the area with the new apartments above the old settlement the population has increased to 55 in 2013.  General  √Ånir lies about 3 km north of the northern isles' capital Klaksv√≠k on the west coast of Bor√∞oy and was founded in 1840, as the increasing population demanded more land for cultivation.http://www.faroeislands.dk/pages/AnirIndex.htm Facing the village is the southern tip of the island of Kunoy. The road through √Ånir continues to Strond and then crosses the causeway to the island of Kunoy to continue to the villages of Haraldssund and Kunoy. High over √Ånir is the entrance of a road tunnel to √Årnafj√∏r√∞ur and on to the island of Vi√∞oy. As of 1 January 2007 √Ånir had 16 inhabitants, in 2013 it had 55 inhabitants. Its Postal Code is FO-726. It belongs to the Municipality of Klaksv√≠k. There are two streets: the four houses of the original village are at the main road to Kunoy (√Ånavegur)√Ånavegur N¬∞ 136, 138, 140 and 142, see http://www.kortal.fo/ and 15 modern villas have been built in 2009 at a new road called Edmundstr√∏√∞ (N¬∞ 1-28).Edmundstr√∏√∞ 1 is an older houses, close to the main road. The new villas are at Edmundstr√∏√∞ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28), see http://www.kortal.fo/ The Faroese word √°nir is a rare variant of v√°nir and means 'forecasts, prospects, hopes'.  Swallowed by Klaksv√≠k?  The old settlement of √Ånir consists of just the small cluster of houses shown in the images in this article. This tranquil and more or less picturesque aspect of √Ånir was lost when in 2005 the new freight harbour of Klaksv√≠k (also called the √Ånir Cargo Terminal or Nor√∞havnin) was built right in front of the settlement. This harbour has 200 metres of quayside, 12 m deep, with 30,000 sqm of storage area for containers, a cold storage facility and a 30 m wide roll-on/roll-off ramp.http://www.annualbusinessreport.com/abr07/072-073.pdf Additionally, a real estate development involving the construction of 15 modern villas on Edmundstr√∏√∞ at √Ånir's entrance has affected the visual aspect of the village. It could be argued that √Ånir has been sacrificed for the growth of Klaksv√≠k and has become part of Klaksv√≠k's outskirts. Today the \\"old √Ånir\\" looks half-abandoned and out of place in its current setting, with broken down cars parked haphazardly and rubbish lying around. There are no shops or other facilities. The extension of Klaksv√≠k's port in recent years is a direct consequence of the opening in 2006 of a sub-sea road tunnel between Bor√∞oy and the Faroe's main islands. This tunnel has generated new economic opportunities for Klaksv√≠k.http://www.klaksvik.fo/index.asp?pID={09A4228D-F2C6-4F50-84C8-290B2EDA96E4} The Port of Klaksv√≠k recently signed a contract with Smyril Line on the use of √Ånir as an alternative terminal for the ferry Norr√∂na.

The first flight took place in May 1941. It was given the Allied reporting name \\"Irving\\", since the earlier reconnaissance version the J1N1-C, was mistaken for a fighter. Design and development In mid-1938 the Japanese Imperial Navy requested a twin-engine fighter designed to escort the principal bomber used at the time, Mitsubishi G3M \\"Nell\\". The operating range of the standard Navy fighter, the Mitsubishi A5M \\"Claude\\", was only 1,200 km (750 mi), insufficient compared with the 4,400 km (2,730 mi) of the G3M. Moreover, at the time, the potential of the \\"Zero\\", then still under development, remained to be evaluated, stressing the need for a long-range escort fighter, much as the Luftwaffe had done with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 Zerst√∂rer, introduced the year before. In March 1939, Mitsubishi and Nakajima began the development of a project 13-Shi. The prototype left the factory in March 1941 equipped with two 843 kW (1,130 hp) Nakajima Sakae 21/22, 14-cylinder radial engines. There was a crew of three, and the aircraft was armed with a 20 mm Type 99 cannon and six 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 97 aircraft machine guns. Four of these machine guns were mounted in two rear-mounted powered turrets, the weight of which reduced the performance of the aircraft considerably. Because of the sluggish handling, being used as an escort fighter had to be abandoned. Instead, production was authorized for a lighter reconnaissance variant, the J1N1-C, also known by the Navy designation Navy Type 2 Reconnaissance Plane. One early variant, the J1N1-F, had a spherical turret with one 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannon mounted immediately behind the pilot. Operation history Commander Yasuna Kozono (left), Rabaul 1943. In early 1943, Commander Yasuna KozonoÔºàÂ∞èÂúí ÂÆâÂêç of the 251st K≈çk≈´tai in Rabaul came up with the idea of installing 20 mm cannons, firing upwards at a 30-degree angle in the fuselage. Against orders of central command, which was skeptical of his idea, he tested his idea on a J1N1-C as a night fighter. The field-modified J1N1-C KAI shot down two B-17s of 43rd Bomb Group attacking air bases around Rabaul on 21 May 1943. The Navy took immediate notice and placed orders with Nakajima for the newly designated J1N1-S nightfighter design. This model was christened the Model 11 Gekk≈ç (ÊúàÂÖâ, \\"Moonlight\\"). It had a crew of two, eliminating the navigator position. Like the KAI, it had twin 20 mm Type 99 Model 1 cannon firing upward in a 30¬∞ upward angle, but added a second pair firing downward at a forward 30¬∞ angle, allowing attacks from above or below. This arrangement was effective against B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and B-24 Liberators, which usually had Sperry ball turrets for ventral defense. The Gekk≈ç's existence was not quickly understood by the Allies, who assumed the Japanese did not have the technology for night fighter designs. Early versions had nose searchlights in place of radar. Later models, the J1N1-Sa Model 11a, omitted the two downward-firing guns and added another 20 mm cannon to face upward as with the other two. Other variants without nose antennae or searchlight added a 20 mm cannon to the nose. The J1N1-S was used against B-29 Superfortresses in Japan, though the lack of good radar and insufficient high-altitude performance handicapped it, since usually only one pass could be made against the higher-speed B-29s. However, some skillful pilots had spectacular successes, such as Lieutenant Sachio Endo, who was credited with destroying eight B-29s and damaging another eight before he was shot down by a B-29 crew, Shigetoshi Kudo (nine victories), Shiro Kuratori (six victories), and Juzo Kuramoto (eight victories); the last two claimed five B-29s during the night of 25‚Äì26 May 1945. Another Gekk≈ç crew shot down five B-29's in one night, but these successes were rare. Many Gekk≈ç's were also shot down or destroyed on the ground. A number of Gekk≈ç's were relegated to kamikaze attacks, using 250 kg (550 lb) bombs attached to the wings.

Surviving aircraft Only one J1N1-S Gekk≈ç survives today. Following the occupation of the home islands, U.S. forces gathered 145 interesting Japanese aircraft and sent them to the United States aboard three aircraft carriers. Four Gekk≈ç's were in this group: three captured at Atsugi and one from Yokosuka. Serial Number 7334, the aircraft from Yokosuka, was given Foreign Equipment number FE 3031 (later changed to T2-N700). Records show that after arriving aboard the , air intelligence officials assigned Gekk≈ç 7334 to Langley Field, Virginia, on 8 December 1945. The airplane was moved to the Air Materiel Depot at Middletown, Pennsylvania, on 23 January 1946. The Maintenance Division at Middletown prepared the Gekk≈ç for flight tests, overhauling the plane's engines (the same make/model as the Zero had used) and replacing the oxygen system, radios, and some flight instruments with American equipment. Mechanics completed this work by 9 April. The Navy transferred Gekk≈ç 7334 to the Army in early June, and an army pilot flew the Gekk≈ç on 15 June 1946, for about 35 minutes. At least one other test flight took place before the Army Air Forces flew the fighter to an empty former Douglas C-54 factory at Park Ridge, Illinois, for storage. The remaining three Gekk≈çs were scrapped. In 1949, the Gekk≈ç was given to the Smithsonian's National Air Museum, but remained in storage at Park Ridge, Illinois. The collection of museum aircraft at Park Ridge numbered more than 60 airplanes when the war in Korea forced the United States Air Force to move it to the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, Maryland. Gekk≈ç 7334 was dumped outside the restoration facility in a large shipping crate in 1953 where it remained until building space became available in 1974. In 1979, NASM staff selected Gekk≈ç 7334 for restoration. Following restoration of the museum's Mitsubishi Zero in 1976, the Gekk≈ç became the second Japanese aircraft to be restored by NASM. The airframe was found to be seriously corroded from being outside for twenty years. At that time, it was the largest and most complex aircraft restoration project the NASM had undertaken. Work started on 7 September 1979, and ended 14 December 1983, following 17,000 hours of work. Today, Gekk≈ç 7334 is fully restored and on display in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, US. Specifications (J1N1-S) See also References =Notes= =Bibliography= * * Francillon, Ren√© J. Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War.

Strathbungo lay just inside Govan parish, on its boundary with Cathcart parish, and at one time a line just north of Allison Street and Nithsdale Street formed the boundary or 'march' between the counties of Lanark and Renfrew. The feudal superiors, the Maxwells of Pollok, preferred the name Marchtown. This name is seen on some old maps, and survives in March Street. Etymology The words 'Strathbungo Cross' appear on a tenement at the corner of Allison Street and Pollokshaws Road, but no satisfactory explanation has ever been given for the name Strathbungo, as 'Strath' (from Scottish Gaelic: Srath) is normally a prefix for a wide river valley. However, there is no river Bungo. \\"Bungo\\" may represent a nasalisation of Mungo, the patron saint of Glasgow, from Srath Mhungain. Development Strathbungo developed as a crofters and miners village in the early 18th century. By the end of that century, over 35 families were living in the village and weaving had become the principal occupation. 1859 and 1860 are the dates of the feuing dispositions granted by Sir John Maxwell of Pollok to the builder John McIntyre and quarrier William Stevenson for the development of the new Strathbungo. 1-10 Moray Place was the first block to be built in the new Strathbungo, to the designs of Alexander ‚ÄòGreek‚Äô Thomson that set the path for Stratbungo to develop as a residential suburb of Glasgow, linked by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway. Thomson lived in the house that he designed at No 1 Moray Place and died there in 1875. The other terraces (named, as was Moray Place, after the protagonists in the Battle of Langside fought nearby), Regent Park Square, Queen Square and Princes Square (later renamed Marywood Square), were built from 1862 to 1880, to form a desirable residential suburb. In the 1890s, the first winner of the posthumous Alexander Thomson Medal, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, lived at 27 Regent Park Square. Strathbungo was later extended in 1928-9 to include the red sandstone terraces of Vennard, Thorncliffe and Carswell Gardens. Strathbungo was designated a conservation area in 1973, although the Gardens were later removed and the area extended to include Nithsdale Street and Drive. In Alexander Thomson's death notice published in the Glasgow Herald of 23 March 1875, his place of death is described as \\"1, Moray Place, Regent Park\\" with no reference to Strathbungo; the residential suburb was initially styled Regent Park, although the area was always more widely known as Strathbungo. By the 1860s tenement buildings had started to appear, and the last of the original village buildings were lost in the 1890s. The village never achieved burgh status and was annexed to Glasgow in 1891. Strathbungo railway station opened on 1 December 1877, and closed on 28 May 1962. Conservation The Strathbungo Society helps promote the preservation of the Strathbungo Conservation Area and organises events for local people like 'Bungo at the Bells' at the New Year and the 'Bungo in the Back Lanes' event in June each year which was originally set up to help get people into the lanes in Strathbungo and to highlight the need for the refurbishment of them.

More generally there is a similar Weil pairing between points of order n of an abelian variety and its dual. It was introduced by Andr√© Weil (1940) for Jacobians of curves, who gave an abstract algebraic definition; the corresponding results for elliptic functions were known, and can be expressed simply by use of the Weierstrass sigma function. Formulation Choose an elliptic curve E defined over a field K, and an integer n > 0 (we require n to be prime to char(K) if char(K) > 0) such that K contains a primitive nth root of unity. Then the n-torsion on E(\\\\overline{K}) is known to be a Cartesian product of two cyclic groups of order n. The Weil pairing produces an n-th root of unity :w(P,Q) \\\\in \\\\mu_n by means of Kummer theory, for any two points P,Q \\\\in E(K)[n], where E(K)[n]=\\\\\\\\{T \\\\in E(K) \\\\mid n \\\\cdot T = O \\\\\\\\} and \\\\mu_n = \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in K \\\\mid x^n =1 \\\\\\\\} . A down-to-earth construction of the Weil pairing is as follows. Choose a function F in the function field of E over the algebraic closure of K with divisor : \\\\mathrm{div}(F)= \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq k < n}[P+k\\\\cdot Q] - \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq k < n} [k\\\\cdot Q]. So F has a simple zero at each point P + kQ, and a simple pole at each point kQ if these points are all distinct. Then F is well-defined up to multiplication by a constant. If G is the translation of F by Q, then by construction G has the same divisor, so the function G/F is constant. Therefore if we define : w(P,Q):=\\\\frac{G}{F} we shall have an n-th root of unity (as translating n times must give 1) other than 1. With this definition it can be shown that w is alternating and bilinear, giving rise to a non- degenerate pairing on the n-torsion. The Weil pairing does not extend to a pairing on all the torsion points (the direct limit of n-torsion points) because the pairings for different n are not the same. However they do fit together to give a pairing T‚Ñì(E) √ó T‚Ñì(E) ‚Üí T‚Ñì(Œº) on the Tate module T‚Ñì(E) of the elliptic curve E (the inverse limit of the ‚Ñìn-torsion points) to the Tate module T‚Ñì(Œº) of the multiplicative group (the inverse limit of ‚Ñìn roots of unity). Generalisation to abelian varieties For abelian varieties over an algebraically closed field K, the Weil pairing is a nondegenerate pairing :A[n] \\\\times A^\\\\vee[n] \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mu_n for all n prime to the characteristic of K.James Milne, Abelian Varieties, available at www.jmilne.org/math/ Here A^\\\\vee denotes the dual abelian variety of A. This is the so-called Weil pairing for higher dimensions. If A is equipped with a polarisation :\\\\lambda: A \\\\longrightarrow A^\\\\vee, then composition gives a (possibly degenerate) pairing :A[n] \\\\times A[n] \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mu_n. If C is a projective, nonsingular curve of genus ‚â• 0 over k, and J its Jacobian, then the theta-divisor of J induces a principal polarisation of J, which in this particular case happens to be an isomorphism (see autoduality of Jacobians). Hence, composing the Weil pairing for J with the polarisation gives a nondegenerate pairing : J[n]\\\\times J[n] \\\\longrightarrow \\\\mu_n for all n prime to the characteristic of k. As in the case of elliptic curves, explicit formulae for this pairing can be given in terms of divisors of C. Applications The pairing is used in number theory and algebraic geometry, and has also been applied in elliptic curve cryptography and identity based encryption.

Early life Burns was born at Queen's Creek, near Swansboro, North Carolina. He became a seaman after learning the trade at the ports in Swansboro and Beaufort, a nearby town situated in Carteret County. After acquiring the skills needed to become a merchant captain, Burns sailed along the East Coast of the United States, all the way north up to Maine. After his voyage, he married his cousin, Joanna Grant, on July 6, 1809. The next year, the couple moved to Swansboro. There, Joanna gave birth to Owen, the couple's only child. Burns received financial support for his trading activities from Edward Pasteur, a physician and local political leader from New Bern. In the summer of 1812, just a month after the War of 1812 had commenced, Burns and Pasteur purchased a vessel in New York City for eight thousand US dollars, which Burns intended to use for privateering along the coast of The Carolinas.Hunter, p. 76. The 147-ton vessel, named Zephyr, had been constructed four years earlier on the West River in Maryland. Zephyr measured from bow (ship) to stern, had a beam of and a depth of almost . The vessel was armed with one pivot gun and between five and seven gun carriages. Also on board were a number of small arms: cutlasses, pistols, muskets, boarding pikes, pickaxes and blunderbusses. After rechristening the vessel as Snap Dragon, Burns and Pasteur obtained official letters of marque for the vessel in New York on August 27, 1812. After sailing back to New Bern, the men sold their 50 shares in the ship at a price of US$260 per share to eight other investors from New Bern, Tarboro and Edenton. Privateering career Pasteur and Burns, on Snap Dragon, headed to New Bern to recruit men to join the vessel's crew. To their surprise, some of New Bern's political leaders treated privateering like piracy, and they tried to complicate matters for the two privateers. The leaders convinced new recruits to borrow money, upon which, they would be arrested for their debt. Burns twice retaliated against the politicians.Hunter, p. 77. In one incident, the crew of Snap Dragon sank a boat with constables who were planning on boarding the ship. Subsequently, a local attorney labeled the vessel as a \\"licensed robber\\". Burns responded by rowing to land and throwing the lawyer into a river.In the retelling of the incident, the name of the river is not specified. It can be assumed from New Bern's geographic location that Burns threw the attorney in either the Trent or Neuse River. With a 25-man crew, Burns left New Bern for Norfolk, Virginia. On October 14, 1812, Snap Dragon and another vessel, Revenge, sailed south. The vessels separated a week later. Snap Dragon encountered success early in the cruise. In one situation, she outran a British frigate and sloop. A few days later, Snap Dragon captured its first prize, a British merchant ship armed with 14 guns. Soon after, Burns and Pasteur led the vessel to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. To fool enemy British ships, they disguised Snap Dragon as a merchant ship by putting up old, ragged sails and moving the guns out of view. Snap Dragon ran into five British men of war. One of the ships, the frigate , fired a warning shot and signaled the other ships to chase down Snap Dragon.Hunter, p. 78. For over two hours, Burns led Snap Dragon away from danger, toward Ship Rock passage, which unknowingly, was blocked by two British brigs. immediately launched an attack on Snap Dragon. Burns told his crew to lie down on the deck while the vessel was being fired upon. Fortunately, Burns was able to command the vessel away from the British ships, unscathed.Bryan, p411.Niles' Weekly Register (Baltimore, Maryland), September 4, 1813. The next morning, Burns and his crew encountered , another British man of war, but again they successfully escaped. The crew of Snap Dragon made their way to St. Croix, where they made \\"several small captures\\" of coastal traders. Burns commanded Snap Dragon on her next two cruises, during which he had several encounters with British men-of-war and took numerous prizes. Life after privateering Months before he completed his third cruise in 1814, Burns' wife Joanna and son Owen left him to live with relatives in Jones County. In September, Joanna died, leaving her son in the custody of her family for five years before Burns obtained legal guardianship over Owen. Three months later, Burns married Jane Hall, a 20-year-old from Beaufort, North Carolina. In April 1815, Burns purchased a property in Beaufort, on which he built a house, that would be his family's residence for the next 20 years. =Business= From the wealth he gained from privateering, Burns became a shipbuilder at Swansboro, North Carolina and made investments in local businesses. In 1818, he built Prometheus at his shipyard in Swansboro near the mouth of the White Oak River (NC Historical Marker #54), the first steamboat in North Carolina, which operated on the Cape Fear River. In 1823, he built Warrior in Beaufort, followed by the brig Henry, eight years later.Hunter, p. 90. During much of the 1820s, he managed a store and taproom on his Beaufort property, and also had a partnership in a Taylor's Creek salt distribution company. Burns possessed a number of vessels, such as a schooner, seiner, sailboat and a mullet boat. Among other things, he also co-owned brick kilns used by the federal government to build Fort Macon, in the largest public works project in the history of the area, and enslaved 11 people, whose forced labor was used for his businesses and on his plantation in Carteret County. =Political career= Burns' political career started with his 1821 election to represent Carteret County in the North Carolina House of Commons and his appointment to serve as the commissioner of a local canal connecting Neuse and Newport Rivers. He served 11 terms in the legislature ‚Äî seven in the House of Representatives and four in the Senate ‚Äî over a course of 14 years.Hunter, p. 91. =Later life= In 1835 President Andrew Jackson appointed him keeper of the Brant Island Shoal Light, a position he held until his death. He is buried in the Old Burying Ground at Beaufort. Legacy Two destroyers have been named in his honor: and , in service during World War I and II, respectively. In 1834, Burnsville, North Carolina was founded and named in his honor. A statue of him was placed in the town square in 1909. The town of Otway, in Carteret County, North Carolina, is also named for him.

Under this conception competitive professionals, such as athletes and artists, are required to endure pain (physical suffering) and stress (mental/emotional suffering) to achieve professional excellence. Medical experts agree that the proverb is wrong for exercise. Exercise motto It came into prominence after 1982 when actress Jane Fonda began to produce a series of aerobics workout videos. In these videos, Fonda would use \\"No pain, no gain\\" and \\"Feel the burn\\" as catchphrases for the concept of working out past the point of experiencing muscle aches. It expresses the belief that solid large muscle is the result of training hard. Delayed onset muscle soreness is often used as a measure of the effectiveness of a workout.https://theconversation.com/mondays-medical-myth-no-pain-no- gain-12298 In terms of the expression used for development, the discomfort caused may be beneficial in some instances while detrimental in others. Detrimental pain can include joint pain. Beneficial pain usually refers to that resulting from tearing microscopic muscle fibers, which will be rebuilt more densely, making a bigger muscle. The expression has been adopted in a variety of sports and fitness activities, beginning in 1982 to present day. David B. Morris wrote in The Scientist in 2005, \\"'No pain, no gain' is an American modern mini-narrative: it compresses the story of a protagonist who understands that the road to achievement runs only through hardship.\\" The concept has been described as being a modern form of Puritanism. Origin A form of this expression is found in the beginning of the second century, written in The Ethics of the Fathers 5:21 (known in Hebrew as Pirkei Avot): This is interpreted to be a spiritual lesson; without the pain in doing what God commands, there is no spiritual gain. One of the earliest attestations of the phrase comes from the poet Robert Herrick in his \\"Hesperides\\". In the 1650 edition, a two-line poem was added: A version of the phrase was crafted by Benjamin Franklin, in his persona of Poor Richard (1734), to illustrate the axiom \\"God helps those who help themselves\\": In the phrase, Franklin central thesis was that everyone should exercise 45 minutes each day.

Clunch is a traditional building material of chalky limestone rock used mainly in eastern England and Normandy. Clunch distinguishes itself from archetypal forms of limestone by being softer in character when cut, such as resembling chalk in lower density, or with minor clay-like components. Use It has been used in a wide variety of shapes such as irregular lumps picked from the topsoil of certain fields, or more commonly blocks quarried by being cut from the bedrock in regular-shaped (ashlar) building blocks. If in the first form it can be bedded in a ramshackle manner (as rubble masonry); if in the second then laid in courses. In either case, mortar is often used between stones to form walls. Properties The stone is a chalk from the Lower Chalk of the Cretaceous age, the period of geological time approximately 145 ‚Äì 66 million years ago. It is greyish-white to light beige in colour, often with a greenish tinge. The latter is due to the presence of glauconite, the potassium and iron aluminium silicate mineral that is also found in Kentish Ragstone. The stone has a gritty texture due to the frequent presence of shell fossils. This stone has been quarried at Totternhoe Quarry in Dunstable, Bedfordshire by H. G. Clarke & Son since 1920.H. G. Clarke and Son It is particularly soft when quarried and subject to chemical and wind erosion as exposed material, i.e. when unrendered in paint, stucco or cement. It can be cut by a saw when in its softer state; when it has been quarried out of the ground it still contains a large amount of water. When the stone dries out it becomes harder, and is not as easy to cut. Clunch is generically a soft limestone. It can be rich in iron-bearing clays or be very fine and white -- in effect just chalk. It is used in various parts of East Anglia, where more durable stone is uncommon, and can be seen frequently in and around Thetford -- mostly now for property boundary walls where not a long-lasting material, but it is also used for some building walls, especially in traditional agricultural buildings. In Ely Cathedral it can be seen in some interior locations. The nearby village of Burwell has its civil parish magazine named after the building material. It is found in the village of Seale in Surrey and in Farnham.Guildford Borough Council Advisory Leaflet Inferior meaning The term has been sometimes used more generically, in other parts of England for any soft and aggregate-based vernacular building stone which has been used as a cheaper, inferior substitute for stronger stone.

A strategic authority, with responsibilities for roads, public transport, planning, emergency services and waste disposal, it was composed of 106 directly elected members drawn from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester. The Greater Manchester County Council shared power with ten lower-tier district councils, each of which directed local matters. It was also known as the Greater Manchester Council (GMC) and the Greater Manchester Metropolitan County Council (GMMCC). Established with reference to the Local Government Act 1972, elections in 1973 brought about the county council's launch as a shadow authority, several months before Greater Manchester (its zone of influence) was officially created on 1 April 1974. The Greater Manchester County Council operated from its County Hall headquarters on Portland Street in central Manchester, until it was abolished 31 March 1986, following the Local Government Act 1985. Its powers were passed to the ten district councils of Greater Manchester, which had shared power with the GMCC. Some powers of the county council were restored when the district councils delegated strategic responsibilities (such as emergency services and public transport) to the county-wide Association of Greater Manchester Authorities and joint boards. History =Creation= The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non- metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country. Retrieved on 21 February 2008. The act formally established Greater Manchester as a metropolitan county on 1 April 1974, although Greater Manchester County Council (GMCC) had been running since elections in 1973. retrieved on 5 March 2008. The leading article in The Times on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the \\"new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively\\". =Operational history= Map of the region administered by Greater Manchester County Council, showing 10 metropolitan districts and the former pre-1972 urban districts Werneth Low was one of several rural areas which became a country park under the governance of the Greater Manchester County Council. The G-Mex centre, established by the GMC in 1986 By January 1974, a joint working party representing Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out strategic and long-term objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county.Frangopulo (1977), p. 246. The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by way of improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation‚Äîmuch of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century industrial growth, and was unsuited to modern communication systems and life-styles.. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in the county's country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure and recreational facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and journey to work patterns.Frangopulo (1977), pp. 246‚Äì255. The council built County Hall on Portland Street in Manchester city centre at the cost of ¬£4.5 million (¬£ as of ), which served as its headquarters. The building is now known as Westminster House. Because of political objection, particularly from Cheshire, Greater Manchester covered only the inner, urban 62 of the 90 former districts that the Royal Commission had outlined as an effective administrative metropolitan area.. In this capacity, GMCC found itself \\"planning for an arbitrary metropolitan area ... abruptly truncated to the south\\", and so had to negotiate several land-use, transport and housing projects with its neighbouring county councils. However a \\"major programme of environmental action\\" by GMCC broadly succeeded in reversing social deprevation in its inner city slums. Leisure and recreational successes included the Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded Manchester Central), a converted former railway station in Manchester city centre used for cultural events,Parkinson-Bailey (2000), pp. 214‚Äì5. and GMCC's creation of five new country parks within its boundaries.. Greater Manchester Transport was established from the former SELNEC PTE to operate the county's public transport. GMCC was, however, criticised for being too Manchester-centric by representatives from the outer suburbs.. =Abolition= A decade after they were established, the mostly Labour-controlled metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council (GLC) had several high-profile clashes with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, with regards overspending and high rates charging. Government policy on the issue was considered throughout 1982, and the Conservative Party put a \\"promise to scrap the metropolitan county councils\\" and the GLC, in their manifesto for the 1983 general election.. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Greater Manchester County Council was abolished on 31 March 1986 under the Local Government Act 1985. That the metropolitan county councils were controlled by the Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of the National Association of Local Government Officers described it as a \\"completely cynical manoeuvre\\". Most of the functions of GMCC were devolved to the ten Greater Manchester metropolitan district councils, though some functions such as emergency services and public transport were taken over by joint boards and continued to be run on a county-wide basis.. The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) was established to continue much of the county-wide services of the county council. Retrieved on 5 March 2008. The metropolitan county continued to exist in law, and as a geographic frame of reference, for example as a NUTS 2 administrative division for statistical purposes within the European Union. Retrieved on 17 February 2007. =Aftermath= Although the metropolitan county council was abolished in 1986, the county area continues to exist, for Parliamentary representation, in mapping, and especially for statistical purposes. The county continues to exist today as both a legal and geographic entity, ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ and has its own Lord Lieutenant (the Monarch's representative in a county) and High Sheriff. The GMC County Hall in Portland Street, Manchester, was sold to Parc Securities in 1988 for an undisclosed sum, believed to be between ¬£5 and ¬£6 million, and refurbished for offices. County Hall Properties bought the structure from Parc two years later and renamed it Westminster House, alluding to the government that abolished the Greater Manchester County Council; the managing director of County Hall (Manchester) Management, the former GMCC economic development chief and former Parc consultant Leslie Boardman, declined to disclose the purchase price in 1992, but press reports put it at about ¬£22million. The seven-storey building became used by the Halifax and Chelsea building societies, the AGF and Scottish Amicable insurance companies, and the German consulate. The last leader of Greater Manchester County Council, Bernard Clarke, became the manager of the YMCA's Training for Life project and a director of Manchester Travel Services and of Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry. The county council's last Chief executive, Tony Harrison, a solicitor, remained Clerk to the Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester after abolition and became a director of various companies. In February 1992, wrongly believing he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, 61-year-old Harrison committed suicide. In March 2010, following the active pursuit of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, it was agreed by the government of the United Kingdom and the ten district councils of Greater Manchester that there should be a return to a statutory, two-tiered system of local governance for Greater Manchester. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority was agreed upon to strategically govern Greater Manchester from 1 April 2011. It consists of eleven members: ten indirectly elected members, each a directly elected councillor from one of the ten metropolitan boroughs that comprise Greater Manchester and elected Mayor of Greater Manchester who chairs the Authority. The authority will derive most of its powers from the Local Government Act 2000 and Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009. Powers and composition The Greater Manchester County Council was a strategic authority running regional services such as public transport, health provision, planning and emergency services. It served to provide a strategic regional framework within which the differing plans of its ten metropolitan borough councils could be harmonised. Bernard Clarke served as leader of the GMCC. =Elections to the GMCC= Elections were held to the Greater Manchester County Council in 1973, 1977 and 1981.

Muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm. Without consideration of factors such as aerodynamics and gravity for the sake of comparison, muzzle energy is used as a rough indication of the destructive potential of a given firearm or cartridge. The heavier the bullet and especially the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it will do. Kinetic energy The general formula for the kinetic energy is :E_\\\\mathrm{k} = \\\\frac{1}{2} mv^2 where :v is the velocity of the bullet :m is the mass of the bullet. Although both mass and velocity contribute to the muzzle energy, the muzzle energy is proportional to the mass while proportional to the square of the velocity. The velocity of the bullet is a more important determinant of muzzle energy. For a constant velocity, if the mass is doubled, the energy is doubled; however, for a constant mass, if the velocity is doubled, the muzzle energy increases four times. In the SI system the above Ek will be in unit joule if the mass, m, is in kilogram, and the speed, v, is in metre per second. Typical muzzle energies of common firearms and cartridges Muzzle energy is dependent upon the factors previously listed, and velocity is highly variable depending upon the length of the barrel a projectile is fired from. Also the muzzle energy is only an upper limit for how much energy is transmitted to the target, and the effects of a ballistic trauma depend on several other factors as well. While the above list mentions some averages, there is wide variation in commercial ammunition. A bullet fired from .357 magnum handgun can achieve a muzzle energy of . A bullet fired from the same gun might only achieve of muzzle energy, depending upon the manufacture of the cartridge. Some .45 Colt ammunition can produce of muzzle energy, far in excess of the average listed above. Legal requirements on muzzle energy Some jurisdictions stipulate minimum muzzle energies for hunting. For example, in Denmark rifle ammunition used for hunting the largest types of game there such as red deer must have a kinetic energy E100 (i.e.: at 100m range) of at least 2700 J and a bullet mass of at least 9 g or alternatively an E100 of at least 2000 J and a bullet mass of at least 10 g. Namibia specifies three levels of minimum muzzle energy for hunting, 1350 J for game such as springbok, 2700 J for game such as hartebeest and 5400 J for big game, together with a minimum caliber of 7 mm. In Germany airsoft guns with a muzzle energy of no more than 0.5 J are exempt from the gun law, while air guns with a muzzle energy of no more than 7.5 J may be acquired without a firearms license. Mainland China uses a concept of \\"muzzle ratio kinetic energy\\" (), which is the quotient (ratio) of the muzzle energy divided by the bore cross sectional area, to distinguish genuine guns from \\"imitation\\" replicas like toy guns. The Ministry of Public Security unilaterally introduced the concept in 2008 leading up to the Beijing Olympic Games, dictating that anything over 1.8 J/cm2 to be defined as real firearms. This caused many existing toy gun products on the Chinese market (particularly airsoft) to become illegal overnight, as almost all airsoft guns shooting a standard 0.20 gram 6mm pellet have a muzzle velocity over , which translates to more than of muzzle energy, or 2.0536 J/cm2 of \\"ratio energy\\". The subsequent heavy-handed crackdowns by local law enforcement led to many seizures, arrests and prosecutions of individual owners for \\"trafficking and possession of illegal weapons\\" over the years.

He was the eldest son of King Seong, and rose to the throne upon his father's death. Background During Seong's reign, Baekje had led an alliance with the neighboring Silla and the Gaya confederacy to attack the powerful northern kingdom of Goguryeo. In 551, Baekje successfully reclaimed from Goguryeo the present-day Seoul region, which was Baekje's capital from its founding until 475. However, Silla betrayed the alliance and, under a secret agreement with Goguryeo, claimed the territory for itself. As crown prince, Wideok organized the reprisal attack on Silla, despite opposition by the aristocracy. He participated in the Battle of Gwansan fortress, in which his father and nearly 30,000 men died fighting the Silla army. That disastrous campaign led to the aristocracy of Baekje taking some power away from the kings. Reign Baekje under Wideok was inimical with both Silla and Goguryeo, launching various battles and border incursions against the rival kingdoms. To avoid isolation, and to strengthen the royal position against the power of the aristocracy, he maintained friendly relations with the Chinese dynasties of Chen, Northern Qi and Sui. Although ties had been largely broken following the cataclysmic events of the 550s, he sent missions to the Chen court in 567, 577, 584, and 586 (it fell to Sui shortly thereafter). In 567, he sent Baekje's first mission to Northern Qi; this may have been facilitated by an improved relationship with Goguryeo. In 570, the Northern Qi granted him titles including \\"Duke of Daifang commandery\\", and he sent another tribute mission in 572. After Northern Qi was conquered by Northern Zhou in 577, Baekje also sent a congratulatory mission including musicians to the Zhou court. The following year a second and final embassy was sent to Northern Zhou, which was conquered by Sui in 581. Wideok sent an immediate congratulatory mission to the Sui court in 581, and another in 582. In 589 Sui conquered Chen and united China. In the same year, a Sui warship happened to run aground on Jeju Island, which was ruled by the Baekje dependency of Tamna. Wideok provided the crew with an official escort (bearing tribute and congratulations) to the Chinese court. In 598 he sent an embassy offering to assist in the Sui expedition against Goguryeo that year. The expedition, however, had already been completed. Yeongyang of Goguryeo launched punitive attacks on Baekje's northern border when he learned of this. Continuing the legacy of his father, Wideok sent various Buddhist missions to Yamato period Japan. Relics In 1995, a stone relic box was found in a Baekje-era Buddhist temple in Buyeo County, Chungcheongnam-do. Inscriptions on its face say it was made in 567 under Wideok's order. In 1996, the South Korean government designated the box as South Korean national treasure No. 288. It is held by the Buyeo National Museum.

Samuel Balto, together with 113 other people from Finnmark were hired by Sheldon Jackson to be involved in the introduction of reindeer in Alaska. Jackson promoted a plan to import reindeer from Russia to introduce reindeer husbandry to the Inupiaq as a solution to their loss of subsistence resources. The group was responsible for transporting goods and mail from Nome, Alaska, to gold mining workers up the Yukon River valley in the central parts of Alaska. Eventually Samuel Balto became a gold miner at Nome, Alaska, during the Klondike Gold Rush.

Population: History The town was originally founded by Yury Dolgoruky in 1154, where his son Vsevolod was born. Its name is explained by the fact that Vsevolod's patron saint was St. Demetrius. In the 13th century, the settlement marked a point where the borders of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Tver, and Pereslavl-Zalessky converged. The settlement itself belonged to the princes of Galich-Mersky, located much to the north, until 1364, when it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Both Dmitry Donskoy and his grandson Vasily II granted Dmitrov as an appanage to their younger sons, so Dmitrov was the capital of a tiny principality. In 1374, it was given town rights. The reign of Ivan III's son Yury Ivanovich (1503‚Äì1533) inaugurated the golden age of Dmitrov. It is during his reign that the black- domed Assumption Cathedral in the kremlin and a smaller monastery cathedral of Sts. Boris and Gleb were built. Thereafter, the town passed to Yury's brother, Andrey of Staritsa. In 1569, it was seized from Vladimir of Staritsa, added to the Oprichnina and consequently went into a decline. The town suffered further damage during the Time of Troubles, when it was ransacked by the Poles. The Cathedral of Sts. Boris and Gleb The Vvedenskaya Church dates from the 1760s In 1812, Dmitrov was briefly occupied by the Grande Arm√©e but in 1941 the Wehrmacht soldiers were stopped on the outskirts of the town. The Anarchist prince Peter Kropotkin spent his last years there. In the 1930s, the local kremlin was excavated by Soviet archaeologists.

There are three basic types: a manual version (also known as a bag valve mask) consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the Expired Air or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an oxygen powered resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.  History  Resuscitators began in 1907 when Heinrich Dr√§ger, owner of the Dr√§gerwerk AG Company, produced the \\"Pulmotor\\" Resuscitator. Considered to be the first practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years. Early \\"Lungmotor\\" resuscitation device When ambulance services began to form in major cities around the world, such as in London, New York and Los Angeles, Emergency medical services or EMS was developed. In these early days, perhaps the most advanced piece of equipment carried on these ambulances were devices for delivering supplemental oxygen to patients in respiratory distress. The Pulmotor and later models, such as the Emerson Resuscitator, utilized heavy tanks of oxygen to power a device which forced air into the patient's lungs. While better than no oxygen at all, these old units were problematic. Aside from often failing to sense obstructions in the airway, the Emerson, and to a lesser degree the Pulmotor, were large, bulky and heavy. The Emerson Resuscitator required two strong men to carry it from the ambulance to the victim. Perhaps the greatest defect, however, was the fact that these units \\"cycled\\". Cycling was a feature that was built into most resuscitators built before the 1960s, including the Pulmotor and Emerson models. To ensure that the victim's lungs were not injured from being over-inflated, the resuscitator was pre-set to provide what was considered a safe pressure of oxygen. Once the unit reached this limit, it ceased to pump oxygen. For patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or any form of obstructive lung disease, the delivered pressure was insufficient pressure to fill the lungs with oxygen, meaning that, for patients with any sort of obstructive lung disease, units that pressure cycled did more harm than good. Pressure cycling also meant that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was impossible to perform if a patient's respiration was being supported by one of these units. If chest compressions were to be done, the cycle would be retarded and the resuscitator would be unable to provide oxygen as long as the chest was being compressed. For victims of smoke inhalation and drowning, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives, so these units found a home on ambulances around the world. The devices that cycled on the basis of upper and lower pressure limits are known as pressure cycled automatic resuscitators. In the UK the introduction of BS6850:1987 Ventilatory Resuscitators confirmed that \\"....automatic pressure- cycled gas-powered resuscitators are not considered suitable for such use (closed chest cardiac compression)...\\" and confirmed the standards required for gas powered resuscitators and operator powered resuscitators. The following year a similar ISO standard was introduced. Around this date most manufacturers supplied or introduced time - volume cycled resuscitators and pressure cycled devices were discontinued. Both the Pulmotor and the Emerson depended to a large extent upon the patient's ability to breathe the oxygen in order to be beneficial. Due to the limitations imposed by the cycling feature, this meant that patients in need of rescue breathing benefited little from the application of these devices. The Emerson and Pulmotor were utilized until the mid-1960s, when a breakthrough in the history of oxygen delivery was made: the demand valve. The demand valve was a revolutionary new piece of equipment. At the simple push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be delivered into the lungs of the patient without the worry of the device cycling and, thus, ceasing to pump oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the demand valve was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to \\"work with the patient\\" than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a demand valve, as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patients airway was a factor in causing vomiting and aspiration. Demand valve resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the demand valve resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.  Modern day  The ambu-bag was a further advancement in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve as the primary method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60 cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a \\"pop-off\\" valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally more common in the pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over- inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute. Even newer products have been developed and are now available. In 1992 the Genesis(R) II time/volume cycled resuscitator (now upgraded to meet the current, International, resuscitation guidelines and called the CAREvent(R) ALS and CA)provide the SIMV automatic ventilation mode with demand breathing for the spontaneously breathing patient. These devices work like full blown transport ventilators yet are simple enough to operate that they can be used in an emergency situation by pre-hospital healthcare providers and are small enough to be easily transportable. Having a manual override control for use during mask CPR they meet the requirements of the current resuscitation standards. The Oxylator (R) EM-100 introduced in the late 1990s and subsequently replaced by the more flexible Oxylator (R) EMX and HD are pressure cycled devices that utilize pressure, rather than time, cycling to ventilate the patient. More recently the microVENT resuscitator range introduced two new models, the microVENT(R) CPR and the microVENT(R)World. These two new time/volume resuscitators meet the latest requirements for resuscitation and are lighter and smaller than most competitor products. NB: Most established automatic resuscitator manufacturers developed time/volume cycled resuscitators as these are acknowledged as preferable to pressure cycled resuscitators.  Response considerations  A manual resuscitator should be used on a victim only in an environment where the air is unquestionably safe to breathe.

He was the first person to receive an honour from Queen Elizabeth II.Our Queen at Ninety. ITV, 28 March 2016 Military career He was born and brought up in Altrincham, Cheshire, and educated at Wellington School. He was 24 years old and a private in the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), British Army, attached to the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers during the Korean War when the following deed took place at United Hill, for which he was awarded the VC. On 4 November 1951 in Korea, when the section holding the left shoulder of the company's position had been seriously depleted by casualties and was being overrun by the enemy, Speakman, on his own initiative, filled his pockets with grenades going forward and pelting the Chinese with the grenades. Having thrown all of the grenades he had taken, he returned for more. Inspired by his actions six men joined him in collecting and a pile of grenades and followed him in a series of charges. He broke up several enemy attacks, causing heavy casualties and in spite of being wounded in the leg and the shoulder continued to lead charge after charge. Such was the ferocity of the fighting that they ran low on ammunition, resorting to throwing stones, ration tins and beer bottles. The enemy was kept at bay long enough to enable his company to withdraw safely. The Press of the time nicknamed him the 'beerbottle' VC, something he disliked for fear that it suggested he and his colleagues drank beer while on duty, in fact the beer was used to cool gun barrels. Although his award was made by King George VI, Speakman was the first VC invested by Queen Elizabeth II. He later achieved the rank of sergeant and served in Malaya (with the Special Air Service), Borneo and Radfan.Ministry of Defence Later life Due to financial hardship, Speakman sold his original VC, using the money to put a new roof on his cottage, but later got a genuine replacement. His Victoria Cross is displayed in the National War Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh Castle. He was interviewed for the 2006 television docudrama Victoria Cross Heroes, which also included archive footage and dramatisations of his actions. In a ceremony held in Seoul on 21 April 2015 for visiting veterans of the Korean War, Speakman gave a replica of his Victoria Cross and other medals to the people and government of South Korea. Speakman became a uniformed in-pensioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Speakman died on 20 June 2018. He was buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, South Korea on 19 February 2019.

The seeds are too small and low-yielding to make a commercial crop, and it is now more widely considered a weed, occurring in crops, waste areas and roadsides. It can be a damaging weed when it is growing in a garden or crop, as it can not only damage the plant it entwines itself around, but can also hinder mechanised harvesting. It is also an invasive species in North America.

It is the total length travelled by all free neutrons per unit time and volume.Rudi J. J. Stamm'ler, M√°ximo Julio Abbate, Methods of steady-state reactor physics in nuclear design. Equivalently, it can be defined as the number of neutrons travelling through a small sphere of radius R in a time interval, divided by \\\\pi R^2 (the cross section of the sphere) and by the time interval.K. H. Beckurts, K. Wirtz: Neutron Physics. Springer 1964, , pp. 82‚Äì83 The usual unit is cm‚àí2s‚àí1 (neutrons per centimeter squared per second). The neutron fluence is defined as the neutron flux integrated over a certain time period, so its usual unit is cm‚àí2 (neutrons per centimeter squared). Natural neutron flux Neutron flux in asymptotic giant branch stars and in supernovae is responsible for most of the natural nucleosynthesis producing elements heavier than iron. In stars there is a relatively low neutron flux on the order of 105 to 1011 cm‚àí2 s‚àí1, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the s-process (slow neutron-capture process). By contrast, after a core-collapse supernova, there is an extremely high neutron flux, on the order of 1032 cm‚àí2 s‚àí1, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the r-process (rapid neutron-capture process). Atmospheric neutron flux, apparently from thunderstorms, can reach levels of 3¬∑10‚àí2 to 9¬∑10+1 cm‚àí2 s‚àí1. However, recent results (considered invalid by the original investigators) obtained with unshielded scintillation neutron detectors show a decrease in the neutron flux during thunderstorms. Recent research appears to support lightning generating 1013‚Äì1015 neutrons per discharge via photonuclear processes. Artificial neutron flux Artificial neutron flux refers to neutron flux which is man- made, either as byproducts from weapons or nuclear energy production or for a specific application such as from a research reactor or by spallation. A flow of neutrons is often used to initiate the fission of unstable large nuclei. The additional neutron(s) may cause the nucleus to become unstable, causing it to decay (split) to form more stable products. This effect is essential in fission reactors and nuclear weapons. Within a nuclear fission reactor, the neutron flux is the primary quantity measured to control the reaction inside. The flux shape is the term applied to the density or relative strength of the flux as it moves around the reactor. Typically the strongest neutron flux occurs in the middle of the reactor core, becoming lower toward the edges. The higher the neutron flux the greater the chance of a nuclear reaction occurring as there are more neutrons going through an area per unit time. = Reactor vessel wall neutron fluence = A reactor vessel of a typical nuclear power plant (PWR) endures in 40 years (32 full reactor years) of operation approximately 6.5√ó1019 cm‚àí2 (E > 1 MeV) of neutron fluence.Nuclear Power Plant Borssele Reactor Pressure Vessel Safety Assessment, p. 29, 5.6 Neutron Fluence Calculation.

The site is overseen by the Forestry Commission for conservation and recreation. Situated next to the A35 road between Dorchester and Poole; the forest provides a home for sika deer, the Dartford warbler and a population of sand lizards. History Wareham Forest featured in the American magazine Life on 20 October 1947. The article describes a fire that raged for four days across Wareham Heath in the summer of that year. The fire severed the road from Wareham to Bere Regis and exploded ammunition left behind from Second World War troop manoeuvres. The photograph accompanying the Life piece shows fire-fighters trying to counteract the blaze, which saw flames leap to over 150 feet in height. Thanks to these efforts, a majority of the forest was saved. A 55-acre tourist park and campsite now makes up part of Wareham Forest. In 2012, a married couple walking their dog over the heath had to be rescued by the Dorset Fire and Rescue Service, after they became stuck in a freezing swamp. Ecosystem A track that passes through the site comprises part of the 'Wareham Forest Way', a walk that leads from Wareham to Sturminster Marshall. There is also a route for cyclists called the Sika Cycle Trail. Situated to the east of the forest is Morden Bog National Nature Reserve. Calluna (or heather) and grasses such as Molinia caerulea (or purple moor grass) grow readily at Wareham Forest, give grazing fodder to a population of sika. The nationally scarce Dartford warbler and the nightjar has been observed around here, and sand lizards may also be spotted. The iconic fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), hallucinogenic toadstool, has been recorded within the forest. In 2006 the Journal of Zoology published the results of a nine-year study that looked into the breeding frequency of the site's smooth snakes (Coronella austriaca). In fiction The forest provides a backdrop for scenes within R. Hyslop's Wolf's-Head novel, set in the time of √Üthelwulf of Wessex.

When the war came, he was appointed to command of the Western Gunboat Flotilla, predecessor of the Mississippi River Squadron. In that position, he led the gunboats in the Battle of Fort Henry. For his services with the Western Gunboat Flotilla, Foote was among the first naval officers to be promoted to the then-new rank of rear admiral. Early life Foote was born at New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Senator Samuel A. Foot (or Foote) and Eudocia Hull.Hoppin, 1874, p. 15 As a child Foote was not known as a good student, but showed a keen interest in one day going to sea. His father compromised and had him entered at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.Hoppin, 1874, pp. 24‚Äì25 Six months later in 1822, he left West Point and accepted an appointment as a midshipman in the United States Navy. Antebellum naval service Between 1822 and 1843, Foote saw service in the Caribbean, Pacific, and Mediterranean, African Coast and at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. He first began as a midshipman on . In 1830, he was commissioned a lieutenant, and was stationed in the Mediterranean. In 1837, Foote circumnavigated the globe in . After serving on sea, Foote was put in charge of the Philadelphia Naval Asylum. After serving on land he went back to sea, and organized a Temperance Society aboard . This group developed into a movement that resulted in ending the policy of supplying grog to U.S. Naval personnel.Hoppin, 1874, pp. 58‚Äì59 Footes USS Perry confronting the slave ship Marta of Ambriz on June 6, 1850'' From 1849 to 1851, Foote commanded , cruising the waters off the African coast. He was active in suppressing the slave trade there.Davenport & Scudder, 1919, pp. 86‚Äì88 This experience persuaded him to support the cause of abolition, and in 1854, he published a 390 page book, Africa and the American Flag. In this book, Admiral Foote described the geography of the African continent, the customs of many of the African people, the establishment of American colonies in Africa, the slave- trade and its evils and the need to protect American citizens and commerce abroad. He also became a frequent speaker on the Abolitionist circuit. Foote was promoted to Commander in 1856, and took command of in the East India Squadron. With this command, Foote was assigned the mission of observing British operations against Canton, China, during the Second Opium War. This eventually resulted in his being attacked from Chinese shore batteries. Foote led a landing party that seized the barrier forts along the Pearl River in reprisal for the attack.Hoppin, 1874, p. 122 This led to a short occupation by the U.S. Navy of Chinese territory. Foote returned to the Continental United States in 1858, and took command of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in Brooklyn, New York, a post he held until the outbreak of the hostilities of the Civil War. Civil War and death ironclads in 1862 action in art, \\"Bombardment of Island 'Number Ten' in the Mississippi River.\\" When the American Civil War began in 1861, Foote was in command of the New York Navy Yard. On June 29, 1861 Foote was promoted to captain. From 1861 to 1862, Foote commanded the Mississippi River Squadron with distinction, organizing and leading the gunboat flotilla in many of the early battles of the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Even though Foote was an officer in the United States Navy, the Western Flotilla was under the jurisdiction of the Union Army. In early February 1862, now holding the rank of flag officer (equivalent to the modern commodore), he cooperated with General Ulysses S. Grant against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Despite heavy damage to one of the gunboats, Foote was able to quickly subdue the fort. Several days later Grant, with three divisions, and Foote with his fleet of ironclads, along with the assistance of Captain Seth Ledyard Phelps and his fleet of timberclad warships, moved against Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River. Hoping for a repeat of the success at Fort Henry, General Grant urged Foote to attack the fort's river batteries. Fort Donelson's guns, however, were better-placed than Fort Henry's were. Three of Foote's gunboats were damaged including the flagship, USS St. Louis. Foote himself received a wound in his foot.Smith, 2001, pp. 138‚Äì142 For his service at Forts Henry and Donelson, Foote received the Thanks of Congress. After repairing his flotilla, Foote joined with General John Pope in a campaign against Island Number Ten on the Mississippi River.

She was a spy working for British intelligence, partnered with John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt). When Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell first mapped out the characters for The New Avengers - an updating of The Avengers - the female lead character was to have been named Charlie (or Charley), but the decision was made not to use the name. Lumley is credited with suggesting the character be named Purdey, after James Purdey and Sons, a famous shotgun manufacturer. Lumley also chose the character's distinctive short haircut. Purdey is a martial arts expert (learned, according to her, during her time with the Royal Ballet, who let her go for being too tall) and (true to her namesake) an expert markswoman, who is often called upon to use her feminine attributes to distract villains. Purdey saw Steed as an attractive, yet fatherly figure, and there was also ongoing banter and playful flirting between Purdey and Mike Gambit (although the series never indicated anything more in her relationship with either man). During the two-year run of the series, no other name was ever given to the character and it was never revealed on screen whether Purdey was the character's first or last name. Reception In the British Film Institute's 1996 tribute book, The Avengers, Toby Miller writes: \\"The New Avengers made a very public and lengthy search for a leading woman. Joan Bakewell likened the eventual choice, Lumley as Purdey, to 'a hockey captain attending a royal garden party'. Richard Afton went far enough to remark that 'sex has taken a long holiday', and Lumley looked back on it from the queer/libertarian-feminist credibility of Absolutely Fabulous to describe her Purdey as 'a huge disappointment, sex-wise'.\\" Writing of Purdey's debut, Alan Hayes in Avenger World: The Avengers in Our Lives says, \\"Purdey was certainly no Emma Peel, and her sharp tongue and habit of intentionally making life difficult for Gambit flew in the face of the warm mutual respect between Steed and Peel, so I found that she grated somewhat (my opinion of her would eventually soften considerably).\\" Further reading * The Complete Avengers: The Full Story of Britain's Smash Crime-Fighting Team! by Dave Rogers, St Martin's Press (1989) * The Avengers by Toby Miller, British Film Institute (1997) * The Avengers Files: The Official Guide by Andrew Pixley, Reynolds & Hearn (2004) * The Avengers: A Celebration: 50 Years of a Television Classic by Marcus Hearn, Titan Books (2010) * The New Avengers TV Times Souvenir Extra (1976) * Avengerworld - The Avengers in Our Lives by Alan Hayes, Lulu (2016) * Quite Quite Fantastic!

Kealey (2000), Nature Genetics, 24 (21) In the book, Ridley explores the issues surrounding the development of human morality. The book, written from a sociobiological viewpoint, explores how genetics can be used to explain certain traits of human behaviour, in particular morality and altruism. Starting from the premise that society can on a simplistic level be represented as a variant of the prisoner's dilemma, Ridley examines how it has been possible for a society to arise in which people choose to co-operate rather than defect. Ridley examines the history of different attempts which have been made to explain the fact that humans in society do not defect, looking at various computer generated models which have been used to explain how such behaviour could arise. In particular he looks at systems based on the idea of tit for tat, where members of the group only cooperate with those who also cooperate and exclude those who do not. This allows altruistic behaviour to develop, and causes the optimum solution to the dilemma, to no longer be to defect but instead to cooperate. He applies this to humans and suggests that genes which generated altruistic-tit for tat behaviour would be likely to be passed on and therefore give rise to the kind of behaviour we see today. From this argument Ridley argues that society operates best in groups of around 150 individuals, which he suggests is the level at which humans are capable of being sure about which members to cooperate with and which to exclude. Although he avoids drawing any specific political points, Ridley ends his book by arguing for a smaller state operating on a more local level.

He died in exile a couple of years later. In the Bible He is mentioned as king of Babylon in the days of King Hezekiah, both in 2 Kings 20:12 (here called Berodach-baladan) and in Isaiah 39:1. In both passages he sends Hezekiah a letter, having heard of his illness and recovery. His messengers who have delivered the letter are lavishly entertained by Hezekiah, leading the prophet Isaiah to criticise Hezekiah for his excessive openness about the wealth he had amassed.; See also *Kings of Babylon *List of biblical figures identified in extra- biblical sources References Bibliography *Erich Ebeling (ed.), Bruno Meissner (ed.), Ernst Weidner (ed.), Dietz Otto Edzard (ed.): Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Arch√§ologie ‚Äì Band 7 .

Stylistically her artwork was affiliated with surrealism. In the late 1930s, Colquhoun was part of the British Surrealist Group before being expelled because she refused to renounce her association with occult groups. Colquhoun was born in Shillong, Eastern Bengal and Assam, British India, but brought up in the United Kingdom. After studying at the Slade School of Art, she lived briefly in Paris before moving back to London. She spent the latter part of her life in Cornwall, where she died in 1988. Biography Margaret Ithell Colquhoun was born in Shillong, Eastern Bengal and Assam, British India, the daughter of Henry Archibald Colebrooke Colquhoun and Georgia Frances Ithell Manley. Colquhoun was educated in Rodwell, near Weymouth, Dorset before attending Cheltenham Ladies' College. She became interested in occultism aged 17, after reading Aleister Crowley's Abbey of Thelema. Colquhoun gained admission to the Slade School of Art in London in October 1927, and was taught by Henry Tonks and Randolph Schwabe. While at the Slade, she joined G.R.S. Mead's Quest Society, and in 1930 published her first article, \\"The Prose of Alchemy\\", in the society's journal. In 1929, Colquhoun received the Slade's Summer Composition Prize for her painting Judith Showing the Head of Holofernes, and in 1931 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy. Despite her studies at the Slade, Colquhoun was primarily a self-taught artist. In 1931, after leaving the Slade, Colquhoun moved to Paris, where she established a studio. She was introduced to surrealism there, in 1931 reading Peter Neagoe's essay What is Surrealism?, and her interest in the movement was deepened in 1936 when she saw Salvador Dal√≠ lecture at the International Exhibition of Surrealism in London. Colquhoun's first solo exhibition was at the Cheltenham Art Gallery in 1936; a solo exhibition at the Fine Art Society in London followed in the same year. In 1937 she joined the Artists' International Association, and in the late 1930s she became increasingly associated with the surrealist movement in Britain, writing three articles for the London Bulletin in 1938 and 1939, visiting Andr√© Breton in Paris in 1939, and joining the British Surrealist Group in the same year. Also in 1939, she exhibited with Roland Penrose at the Mayor Gallery, showing 14 oil paintings and two objects. After only a year as a member of the British Surrealist Group, Colquhoun was expelled in 1940, due to her refusal to comply with E.L.T. Mesens' demands that the surrealists should not be members of any other groups, which Colquhoun felt would interfere with her studies of occultism. This led to Colquhoun's exclusion from other exhibitions organised by the British surrealists, but she continued to work with surrealist principles. In 1946, Colquhoun bought a studio near Penzance in Cornwall, and divided her time between there and London; in 1957 she moved to Paul, Cornwall. Colquhoun died in 1988. She left her occult work to the Tate, and her other art to the National Trust. In 2019, the Tate acquired the National Trust's holdings of Colquhoun's works. Art Song of Songs 1933 Though only formally involved with the surrealist movement in England for a few years, Colquhoun first gained her reputation as a surrealist, and identified as a surrealist for the rest of her life. She used many automatic techniques, which were described in Andr√© Breton's first surrealist manifesto as a defining feature of surrealism, and invented several automatic techniques herself. Colquhoun had an early interest in biology, and studies of plants and flowers were a recurring theme in her art throughout her life. Many of her early notebooks contained very detailed drawings of plants, and her early works included a series of enlarged images of flora, occupying the full canvas and painted almost photographically. Colquhoun's work also often explored themes of sex and gender. Her early work often depicts powerful women from myth and Bible stories, such as Judith Showing the Head of Holofernes 1929, and Susanna and the Elders 1930 - both of which are likely homages to Artemisia Gentileschi's works on the same themes. Dawn Ades sees Colquhoun's treatment of gender as responding to the masculine and patriarchal themes in the art of other surrealists - for instance, where other surrealists drew landscapes as women, Colquhoun's Gouffres Amers 1939 shows a male body as a landscape. Stylistically, some her works have been described as \\"macabre\\" and sinister.\\" In 1939, she created the work Tepid Waters (Rivi√®res Ti√®des) which was displayed at her solo exhibition at the Mayor Gallery the same year. The work was political in content, referring to the Spanish Civil War. In the 1940s, Colquhoun began to create works exploring the themes of consciousness and the subconscious. Her interest in psychology and dreams also attached her to the Surrealism movement. She used a wide range of materials and methods, such as decalcomania, fumage, frottage and collage. Colquhoun went further, developing new techniques such as superautomatism, stillomanay, parsemage, and entoptic graphomania writing about them in her article The mantic stain. Three works which stand out during the 1940s are The Pine Family, which deals with dismemberment and castration, A Visitation which shows a flat heart shape with multicoloured beams of light and Dreaming Leaps, a homage to Sonia Araquistain. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Colquhoun turned her attention towards collages rather than painting. The last retrospective of her work was held at the Newlyn Orion Gallery in 1976, which showed a large number of collages, many of which were according to Ratcliffe inspired by the collages of Kurt Schwitters. Although initially acclaimed, art historians have noted that Colquhoun's reputation suffered during the war, a period when British surrealists such as E.L.T Mesens pamphleted against her former husband, Toni del Renzio. A review of her 1973 exhibition in Penzance claimed: \\"She has always ignored prevailing fashions in art and remained true to her beliefs and highly personal style and approach with an integrity that is to be admired. Unfortunately, as a result she has often been under-rated...' Her major work 'La Cathedrale Engloutie' was a leading exhibit in the Dulwich Picture Gallery exhibition of British Surrealism, 2020https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/about/press-media/press- releases/british-surrealism-full-press-release/  Literary works  Colquhoun was also a writer. Between 1942 and 1944, she gave a number of poetry readings at the International Arts Centre in London, an event organised by her former husband. In 1955 she published The Crying of the Wind, a travelogue containing some stylistically surreal passages about her journeys in Ireland and interest in Celtic history. In 1961, her book The Goose of Hermogenes was published. Written in first-person narrative, the literary work was described by Paul C. Ray as a text that \\"recounts encounters of objective chance with their attendant shocks of recognition - encounters to produce their effect must be experienced.\\" In the 1980s, the art historian Dawn Ades described her early literary works as \\"like accounts of dreams in which a stream of narrative fantasy replaces the striking juxtapositions of images in Surrealist automatic texts.\\" She published poetry (Grimoire of the Entangled Thicket [1973], Ozmazone [1983]) and tales of her travels in Ireland and Cornwall. Colquhoun also published a variety of critical writing and automatic prose on the London Bulletin, as well as essays on automatism such as 'The Mantic Stain.' The article discussed automatism in the British context, leading her to give a series of lectures in institutions in the early 1950s, such as at the Oxford Art Society, Cambridge Art Society and the Working Men's Institute. In 1953, she appeared on the BBC television show Fantastic Art. Reception and legacy Colquhoun gained an early reputation within the British Surrealist movement, though in later years she became better known as an occultist. Upon her death, Colquhoun left her occult work to Tate, and her other artistic belongings to the National Trust. In 2019 it was announced that more than 5,000 drawings, sketches, and commercial artworks by her had been transferred to Tate by the National Trust. Although her work has largely been discussed in terms of its connection to Surrealism, Colquhoun sometimes stated her independence from the movement. In 1939, the same year she joined the English Surrealist group, she described herself as an 'independent artist' in a review for the London Bulletin. In 2012, the scholar Amy Hale noted that Colquhoun \\"is becoming recognized as one of the most interesting and prolific esoteric thinkers and artists of the twentieth century\\". Hale noted that through Colquhoun's work \\"we can see an interplay of themes and movements which characterizes the trajectory of certain British subcultures ranging from Surrealism to the Earth Mysteries movement and also gives us a rare insight into the thoughts and processes of a working magician.\\"  Personal life  In 1940, Colquhoun met the Russian-born Italian artist and critic Toni del Renzio in London. Although initially, it appears that Renzio gave bad reviews of Colquhoun's art when seeing her work exhibited at the A.I.A exhibition in March, he later wrote a letter to Conroy Maddox declaring that he found her to be \\"essentially a mystic, therefore individualist, conscious of being an artist, anxious to exhibit.\\" They married in July 1940 and in the same year they moved into a two-storey apartment at 45a Fairfax Road, Bedford Park. Their Bedford Park studio according to Ratcliffe became an open house for friends, other artists and like-minded individuals. The marriage later became an unhappy union and Matthew Gale wrote that they were \\"acrimoniously divorced\\" in 1947. From 1945, Colquhoun lived and worked in Parkhill Road, Hampstead. In 1957 Colquhoun moved to Cornwall, where she already owned a studio in Penzance. She remained in Cornwall until her death on 11 April 1988.

Dehghani broke away from the OIFPG when she accused it of deviating from the strategy of guerrilla warfare. From the early days of Iranian Revolution, the group claimed to be the \\"sole genuine communist organization\\" and opposed the Islamic Republic. Reportedly, as much as 30% of OIFPG members joined the group and fought in the 1979 Kurdish rebellion against government forces, backing the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan. Surviving members of the group and its factions moved to Europe in the 1990s.

Viking Press) Once There Was a War, published in 1958, is a collection of articles written by John Steinbeck while he was a special war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune from June to December 1943. Steinbeck's articles include descriptions of life on a troop transporter, an account of the liberation of a small Sicilian town, a description of how homesick US soldiers tried to grow their native vegetables in the English gardens where they billeted, and an account of how a detachment of US paratroopers tricked the German garrison at Ventotene into surrendering. Steinbeck did not report 'straight news', as he put it: he did not cover battles, or interview national or military leaders. As befitted the author of The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck wrote about the experiences of the ordinary people, those who were doing the actual fighting, and those who did the vast number of unglamorous but vital support jobs which kept the armed forces operating. In his Introduction, Steinbeck confesses that he felt 'a visitor' to the war, and was uncomfortable knowing that he could go home at any time, while the serving personnel could not. For this reason, he said, 'I never admitted to seeing anything myself, but always put my story in the mouth of another.' How much of his reporting is therefore of the 'eyewitness' class cannot be determined. For example, his descriptions of American and British torpedo boats in action against German forces seem like first-hand accounts, yet he nowhere refers to himself as present, despite his inclusion of convincing dialogue and detail. However, in his Travels with Charley, Steinbeck mentions wearing a naval officer's cap, 'Given me by a British torpedo boat captain, a very gentle gentleman and a murderer,' which phrase suggests that Steinbeck may well have observed action at first hand.

Often called the doyenne of Scottish literature, she wrote over 90 books of historical fiction, science fiction, travel writing and autobiography. Her husband Dick Mitchison's life peerage in 1964 entitled her to call herself Lady Mitchison, but she never did. She was appointed CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1981. The Corn King and the Spring Queen (1931) is seen by some as the prime 20th-century historical novel. Interests Like her father John Scott Haldane and elder brother J. B. S. Haldane, Naomi Haldane initially pursued a scientific career. From 1908, she and her brother looked into Mendelian genetics. Their 1915 publication was the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals. However, whilst she was a diploma student at the Society of Oxford Home Students (later St Anne's College, Oxford), the outbreak of the First World War changed her interest to nursing. Naomi Mitchison was a vocal feminist, particularly campaigning for birth control. We Have Been Warned (1935) is noted as her most controversial work, with its explicit sexuality. It was rejected by leading publishers and ultimately censored. Biography =Childhood and family background= Naomi Mary Margaret Haldane was born in Edinburgh, the daughter and younger child of the physiologist John Scott Haldane and his wife (Louisa) Kathleen Trotter. Naomi's parents came from different political backgrounds, her father being a Liberal and her mother from a Conservative and pro-imperialist family. However, both families were of landed stock; the Haldane family had been feudal barons of Gleneagles since the 13th century, but were nevertheless known for their achievements in other spheres. Today the best-known member of the family is probably Naomi's elder brother, the biologist J. B. S. Haldane (1892‚Äì1964), but in her youth her paternal uncle Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, twice Lord Chancellor (from 1912 to 1915 under H. H. Asquith, and in 1924 during the first Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald), was better known. Naomi followed her brother to the Oxford Preparatory School (later Dragon School) in 1904‚Äì1911, as the only girl there. From 1911, she was tutored at home by a governess. She qualified for the University of Oxford in 1914, via the Oxford higher local examination and entered the Society of Oxford Home Students (later renamed St Anne's College) to pursue a degree course in science. Before she completed the course she chose to become a nurse, for the First World War had broken out. After completing a course of first aid and home nursing in 1915, she joined a Voluntary Aid Detachment at St Thomas's Hospital, London. Her service was much curtailed after she caught scarlet fever. The Haldanes were known for their self-styled domestic experiments. She and her brother John started investigating Mendelian genetics in 1908. They initially used guinea pigs as experimental models, but changed to mice as they were more convenient to handle. Their findings were published as \\"Reduplication in Mice\\" in 1915. This was in fact the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals. =Marriage and family life= On 11 February 1916, Naomi married the barrister Gilbert Richard Mitchison (23 March 1894 ‚Äì 14 February 1970), who was a close friend of her brother. Mitchison was then on leave from the Western Front; like her, he came from a well-connected and wealthy family. He became a Queen's Counsel, then a Labour politician, and eventually a life peer on 5 October 1964 as Baron Mitchison of Carradale in the County of Argyll, on retirement for his political work. Naomi thus became Lady Mitchison as the wife of a life peer, but she objected to the title. She played an active part in her husband's political career and in his constituency duties. Dick and Naomi Mitchison's marriage was not wholly satisfactory. After some years they both agreed to an open marriage, in which they entered into several other relationships that were conducted with dignity and described with humour. Her first serious lover was the Oxford classicist Theodore Wade-Gery, whose scholarship she drew on in writing her historical novels.Calder 2019, pp. 105‚Äì107. As described in her autobiography, You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920‚Äì1940, she fell deeply in love with Wade-Gery. She wrote him love poems and missed him greatly after he broke off the relationship, considering it incompatible with his marriage to another woman in 1928. She mitigated her sorrow by undertaking a risky mission to help persecuted socialists in fascist-dominated Austria. Later she had several briefer, less intense affairs, in which the men were in love with her and she did her best to reciprocate. As she emphasized in describing these, she was careful to use contraceptives with her lovers and let her children be fathered by her husband alone ‚Äì although she dreamed of a future in which her daughters would be able to \\"have children by several chosen fathers, uncensured\\". Naomi and Dick had seven children. Their four sons were Geoffrey (1918‚Äì1927), who died of meningitis, Denis (1919‚Äì2018), a professor of bacteriology, Murdoch (1922‚Äì2011), and Avrion (born 1928), both professors of zoology. Their three daughters were Lois, Valentine, and Clemency, who died in 1940, shortly after her birth. Between 1923 and 1939, they lived at River Court House, Mall Road, Hammersmith, London. They bought the Carradale House at Carradale in Kintyre in 1939, where they lived for the rest of their lives. The house was frequented by people of all sorts: lords, ladies, politicians, writers, neighbours, fishermen and farmers. She and Denis MacIntosh, a local fisherman, wrote a documentary, Men and Herring: A Documentary, in 1949. Ten years later this was adapted for BBC Television as a docudrama, Spindrift. =Literary career= Mitchison was a prolific writer, completing more than 90 books in her lifetime, across a multitude of styles and genres. These include historical novels such as her first novel The Conquered (1923), set in Gaul in the 1st century BC, during the Gallic Wars of Julius Caesar, and her second novel Cloud Cuckoo Land (1925) set in 5th-century BC Ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War. Her best work is considered to be The Corn King and the Spring Queen (1931), which treats three different societies, including a wholly fictional one, and explores themes of sexuality that were daring for that day. Terri Windling described it as \\"a lost classic\\". Literary critic Geoffrey Sadler has stated of Mitchison's historical fiction: \\"On the basis of her early writings, she is unquestionably one of the great historical novelists.\\" In 1932, Mitchison was commissioned by Victor Gollancz to edit a guide to the modern world for children. Mitchison's book, An Outline for Boys and Girls and Their Parents, included several distinguished contributors, including W.H. Auden, Gerald Heard, and Olaf Stapledon. On publication, An Outline was praised by The Times Literary Supplement, the New Statesman and the London Mercury. However, several clergymen, including the Archbishop of York, were angered by the book's lack of emphasis on Christianity, while other right-wing authors objected to what they claimed was a sympathetic attitude to the Soviet Union. The Conservative writer Arnold Lunn wrote a lengthy attack on the book in the English Review, which contributed to its commercial failure. Undoubtedly her most controversial work, We Have Been Warned, was published in 1935, based on a journey to the Soviet Union. In it she explored sexual behaviour, including rape and abortion. The book was rejected by various publishers. She approached first her friend Victor Gollancz (of Victor Gollancz Ltd.), who flatly turned her down as he observed that \\"publication of the book would cause a real outcry.\\" The book was extensively rewritten to make it more acceptable to publishers, and was still subject to censorship. Upon publication it was universally despised for its depiction of rape, free love and abortion that \\"alienated readers on the left and horrified those on the political right.\\" In 2005, files from the National Archives revealed the British government had considered prosecuting the publishers of We Have Been Warned, but ultimately decided not to do so. Mitchison was a compulsive writer, as her travelogues would reveal. She would write on planes or in trains as prompted by the situation. For example, she wrote up a visit to the US in the 1930s, objecting to sharecropping. Mitchison's 1938 book The Moral Basis of Politics was a treatise on ethics and politics that she had worked on for three years. In it she defended the right of the left-wing journalist H. N. Brailsford to criticise the Moscow Trials, which had caused controversy on the British left at the time. Mitchison's The Blood of the Martyrs (1939) is set against the background of Nero's persecution of the Christians. She draws parallels between Nero and dictators of her own time: Mussolini and Hitler. In 1952, Mitchison went to Moscow as a member of the Authors' World Peace Appeal. She went frequently to Africa, especially to Botswana, where she was made a sort of tribal mother (Mmarona) to the baKgatla people. Mucking Around (1981) best describes her haphazard travels in five continents over 50 years. Later works included further historical novels: The Bull Calves (1947) about the Jacobite rising of 1745 and The Young Alexander the Great (1960). She also turned to fantasy, such as Graeme and the Dragon (1954, Graeme Mitchison being a grandson through Denis), science fiction such as Memoirs of a Spacewoman (1962) and Solution Three (1975), fantasy such as the humorous Arthurian novel To the Chapel Perilous (1955), non-fiction such as African Heroes (1968), and also children's novels, poetry, travel and a three-volume autobiography. She was never sure exactly how many books she had written, often claiming there were about 70. The articles were uncountable, from book reviews for the old Time and Tide magazine and the New Statesman to practical essays on farming, campaigning articles, recollections and reflections. After her husband's death, Mitchison wrote several memoirs, published as separate titles between 1973 and 1985. She was also a good friend of the writer J. R. R. Tolkien and she was one of the proof readers of The Lord of the Rings. Maxim Lieber served as her literary editor in 1935. =Activism= Mitchison, like her brother, was a committed socialist in the 1930s. She visited the Soviet Union in 1932 as part of a Fabian Society group, and expressed some misgivings about the direction of Soviet society. An active anti-fascist, Mitchison travelled to Austria, where she undertook the risky task of smuggling documents and left- wing refugees out of the country. She stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate for the Scottish Universities in 1935, at a time when universities were allowed to elect MPs. Eventually, as her political candidacy and her pro- Left writings had failed, she gradually became disenchanted with the Left. At this time she became politically attracted to Scottish Nationalism and increasingly wrote on specifically Scottish issues and themes. Her name was on George Orwell's list of people prepared in March 1949 for the Information Research Department set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government, who were considered to have pro-communist leanings and so be inappropriate to write for the IRD. Mitchison's advocacy continued in other ways. She acted as a spokeswoman for the island communities of Scotland. She was a friend of Seretse Khama and became an advisor to the Bakgatla tribe of Botswana. She also took a keen interest in the problems of Scotland and served on the Argyll County Council and on the Highlands and Islands Development Council. Meanwhile she was a serious botanist and gardener, and a practical farmer. She became a Labour representative in Argyll County Council from 1945 to 1966. She was a member of the Highland Panel from 1947 to 1965, and of the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council from 1966 to 1976. Mitchison was a Life Fellow of the Eugenics Society. She was also a vocal campaigner for women's rights, advocating birth control, and active in local government in Scotland (1947‚Äì1976). Her own lack of knowledge about birth control (as stated in her memoirs) led to her interest in the causes of birth control and abortion. She was on the founding council of the North Kensington Women's Welfare Centre in 1924. Today, she is best known for her advocacy of feminism and her tackling of then-taboo subjects in her writing. She was a principal investor in the Partisan Coffee House, a meeting place for the New Left off Soho Square, which functioned from 1958 to 1962. Mitchison was also present and supporting a Stop the Seventy Tour rally, aiming to stop the apartheid South African rugby and cricket tours of Britain, in December 1969. =Later life= Statue of Naomi Mitchison, located in South Gyle, Edinburgh Dick predeceased her in 1970, but Naomi remained active as a writer well into her nineties. She was appointed CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1981. In her old age she was constantly anxious and depressed about the future, particularly the misuse of scientific development such as nuclear arms. She claimed that to experience two world wars in a lifetime was too much. On the other hand, she never exhausted the Haldanes' eccentricity, and once remarked that her biography in Who's Who was \\"burning rubbish\\". When asked on her 90th birthday whether she had any regrets in life, she replied, \\"Yes, all the men I never slept with. Imagine!\\" She died at Carradale on 11 January 1999 at the age of 101 and was cremated at the Clydebank crematorium on 16 January. Her ashes were then scattered at Carradale.

He is immortalized in the newsgroups alt.fan.joel- furr, alt.bonehead.joel-furr, and alt.joel-furr.die.die.die. He was a pretender to the throne of James \\"Kibo\\" Parry, and the bitter enemy of Serdar Argic. He is also infamous for his Usenet response to the death of Roger Zelazny: \\"Good\\". (Furr has subsequently apologized for this statement, attributing his cranky response to immaturity and thoughtlessness.) One reason for Furr's fame on Usenet was his self-appointed leadership over the alt hierarchy, where any user could create a newsgroup without any official vote or sanction by the user community. Before 1992, internet administrators did not carry alt newsgroups that did not obtain some general community assent. However, in the time spanning roughly 1993 to 1995, commercial internet service providers were cropping up left and right, and few of them had time or inclination to manage which newsgroups their services carried, so they carried all groups that were created. Furr attempted to bring some order and rationale to this practice, but with minimal success. According to Brad Templeton, Furr is one of the earliest people to refer to unsolicited electronic messages as \\"spam\\". The term \\"spam\\" had been widely used by Monty Python fans to describe excessive torrents of verbiage on electronic chat systems and multi-user dungeons, analogous to the Vikings chanting \\"spam spam spam spam spam, WONDERFUL SPAM\\" in the legendary Python sketch. Furr used the term in the USENET newsgroup news.admin.policy to describe an out-of-control automated robo-moderation system known as ARMM. While he didn't coin the phrase, he appears to have been the first to use it to describe the phenomenon as it applied to USENET newsgroups. Furr created a line of Usenet kook T-shirts, which included a \\"Serdar Argic World Tour\\" shirt as well as one imprinted with the programming code for RSA encryption, boasting \\"This shirt is a munition\\", a reference to US export law. He also created and sold T-shirts after the \\"Green Card\\" spamming incident carried out by Canter & Siegel. He is an alumnus of the University of Georgia and its Demosthenian Literary Society. Furr serves as the official \\"Weigher of Coal\\" for Richmond, VT. Furr appeared in the editorial pages of the Washington Post on May 11, 2018, with an editorial noting that despite having no official duties whatsoever as Weigher of Coal, he is still required to follow strict ethical standards.

The area around the city has nearly 700,000 km¬≤. Its name (which is Portuguese for Round Turn) is due to the round shape of a curve in the Para√≠ba do Sul river around which the city was built. Situated in Volta Redonda is Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), Brazil's second largest steel producer. Today its economy, despite still being based on industry, is quite diverse, and largely focused on the areas of services and trade. Due to this, Volta Redonda is worldly known as Cidade do A√ßo (which is Portuguese for Steel City). The city borders with the municipalities of Barra Mansa (north, northwest, west and southwest), Barra do Pira√≠ (northeast), Pinheiral, Pira√≠ (south and east), and Rio Claro (south) and is 130 km from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Along with the municipalities of Barra Mansa and Pinheiral, it is a conurbation of over 500,000 inhabitants, according to the IBGE estimates for 2008, and the state's largest urban spot outside the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Economical center of the South Fluminense region, Volta Redonda is a strategic area, close to major hub cities in other regional states, such as Juiz de Fora (190 kilometers) and Sao Jose dos Campos (220 kilometers). History In 1744, the first explorers named the curious curve of the Para√≠ba do Sul river \\"Volta Redonda\\". Big farms were installed in the region and nowadays some farm names are the names of some districts. Between the years of 1860 and 1870, the navigation through the Para√≠ba do Sul river had its golden period between the cities of Resende and Barra do Pira√≠ and at the same time the railroad D. Pedro II was built in Barra do Pira√≠ and Barra Mansa. With this, in 1875, the village of Santo Antonio de Volta Redonda started to have great impulse, but with the freedom of slaves in 1888, the decay of the Vale do Para√≠ba became visible, destroying the agriculture, which would never recover in a very satisfactory way. National Archives of Brazil. This situation would be reversed in 1941, when the cycle of industrialization of Volta Redonda began. Chosen as site for installing the Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional (CSN) steel mill in the middle of World War II, it marked the base of Brazilian industrialization. Laborers from diverse regions of the country came to Volta Redonda to work in the mill. When it opened in 1946, it was the first steel mill in South America. A heavily subsidized symbol of national pride, the Volta Redonda mill embodied the import substitution industrial policies that prevailed in Latin American economies from World War II until the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s. Since its 1993 privatization, however, the mill ‚Äî now known as the Presidente Vargas Steelworks ‚Äî has transcended its dirigiste origins to become one of the world's most efficient steel production facilities - due to this large production of steel and minerals, the city is globally nicknamed \\"Cidade do A√ßo\\" (literal Portuguese for \\"City of Steel\\"). Education In the second half of the 20th century, the city received the boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1961 the Industrial Engineering and Metallurgical Volta Redonda of Fluminense Federal University who later brought more courses the city with the Institute of Exact Sciences and Institute Humanities and Social Sciences, or also higher education institutions University Center or Geraldo Di Biase - UGB, University Centre of Barra Mansa - UBM and University Center of Volta Redonda - UniFOA was created. In the 2000s, the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro was launched with technological and industrial emphasis. Sports Volta Redonda Futebol Clube is the most important football club of the city, playing its home matches at Est√°dio Raulino de Oliveira, which is also located in the city downtown.

The School teaches a wide range of subjects including the history, politics, literature, sociology, economics and languages of the region and is the largest centre for the study and research of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, and Russia in the United Kingdom. It has links with universities both across Europe and globally.http://www.ssees.ucl.ac.uk/ History The School was founded by R.W. Seton-Watson in London in 1915, as a department of King's College London, and inaugurated by Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, who later became President of Czechoslovakia. In 1932 the School became an Institute of the University of London, no longer connected to any college.I. W. Roberts, History of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies 1915-1990 (London: School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University of London, 1991). In 1999, the School merged with University College London (UCL). Teaching More than 60 academic staff work at the School, teaching and conducting research in the history, economics, politics, sociology, anthropology, culture, literature and languages of the countries of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, and Russia. In 2012/2013 the School had over 200 graduate students studying taught MA degrees or undertaking PhD research. In addition, the School has over 600 undergraduate students. Research Along with its undergraduate and graduate teaching, the School hosts a number of interdisciplinary research centres, groups and funded projects which aim to help us expand research and understanding of their specialist regions. It is a major international centre for training the next generation of regional specialists, through a combination of academic rigour and the skills and knowledge required by employers. It also specializes in analyzing and disseminating information about changes in the region, publishing periodicals, papers and books, holding conferences, public lectures, seminars and briefings, and providing experts who can act as advisers to government, the media, and public and private institutions. Library Comprising around 357,000 volumes of books, pamphlets and periodicals, the School's library is unique in the UK for the quantity of research material on open access and for the extensive collection of newspapers from the region. Its collections of books, periodicals and archives are consulted by scholars from all over the world, and it has recently developed an important role in the provision of electronic and audio-visual material relating to its area of study. Central to the School since its founding, the Library moved from Senate House to the new building on Taviton Street in 2005. The library is one of the leading research collections in Britain for the study of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The main fields of interest are the languages, literature, history, politics, economics, geography and bibliography of Russia and the western Republics of the former USSR, Poland, the Czech Lands, Slovakia, former Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Austria, Germany and Italy. Subsidiary fields of interest are the arts in general, demography, ethnography and religion. Material is also collected on the former German Democratic Republic (history, political and economic life), the history of Germany and Austria, the Lusatian Sorbs, and Slavonic and Ugro-Finnic studies in general. The Library also houses the Bain Graffy Film Collection of films from and about Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. Building In May 2004 the foundation stone of the School's new building on Taviton Street in Bloomsbury was unveiled by the President of Poland, Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski, in the presence of The Princess Royal, Chancellor of the University of London. The school moved to the building in the summer of 2005 after nearly 90 years at Senate House. V√°clav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, delivered the keynote address of his visit to the UK at a ceremony to open the building in October 2005. Following Klaus's address, the Princess Royal unveiled the stone to mark the formal opening of the building, on the occasion of the School's 90th anniversary. The building was designed by award-winning architects Short and Associates. The design of the building aims to be 'environmentally- friendly' not simply through the addition of elements such as solar panels, but by facilitating the passage of cool air around the building and so avoiding the need for air conditioning or other expensive, energy-using solutions ‚Äì a first for the 'central London heat island'.Contractors page for the project.For an account of the design see: Short, C.A., Whittle, G., Owarish, M., (2006) \\"Fire & Smoke Control in Naturally Ventilated Buildings\\", Building Research & Information, 34 (1), pp. 21‚Äì54 and Short, C.A., Lomas K.J., Woods, A., (2004) \\"Design Strategy for Low Energy Ventilation and Cooling Within an Urban Heat Island\\", Building Research and Information, 32 (3), May ‚Äì June, pp. 187‚Äì206.

However, under administrative license suspension (ALS) laws, sometimes called administrative license revocation or administrative per se, licenses are confiscated and automatically suspended independent of criminal proceedings whenever a driver either (1) refuses to submit to chemical testing (blood, breath or, in some states, urine), or (2) submits to testing with results indicating a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher. Because ALS laws are immediate and require no proof of guilt, proponents such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving argue that they are more effective in reducing drunk driving than are traditional post-conviction sanctions, and that, in any event, driving is only a privilege. However, civil liberties advocates and other critics object to a procedure in which guilt is presumed and punishment is automatically imposed by the officer; they further point out that state and federal courts have held the driving privilege, once given, to be a vested right that cannot be taken away without due process. See, e.g., Schuman v. California, 584 F.2d 868 (1978). The laws have also been criticized as constituting double jeopardy and/or multiple punishment. While the argument for double jeopardy is tenuous, that for multiple punishment may have merit: the driver has his license suspended by the State in the ALS proceedings, and then is punished by the State again in court for the same offense‚Äîthe punishment often involving a second license suspension. While this issue has been resolved both ways in the past by state and federal courts, the currently prevailing view is that there is no multiple punishment since the suspension is only an administrative \\"sanction\\", not a criminal \\"punishment\\". As of 2010, only nine states did not have ALS laws: Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Tennessee.DUI/DWI laws, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, February 2010 The example of Texas In the state of Texas, Administrative License Revocation is a process by which an individual who is arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) has his or her driver's license administratively suspended. This program went into effect on January 1, 1995, and is administrated by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). DPS records indicate that 103,168 notices of suspension were served during calendar year 2003. During that time period the agency processed 95,495 suspensions. A suspension can occur from either the refusal to submit to a chemical test or results of 0.08 or greater alcohol concentration when a chemical test is taken. This blood alcohol concentration (0.08 grams percent) applies to drivers age 21 and over, but a lower BAC level is applicable to underage drivers or any driver operating a commercial motor vehicle. DPS is also authorized to suspend the drivers licenses of minors who commit the offense of driving under the influence (DUI) as well as individuals who refuse to provide a specimen following an arrest for the offense of boating while intoxicated (BWI). The statutes concerning ALR suspensions are found in the Texas Transportation Code at Chapters 524 and 724. The administrative license suspension process usually begins when a law enforcement officer determines that there is reasonable suspicion for an initial traffic stop of a motorist. If the officer has reason to believe that the driver is impaired, field sobriety tests are administered. If the driver performs poorly, the driver is arrested for DWI and transported to the police station. At the station, the officer will read to the driver the \\"Statutory Warning\\" and then request that driver submit to a breath or blood test to measure his/her alcohol concentration. If the driver refuses to provide a specimen or provides a specimen with a prohibited alcohol concentration, the officer serves a notice of suspension and confiscates the driver's license. Procedures for handling minors vary slightly. A law enforcement officer must have reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop, however, a full custodial arrest is not required. Once the officer determines that the individual is under 21 years of age and has reason to believe that he/she has consumed alcohol, the officer will issue the driver a citation for DUI, serve the notice of suspension, and confiscate the driver license. The minor may or may not be placed under arrest and a chemical test may or may not be requested. The officer may proceed with a custodial arrest procedure if he believes the individual is seriously impaired. The driver has fifteen days from the date of the notice of suspension is served to request a hearing. If no hearing is requested, the suspension will automatically go into effect on the 40th day after notice was served. The period of suspension is 90 days to a year, depending upon the existence of prior convictions; if a refusal to submit to testing is involved, the periods are 180 days to two years. Minors face suspensions of 60 to 180 days. Administrative suspension hearing Assuming the license holder makes the demand for a hearing within the statutory period, a hearing is scheduled. The nature of these vary considerably from state to state. In some states, the hearing takes place in court before a judge. More commonly, however, an administrative hearing will be conducted by the state's department of motor vehicles. The procedures for these administrative hearings vary as well. In some, the hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), the state's case will be presented by a prosecutor, and the officer will be required to testify. In a growing number of others, such as California, the role of \\"judge\\" and \\"prosecutor\\" are filled by one person‚Äîa DMV employee with no legal training‚Äîand the DMV's case can consist of no more than the arrest report; if the licensee wishes to cross-examine the officer, he must subpoena him and pay for his salary.

Early life Roberts was born in Sumner County, Tennessee, and graduated from Furman University, a Baptist school in Greenville, South Carolina. Significance He was known for his erratic behaviour and \\"falling into difficulties with nearly everyone who worked with him\\", which cost him his connection with the Southern Baptist Convention. Roberts was the only Baptist known to have influenced Hong Xiuquan (Ê¥™ÁßÄÂÖ®, Wade-Giles: Hung Hsiu-ch'√ºan), the Hakka who led the Taiping Rebellion (1851‚Äì1864) against the Qing Dynasty which caused millions of deaths. Hong spent two months studying with Roberts at Canton (Guangzhou) in 1847. Roberts refused Hong's request for a baptism, perhaps due to a misunderstanding. He was also the first Baptist missionary arrived in Hong Kong in February 1842. With the Taipings In 1860, Roberts left Canton for the Taiping capital at Nanjing. He was dismayed to find that the beliefs of the Taiping departed widely from his own Christianity, but nevertheless accepted a post as advisor to Hong Rengan, foreign minister at the Taiping court. While there, Roberts arranged for some Baptists from the United States to visit Nanjing and meet Hong directly. He left in January 1862 on board the British gunboat Renard following a dispute with Hong, accusing Hong of the murder of Issachar's servant, and was thereafter fiercely critical of the Taiping. Death Roberts died of leprosy (which he had contracted in Macao in 1837) at the home of his niece in Upper Alton, Madison County, Illinois on December 28, 1871.Coughlin, Margaret Morgan.

Silver obol of Raymond V count of Toulouse. He was the son of Alphonse I of Toulouse and Faydida of Provence. Alphonse took his son with him on the Second Crusade in 1147. When Alphonse died in Caesarea in 1148, the county of Toulouse passed to his son Raymond, then aged 14. The young count was honoured by Rorgo Fretellus, archdeacon of Nazareth, who dedicated a new edition of his Description of the Holy Places to him. As count, Raymond permitted the first assembly of townsmen in Toulouse, the origin of the later capitouls. In 1165, in the town of Lombers, the Bishop of Albi, attended by both clerics and members of the nobility, including Constance, the wife of Raymond V, interrogated and debated with members of an alleged heretical sect. Calling themselves \\"Good Men\\", this group held beliefs similar to those of Henry of Lausanne and Peter of Bruys as well as indicating Cathar influence. While the Good Men declined to respond to a number of questions about their beliefs, they told the bishop that they did not accept the Old Testament, and that their reading of the New Testament persuaded them that they should not take oaths. They further challenged the jurisdiction of the bishop. In 1178 Raymond requested assistance from the Cistercians to combat heresy in his dominions. Wakefield suggests that being under pressure on his western border from King Alfonso II of Aragon, Raymond wished to present himself as a defender of the faith. A joint legatine and royal commission arrived in Toulouse charged with authority to preach, investigate, and condemn. It operated for three months. Family In 1153/6, Raymond married Constance, daughter of King Louis VI of France by his second wife, Adelaide of Maurienne. Constance was the widow of Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne. Because Raymond was related to her within prohibited degrees, they were separated by ecclesiastical authority in 1165. They had five children: #Raymond VI, who succeeded his father as Count of Toulouse #Aubri, died 1180 #Adelaide or Azalais of Toulouse, who married Roger II Trencavel in 1171 and died in 1199 #Baldwin, born 1165, executed on the orders of Raymond VI in 1214 He was engaged with Richeza of Poland, widow of Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Provence. Raymond also had an illegitimate daughter: # Indie (July 1192 ‚Äì 27 September 1249), who married firstly Guilabert de Lautrec (d.1215), and secondly Bernard de L'Isle-Jourdain (d.1228), and had issue.

The municipality population in 2011 was 9,627,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 484.52 km2. The urban centre of Pinhel had about 3500 residents in 2001.  History  The origins of this municipality date back to the Calcolithic period, as many of the remnants of ancient cultures from this period remain: namely the rock-art engravings and paintings that line the C√¥a valley in Cidadelhe. Part of the historic district of Guarda, the region obtained its name for many pine forests that covered the region's hills and mountains. There are also several references to a pre-Roman or Roman presence, suggesting a continual occupancy since this period. During the medieval period, owing to the defensive requirements of the fledgling nation, several fortified centres developed, including the Pinhel, but also along a line that included: Trancoso, Marialva, Guarda, Castelo Rodrigo, Almeida and Castelo Mendo. The Castle of Pinhel dates from the reign of King Denis and the keep tower from his descendant, King Manuel I. Pinhel's strategic position, along the frontier with Spain, made the monarchs of Portugal retain many of these fortifications, as well as allowing the development of their territorial claims. The historical centre, with its narrow roadways, were adapted from the morphology of the terrain, with many patrimonial references to the medieval and modern eras. The homes of the city of Pinhel, some dating from the 16th century, includes some lost references to the presence of a Jewish population at one time, such as along the Rua de Santa Maria. Pinhel was, for a long time, the seat of its own diocese, before being incorporated into the Diocese of Guarda. The 17th and 18th century were periods of growth for the region, dominated the construction of estates, scattered in many of the historic corners of the municipality, some monumental and decorative. The urbanized area of Pinhel, the city of Pinhel, was elevated to this status in 1770.  Ecclesiastical History  In 1770.08.25 a bishopric was established as Diocese of Pinhel / Pinhelen(sis) (Latin adjective), on territory split off from the Diocese of Lamego, apparently as suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Braga. The Church of the Saviour (Portuguese: Igreja do Salvador) served as cathedral, until its demolition and substitution as such in 1797 by the convent church of St. Louis (Portuguese: Igreja de S√£o Lu√≠s) as ordered by bishop Don Bernardo Bernardino Beltr√£o Freire.

The neighborhood became part of the unified borders of Jerusalem according to the Jerusalem Law, enacted in 1980. East Jerusalem, including French Hill, was never officially annexed to Israel, but it was brought under the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem city municipality, allowing Israeli law to be implemented there. Etymology Construction work on the French Hill reservoir in 1926 The opening ceremony of the French Hill Reservoir 15 July 1926 (sign in English, Arabic and Hebrew) The source of the name French Hill is the fact that the land belonged to the Catholic Monastery of St Anne, whose monks hailed mainly from France.The Guide to Israel Zev Vilnay, Hamakor Press, Jerusalem, 1972, p. 130 In 1926 the Monastery donated a plot of land to built a reservoir to store water that was pumped from Ein Farah, to supply the city of Jerusalem. An opening ceremony was held on 15 July 1926 and the location was reported in the newspapers as \\"the French Hill\\" (at the time in Hebrew in plural - Giv'at Ha'Zorfatim).Andrew Koch, The Jerusalem Water Supply, The Palestine Post, 12 July 1936 According to local legend, it was named after a British general, John French, 1st Earl of Ypres who is said to have had his headquarters on this hill. According to this legend there was a mistake with the translation to Hebrew that named the place after the country France (in Hebrew: Tzarfat). However, French never served in this region. Had the neighborhood been named for General French, the correct name in Hebrew would have been Giv'at French. History Under Jordanian rule, the area () was a military outpost. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, a small number of Palestinians from Lifta moved to the area prior to 1967.Walid Khalidi All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948. Washington DC: Institute for Palestine Studies, 1992 According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from the following Palestinian neighbourhoods/villages in order to construct French Hill in 1968: *394 dunams from Isawiya,'Isawiya Town Profile, ARIJ, 2012, p. 14 *394 dunams from Shuafat.Shu‚Äôfat Town Profile, ARIJ, 2013 p. 14 In 1969, construction began on a new residential neighborhood to create a land link between West Jerusalem and the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus, which had been an Israeli enclave in Jordanian territory before the war.Understanding Jerusalem - Middle East Quarterly The official name of the new neighborhood was Giv'at Shapira. Another section of French Hill, Tzameret HaBira, was populated mainly by American immigrants.Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem, 2002-2003. Jerusalem, Israel: Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies; ISSN 0333-9831 Demographics In 2002-2003, French Hill had a population of 6,631. Giv'at Shapira had a population density of 10.9 persons per dunam (10,900 people/km¬≤), while Tzameret HaBira was less crowded, with 4.7 persons per dunam (4,700 people/km¬≤). The population is mostly Jewish, including a large number of immigrants from South America and the former Soviet Union.Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem, 2002-2003 Jerusalem, Israel: Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies; ISSN 0333-9831 In recent years, an increasing number of Arabs have been buying apartments in the neighborhood.Love thy neighbor, Jpost.com; accessed 15 August 2017. The neighborhood has also seen a large influx of Orthodox Jews in recent years. The ethnic mix is much more diverse than in most other Jewish areas in the city, partly due to the proximity of the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus. Schools and religious institutions French Hill has 9 synagogues. One of them, Kehillat Ramot Zion (), is a Masorti congregation, which are uncommon in Israel. The first elementary school in Israel run by the movement, the Frankel School, was established in Givat Shapira (French Hill). Arab-Israeli conflict The French Hill intersection which connects northern Jerusalem to Maale Adumim and the Dead Sea has been the site of eleven Palestinian terror attacks. According to an article by the US News and World Report, \\"the busy thoroughfare, which divides the Jewish neighborhood of French Hill from the Arab neighborhood of Shuafat, is the most accessible corner in the city for a West Bank terrorist looking for a crowd of Israelis.\\" In 2004, members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade shot and killed George Khoury, an Israeli Arab economics student, while he was jogging in French Hill.

When it landed on the Venusian surface on 15 December 1970, it became the first spacecraft to soft land on another planet and the first to transmit data from there back to Earth. Design The lander was designed to be able to survive pressure of up to (2,610 psi) and temperatures of . This was significantly greater than what was expected to be encountered but significant uncertainties as to the surface temperatures and pressure of Venus resulted in the designers‚Äô opting for a large margin of error. The degree of hardening added mass to the probe which limited the amount of mass available for scientific instruments both on the probe itself and the interplanetary bus. The interplanetary bus carried a solar wind charged particle detector and a cosmic ray detector. On the lander there were temperature and pressure sensors as well as an accelerometer to measure atmospheric density. The probe also carried a radar altimeter.  Launch  The probe was launched from Earth on 17 August 1970, at 05:38 UTC. It consisted of an interplanetary bus, based on the 3MV system, and a lander. During the flight to Venus, two in-course corrections were made using the bus' on-board KDU-414 engine.  Landing  Venera 7 entered the atmosphere of Venus on 15 December 1970. The lander remained attached to the interplanetary bus during the initial stages of atmospheric entry, to allow the bus to cool the lander to ‚àí8 ¬∞C (17 ¬∞F) for as long as possible. The lander was ejected once atmospheric buffeting broke the interplanetary bus's lock-on with Earth. The parachute opened at a height of 60 km, and atmospheric testing began with results showing the atmosphere to be 97% carbon dioxide. The parachute was initially reefed down to 1.8 square meters, opening to 2.5 square meters 13 minutes later, when the reefing line melted as designed. Six minutes after the unreefing, the parachute started to fail, resulting in a descent more rapid than planned. The parachute eventually failed completely, and the probe entered a period of freefall. As a result, the lander struck the surface of Venus at about 16.5 m/s (37 mph) at 05:37:10 UTC. The landing coordinates are .Patrick Moore, The data book of astronomy. CRC Press, 2000, p. 92. See Table 5-5, Missions to Venus, 1961‚Äì2000. Landing near Navka Planitia The probe appeared to go silent on impact, but recording tapes kept rolling. A few weeks later, upon a review of the tapes by the radio astronomer Oleg Rzhiga, another 23 minutes of very weak signals were found on them. The spacecraft had landed on Venus, and probably bounced onto its side, leaving the medium gain antenna not aimed correctly for strong signal transmission to Earth. The probe transmitted information to Earth for 53 minutes, which included about 20 minutes from the surface. It was found that the temperature at the surface of Venus was ¬± 20 ¬∞C. Using the temperature, and models of the atmosphere, a pressure of 9.0 MPa (1,300 psi) ¬± 1.5 MPa was calculated. From the spacecraft's rapid halt (from falling to stationary inside 0.2 seconds), it was possible to conclude that the craft had hit a solid surface with low levels of dust. The probe provided information about the surface of Venus, which could not be seen through a thick veil of atmosphere. The spacecraft definitively confirmed that humans cannot survive on the surface of Venus, and excluded the possibility that there is any liquid water on Venus.

He drew international attention with a series of publications questioning the existence of post-traumatic stress disorder, criticizing the medicalization of psychotherapy for trauma and the exaggeration of mental illness statistics. Recently he has argued that global mental health statistics should take into account differing ethnopsychiatric definitions.  Palestinian controversy  Summerfield has been a vocal critic of the Israeli Government's actions against Palestinians and of what he believes are Israeli physicians' violations of medical ethics. An October 16, 2004 editorial published by the British Medical Journal, concerning what he described as the level of Israeli violence against Palestinian children generated controversy and a number of responses both negative and positive.

He was the son and successor of Neriglissar. Though classical authors such as Berossus wrote that Labashi-Marduk was just a child when he became king, Babylonian documents indicate that he had been in charge of his own affairs before his rise to the throne, suggesting he was an adult. Labashi-Marduk's reign was very short, lasting only two to three months, with the latest evidence of Neriglissar being alive being from April 556 BC and documents dated to his successor, Nabonidus, appearing by the end of June that same year. Nabonidus led a coup against the king, deposing and killing Labashi-Marduk. The reason for Nabonidus's usurpation of the throne is unknown, Berossus simply describes the justification as Labashi-Marduk having indulged in \\"evil ways\\".  Background  Labashi-Marduk was the son and heir of Neriglissar (560‚Äì556 BC), the fourth king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Labashi-Marduk's mother was a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar II (605‚Äì562 BC), the empire's second and greatest king. Three daughters of Nebuchadnezzar are known; Kashshaya, Innin-etirat and Ba'u-asitu, and since no cuneiform text explicitly mentions which daughter Neriglissar married, the name of Labashi- Marduk's mother is unknown. Historian David B. Weisberg proposed in 1974 that Neriglissar's wife was Kashshaya, since her name appears together with the name of Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar in economic documents. Though no concrete evidence exists, this identification has generally been accepted by subsequent historians, such as Donald Wiseman and Jona Lendering. Neriglissar was the son of a man by the name Bel-shum-ishkun and might originally have been from the Aramean clan of the Puqudu, since Bel-shum-ishkun is recorded as originating in the Babylonian province of the same name. According to the later Hellenistic-era Babylonian writer and astronomer Berossus, Naboukhodonosoros (Nebuchadnezzar) died of sickness after a reign of 43 years and was succeeded by his son Euilmaradokhos (Amel-Marduk), who \\"ruled capriciously and had no regard for the laws\\". After ruling two years, Neriglassaros (Neriglissar) plotted against Amel-Marduk and had him deposed and killed. If Berossus is to be believed, Neriglissar was the leader of this conspiracy. It is likely that the conflict between Amel-Marduk and Neriglissar was a case of inter-family discord rather than some other form of rivalry. Neriglissar's claim to the throne likely came through his marriage to Nebuchadnezzar's daughter, who might have been significantly older than either of Nebuchadnezzar's sons (as she is attested significantly earlier in her father's reign).  Reign  Neriglissar likely died in April 556 BC. The last known documents dated to Neriglissar's reign are a contract from 12 April 556 BC at Babylon and a contract from 16 April that same year at Uruk. The Uruk King List (IM 65066, also known as King List 5), a record of rulers of Babylon from Shamash-shum-ukin (668‚Äì648 BC) to the Seleucid king Seleucus II Callinicus (246‚Äì225 BC), accords Neriglissar a reign of three years and eight months, consistent with the possibility that Neriglissar died in April. Labashi-Marduk thus became king of Babylon, but his reign proved to be brief. Berossus erroneously gives Labashi-Marduk's reign as nine months (though it is possible that this is a scribal error) and states that Labashi-Marduk's \\"evil ways\\" led to his friends plotting against him, eventually resulting in the child king being beaten to death. The plotters then agreed that Nabonnedos (Nabonidus), one of the plotters, should rule. The Uruk King List only gives Labashi-Marduk a reign of three months and contract tablets from Babylonia suggest that he might have ruled as briefly as just two months. By the end of June 556 BC, tablets dated to Nabonidus are known from across Babylonia. Although Berossus refers to Labashi-Marduk as a child, it possible that he became king as an adult since commercial texts from two years earlier indicate that Labashi-Marduk was in charge of his own affairs at that time. The reason for the coup against Labashi-Marduk is unknown. It is possible that despite Labashi-Marduk and his father being well-connected and wealthy, they were ultimately seen as commoners, lacking noble blood. Though Labashi-Marduk being the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar through his mother would have made him connected to the royal dynasty, it is also possible that he was the son of Neriglissar and another of his wives. Thus, Labashi-Marduk's rise to the throne might have signified a true break in the dynasty of Nebuchadnezzar and might as such have aroused opposition from the Babylonian populace.

He was also Count of Melgueil (as Raymond IV) from 1173 to 1190. Early life Born at Saint-Gilles, Gard, he was a son of Raymond V and Constance of France.Jonathan Sumption, The Albigensian Crusade, (Faber and Faber, 1999), 63. His maternal grandparents were Louis VI of France and his second wife Ad√©laide de Maurienne. His maternal uncles included Louis VII of France. In 1194 he succeeded his father as count of Toulouse. He immediately re-established peace with both Alfonso II of Aragon and with the Trencavel family. Marriages He was married five times: # His first wife, Ermessende of Pelet, Countess of Melgueil, whom he married in 1172, died in 1176 without issue. # His second wife was Beatrice of B√©ziers, sister of Roger II Trencavel;Fredric L. Cheyette, Ermengard of Narbonne and the World of the Troubadours, (Cornell University Press, 2001), 26. they divorced in 1189 and she was said to have become a Cathar parfaite (or perfect level Cathar) after the divorce. Raymond and Beatrice had one daughter, Constance of Toulouse, who was married first to King Sancho VII of Navarre, and secondly to Pierre- Bermond II of Sauve, lord of Anduze. # In October 1196 at Rouen he married Joan Plantagenet. She died on 4 September 1199. They had two surviving children: Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse (1198‚Äì1249) and Joan of Toulouse (1198-1255), second wife of Bernard II de la Tour, Lord of la Tour. # His fourth wife was the daughter of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. They divorced probably in late 1202. By early 1203 she had remarried to Thierry of Flanders. # January 1204, in Perpignan, he married his last wife, Eleanor of Aragon, daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon and Sancha of Castile. Problems with the Church Raymond VI held vast territories but his control of them was problematic. Aside from theoretically owing allegiance to the King of France, Raymond held Provence as a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.Setton, Kenneth Meyer; Wolff, Robert Lee and Hazard, Harry W. A History of the Crusades, Vol. 2, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1969 Henry II of England controlled neighboring Aquitaine through his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, who had a claim to Toulouse through her grandmother, Philippa of Toulouse, daughter of William IV, Count of Toulouse. Alfonso II of Aragon was involved in the affairs of Languedoc, stimulating emigration from the north to colonize newly reconquered lands in Aragon. In Toulouse, Raymond maintained the communal freedoms, extended exemptions from taxation, and extended his protection to the communal territory. A poet and a man of culture, he hated war but did not lack energy. According to Henri Pirenne, \\"At the end of the 12th century Languedoc was swarming with those mystics who aspired to lead the Church and the age back to apostolic simplicity, condemning both the religious hierarchy and the social order...\\"Pirenne, Henri. A History of Europe, Routledge, 2010 At first Innocent III tried to deal with the Cathars by peaceful conversion, sending into the affected regions a number of legates or representatives.\\"The Cathars an Introduction\\", International School of Toulouse Count Raymond declined to assist, although constantly embroiled with his vassals, and given the autonomy of the towns, Kenneth Setton questions whether Raymond \\"could have coped effectively with the challenge of heresy even if he had wished to do so.\\" The legates sent from Rome and France received little support as they were considered foreign reformers. Papal legate Pierre de Castelnau was sent to address Raymond's tolerance for the practice of the Cathars, but withdrew for six months in 1206 out of concerns for his safety. Pierre's assassination on January 15, 1208 led to Raymond's excommunication. The excommunication was lifted after Raymond humbled himself before the Pope. After the capture and massacre of B√©ziers, the siege and capture of Carcassonne, and the death of Raymond Roger Trencavel, all in 1209, he moved his camp, was again excommunicated by the Council of Montpellier in 1211, and tried to organize resistance against the Albigensian Crusade. More of a diplomat than a soldier, he was unable to stop the advance of Simon de Montfort, who conquered Toulouse. Raymond was exiled to England under his former brother-in-law John, King of England. In November 1215 Raymond and his son (the later Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse) were in Rome with Raymond-Roger, Count of Foix on the occasion of the Fourth Lateran Council to vindicate themselves and dispute the loss of their territories. Raymond's son-in-law, Pierre-Bermond II of Sauve, was also there to lay claim to the county of Toulouse, but this claim failed. Raymond and his son went from Rome to Genoa and thence to Marseille in February 1216. Raymond's son set out from Marseille to regain the family territories in Provence; in May 1216 he besieged Beaucaire and captured it on August 24. Meanwhile, Raymond went to Aragon, hoping to rally support. From there he engaged in secret negotiations with leaders in Toulouse during 1216.Chanson de la Croisade Albigeoise laisse 171; Guillaume de Puylaurens, Chronica 27. Simon de Montfort possibly believed that Raymond was on his way to the city in September 1216;Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay, Historia Albigensis 585. at any rate he returned in great haste from Beaucaire and conducted a partial sack of the city, apparently intended as punishment. Finally, on September 12, 1217, Raymond re-entered Toulouse again. Simon de Montfort immediately besieged the city once more. Simon was killed during the siege (on 25 June 1218); his son Amaury VI of Montfort took his place, and for five years the Crusade faltered. The failure of Louis VIII's campaigns, from 1219 to 1226, finally permitted Raymond, and his son and successor, to recover most of their territories. Raymond VI is represented as one of four figures on the ceiling of the Minnesota Supreme Court in the United States of America. His painting is next to Moses, Confucius, and Socrates, each painting representing an aspect of law. Raymond VI's painting is entitled \\"The Adjustment of Conflicting Interests\\", and the scene is of Raymond VI of Toulouse standing before the papal legate in 1208. Raymond argued successfully for city freedoms, extended exemptions from taxation, and protection of the communal territory from the church. The paintings were made by John LaFarge in 1903.

The college's main site is on Monks Road (B1308), specifically to the north, and to the south of Lindum Hill (A15). It was formerly known as the Lincoln College of Technology and was one of the sites for North Lincolnshire College. Satellite sites The college also has sites in Gainsborough, and also in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire (since merging with the former Newark and Sherwood College in 2007). The two branch sites are branded as Gainsborough College and Newark College respectively. More than 11,000 students are enrolled across the three sites, making it one of the largest educational establishments in the county of Lincolnshire. The college closed its small fourth campus in Louth, Lincolnshire in 2005. History The buildings of the City School, a former grammar school on Monks Road, now the Gibney Building part of the college built in 1885 as the School of Science and Art The college was earlier known as Lincoln Technical College and built on Cathedral Street in 1932. It became Lincoln College of Technology in the early 1970s, then administered by the City of Lincoln Education Committee. In the mid-1980s the college piloted the Technician Engineering Scholarship Scheme (TESS), funded by the Engineering Industry Training Board, a scheme for women.Technician Engineering Scholarship Scheme North Lincolnshire College (known as NLC from 1989) was created on 1 September 1987 by Lincolnshire County Council from combining the Lincoln site with Gainsborough College of Further Education and part of the Louth Further Education Centre. It previously had its headquarters on Cathedral Street until 1993. In the early 1990s it offered degrees and HNDs in Business Studies, Electronics, and Computer Studies in conjunction with Nottingham Trent University, becoming an associate college in 1994. In 1997 the Principal, Allan Crease, in a speech to the Association of Colleges criticised the means of funding from the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), where money was allocated by numbers at the college, and staff received less pay than those at school. In the late 1990s the University of Lincoln was being developed, subsuming Lincoln College of Art, and offered similar courses to the college, but the university was not fully built until the mid-2000s. In the late 1990s the college had a student population of around 15,000 and over 20,000 by 2001. It soon after changed its name to Lincoln College, not least because North Lincolnshire was an area not covered by the college. From 2010 it was funded by the East Midlands LSC, based in Leicester, although the local LSC office was based nearby on Kingsley Road in North Hykeham. In 2006 Lincoln College acquired the site of a former Tradex cash and carry store. The college plans to make this into a multi purpose drama and music facility. The new building will be state of the art and include a theatre, recording studios and rehearsal spaces. The project is being prepared and will be finished by the start of the 2007‚Äì2008 academic year. Buildings The new Deans Sport & Leisure centre Eight different buildings make up Lincoln College's main site, including the Abbey, Gibney, Sessions, Bishops and Cathedral Buildings. Bishops Building, located to the back of the site, contains a technology school. This has electronics courses including BTEC National Diploma Electrical and Electronic Engineering course. =City of Lincoln School= Part of the college, the Gibney Building, is the site of the former City School, previously the Lincoln Technical School, which for a time became the headquarters of the Lincoln Archaeological Trust in the early 1970s. From November 1940, boys from the Bablake School in Coventry were evacuated to the City of Lincoln School for two and a half years. Girls from Bablake School were evacuated to South Park High School for Girls (now Priory LSST). Roundhay Grammar School had been evacuated to Lincoln School (now LCHS) on Wragby Road. The school had around 600 boys in the 1960s. Former members of this school have their City School Lincoln Association. Curriculum The automotive technology program at Lincoln College includes training in fuel systems, electrical systems, driving diagnostics and transmissions, and techniques to install, repair and maintain vehicles. There are higher education courses in Computing Higher National Diplomas in Internet and Computer Science & NVQ in Logistics Operations Management. Instructors are certified through the Automotive Service of Excellence (ASE).Logistics Education areas. The college has higher education links with universities including the University of Lincoln and Nottingham Trent University.

He wrote also on Scottish folklore, and was a published poet. Life He was born at Applecross, Ross and Cromarty, on 20 March 1899, the son of Colonel John MacGregor M.D. of the Indian Medical Service. He was educated at Tain Academy. MacGregor was brought up in Tain and Inverness, and educated there and in Edinburgh. His books were mainly about Scotland, and his romanticising style incurred the displeasure of Compton Mackenzie, who caricatured him in some of his novels (perhaps unjustly so as MacGregor was forced to be critically realistic about certain aspects of life on the west coast, in his book The Western Isles). Judging by the title of the 1931 book A Last Voyage to St. Kilda. Being the Observations and Adventures of an Egotistic Private Secretary who was alleged to have been 'warned off' That Island by Admiralty Officials when attempting to emulate Robinson Crusoe at the Time of Its Evacuation there might have been something to caricature. In partial explanation, St Kilda was evacuated in 1930; at the time he was Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The same book was the subject of a legal case when MacGregor brought an injunction to prevent the distribution of The Edge of the World, a film by Michael Powell that he claimed was based on it. MacGregor lost the case. He lived in London for most of his adult life in Swan Court and Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea. Along with T. Ratcliffe Barnett, an Edinburgh minister and author, MacGregor reflects a transitional period during the first half of the 20th century when the north of Scotland was still rural and mostly unaffected by modern society. MacGregor was also a campaigner against cruelty to animals, including vivisection and hunting for sport.\\"Uproar at RSPCA meeting. Protests against 'blood sports'\\" The Times; 26 June 1931, p. 11. In the years before his death in 1970, he visited the United States often and was a mentor to a young Marion Barry, who later became mayor of Washington, D.C. His book about his childhood, The Goat Wife, tells the evocative story of his hard working and resourceful Aunt Dorothy, who left a comfortable existence in Edinburgh's Ann Street - reputed to be the most haunted street in Edinburgh - to begin life as a solo crofter in the Easter Ross village of Ardgay (then known locally as \\"High Wind\\"). Spanning the period before the First World War until the end of the Second, it captures the last remnants of the simplicity, privations and charm of Scottish rural community life.

The name Acampe was derived from the Greek word akampas, meaning \\"rigid\\", referring to the small, brittle, inflexible flowers. Acampe produce slow- growing, medium-sized vines that form very large vegetative masses in nature. They are noted for their thick, leathery, distichous leaves. They produce fragrant small to medium-sized yellow flowers, barred with orange or red stripes, in a few to many-flowered racemose inflorescence. The brittle sepals and petals look alike.

It is headquartered in the Brooklin Novo neighborhood of S√£o Paulo. History The company was originally formed as part of Telebr√°s, the state-owned telecom monopoly at the time. In 1998, Telebr√°s was demerged and privatized. Telef√≥nica bought Telesp, the S√£o Paulo division, and rebranded it to Telef√≥nica. On 15 April 2012, all Telef√≥nica services were rebranded again to Vivo, using the same strategy of unifying all its services in a unique brand, like Movistar (Hispanic America and Spain) and O2 (rest of Europe). =Merged companies= The following operators merged to form Vivo: ''' Owned by Telef√≥nica *Telef√≥nica Celular (Rio de Janeiro, Esp√≠rito Santo, Rio Grande do Sul) *Telebahia Celular (Bahia) *Telergipe Celular (Sergipe) *Telesp Landline (S√£o Paulo) Owned by Portugal Telecom *Telesp Celular (S√£o Paulo) *Global Telecom (Paran√°, Santa Catarina) *Norte Brasil Telecom (a.k.a.

The Vivo brand was launched on 13 April 2003, as a mobile phone service provider. It's the largest provider in Brazil with over 76 million users. It originated from the merger of several Brazilian mobile phone operations under a joint-venture owned equally by Portugal Telecom (PT) and Spain's Telef√≥nica. Until 2006, the group was composed of six holding companies which, as announced in November 2005, merged into a single holding company, \\"Vivo Participa√ß√µes\\". The operation was concluded on 22 February 2006. In July 2010, Telef√≥nica bought PT's shares. Today Vivo operates an UMTS, 3G networks and band 7 4G LTE in major cities. Initially, the network was based on analog AMPS (IS-95) and parts (resulting from acquisition of other companies), using TDMA (IS-136). These are all being converted to GSM since 2006, when, after years being the only CDMA network, Vivo announced a GSM network, and that it would operate in both CDMA and GSM. The CDMA network was gradually converted to CDMA2000 in the major cities. The CDMA network was discontinued in November 2012. Vivo brands Vivo Store in Rio de Janeiro.

Gohmert is a member of the Republican Party and is part of the Tea Party movement. In January 2015, he unsuccessfully challenged John Boehner for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. Early life and education Gohmert was born in Pittsburg, Texas, the son of Mary Sue (n√©e Brooks) and Louis Buller Gohmert. Gohmert was raised in Mount Pleasant, Texas, where he graduated from the local high school in 1971. He enrolled in Texas A&M; University, receiving U.S. Army scholarship and earning a B.A. in history in 1975. Gohmert commanded a cadet brigade in the Corps of Cadets and served as class president. He was also a student leader for the MSC Student Conference on National Affairs alongside future fellow Congressman Chet Edwards, and a member of the Ross Volunteer Company. Gohmert received a Juris Doctor degree from Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas, in 1977, where he was also class president. Early political career Gohmert attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps. He served in the JAG Corps at Fort Benning, Georgia, from 1978-82. The majority of his legal service in the U.S. Army was as a defense attorney. Gohmert was elected as a state district judge for Texas's 7th Judicial District, serving Smith County (Tyler, Texas) from 1992 to 2002. He was elected to three terms. He first saw national recognition for a 1996 probation requirement where he ordered an HIV positive man, who was convicted on motor vehicle theft charges, to seek the written consent from all future sexual partners on a court provided form notifying them of his HIV status. The order angered LGBT activists and civil libertarians. In 2002, Gohmert was appointed by Texas Governor Rick Perry to fill a vacancy as Chief Justice on Texas's 12th Court of Appeals, where he served a six-month term, which ended in 2003. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= A mid-decade redistricting made the 1st District significantly more conservative than its predecessor. Tyler, which had long anchored the 4th District, was shifted to the 1st District. In the 2004 Republican primary, Gohmert defeated State Representative Wayne Christian of Center, Texas. He defeated Democratic incumbent 1st District Congressman Max Sandlin in a landslide with 61% of the vote. He has never again faced another contest that close, and has been reelected seven times, never dropping below 68 percent of the vote. He only faced an independent in 2008, and a Libertarian in 2010. Gohmert handily won his seventh term in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 192,434 votes (73.9%), he defeated Democrat Shirley J. McKellar, who polled 62,847 ballots (24.1%). Libertarian Phil Gray polled 5,062 votes (1.9%). =Tenure= President George W. Bush in 2005 On July 29, 2009, Gohmert signed on as a co-sponsor of the defeated H.R. 1503. This bill would have amended \\"the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require the principal campaign committee of a candidate for election to the office of president to include with the committee's statement of organization a copy of the candidate's birth certificate, together with such other documentation as may be necessary to establish that the candidate meets the qualifications for eligibility to the office of president under the Constitution\\". Gohmert stated in a House Judiciary Hearing on May 15, 2013, that he believed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) did not act with due diligence concerning alleged bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev. His contention was that the FBI was more interested in Christian groups such as those led by Billy and Franklin Graham than in groups that might be considered less politically correct to target. Attorney General Eric Holder responded to his claims: \\"The only observation I was going to make is that you state as a matter of fact what the FBI did and did not do. Unless somebody has done something inappropriate, you don't have access to the FBI files ... I know what the FBI did. You cannot know what I know. That's all\\". Gohmert objected to this on the grounds that Holder had \\"challenge[d]\\" his character and made several unsuccessful attempts to inject his viewpoint as a point of personal privilege. On January 3, 2013, Gohmert broke ranks with the House leadership to nominate outspoken Florida Representative Allen West for Speaker of the House, although West narrowly lost his bid for re-election in November 2012, and was no longer a member of Congress.Chris Moody (January 3, 2013), \\"John Boehner re-elected as speaker of the House\\", yahoo.com; accessed August 24, 2014. Although he has previously ruled out the possibility of a bid for the U.S. Senate, he has recently been boosted by at least one \\"tea party\\" group (Grassroots America We the People) as a primary challenger to current Republican Senator John Cornyn. A vocal critic of House speaker John Boehner, Gohmert challenged his re-election to the speakership for the 114th Congress when Congress convened on January 6, 2015. Boehner was re-elected, even though 25 Freedom Caucus Republicans chose not to vote for himGohmert received 3 of those votes. In 2017, Gohmert expressed fear that he might become the target of gun violence similar to that experienced by former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and refused to hold public town hall meetings. In April 2018, Gohmert testified at a hearing supporting Derrick Miller, a former US Army National Guardsman Sergeant who was sentenced to life in prison with the chance of parole for the premeditated murder of an Afghan civilian during a battlefield interrogation. Fiscal policy Gohmert has signed the Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. He offered an alternative plan to kick-start the economy with his tax holiday bill that would allow taxpayers to be exempt for two months from having federal income tax taken out of their paychecks. He was one of a number of Republicans who voted against the Budget Control Act of 2011 on grounds it did not do enough to deal with the government's growing debt. Gohmert was one of four Republicans who joined 161 Democrats to vote against a balanced budget Constitutional amendment in November 2011. Gohmert supports and has voted for legislation in favor of school vouchers. Gohmert strongly supported the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress), a bill that would change the way in which discretionary appropriations for individual accounts are projected in the Congressional Budget Office's baseline. Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current year's appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward. Gohmert said that \\"conservatives have advocated for years that there should be no automatic spending increases in any federal department's budget ... that has been a trap so when we simply slow the rate of increase, we are accused of making draconian cuts.\\" He argued the legislation would make clearer \\"what is an increase and what is a cut\\", put the government in the same situation as American families, and help with the task of getting the debt under control. Climate change and the environment Gohmert rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, and has asserted that data supporting it is fraudulent. He opposes cap-and-trade legislation, such as the one that was passed in the U.S. House when it had a Democratic majority, and supports expanding drilling, and exploration in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). In an interview on the C-SPAN program Washington Journal on July 8, 2015, after Pope Francis issued his second encyclical Laudato si', Gohmert said the Pope was incorrect in identifying climate change as a serious problem. Gohmert supported the U. S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. In a 2012 meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee, Gohmert stated his strong support of a trans-Alaskan pipeline, as a means for caribou to have more sex. According to Gohmert, \\"When [the caribou] want to go on a date, they invite each other to head over to the pipeline. So [his] real concern now [is] ... if oil stops running through the pipeline ... do we need a study to see how adversely the caribou would be affected if that warm oil ever quit flowing?\\" Gohmert's comments were not favorably received by the rest of the committee. Social policy Gohmert speaking at a rally in 2011 Gohmert opposes abortion. He has stated that he believes that life begins at conception. Gohmert sponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act. Gohmert voted for the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, a bill that prohibits the transportation of a minor across state lines for the purposes of an abortion without the consent of the minor's parents. He has 100% pro-life voting record rating from the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC). At a congressional hearing on May 23, 2013, on an abortion bill that would ban the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy, Gohmert told the story of another couple he knew that decided to go through with their pregnancy despite learning of fetal anomalies. He told Zink, a woman witness, that she should have gone through with her pregnancy despite some doctor's opinion that the brain function was impaired, and then have a better assessment of the baby's health once it was born. Gohmert explained: \\"Ms. Zink, having my great sympathy and empathy both, I still come back wondering, shouldn't we wait, like that couple did, and see if the child can survive before we decide to rip him apart? ... So these are ethical issues, they're moral issues, they're difficult issues, and the parents should certainly be consulted. But it just seems like, it's a more educated decision if the child is in front of you to make those decisions\\", Gohmert said. Gohmert opposes LGBT rights. In 2009, he voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a bill that expanded the federal hate crime law to cover crimes biased by the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2010, Gohmert opposed allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the U.S. military and voted against the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act. In 2019, Gohmert expressed his strong opposition to the Equality Act, a bill that would protect LGBT people against discrimination. On December 16, 2012, two days after the Sandy Hook shootings, Gohmert appeared on Fox News Sunday and suggested that the tragedy would have never happened had the teachers been armed. He told host Chris Wallace, \\"I wish to God that she [principal Dawn L. Hochsprung] had an M4 in her office, locked up so when she heard gunfire, she pulls it out... and takes him out and takes his head off before he can kill those precious kids.\\" He claimed that the 20 victims who had been killed with a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle had \\"defensive wounds\\". On March 22, 2016, Gohmert was one of only 4 representatives to vote against H.R. 4742 (383 voted for the act). H.R. 4742 is a bill to authorize the National Science Foundation to support entrepreneurial programs for women. Gohmert gave the following quotes in defense of his position: Gohmert acknowledged that the bill was \\"well intentioned,\\" but said that \\"this program is designed to discriminate against that young, poverty-stricken boy and to encourage the girl. Forget the boy. Encourage the girl.\\" In December 2018, with the possibility of a government shutdown that month looming, the House passed a bill funding the government through February and providing 5.7 billion for the border wall between the United States and Mexico favored by President Trump hours after he told House Republican leaders that he would not sign a package passed in the Senate due to it not providing money for the barrier. After the shutdown commenced, Gohmert was asked by Griff Jenkins how long President Trump should keep the government closed, Gohmert noting that it was only a fourth of the government that was shutdown as Congress had already approved other portions of the funding through September 2019 and answered that Trump should keep it closed \\"till hell freezes over\\" as Congress owed Americans border security. Gohmert added that the most compassionate thing the US could do for Mexico and Central America was to not bestow either country with \\"money that ends up in the hands of drug cartels.\\" In a later statement, Gohmert said, \\"It is simply outrageous that people who live behind walls, gated communities, have armed body guards and lead the Democrat Party, like millionaire Speaker Pelosi, would deny the American public the simple right to be safe from dangerous criminal elements included in the groups pouring illegally into our country.\\" COVID-19 Although high-quality evidence of its effectiveness is lacking, Gohmert strongly supports the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. He has urged the Food and Drug Administration in April 2020 to approve the drug as an official treatment. In April 2020, Gohmert was criticized after falsely claiming that Germany had invented a \\"mist\\" that killed the coronavirus. Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19 on July 29, 2020, a day after he attended a House Judiciary Committee hearing without wearing a mask. In an interview, Gohmert suggested that he might have contracted the disease from wearing a mask. One of Gohmert's aides emailed Politico with criticism, thanking Politico for letting the office know that Gohmert tested positive for the Coronavirus; that \\"Louie requires full staff to be in the office, including three interns, so that 'we could be an example to America on how to open up safely'\\"; and that \\"people were often berated for wearing a mask\\". Gohmert stated he plans to take hydroxychloroquine as part of his treatment. On August 12, 2020, Gohmert reported that he successfully used Hydroxycholorquine, azithromycin, the z-pak, zinc, vitamins and a steroid nebulizer to treat his Coronavirus. On September 19, 2020, Gohmert was reported to be \\"glad to be on the other side\\" and to have donated his blood plasma (presumably for use in convalescent plasma therapy) . =Committee assignments= Committee on the Judiciary * Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice * Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations (Vice Chair) Committee on Natural Resources (Vice Chair) * Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources * Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations =Caucus memberships= Gohmert with Ben Shapiro in 2018 * Freedom Caucus * Israel Allies Caucus *United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus * Tea Party Caucus * Republican Study Committee * Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus *Congressional Western Caucus Controversies =\\"Terror baby\\"= In a speech about national security made on the House floor in June 2010, Gohmert claimed that a retired FBI agent had told him that one of the things the FBI had been looking at were terrorist cells overseas sending young women to become pregnant so they would deliver the baby in the United States, and then take the baby with them back to be raised as a terrorist. When adult, this operative‚Äîa U.S. citizen by birth‚Äîcould be easily infiltrated in the U.S. to carry out terrorist actions. On August 12, 2010, Gohmert appeared on Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ to defend comments he had recently made on the floor of the House regarding \\"terror babies\\". On Fox Business News, Gohmert later claimed that an airline passenger with a relative in Hamas had a grandchild who was to be intentionally born in the United States. In the interview, Gohmert asserted that pregnant women from the Middle East are traveling to the U.S. on tourist visas, planning to deliver the child there. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that children born on U.S. soil are U.S. citizens at birth. Gohmert asserted that the child would then be returned to the mother's home country and be submitted to a life of terrorist training. When repeatedly asked by the host for any evidence of this, Gohmert did not provide substantiation for either the ex-FBI agent story or the airline passenger story, but he did refer to a Washington Post article that said Chinese tourists sometimes travel to the U.S. to give birth in the U.S. Gohmert said this practice takes advantage of a \\"gaping hole in the security of our country\\". =Muslim Brotherhood= On June 13, 2012, Gohmert was one of five Republican United States representatives (including Michele Bachmann, Trent Franks, Tom Rooney, Lynn Westmoreland) to send letters to the Inspectors General of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice and the Department of State outlining their \\"serious national security concerns\\", and asking for \\"answers to questions regarding the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical groups' access to top Obama administration officials.\\" In the letter, Gohmert and the other U.S. lawmakers wrote about information they claim \\"raises serious questions about Department of State policies and activities that appear to be a result of influence operations conducted by individuals and organizations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\\" One of the letters in particular to Ambassador Harold W. Geisel, the Deputy Inspector General of the United States Department of State, mentioned the Deputy Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, as an example of the undue influence. The letter said that Abedin, wife of former U.S. representative Anthony Weiner, who had access to sensitive national security and policy information, \\"has three family members‚Äìher late father, her mother and her brother‚Äìconnected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations\\", as backed up by a study by the Center for Security Policy. The letter and the Center for Security Policy's accusation were widely denounced as a smear, and achieved \\"near-universal condemnation\\", including from several prominent Republicans such as John McCain, John Boehner, Scott Brown, and Marco Rubio. Gohmert and his colleagues were praised by Newt Gingrich as the \\"National Security Five\\" in an editorial on the Politico website. Gingrich expressed he favors investigating the Muslim Brotherhood, and made clear his support to Gohmert and the other four state-elected representatives for rising up concerns that improve national security. Columnist Cal Thomas replied, to accusations of \\"McCarthyism\\", that the real possibility of infiltration by Islamic extremists deserves to be investigated. =Comments on Robert Mueller= Representative Gohmert was one of three Republicans who called for the resignation of Robert Mueller, the prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, on the grounds that they believe Mueller can not conduct his investigation fairly \\"because of his relationship with James Comey, his successor at the bureau\\"Kyle Cheney, November 3, 2017, Politico, Conservatives introduce measure demanding Mueller's resignation: It's the latest sign of GOP resistance to the special counsel's Russia probe., Retrieved November 5, 2017 As of March 2016, \\"[s]ix people connected to President Trump have been charged by the special counsel with an array of crimes, including financial fraud and lying to Congress and investigators. Five have been convicted or pleaded guilty. Twenty-eight others, including 26 Russians, also face charges.\\" However, Mueller did not exonerate Trump on the issue of obstruction - a fact he reiterated during the House Judiciary Committee hearing. In a June 2019 interview with Politico, Gohmert referred to Mueller as an \\"anal opening.\\" =Comments on George Soros= In December 2018, Gohmert was a guest on Varney & Co. on Fox Business News discussing Google's work in China, when Gohmert digressed from the topic to say that it reminded him that \\"George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn't know it from the damage he's inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned. This same kind of thing ‚Äî Google coming from a free country and helping oppress.\\" The allegation, which is popular on right-wing propaganda websites, has been thoroughly debunked by credible news sources, and it denigrates Soros's childhood experiences surviving the Holocaust. Within an hour, host Stuart Varney said on air, \\"In the last hour, one of our guests, Congressman Louie Gohmert, for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros, and made unsubstantiated and false allegations against him. I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program or anyone at Fox Business.\\" Gohmert later responded that his words had not been anti-Semitic and were actually a \\"pro-Jewish statement on my part.\\" =Whistleblower outing= In an open impeachment hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Gohmert spoke the name of a man widely thought to be the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment. =Lynching= On February 26, 2020, Louie Gohmert voted against making lynching a federal hate crime. Gohmert stated the 10-year sentence for lynching stated in the act was \\"ridiculous,\\" and that crimes such as lynching should be prosecuted through state murder statutes, which is punishable up to death in Texas. Gohmert opposes federal hate crime legislation, saying that some hate crime legislation is unnecessary because assault and murder are already crimes.

Top image is in plane polarized light (PPL); bottom image is in cross polarized light (XPL). Blue epoxy fills pore spaces. Photomicrograph of a lithic wacke (sandstone). Top image is in plane polarized light (PPL); bottom image is in cross polarized light (XPL). Blue epoxy fills pore spaces. Greywacke or graywacke (German grauwacke, signifying a grey, earthy rock) is a variety of sandstone generally characterized by its hardness, dark color, and poorly sorted angular grains of quartz, feldspar, and small rock fragments or lithic fragments set in a compact, clay-fine matrix. It is a texturally immature sedimentary rock generally found in Paleozoic strata. The larger grains can be sand- to gravel- sized, and matrix materials generally constitute more than 15% of the rock by volume. The term \\"greywacke\\" can be confusing, since it can refer to either the immature (rock fragment) aspect of the rock or its fine-grained (clay) component. The origin of greywacke was unknown until turbidity currents and turbidites were understood, since, according to the normal laws of sedimentation, gravel, sand and mud should not be laid down together. Geologists now attribute its formation to submarine avalanches or strong turbidity currents. These actions churn sediment and cause mixed-sediment slurries, in which the resulting deposits may exhibit a variety of sedimentary features. Supporting the turbidity current origin theory is that deposits of greywacke are found on the edges of the continental shelves, at the bottoms of oceanic trenches, and at the bases of mountain formational areas. They also occur in association with black shales of deep sea origin. Greywackes are mostly grey, brown, yellow or black, dull-colored sandy rocks which may occur in thick or thin beds along with shales and limestones. They are abundant in Wales, the south of Scotland, the Longford Massif in Ireland and the Lake District National Park of England; they compose the majority of the main alps that make up the backbone of New Zealand; sandstones classified as feldspathic and lithic greywacke have been recognized in Ecca Group in South Africa. They can contain a very great variety of minerals, the principal ones being quartz, orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars, calcite, iron oxides and graphitic, carbonaceous matters, together with (in the coarser kinds) fragments of such rocks as felsite, chert, slate, gneiss, various schists, and quartzite. Among other minerals found in them are biotite, chlorite, tourmaline, epidote, apatite, garnet, hornblende, augite, sphene and pyrites. The cementing material may be siliceous or argillaceous and is sometimes calcareous. As a rule greywackes do not contain fossils, but organic remains may be common in the finer beds associated with them. Their component particles are usually not very rounded or polished, and the rocks have often been considerably indurated by recrystallization, such as the introduction of interstitial silica. In some districts the greywackes are cleaved, but they show phenomena of this kind much less perfectly than the slates. Some varieties include feldspathic greywacke, which is rich in feldspar, and lithic greywacke, which is rich in tiny rock fragments. Although the group is so diverse that it is difficult to characterize mineralogically, it has a well-established place in petrographical classifications because these peculiar composite arenaceous deposits are very frequent among Silurian and Cambrian rocks, and are less common in Mesozoic or Cenozoic strata. Their essential features are their gritty character and their complex composition. By increasing metamorphism, greywackes frequently pass into mica-schists, chloritic schists and sedimentary gneisses.

Honor√© Daumier satirizes the bourgeoisie scandalized by the Paris Salon's Venuses. An art exhibition is traditionally the space in which art objects (in the most general sense) meet an audience. The exhibit is universally understood to be for some temporary period unless, as is rarely true, it is stated to be a \\"permanent exhibition\\". In American English, they may be called \\"exhibit\\", \\"exposition\\" (the French word) or \\"show\\". In UK English, they are always called \\"exhibitions\\" or \\"shows\\", and an individual item in the show is an \\"exhibit\\". Such expositions may present pictures, drawings, video, sound, installation, performance, interactive art, new media art or sculptures by individual artists, groups of artists or collections of a specific form of art. The art works may be presented in museums, art halls, art clubs or private art galleries, or at some place the principal business of which is not the display or sale of art, such as a coffeehouse. An important distinction is noted between those exhibits where some or all of the works are for sale, normally in private art galleries, and those where they are not. Sometimes the event is organized on a specific occasion, like a birthday, anniversary or commemoration. Types of exhibitions Exhibition space being readied for a show at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery There are different kinds of art exhibitions, in particular there is a distinction between commercial and non-commercial exhibitions. A commercial exhibition or trade fair is often referred to as an art fair that shows the work of artists or art dealers where participants generally have to pay a fee. A vanity gallery is an exhibition space of works in a gallery that charges the artist for use of the space. Temporary museum exhibitions typically display items from the museum's own collection on a particular period, theme or topic, supplemented by loans from other collections, mostly those of other museums. They normally include no items for sale; they are distinguished from the museum's permanent displays, and most large museums set aside a space for temporary exhibitions. Exhibitions in commercial galleries are often entirely made up of items that are for sale, but may be supplemented by other items that are not. Typically, the visitor has to pay (extra on top of the basic museum entrance cost) to enter a museum exhibition, but not a commercial one in a gallery. Retrospectives look back over the work of a single artist; other common types are individual exhibitions or \\"solo shows\\", and group exhibitions or \\"group shows\\"). The Biennale is a large exhibition held every two years, often intending to gather together the best of international art; there are now many of these. A travelling exhibition is an exhibition seen at several venues, sometimes across the world. Exhibitions of new or recent art can be juried, invitational, or open. * A juried exhibition, such as the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London, or the Iowa Biennial, has an individual (or group) acting as judge of the submitted artworks, selecting which are to be shown. If prizes are to be awarded, the judge or panel of judges will usually select the prizewinners as well. * In an invitational exhibition, such as the Whitney Biennial, the organizer of the show asks certain artists to supply artworks and exhibits them. * An open or \\"non-juried\\" exhibition, such as the Kyoto Triennial,Kyoto Triennial allows anybody to enter artworks and shows them all. A type of exhibition that is usually non-juried is a mail art exhibition. History Paris Salon of 1787, held at the Louvre \\"A Slight Attack of Third Dimentia Brought on by Excessive Study of the Much Talked of Cubist Pictures in the International Exhibition at New York,\\" drawn by John French Sloan in April 1913, satirizing the Armory Show. The art exhibition has played a crucial part in the market for new art since the 18th and 19th centuries. The Paris Salon, open to the public from 1737, rapidly became the key factor in determining the reputation, and so the price, of the French artists of the day. The Royal Academy in London, beginning in 1769, soon established a similar grip on the market, and in both countries artists put great efforts into making pictures that would be a success, often changing the direction of their style to meet popular or critical taste. The British Institution was added to the London scene in 1805, holding two annual exhibitions, one of new British art for sale, and one of loans from the collections of its aristocratic patrons. These exhibitions received lengthy and detailed reviews in the press, which were the main vehicle for the art criticism of the day. Critics as distinguished as Denis Diderot and John Ruskin held their readers attention by sharply divergent reviews of different works, praising some extravagantly and giving others the most savage put-downs they could think of. Many of the works were already sold, but success at these exhibitions was a crucial way for an artist to attract more commissions. Among important early one-off loan exhibitions of older paintings were the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857, and the Exhibition of National Portraits in London, at what is now the Victoria and Albert Museum, held in three stages in 1866-68. As the academic art promoted by the Paris Salon, always more rigid than London, was felt to be stifling French art, alternative exhibitions, now generally known as the Salon des Refus√©s (\\"Salon of the Refused\\") were held, most famously in 1863, when the government allowed them an annex to the main exhibition for a show that included √âdouard Manet's Luncheon on the Grass (Le d√©jeuner sur l‚Äôherbe) and James McNeill Whistler's Girl in White. This began a period where exhibitions, often one-off shows, were crucial in exposing the public to new developments in art, and eventually Modern art. Important shows of this type were the Armory Show in New York City in 1913 and the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936. Museums started holding large loan exhibitions of historic art in the late 19th century, as also did the Royal Academy, but the modern \\"blockbuster\\" museum exhibition, with long queues and a large illustrated catalogue, is generally agreed to have been introduced by the exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun held in several cities in the 1970s. Many exhibitions, especially in the days before good photographs were available, are important in stimulating research in art history; the exhibition held in Bruges in 1902 (poster illustrated below) had a crucial impact on the study of Early Netherlandish painting. In 1968 Art fairs in Europe became quite the fashion with the advent of the Cologne Art Fair which was sponsored by the Cologne Art Dealers Association. Because of the high admission standards of the Cologne fair a rival fair was organized in D√ºsseldorf which enabled less regarded galleries opportunity to meet with an international public. The fairs took place during the fall months. This rivalry continued for a few years which provided the Basel Art Fair the opportunity to interject the Basel fair in early summer. These fairs became extremely important to galleries, dealers and publishers as they provided the possibility of worldwide distribution. D√ºsseldorf and Cologne merged their efforts. Basel soon became the most important art fair. In 1976, the Felluss Gallery under the direction of Elias Felluss, in Washington DC organized the first American dealer art fair. \\"The Washington International Art Fair\\" or \\"Wash Art\\" for brevity. This American fair met with fierce opposition by those galleries interested in maintaining distribution channels for European artwork already in place. The Washington fair introduced the European idea of dealer fairs to art dealers throughout the United States. Following the advent of Wash Art, many fairs developed throughout the United States. Preservation issues Although preservation issues are often disregarded in favor of other priorities during the exhibition process, they should certainly be considered so that possible damage to the collection is minimized or limited. As all objects in the library exhibition are unique and to some extent vulnerable, it is essential that they be displayed with care. Not all materials are able withstand the hardships of display, and therefore each piece needs to be assessed carefully to determine its ability to withstand the rigors of an exhibition. In particular, when exhibited items are archival artifacts or paper-based objects, preservation considerations need be emphasized because damage and change in such materials is cumulative and irreversible.Mary Todd Glaser, \\"Protecting Paper and Book Collections During Exhibition,\\" Northeast Document Conservation Center, NEDCC.org , (accessed August 9, 2009). Two trusted sources ‚Äì the National Information Standard Organization's Environmental Conditions for Exhibiting Library and Archival Materials, and the British Library's Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials ‚Äì have established indispensable criteria to help curtail the deleterious effects of exhibitions on library and archival materials. These criteria may be divided into five main preservation categories: Environmental concerns of the exhibition space; Length of the exhibition; Individual cases; Display methods used on individual objects; and Security. =Environmental concerns of the exhibition space= File:Exposition Richard Prince, American Prayer - montage 23.jpg1 February 2011 File:Exposition Richard Prince, American Prayer - montage 25.jpg25 February 2011 File:Exposition Richard Prince, American Prayer - montage 28.jpg25 February 2011 File:Exposition Richard Prince, American Prayer - montage 33.jpg8 March 2011 File:Exposition Richard Prince, American Prayer - sc√©nographie 21.jpg26 June 2011 File:Exposition Richard Prince, American Prayer 04.jpg26 June 2011 The main concerns of exhibition environments include light, relative humidity, and temperature. ;Light Light is used to draw attention to the exhibits. Interior of Tartu Art Museum with the exhibition \\"Changing Tartu in Four Views\\". Light wavelength, intensity, and duration contribute collectively to the rate of material degradation in exhibitions.National Preservation Office, Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials, Preservation Management Series (London: British Library, 2000), 2. The intensity of visible light in the display space should be low enough to avoid object deterioration, but bright enough for viewing. A patron‚Äôs tolerance of low level illumination can be aided by reducing ambient light levels to a level lower than that falling on the exhibit.National Preservation Office, Guidance for Exhibiting Library and Archive Materials, Preservation Management Series (London: British Library, 2000), 2. Visible light levels should be maintained at between 50 lux and 100 lux depending on the light sensitivity of objects.National Information Standards Organization, Environmental Conditions for Exhibiting Library and Archival Materials (Bethesda, MD: NISO Press., 2001), 6. An items level of toleration will depend on the inks or pigments being exposed and the duration of the exhibition time. A maximum exhibition length should initially be determined for each exhibited item based on its light sensitivity, anticipated light level, and its cumulative past and projected exhibition exposure. Light levels need to be measured when the exhibition is prepared. UV light meters will check radiation levels in an exhibit space, and data event loggers help determine visible light levels over an extended period of time. Blue wool standards cards can also be utilized to predict the extent to which materials will be damaged during exhibits.Gary Thompson, The Museum Environment, 2nd ed. (London: Butterworths, 1986), 183. UV radiation must be eliminated to the extent it is physically possible; it is recommended that light with a wavelength below 400 nm (ultraviolet radiation) be limited to no more than 75 microwatts per lumen at 10 to 100 lux.NISO, 6. Furthermore, exposure to natural light is undesirable because of its intensity and high UV content. When such exposure is unavoidable, preventative measures must be taken to control UV radiation, including the use of blinds, shades, curtains, UV filtering films, and UV- filtering panels in windows or cases. Artificial light sources are safer options for exhibition. Among these sources, incandescent lamps are most suitable because they emit little or no UV radiation.Edward P. Adcock, IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 27. Fluorescent lamps, common in most institutions, may be used only when they produce a low UV output and when covered with plastic sleeves before exhibition.Edward P. Adcock, IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 27. Though tungsten-halogen lamps are currently a favorite artificial lighting source, they still give off significant amounts of UV radiation; use these only with special UV filters and dimmers.Edward P. Adcock, IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 27. Lights should be lowered or turned off completely when visitors are not in the exhibition space. ;Relative humidity (RH) The exhibition space's relative humidity (RH) should be set to a value between 35% and 50%.NISO, 6. The maximum acceptable variation should be 5% on either side of this range. Seasonal changes of 5% are also allowed. The control of relative humidity is especially critical for vellum and parchment materials, which are extremely sensitive to changes in relative humidity and may contract violently and unevenly if displayed in too dry an environment. ;Temperature For preservation purposes, cooler temperatures are always recommended. The temperature of the display space should not exceed 72 ¬∞F.Edward P. Adcock, IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 8. A lower temperature of down to 50 ¬∞F can be considered safe for a majority of objects. The maximum acceptable variation in this range is 5 ¬∞F, meaning that the temperature should not go above 77 ¬∞F and below 45 ¬∞F. As temperature and relative humidity are interdependent, temperature should be reasonably constant so that relative humidity can be maintained as well. Controlling the environment with 24-hour air conditioning and dehumidification is the most effective way of protecting an exhibition from serious fluctuations. =Length of the exhibition= Poster, Bruges, 1902 One factor that influences how well materials will fare in an exhibition is the length of the show. The longer an item is exposed to harmful environmental conditions, the more likely that it will experience deterioration. Many museums and libraries have permanent exhibitions, and installed exhibitions have the potential to be on the view without any changes for years. Damage from a long exhibition is usually caused by light. The degree of deterioration is different for each respective object. For paper-based items, the suggested maximum length of time that they should be on display is three months per year, or 42 kilolux hours of light per year ‚Äì whichever comes first.Edward P. Adcock, IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 6. An exhibition log report, including records of the length of the exhibition time and the light level of the display, may prevent objects from being exhibited too frequently. Displayed items need to be inspected regularly for evidence of damage or change.Edward P. Adcock, IFLA Principles for the Care and Handling of Library Material (Paris: IFLA, 1998), 6. It is recommended that high-quality facsimiles of especially delicate or fragile materials be displayed in lieu of originals for longer exhibitions.Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 37. =Individual cases= Library or archival materials are usually displayed in display cases or frames. Cases provide a physically and chemically secure environment. Vertical cases are acceptable for small or single-sheet items, and horizontal cases can be used for a variety of objects, including three-dimensional items such as opened or closed books, and flat paper items. All these objects can be arranged simultaneously in one horizontal case under a unified theme. Materials used for case construction should be chosen carefully because component materials can easily become a significant source of pollutants or harmful fumes for displayed objects. Outgassing from materials used in the construction of the exhibition case and/or fabrics used for lining the case can be destructive. Pollutants may cause visible deterioration, including discoloration of surfaces and corrosion. Examples of evaluative criteria to be used in deeming materials suitable for use in exhibit display could be the potential of contact-transfer of harmful substances, water solubility or dry-transfer of dyes, the dry- texture of paints, pH, and abrasiveness.NISO, 10. New cases may be preferred, constructed of safe materials such as metal, plexiglass, or some sealed woods.Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 37. Separating certain materials from the display section of an exhibition case by lining relevant surfaces with an impermeable barrier film will help protect items from damage. Any fabrics that line or decorate the case (e.g. polyester blend fabric), and any adhesives used in the process, should also be tested to determine any risk. Using internal buffers and pollutant absorbers, such as silica gel, activated carbon, or zeolite, is a good way to control relative humidity and pollutants. Buffers and absorbers should be placed out of sight, in the base or behind the backboard of a case. If the case is to be painted, it is recommended oil paints be avoided; acrylic or latex paint is preferable. =Display methods= A photography exhibition in Moscow, 2010 There are two kinds of objects displayed at the library and archival exhibition ‚Äì bound materials and unbound materials. Bound materials include books and pamphlets, and unbound materials include manuscripts, cards, drawings, and other two-dimensional items. The observance of proper display conditions will help minimize any potential physical damage. All items displayed must be adequately supported and secured. ;Unbound materials Unbound materials, usually single-sheet items, need to be attached securely to the mounts, unless matted or encapsulated. Metal fasteners, pins, screws, and thumbtacks should not come in direct contact with any exhibit items.Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 11. Instead, photo corners, polyethylene, or polyester film straps may hold the object to the support. Objects may also be encapsulated in polyester film, though old and untreated acidic papers should be professionally deacidified before encapsulation.Glaser, NEDCC.org , (accessed August 09, 2009). Avoid potential slippage during encapsulation ‚Äì when possible, use ultrasonic or heat seals. For objects that need to be hung (and that may require more protection than lightweight polyester film), matting would be an effective alternative. Objects in frames should be separated from harmful materials through matting, glazing, and backing layers. Matting, which consists of two pH-neutral or alkaline boards with a window cut in the top board to enable the object to be seen, can be used to support and enhance the display of single sheet or folded items. Backing layers of archival cardboard should be thick enough to protect objects. Moreover, any protective glazing used should never come in direct contact with objects.Gail E. Farr, Archives and Manuscripts: Exhibits (Chicago: Society of American Archivists, 1980), 42. Frames should be well- sealed and hung securely, allowing a space for air circulation between the frame and the wall. ;Bound materials The most common way to display bound materials is closed and lying horizontally. If a volume is shown open, the object should be open only as much as its binding allows. Common practice is to open volumes at an angle no greater than 135¬∞.NISO, 12. There are some types of equipment that help support volumes as they displayed openly: blocks or wedges, which hold a book cover to reduce stain at the book hinge; cradles, which support bound volumes as they lay open without stress to the binding structure; and polyester film strips, which help to secure open leaves. Textblock supports are best used in conjunction with book cradles where the textblock is greater than 1/2 inch, or where the textblock noticeably sags.NPO, 6. Regardless of its method of support, however, it is worth noting that any book that is kept open for long periods can cause damage. One should turn an exhibited book's pages every few days in order to protect pages from overexposure to light and spread any strain on the binding structure. =Security= Because exhibited items are often of special interest, they demand a high level of security to reduce the risk of loss from theft or vandalism. Exhibition cases should be securely locked. In addition, cases may be glazed with a material that hinders penetration and that when broken does not risk shards of glass falling on the exhibits.Nelly Balloffet, and Jenny Hille, Preservation and Conservation for Libraries and Archives (Chicago: ALA, 2005), 154. Whenever possible, the exhibition area should be patrolled; a 24-hour security presence is recommended when precious treasures are exhibited.Gail E. Farr, Archives and Manuscripts: Exhibits (Chicago: Society of American Archivists, 1980), 22. Finally, the exhibition is best protected when equipped with intruder alarms, which can be fitted at entry points to the building and internal areas.

Raymond VII Family and marriages Raymond was born at the Ch√¢teau de Beaucaire, the son of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Joan of England. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Henry II of England and a nephew of kings Richard I and John of England. In March 1211, Raymond VII married Sancha of Aragon. They had one daughter, Joan, and were divorced in 1241. He was engaged to Sanchia of Provence, but she married Richard of Cornwall instead. In 1243 Raymond married Margaret of Lusignan, the daughter of Hugh X of Lusignan and Isabella of Angoul√™me. They had no children and the Council of Lyons in 1245 granted Raymond a divorce. He then tried to get support of Blanche, mother of King Louis IX of France, to marry Beatrice of Provence, who had just become Countess of Provence, but Beatrice married Blanche's son Charles instead. Life During the Albigensian Crusade in May 1216, Raymond set out from Marseille and besieged Beaucaire, which he captured on 24 August. He fought to reconquer the county of Toulouse from Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester and later Simon's son Amaury VI of Montfort. He succeeded his father in 1222. At the moment of his accession, he and the new count of Foix, Roger Bernard II the Great, besieged Carcassonne. On 14 September 1224, the Albigensian Crusaders surrendered and the war came to an end, each southern lord making peace with the church. However, in 1225, the council of Bourges excommunicated him and launched a crusade against him, the king of France, Louis VIII, called the Lion, wanting to renew the conflict in order to enforce his royal rights in Languedoc. Roger-Bernard tried to keep the peace, but the king rejected his embassy and the counts of Foix and Toulouse took up arms again. The war was largely a discontinuous series of skirmishes and, in January 1229, Raymond, defeated, was forced to sign the Treaty of Paris (also known as the \\"Treaty of Meaux\\"). By this treaty he ceded the former viscounty of Trencavel to Louis IX and his daughter Joan was forced to marry Alphonse, brother of the king. When Raymond died, Alphonse became count of Toulouse, and after Alphonse's death the county was annexed by France. Raymond VII was buried beside his mother Joan in Fontevrault Abbey.

The term dates from the late 19th century, when the \\"safety bicycle\\" became popular in Europe, the United States, and Australia. Historically, bicycles lessened the need for horses, fuel and vehicle maintenance. Though their use has waned over the years in many armies, they continue to be used in unconventional armies such as militias.  History  = Origins = American Bicycle Corps at Fort Missoula in 1897 Numerous experiments were carried out in the late 19th century to determine the possible role of bicycles and cycling within military establishments, primarily because they can carry more equipment and travel longer distances than walking soldiers. The development of pneumatic tires coupled with shorter, sturdier frames in the late 19th century led military establishments to investigate their applicability. To some extent, bicyclists took over the functions of dragoons, especially as messengers and scouts, substituting for horses in warfare. Bicycle units or detachments were in existence by the end of the 19th century in most armies. The United Kingdom employed bicycle troops in militia or territorial units, rather than in regular units. Essentially this reflected the popularity of cycling amongst the civilian population and the perceived value of bicycles in providing increased mobility for home defence units.R. Wilson, page 32, \\"East York Volunteer Infantry 1859-1908\\", Fineprint Hull 1982 In 1887 the first of a series of cyclist maneuvers involving British volunteer units was held.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911, Volume VII, page 685An article written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, published in the Daily Express of 8 February 1910, argued the case for Yeomanry cyclists replacing mounted troops. Prime arguments given were numbers available, tactical advantage, rapidity, and relative cheapness In France, several experimental units were created, starting in 1886. They developed folding bicycles, that could be collapsed and carried slung across the backs of their riders, from an early date. By 1900 each French line infantry and chasseur battalion had a cyclist detachment, intended for skirmishing, scouting and dispatch carrying. In the years prior to World War I the availability of an extensive network of paved or gravel roads in western Europe made military cyclists appear a feasible alternative to horse mounted troops; on the grounds of economy, simplicity of training, relative silence when on the move and ease of logistical support. The Dutch and Belgian armies, with extensive flat terrain within their national boundaries, maintained battalion or company sized units of cyclists. The Italian Bersaglieri expanded their established role as fast-moving light infantry through the extensive use of bicycles from the 1890s onwards. Even the Swiss Army found bicycles to be a useful means of mobility in rough terrain where horse cavalry could not be used. The Imperial Russian Gendarmerie used bicycles with outrigger wheels, to mount patrols along the Siberian Railway before and during the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. In World War I, the level terrain in Belgium was well used by military cyclists, prior to the onset of trench warfare. Each of the four Belgian carabinier battalions included a company of cyclists, equipped with a brand of folding, portable bicycle named the Belgica. A regimental cyclist school gave training in map reading, reconnaissance, reporting and the carrying of verbal messages. Attention was paid to the maintenance and repair of the machine itself.Pages 21-22 \\"Handbook of the Belgian Army 1914\\", prepared by the General Staff, British War Office, In the United States, the most extensive experimentation on bicycle units was carried out by 1st Lieutenant Moss, of the 25th United States Infantry (Colored) (an African American infantry regiment with European American officers). Using a variety of cycle models, Moss and his troops carried out extensive bicycle journeys covering between 800 and 1,900 miles (1287 to 3058 km). Late in the 19th century the United States Army tested the bicycle's suitability for cross-country troop transport. Buffalo Soldiers stationed in Montana rode bicycles across roadless landscapes for hundreds of miles at high speed. The \\"wheelmen\\" traveled the 1,900 Miles to St. Louis Missouri in 40 days with an average speed of over 6 mph. The first known use of the bicycle in combat occurred during the Jameson Raid, in which cyclists carried messages. In the Second Boer War military cyclists were used primarily as scouts and messengers. One unit patrolled railroad lines on specially constructed tandem bicycles that were fixed to the rails. Several raids were conducted by cycle-mounted infantry on both sides; the most famous unit was the Theron se Verkenningskorps (Theron Reconnaissance Corps) or TVK, a Boer unit led by the scout Daniel Theron, whom British commander Lord Roberts described as \\"the hardest thorn in the flesh of the British advance.\\" Roberts placed a reward of ¬£1,000 on Theron's head‚Äîdead or alive‚Äîand dispatched 4,000 soldiers to find and eliminate the TVK. = World Wars = Italian Bersaglieri before World War I with folding bicycles strapped to their backs. German bicycle infantry during World War I Most common bicycle used by Polish scout companies assigned to infantry divisions during the Polish Campaign During World War I cycle-mounted infantry, scouts, messengers and ambulance carriers were extensively used by all combatants. Italy used bicycles with the Bersaglieri (light infantry units) until the end of the war. German Army J√§ger (light infantry) battalions each had a bicycle company (Radfahr-Kompanie) at the outbreak of the war, and additional units were raised during the war, bringing the total to 80 companies. A number of these were formed into eight Radfahr-Bataillonen (bicycle battalions). The British Army had cyclist companies in its divisions, and later two whole divisions became cyclists: 1st and 2nd Cyclist Divisions. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops. Early in World War II their southern campaign through Malaya en route to capturing Singapore in 1941 was largely dependent on bicycle-riding soldiers. In both efforts bicycles allowed quiet and flexible transport of thousands of troops who were then able to surprise and confuse the defenders. Bicycles also made few demands on the Japanese war machine, needing neither trucks nor ships to transport them, nor precious petroleum. Although the Japanese were under orders not to embark for Malaya with bicycles, for fear of slowing up amphibious landings, they knew from intelligence that bicycles were plentiful in Malaya and moved to systematically confiscate bicycles from civilians and retailers as soon as they landed. Using bicycles, the Japanese troops were able to move faster than the withdrawing Allied Forces, often successfully cutting off their retreat. The speed of Japanese advance, usually along plantation roads, native paths and over improvised bridges, also caught Allied Forces defending the main roads and river crossings by surprise, by attacking them from the rear. However, there were one or two cases of Australian troops turning the tables on the Japanese by isolating cycle troops from their accompanying motorized forces after blowing up bridges over rivers. Another advantage that the Japanese had with using bicycles was that it allowed an individual soldier to carry more without needing to rest and resupply often: British soldiers carried only 18 kilograms of equipment in order to march long distances through the jungles whereas Japanese bicycle soldiers could carry 36 kilograms of equipment. German invasion of Denmark in 1940 During the Invasion of Poland of 1939, most Polish infantry divisions included a company of bicycle- riding scouts. The equipment of each bicycle company included 196 bicycles, 1 motorcycle with sidecar, and 9 horse-drawn supply carts, plus three to six anti-tank rifles and standard infantry equipment such as machine guns, rifles, pistols, and hand grenades.:pl:Kompania kolarzy w 1939 The Finnish Army utilized bicycles extensively during the Continuation War and Lapland War. Bicycles were used as a means of transportation in Jaeger Battalions, divisional Light Detachments and regimental organic Jaeger Companies. Bicycle units spearheaded the advances of 1941 against the Soviet Union. Especially successful was the 1st Jaeger Brigade which was reinforced with a tank battalion and an anti-tank battalion, providing rapid movement through limited road network. During winter time these units, like the rest of the infantry, switched to skis. Within 1942‚Äì1944 bicycles were also added to regimental equipment pools. During the Summer 1944 battles against the Soviet Union, bicycles provided quick mobility for reserves and counter-attacks. In Autumn 1944 bicycle troops of the Jaeger Brigade spearheaded the Finnish advance through Lapland against the Germans; tanks had to be left behind due to the German destruction of the Finnish road network. SS troops advancing on bicycles. 1944. The hastily assembled German Volksgrenadier divisions each had a battalion of bicycle infantry, to provide a mobile reserve. Allied use of the bicycle in World War II was limited, but included supplying folding bicycles to paratroopers and to messengers behind friendly lines. The term \\"bomber bikes\\" came into use during this period, as US forces dropped bicycles out of planes to reach troops behind enemy lines. By 1939, the Swedish Army operated six bicycle infantry regiments. They were equipped with domestically produced Swedish military bicycles. Most common was the m/42, an upright, one- speed roadster produced by several large Swedish bicycle manufacturers. These regiments were decommissioned between 1948 and 1952, and the bicycles remained for general use in the Army, or were transferred to the Home Guard. Beginning in the 1970s, the Army began to sell these as military surplus. They became very popular as cheap and low-maintenance transportation, especially among students. Responding to its popularity and limited supply, an unrelated company, Kronan, began to produce a modernized version of the m/42 in 1997. = Later uses = Although much used in World War I, bicycles were largely superseded by motorized transport in more modern armies. In the past few decades, however, they have taken on a new life as a \\"weapon of the people\\" in guerrilla conflicts and unconventional warfare, where the cycle's ability to carry large, about , loads of supplies at the speed of a pedestrian make it useful for lightly equipped forces. For many years the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army used bicycles to ferry supplies down the \\"Ho Chi Minh trail\\", avoiding the repeated attacks of United States and Allied bombing raids. When heavily loaded with supplies such as sacks of rice, these bicycles were seldom rideable, but were pushed by a tender walking alongside. With especially bulky cargo, tenders sometimes attached bamboo poles to the bike for tiller-like steering (this method can still be seen practiced in China today). Vietnamese \\"cargo bikes\\" were rebuilt in jungle workshops with reinforced frames to carry heavy loads over all terrain. =21st century= LTTE bicycle infantry platoon north of Killinochi in 2004 The use of the cycle as an infantry transport tool continued into the 21st century with the Swiss Army's Bicycle Regiment, which maintained drills for infantry movement and attack until 2001, when the decision was made to phase the unit out. The Finnish Defence Forces still trains all conscripts to use bicycles and skis.http://yle.fi/uutiset/puolustusvoimien_polkupyorilla_ei_enaa_ole_merkitysta_sodan_aikana/5238523 The LTTE Tamil Tigers made use of bicycle mobility during the Sri Lankan Civil War.

It tells the story of a dysfunctional family who find themselves on a neverending road in the middle of a forest during a routine drive on Christmas Eve. Plot Driving on Christmas Eve with his family, Frank Harrington decides to take a short cut through a remote location. In the car with him: his wife Laura, his son, Richard, his daughter, Marion, and her boyfriend, Brad. It is night, and as Frank drives, he begins to fall asleep at the wheel, only to be woken by the screams of his family, warning him of an oncoming vehicle, he narrowly avoids the vehicle, and after an inspection of his car, continues to drive. Confused, Laura questions her husband as to why he didn't take the usual route to her mother-in-law's house; he claims he was \\"bored\\" and fancied a change. As the siblings bicker, Frank abruptly stops the car, claiming he saw a young woman, dressed in white in the forest. The woman appears at Frank's window, holding a baby. Marion, seeing how distressed the woman appears to be, and realizing that she needs help, offers to walk so that they can take the woman in the car to a house for help. The woman gets into the car, and as the family ask her questions, she remains silent. They arrive at a wooden cabin, and Laura and Frank go in to investigate. Meanwhile, Richard goes to masturbate in the woods, leaving Brad in the car with the woman and her child. Brad begins questioning the woman and telling the woman his plans to propose to Marion, meanwhile Marion walks along the road to catch up with the family and rehearses how she plans to break up with Brad. The woman tells Brad the name of her child; Amy, and passes her to him. A confused Brad asks how the child can breathe with the blankets covering her face, the woman replies that the baby is dead. Confused, Brad lifts the blankets to discover what appears to be the corpse of the child, and screams. The camera changes back to Richard, who hears the scream and immediately runs back to the car. Brad and the woman are nowhere to be seen. However, Marion sees a hearse driving down the road, and as she turns to look, she sees Brad screaming for help in the back of it. She runs back to the family and makes them drive after the hearse. Frank once again stops the car after they hit something in the road. He finds Brad's mutilated body, and as Marion goes into a state of shock, Laura attempts to call the police using Brad's cellphone. However, the other end of the line is a woman begging for help. Disturbed by this, Laura doesn't tell the rest of the family. As they begin driving again, Marion sits silently. As tension rises, Laura questions Frank's ability to direct them. They argue, and he tells Laura that he hates visiting her family. Frank abruptly stops the car once again when he sees a baby carriage in the road. Richard gets out to look and pretends to be pulled into the carriage, scaring his parents. They get back into the car, only to stop again. This time Richard gets picked up by the same hearse as before. While the three run to save Richard, Frank sees the \\"woman in white\\" again. They find Richard's body and Laura begins to show signs of insanity. Driving with his daughter in the front of the car, Marion appears to have returned to normal, and the family pass a sign that says \\"Marcott\\". Frank realizes that this must be a military road, and that's why it's not on the map. During another stop, Laura shoots Frank in the leg with a shotgun that they unwrapped, which was a present for a family member. After dressing the wound, they begin the drive again. Shortly after, Laura talks about seeing the face of a friend who had died 20 years earlier in the woods. She demands to visit with her departed friend, and upon Frank refusing, jumps out of the moving vehicle. Frank stops and they search for Laura until the hearse appears once again. Frank tries to shoot the driver but the car begins backing up as Laura appears. She is disheveled and begins babbling with her brain exposed from the back of her head, revealing Frank had accidentally shot her instead. Laura collapses and dies. Putting her in the back of the car, Frank and Marion continue driving. They come across the same ranger station they had stopped at earlier, and Frank is attacked in the dark by the lady in white. Afterward, Frank has a noticeable change in demeanor, much like his wife and daughter, and punches Marion unconscious. He sees the woman in white go into the woods once again, and chases her with the shotgun. He begins screaming and shooting the gun, only to be quickly dispatched in the dark. Marion awakens and starts the car. She begins to drive when the car suddenly runs out of gas. She begins to walk and sees body bags containing her dead family members in the middle of the road. As she cries the hearse pulls up, but the woman in white appears behind her. She tells a frightened Marion that the hearse isn't there for her before getting into the hearse and driving off, leaving Marion alone with her dead family. Marion suddenly awakens in the hospital, heavily bandaged. The doctor tells her of her coma and assures Marion that she and the baby will be fine. On the way out of the hospital, the doctor talks to a man claiming to be the one that found the family after the car crash. The car is then seen being pulled from a wreck, and the doctor discusses the accident. The man confirms that the whole family, except Marion, have died, and that the crash has also claimed the life of a young woman and her baby in the other car. He asks the doctor for her name, and she reveals to him that it is Dr. Marcott. The viewer gets the impression that Marion dreamed of how her family had died while in a coma, and that the hearse not picking her up was her dream telling her that she would live. As the doctor tries to leave, her car fails to start, and the man who found the family offers her a lift in the same hearse from Marion's dream. As the credits roll, two workers are seen sweeping up debris from the crash. They find a note Frank had previously written in the car with Marion before their final stop, insinuating that the experiences of the family were real.

Sometimes known as \\"duck soup\\", hen, rabbit or pig blood can also be used. In English it can be called \\"duck blood soup\\". Flavours Generally the sweet and sour taste of the soup comes from the balance of sugar and vinegar. However, there are hundreds of recipes popular in different parts of Poland, Belarus and Lithuania. Among the ingredients used are plum or pear syrup, dried pears, plums or cherries, apple vinegar and honey. Like most Polish soups, czernina is usually served with kluski, fine noodles, macaroni, boiled potatoes, or dumplings. Symbol Until the 19th century czernina was also a symbol in Polish culture. It was served to young men applying for the hand of their beloved. If the suitor was accepted he would be served black czernina along with the rest of the family. If not, he would be served a bowl of golden czernina, made without the duck's blood, as a symbolic rejection of their proposal.

Following ideological paths that were mostly new to the Far right in the United Kingdom, the ONF stood opposed to the more traditionalist Flag Group. Development The ONF emerged in the early 1980s when young radicals such as Nick Griffin, Derek Holland, Patrick Harrington and David Kerr became attracted to Third Position ideas and, eschewing the route of electoral politics favoured by the National Front up to that point, hoped to develop a cadre of devoted nationalist revolutionaries.Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity, New York University Press, 2003, p. 68 Emphasising a strong anti-capitalist as well as anti-communist line, the ONF began to emerge as the most powerful group within the NF after the series of splits in late 1979 and early 1980 though they did not come to prominence within the NF until 1984 when Martin Webster was expelled from the Party.Gerry Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', L. Cheles, R. Ferguson, and M. Vaughan, Neo-Fascism in Europe, London: Longman, 1992, p. 252 The Political Soldier faction began with the support of chairman Andrew Brons but before long differences between the two factions began to show. This came to a head in 1986 when the party split in two, with around 2,000 of the NF's 5,000 membership following Griffin into the ONF and the rest departing for the Flag Group.Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 255 The ONF maintained the monthly newspaper the National Front News and took control also of Nationalism Today during this period. With control assured the ONF took on responsibility for instructing its members ideologically and gained the backing of Rosine de Bounevialle, a veteran of the League of Empire Loyalists and the publisher of the anti-Semitic journal Candour, who allowed these training seminars to be held on her Hampshire estate. Subsequently these were moved to specially prepared buildings on land owned by Nick Griffin's father Edgar.Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 256 Ideology Aided by Roberto Fiore, whose Terza Posizione held similar views, the ONF developed an ideology that stressed the need for a \\"New Man\\" with the cadre structure influenced by the \\"nest\\" system of the pre- Second World War Romanian Iron Guard.Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, pp. 68-69 The two main sources of ideology for the ONF were the journal Rising published from 1983 to 1986 and The Political Soldier, a 1984 book by Derek Holland. Within the pages of these works the ONF committed itself to a revolt against modernity, echoing many of the words of the likes of Corneliu Codreanu and Julius Evola.Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 69 The party put emphasis on the values of ruralism with Nick Griffin, who lived on a farm in Wales, running a \\"Smash the Cities\\" campaign for the ONF that has been compared by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke to Pol Potism. Unlike the earlier NF, that had emphasised British identity, the ONF showed sympathy towards indigenous nationalisms within the United Kingdom. The ONF adopted a policy of support for Ulster nationalism, a fringe idea within Northern Ireland, and through this shift forged links with the Ulster Defence Association and in particular John McMichael who was advocating such an idea at the time.Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', pp. 260-261 Separate links were also maintained with sometime Democratic Unionist Party activist George Seawright who, although not avowedly an Ulster nationalist, was the brother of ONF activist David Seawright. Although there was no evidence of a direct connection between the two groups the ONF broke from the exclusively British nationalist vision of its predecessors to praise the activities of the Welsh nationalist Meibion Glynd≈µr.Goodrick-Clarke, Black Sun, p. 43 The desire for the development of a fanatical Political Soldier also led the ONF to follow their Italian counterparts in expressing some admiration for a similar fanaticism that they saw in Islam. This idea led to the publication of the most notorious issue of NF News which featured a cover extolling the 'new alliance' of the party with the Ayatollah Khomeini, Muammar Gaddafi and Louis Farrakhan, a previously unthinkable stance in the NF.National Front News, No. 108, 1988 During a march for Quds Day in 1988 Patrick Harrington and Graham Williamson took their place alongside a group of Islamic fundamentalists.Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 260 The 'scientific racism' that had been the cornerstone of NF ideas up to that point was abandoned by the ONF in favour of an emphasis on ethnopluralism and expressions of admiration for Black separatist leaders such as Farrakhan and Marcus Garvey, a new departure illustrated by the August 1987 edition of National Front News in which the slogan 'Black is beautiful' appeared.N. Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism: The British National Party and the Quest for Legitimacy, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 45 Copies of the Nation of Islam-linked newspaper The Final Call could also be purchased from the ONF.N, Lowles & S. Silver, White Noise, London: Searchlight, 1998, p. 10 Decline The desire to build a Political Soldier leadership meant that the ONF was by its nature exclusive and limited. Membership in its strictest sense was effectively closed off with outsiders only allowed to become \\"Friends of the Movement\\" and full membership being only open to those chosen by the leadership.Gable, 'The Far Right in Contemporary Britain', p. 253 The ideas held less appeal for the racist skinheads that the ONF still had links with. The ONF saw the skinheads as a source of eager foot-soldiers for their revolutionary struggles, a factor that led the ONF to host Rock Against Communism concerts in the mid-1980s.Goodrick- Clarke, Black Sun, pp. 194-195 However, disillusionment set in with the ONF's esoteric ideas and in 1987 sometime NF member and Skrewdriver singer Ian Stuart Donaldson joined with British Movement organiser Nicky Crane to set up Blood and Honour, initially as a magazine before developing it into a movement for White power bands independent of the parties. The departure of these groups also meant a loss of one of the ONF's main sources of revenue and the split proved fairly divisive with B&H; supporters dubbing the ONF the \\"Nutty Fairy Party\\" due to their unusual ideas and rumours of homosexuality within the leadership.Lowles & Silver, White Noise, pp. 9‚Äì14 The split came at a bad time as membership had already been curtailed by the decision in 1986 to double the price of membership fees and to restrict membership to those considered worthy of Political Soldier status by the leadership.Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism, p. 45 The group's devotion to the likes of Evola and Codreanu also damaged its chances as these thinkers were virtually unknown in Britain and as such the ONF's ideas were considered too foreign to be relevant to a British context.Richard C. Thurlow, Fascism in Britain: From Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts to the National Front, I.B.Tauris, 1998, p. 270 In an attempt to gain much needed funds, Griffin and Holland travelled to Libya in 1988 in the hope of persuading Muammar Gaddafi to provide money to bankroll the ONF. However, the pair were able to secure only a consignment of copies of the colonel's political testament The Green Book, meaning that the group's financial woes were not alleviated.Searchlight, October 1999, p. 5 Breaking from its own ban on electoral activity, Harrington ran as a candidate in the 1989 Vauxhall by-election, during which his rival candidates included the Flag Group's Ted Budden, who confusingly was standing as a \\"National Front\\" candidate. Both men received derisory vote shares.David Boothroyd, Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties, 2001, p. 190 In 1989 Harrington, who was by then effective leader of the group, approached The Jewish Chronicle with a view to opening dialogue with the Jewish community. The move proved unpopular with Griffin and Holland who broke off in 1989 to form the International Third Position (ITP), which advocated anti-capitalist Strasserist views, as well as continuing anti-Zionism.Copsey, Contemporary British Fascism, pp. 45‚Äì46 With the ONF in disarray, Harrington (by then effective leader, although the ONF had eschewed an individual leader at their peak) wound up the group in January 1990 and reconstituted it, along with about fifty NF members, as the Third Way, which continued to offer a programme akin to that of the Political Soldier movement. The Flag Group, led by Martin Wingfield and Ian Anderson, reclaimed the NF name and identity and sought to reposition the NF once again by following the example of the base itself on the Front National, which was experiencing growth in France through right-wing populism.Piero Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 181 References Category:National Front (UK) Category:Third Position Category:Neo-Nazi organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct political parties in the United Kingdom Category:Ulster nationalist parties Category:Neo-Nazi political parties ","title":"Official National Front"},{"id":"1131987","text":"The Patrol Air Cushion Vehicle (PACV), also known as the Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV) in Army and Coast Guard service, was a United States Navy and Army hovercraft used as a patrol boat in marshy and riverine areas during the Vietnam War between 1966 and 1970. Six hovercraft were built, three for the Army and three for the Navy. The military developed the PACV because its lack of draft meant that it could operate unimpeded in the shallow and reed-choked waters widespread in South Vietnam, most notably in the Mekong Delta and Plain of Reeds. The PACV was also found to be valuable because of its unusually high speed of , faster than other watercraft in the conflict. However, it faced major drawbacks, including its high cost of $1 million (equivalent to 13 Patrol Boat, Rivers) and unreliability. During the conflict, two of the Army‚Äôs three hovercraft were destroyed by the Viet Cong. The PACVs in Vietnam were considered \\"unsuccessful\\" in evaluations and were withdrawn in 1970. Following their service in Vietnam, the Navy PACVs returned to the United States where they were used by the Coast Guard, where another sank in an accident. Development The PACV was based on the Bell Aerosystems Bell SK-5 hovercraft; a licensed version of the British Saunders-Roe (later, British Hovercraft Corporation) SR.N5 hovercraft. The SK-5 was adapted for American military use in 1965. Three were purchased by the US Navy for operations in the emerging Vietnam War. Training of PACV crews was performed in the waters off Coronado, California near San Diego. Design of the Army ACVs began in 1966 and was completed Design Two different designs were made: one for the Navy and one for the Army. The Navy's hovercraft, called Patrol Air Cushion Vehicles, more closely resembled the civilian SK-5s that they were based on while the Army crafts had more extensive modifications. Each hovercraft was long, with a beam of and a height of when floating on its air cushion. It weighed fully loaded. Army and Navy PACVs had a crew of 4‚Äîdriver, radar operator, and gunners‚Äîand could carry up to 12 troops, many of whom rode on the outside of the vehicle. Army ACV 903 undergoing pre-deployment testing shortly after being built Both designs were powered by a General Electric 7LM100-PJ102 gas turbine engine. The engine, its 304-gallon (1,150 litre) fuel tank, an auxiliary power unit, and the Westland transmission were located amidships. The engine powered both the three-blade variable-pitch propeller for thrust and the diameter centrifugal fan for lift. The transmission served to link the engine and lift fan so that the fan could provide lift and thrust. Twin rudders and elevators sat behind the fans. As a hovercraft, the PACV could skim over water, including shallow and reed-choked waters, flat land, and ice. The PACV/ACV was very fast compared to contemporary watercraft, being capable of speeds up to . It had a range of and endurance of seven hours The Army hovercraft, called Air Cushion Vehicles, had more extensive modifications. They had heavier armor and reinforced, load-bearing decks. Army ACVs carried of armor‚Äîroughly equal to that of an M113 armored personnel carrier. The armor was thickest around the engine, transmission, and fuel tanks, providing protection from .50 caliber rounds fired at , while the armor around the crew compartment could only block .30 caliber rounds fired at . To save weight, many crews removed the armor around the crew compartment, and an Army evaluation recommended that it be removed altogether because of it \\"did not provide any protection to the crew,\\" especially against heavier weapons such as recoilless rifles, artillery, and RPGs. The communications package consisted of a six-station intercom system, UHF radios, and a radio security set. The boats were shipped with AN/ARC-54 FM radios. However, these proved unreliable, with an operational ready rate of only 35 percent. Army units sought to replace them with VRC-125s. While it is not known if this replacement occurred, one ACV did receive a VRC-46 radio. The hovercraft carried a Decca 202 radar with a dish antenna, which could detect targets within . Some Army ACVs were fitted with XM3 Personnel Detectors (better known as XM-3 \\"people sniffers\\"), which could detect human emissions including carbon and ammonia. This equipment was used to find hidden enemies. Dog teams were also sometimes carried to help detect enemies. The radar was found to be very effective, including for navigating in low-visibility and foggy conditions. Dock Landing Ship launches a PACV in 1967 The PACV was armed with twin .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns in a roof-mounted turret in the front and two 7.62mm M60 machine guns, one port and one starboard. The Army initially equipped their hovercraft with a minigun and 40 mm M5 automatic grenade launcher as well. Only one ACV was outfitted with a grenade launcher, however, and the miniguns were removed to make space for more troops and cargo because it was found to be effective only for suppressive fire. The Army ACVs had other improvements over the Navy PACVs beyond their additional armor, namely a wider cockpit, more horsepower, two gun positions instead of one, and a flat deck on top of the skirt for troops to ride on. Operational history A PACV in Cau Hai Bay near Hue in 1968 PACVs were first deployed to Vietnam in May 1966 as PACV Division 107, Task Force 116, where they were used by the Navy for riverine patrol missions in the Mekong Delta and on the Mekong River. Often called \\"Pac Vees\\", they were armed with a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on a rotating platform in the front and two side-mounted M60 machine guns. In addition, the crew, and often US Army Special Forces and ARVN Rangers, riding on the side panels, employed assorted small arms such as M16 rifles and M79 grenade launchers as well as various other rifles, .45 pistols, light and medium machine guns, and grenades, although using small arms was dangerous because spent casings could fall into the propeller. The PACV was used to prevent Viet Cong infiltration from the sea and tidal areas along river mouths and deltas. It was especially useful in shallow marshy areas, especially the Mekong Delta, where other patrol boats such as the Patrol Boat River or Patrol Craft Fast (Swift boat) could not go. The PACV's relatively light weight of only seven tonnes meant that it could be easily carried by a CH-54 helicopter. This allowed it to be airlifted between forward operating bases or transported back to base when it suffered damage. The PACV could also be split into sections and then transported in Air Force transport planes, which was how they were brought to Vietnam. PACV cruising full speed through a swamp Men of the 9th Infantry Division repair a damaged PACV, 18 July 1968 Navy PACVs were deployed in Operations Game Warden and Market Time, the Navy's operations to deny Viet Cong access to resources in the Mekong Delta and prevent North Vietnamese weapons, fighters, and supplies from entering South Vietnam, respectively. The PACVs were deemed unsuitable for Operation Game Warden because of their \\"mechanical unreliability\\" and the limitations imposed on them by terrain. As a result, they were removed from the operation and transferred to another Navy unit, CTF 117. They were also found unsuitable for Market Time operations after serving in that operation from 20 September to 17 October 1966, due to their high noise, low visibility, high cost, and limited utility on the high seas or in narrow waterways. In November 1966, the Navy PACVs were used to great effect in Operation Quai Vat (Vietnamese for \\"Monster\\", which was what the Viet Cong called the PACVs). In the operation on the Plain of Reeds, conducted jointly with Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) troops and Army helicopters and special forces, the PACV force brought its speed and firepower to bear on the Viet Cong, killing at least 23 of them, destroying 70 of their sampans and an equal number of their structures, taking many prisoners, and capturing their supplies. This demonstration of combat prowess in the marshy terrain in southwestern Vietnam formed the basis for stationing the Army ACVs in the Plain of Reeds along the South Vietnamese/Cambodian border. An Army evaluation found that in the Plain of Reeds, \\"any mission requiring ground operations can best be accomplished by ACV unts,\\" particularly reconnaissance, light assaults, infantry transport, canal security, cordoning off areas to prevent escape, and patrolling. Though the loud noise of the PACVs was an issue, their speed made up for it in this otherwise difficult terrain, especially during the monsoon season. The PACV could clear rice paddy dikes and other solid obstacles up to high and negotiate slopes of up to . However, the PACV did not perform well in the dry season, with an Army evaluation noting that \\"The wetter the season, the better for vehicle operations\\". The Navy withdrew the PACVs for overhaul in January 1967 and redeployed them to Vietnam in early 1968. Also in 1968, the Army began employing its version of the PACV, the ACV. The Army acquired the vehicles and activated their unit, the 39th Cavalry Platoon, in January before deploying them to Vietnam in April. There were only three Navy PACVs and three Army ACVs during the whole Vietnam War. Two of the three ACVs (No. 901 and 902) were Assault Air Cushion Vehicles (AACV), weapons-heavy vessels configured for attack missions, while the other (No. 903) was a Transport Air Cushion Vehicle (TACV) configured for logistics missions. The TACV only carried the twin M60s, forgoing the .50 cal and other weapons to increase space in the cabin for carrying troops. Both AACVs were lost to Viet Cong attacks. Navy PACVs were based out of Cat Lo Naval Base and operated by Task Forces 116 and 117. The three Army ACVs were operated by the 39th Cavalry Platoon, 9th Division, and were based out of Ben Luc and ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp, although they often deployed from fire support bases. A US Army ACV patrolling the Mekong River The Green Berets stationed in Moc Hoa became proponents of the PACVs, using them in many of their early operations. Search and destroy raids conducted out of Moc Hoa in November 1966 caught the Viet Cong by surprise and resulted in many Viet Cong deaths. The PACV's speed, maneuverability, and firepower lent themselves to many types of missions, including patrolling, search and destroy, escorting other ships, raiding, reconnaissance, medical evacuation, transporting artillery pieces, and providing fire support to infantry. It was best suited for ambushes and raids, especially at night, when it could be easily concealed behind reeds and swamp grass. Although it was too loud to be very effective at surprise attacks, it could use its speed to raid Viet Cong bases and escape before they could react. The PACV was found to be most effective when employed in combined arms operations alongside helicopters, artillery, and other watercraft; patrol missions conducted in concert with air cavalry or Hurricane Aircat airboats were found to be especially effective. The PACV's low profile and radar also meant that it was used as a stealthy stationary radar station when its engines were off. However, Army evaluations found that the ACV had insufficient firepower, being unable to damage armored or fortified targets, and recommended that it be outfitted with heavier weapons such as TOW missiles, 20mm autocannons (such as the M139 or M61 Vulcan), or 106mm M40 recoilless rifle. They also found that it could be too loud to be used effectively for patrol and interdiction missions. Fuel resupply was another frequently cited issue for longer missions, especially given that no adequate method of refueling in the field existed. The PACV was frequently compared to a helicopter because of its speed, terrain crossing ability, maintenance requirements, and cost. Army ACV units operated similarly to air cavalry. Operating these highly specialized vehicles required pilots and maintenance personnel undergo considerable training, with pilots requiring 75‚Äì100 hours of flight experience before participating in combat. Training requirements meant that the Army had to set one craft aside for training for 14 days every month. Troops riding in and on the PACVs also needed training to use them safely: during evaluation, one soldier died when he fell into the hovercraft's intake, and another lost his hand to the propeller. mine. Three men died in the explosion. Another downside of the PACV was the degree of maintenance it required: each hour of operation required 20 hours of maintenance, a ratio comparable to that of the C-17 Globemaster III airplane and double the 10-hour average for contemporary military helicopters. An Army evaluation found that the PACV had an operationally ready rate of 55.7 percent, and all three Army ACVs were only operational during June 1969. This maintenance requirement, which was made even worse when the vehicles suffered damage, combined with the insufficient firepower to lead an Army evaluation to conclude that \\"there is no hope of the [PACV/ACV] unit fighting to a satisfactory conclusion in any large engagement.\\" The PACV was also very expensive, costing about $1 million each,Equivalent to $7.75 million in 2019 as much as 13 Patrol Boat, Rivers. Because of their high profile and degree of threat, the PACVs and ACVs in Vietnam became major targets. The Viet Cong used ambushes and naval mines against the PACVs. Mines proved especially effective: Army ACV 902 was destroyed by a tripwire-triggered mine on 9 January 1970. Though no one onboard was killed, 14 men were injured and the attack slowed the pace of ACV operations because of Army regulations stipulating that the hovercraft work in pairs to protect each other. When ACV 901 was destroyed by a command-detonated mine on 3 August 1970, killing three, the ACVs were deactivated. The 39th ACV Platoon ceased operations on 31 August 1970 and officially left Vietnam in September, transferring their sole surviving ACV to the Army Transportation Museum in Virginia. Navy PACVs returned to the continental United States that August as well. In total, Navy PACVs saw more than 4,500 hours of operation. Postwar =US Coast Guard service= A Coast Guard ACV underway Following their withdrawal in 1970, the Navy PACVs were transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard for evaluation. The Coast Guard used PACVs, which they called Air Cushion Vehicles (ACVs), through 1975, when they cancelled the ACV program due to budget constraints. Two were stationed at Fort Point, San Francisco and the third was used for Arctic Trials in Point Barrow, Alaska, though they were also tested in the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. The Coast Guard PACVs were modified to meet their requirements by replacing the .50 cal gun mount with an observation dome and adding a KAAR LN66 radar and search-and-rescue equipment. Coast Guard PACVs were crewed by 3‚Äîoperator, radar operator and navigator, and search-and-rescue crewman‚Äîand could carry 6 passengers and half a ton of cargo. Because it was lighter than the military version, the Coast Guard ACV could go up to and had a range of . The ACVs in Coast Guard service were used primarily for search-and-rescue missions because of their speed and range. In over 185 search-and-rescue missions, they towed boats up to long and recovered survivors from the water and then rushed them to the shore. However, they were also used to service buoys, resupply and repair remote lighthouses and lightships, enforce laws, clean up oil spills, and ferry personnel and supplies. For minor repairs to buoys, the ACV shortened what was normally a full day mission by a fully crewed ship to a 2-3 hour one by an ACV with three crew members. The ACV was fast enough that it was able to respond to search- and-rescue calls while servicing buoys, something that was not possible for regular Coast Guard cutters. However, servicing structures in choppy weather on the open sea was found to be dangerous. The ACV proved particularly effective in the Arctic because it could traverse water and ice equally well at high speeds, although crews did encounter some issues relating to windshield icing. At least one ACV was active in San Francisco Bay 24/7, and a special hangar for the ACVs was built at the Coast Guard Station at Fort Point from August 1970 to 1972. The San Francisco ACVs were evaluated for use as a crash/fire rescue vehicle at Oakland International Airport in 1972 and were found to be successful. One of the San Francisco-based ACVs was showcased by the Coast Guard at the U.S. International Transportation Exposition at Dulles International Airport in 1972, where it was inspected by tens of thousands of international visitors. Over the first two years of evaluation, the Coast Guard ACVs accrued over 1,500 hours of operating time. As part of the evaluation, the ACV at Point Barrow was transferred to Traverse City, Michigan for refurbishment and then stationed at St. Ignace Coast Guard Station on Lake Huron. It sank on 23 November 1971 after only 26 hours of operation in Lake Huron, after the cabin was breached by a rock and the engine inexplicably failed, leading the craft to take on water and sink. After this sinking, one of the two San Francisco ACVs was then transferred to the Great Lakes. Another was transferred to the East Coast, where it performed aids to navigation survey/inspection and search-and-rescue operations on Chesapeake Bay, while the third remained in San Francisco Bay. The Chesapeake ACV was found to be particularly valuable for search-and-rescue operations in marshy or shallow waters. In the final Coast Guard evaluation, Commander Thomas Lutton wrote that \\"The ACV has dramatically and repeatedly demonstrated its capability to effectively perform a wide range of Coast Guard missions.\\" However, the Coast Guard was in the middle of a large upgrade of its other boats and cutters at the time and so did not have the money to acquire ACVs. As such, the two surviving ACVs were transferred to US Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, on 25 April 1975. =Survivors= The sole surviving Army ACV (No. 903) was transferred to the U.S. Army Transportation Museum in Fort Eustis, Virginia, where it is still on display . The only surviving US Navy PACV (No. 004) is preserved at the Yanks Air Museum in Chino, California.
