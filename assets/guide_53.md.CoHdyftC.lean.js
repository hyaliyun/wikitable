It was founded on 1 January 2018 to replace the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA). HCA in turn was established by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 as one of the successor bodies to the Housing Corporation, and became operational on 1 December 2008.Inside Housing: New agencies will face 'huge challenges' History On 17 January 2007, Ruth Kelly announced proposals to bring together the investment functions of the Housing Corporation, English Partnerships and parts of the Department for Communities and Local Government to form a new unified housing and regeneration agency. It would also incorporate the functions of the Academy for Sustainable Communities and the government's advisory team for large applications. In the following months, Professor Martin Cave, Director of the Centre for Management under Regulation at University of Warwick, led the most comprehensive review of English housing regulation for 30 years. Reporting in June, the Cave Review recommended that a new regulator be set up, separating the regulation and investment responsibilities of the Housing Corporation. On 15 October 2007, Yvette Cooper announced that the Government accepted the recommendation of the Cave Review to transfer the Corporation's regulatory powers to an independent body, subsequently named as the Tenant Services Authority (TSA). The new investment body was initially announced as \\"Communities England\\", and later renamed as the Homes and Communities Agency. The Chief Executive for the body was announced as Sir Bob Kerslake in December 2007. Kerslake had led the regeneration of Sheffield as chief executive of the City Council since 1997.Brown reveals housebuilding tsar, The Observer, 16 December 2007. Retrieved 28 May 2010 On 17 October 2008 the Housing Minister Iain Wright announced the Board members of the HCA including Robert Napier (chair), Kate Barker, Candy Atherton, and Shaukat Moledina (previously Vice-Chair of the Housing Corporation).Tenants to get a stronger voice at national level , CLG, 17 October 2008 Kerslake was appointed as a Permanent Secretary at the agency's parent Department for Communities and Local Government in September 2010. The HCA announced that it would appoint an interim Chief Executive from existing staff.Sir Bob Kerslake appointed as permanent secretary at Communities and Local Government , HCA, 6 September 2010 Housing minister Grant Shapps announced early on that the TSA would be abolished as part of the cull of quangos by the coalition government after the 2010 general election. In June 2010, he said that the HCA would be retained but become \\"smaller, more strategic - with the HCA's functions being delivered under local leadership.\\"Speech to the Chartered Institute of Housing Conference, 24 June 2010. Transcript on CLG website. In September 2010, the HCA was also included on a list of organisations being considered for closure.Document leak shows HCA is 'under review' , Inside Housing, 24 September 2010 However, Shapps announced in October that the TSA would be merged into the HCA. In November, he confirmed that the HCA would be retained, but reformed to cut running costs. New initiatives The HCA's Kickstart programme provided grants to developers in order to rescue stalled projects during the recession, helping to maintain employment and output of new homes. One of the most groundbreaking Kickstart projects was a £45.6 million investment in Berkeley Homes to provide 555 new homes for rent on the open market, located in London, the south east and south west. However, after a campaign for disclosure by Building Design magazine, the agency revealed that many Kickstart projects failed to meet CABE's standards of good design. Sale of ransom strips  The pilot sale of micro plots was compared to driveway ransoms when Homes England wrote to householders in Birmingham warning that Homes England owned microplots between the household and the public road. Homes England said it had written to 90 householders however a freedom of information request found over 500 micro plots for sale in the Redditch and Bromsgrove boroughs. Homes England said that if householders did not purchase microplots they could be sold to third parties. A third party sale was expected by homeowners to result in the micro plot being used as a ransom strip. Social Housing Regulator The Homes and Communities Agency acted as the government's Social Housing Regulator. It provided regular reports on each registered social housing agency in England. In March 2014, it made its first ruling that a housing association had breached its 'serious detriment' threshold for harm to consumers for its home repairs against Circle 33, due to \\"chronic and long standing difficulties in the delivery of the repairs service\\".Regulator slams landlord for its London repairs service , Inside Housing, 11 February 2015 In Scotland this function is performed by the Scottish Housing Regulator.

Barndominium is a neologistic portmanteau of barn and condominium with multiple meanings. One definition refers to a type of steel building. This usage refers to a non- traditional structure, with a steel frame and sheet metal siding, originally designed as a storage building or barn structure that has been repurposed by the addition of living areas to previously open space. This type of building is typically built on an existing property or multi-acre homesite and the structure often acts as a dual purpose living and shop or work and storage areas large enough for things as large as boats and recreational vehicles. The term has also been used for wood-framed structures, and is often used interchangeably with terms like \\"barn home\\" and \\"barn with living quarters\\", for newer buildings in the tradition of bastles, housebarns and connected farms. The term was used, once, for a planned subdivision equestrian community where owners share stable space in a centrally-located equestrian facility. The concept is similar to a Golf course community, but geared toward horses and equestrian activity. It wasn't until 2016 when barndominiums were mentioned again, this time on the HGTV show Fixer Upper.

Szarzyński was a Cistercian monk; virtually nothing else is known of his life. He may have been involved with the choir of the Collegiate Church at Lowicz, where many of his compositions were preserved. His works are dated from 1692 to 1713, and the level of technical competence displayed in his works indicates that he must have had significant formal training. All but one of his surviving works are sacred in nature. He wrote solo motets for voice, violin, and continuo, which are in concertato style. He also wrote a number of choral works. Many of his pieces interpolate melodies from popular religious tunes. His lone surviving nonreligious work is a sonata for two violins and continuo.

It is located in the Rural Municipality of Prairie Lakes. Ninette has many small businesses, and is known locally for its wide range of sports facilities. In the summer, activities such as boating, fishing, and hunting are offered, while snowmobiling and ice fishing are offered during the wintertime.  History  Ninette's original post office was established in 1883 on a site near Overend Lake. It was later moved, following the construction of the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway in the area, to its current site near Pelican Lake, closer to the railway. In June 1926, Ninette became an unincorporated village. There are multiple theories as to the name of the community, including being named informally for a French actress or waitress, the deceased daughter of a local resident, or a character in a novel that was being read by a postal inspector in the area, the name being short for Antoinette. The Manitoba Sanatorium, a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients in the province, opened in May 1910 nearby on Pelican Lake's north shore, causing a growth in Ninette's population from the sanatorium's staff and patients' families, especially as its capacity quadrupled in its first 13 years. The sanatorium closed in 1972 after the development and prevalence of tuberculosis drugs and other treatments made the facility obsolete.  Demographics  As of the 2016 Canadian census, the population of Ninette was 221, a 1.3% decrease from its population of 224 in the 2011 census. The median age was 53.7 years old, 12.7 years older than the national average of 41.0. There were 110 private dwellings, 105 of which were occupied. English-speakers comprise the vast majority of Ninette's population. In terms of Canada's official languages, 95.3% of the population speaks exclusively English, while the remaining 4.7% speaks both English and French. No other languages are spoken or known in the community. Of those in Ninette aged 15 or older, 48.7% are married, 15.4% are living with a common-law partner, 23% have never been married, 2.6% are separated, 5.1% are divorced, and 7.7% are widowed. Of the census families in Ninette, 71.4% consist of two persons, 21.4% consist of three persons, and the remaining 7.1% consist of five or more persons. The average size of a census family is 2.4 persons. Out of all of Ninette's couple census families, 66.7% are without children, while 25% have one child, and 8.3% have three or more children.

Other major perforating diseases are elastosis perforans serpiginosa and reactive perforating collagenosis. Recently, however, there is a controversy on categorizing Kyrle disease with perforating dermatosis or a subtype of acquired perforating collagenosis. Kyrle disease was first described by Josef Kyrle in 1916 when a diabetic woman presented generalized hyperkeratotic nodules. The disease is distinguished by large papules with central keratin plug on the skin, usually on the legs of the patient and is often in conjunction with liver, kidney or diabetic disorders. It can affect both females and males with a 6:1 ratio. The papules usually show up on the patient with an average age of 30 years. Kyrle disease is a rare disease unless there is a high count of patients with chronic kidney failure. The disease seems to be more prevalent in African Americans, which can be correlated to the high incidence of diabetes mellitus and kidney failure in the population.  Signs and symptoms  Kyrle disease symptoms are chronic and have an onset during adulthood between the ages of 30 and 50 years of age. However, there were reported cases of early onset as early as 5 years of age and late onset as late as 75 years of age. The main symptom is the development of small papules into painless lesions that are surrounded by silvery scales. The lesions are painless, however, there is a chance that the patient may experience extreme urges to itch them. In time, these lesions grow up to a radius of 0.75 inch and develop into red-brown nodules with a central plug of keratin. As more lesions develop, they can come together and form larger keratotic plaques. These lesions are usually observed on the lower extremities, however, can also develop on the upper extremities, such as, the arms, the head and the neck. The only parts of the body that Kyrle disease do not form are the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. Lesions may heal spontaneously without treatment, however, new ones will develop in its place. Other symptoms that may be observed: * Hyperkeratotic cone-shaped papular plugs * Hyperkeratotic verrucous plaques * Diabetes mellitus * Hepatic insufficiency * Presence of albumin in the urine * Excess sugar in the urine  Causes  The causes of Kyrle disease are unclear and can be idiopathic. The only correlation that has shown light is the frequent association with an underlying disorder, such as, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipoproteinemia, liver abnormalities, and congestive heart failure. However, there had been cases where Kyrle disease was seen without any conjunction with the previous mentioned disorders. Due to the causes of Kyrle disease is unknown, the best way to prevent the disease is to prevent the disorders that are usually reported in conjunction with it.  Mechanism  The pathophysiology of Kyrle disease is unclear. Some scientists believe that it may be a variation of prurigo nodularis. The theory that most scientists agree upon is that Kyrle disease is an elimination of keratin and other cellular material across the epidermis. Keratinization in Kyrle disease form at the basilar layer that is lower than the normal proliferation region in the epidermis. This causes an inflammatory response which results with the keratin, along with other cellular material and connective tissue, to be forced out the epidermis. Another reason for an inflammatory response may be due to an alteration of the dermal connective tissue. This is theorized because this step is a main reason for inflammatory responses in other skin diseases, such as, elastosis perforans serpiginosa and perforating collagenosis.  Diagnosis  Since many other skin disorders can be characterized by abnormal papules or nodules, a dermatologist will determine if a patient has Kyrle disease by the depth of penetrating keratotic plugs, localized distribution of the plugs, size of plugs, and the age of onset. A physician will also have to test for disorders, such as, diabetes, hepatic, and renal disease to help bolster the diagnosis of Kyrle disease. Other underlying diseases that Kyrle disease is observed with are tuberculosis, pulmonary aspergillosis, scabies, atopic dermatitis, AIDS, neurodermatitis, and endocrinological disorders. The inheritance of Kyrle disease is unknown as reported cases point to both autosomal dominance and autosomal recessiveness.  Treatment  The best treatment for Kyrle's disease is to treat the underlying disease if present as life expectancy is also determined by the underlying disease. However, if there are no other diseases associated with Kyrle disease, treatment of the lesions is the course of action. There is a chance of the lesions healing without treatment but new ones will develop. = Medical care = Isotretinoin, high doses of vitamin A and tretinoin cream can be utilized. Also, emollients, oral antihistamines, and antipruritic creams that contain menthol and camphor may be helpful because the lesions can become very itchy. = Radiation therapy = UV irradiation can be utilized after curetting the hyperkeratosis with a combination medication treatment of oral retinoids, psoralen and Ultraviolet A radiation. = Surgical care = Surgical options are considered the final option for treating Kyrle disease. The use of a carbon dioxide laser, electrocautery, or cryosurgery to rid of limited lesions can be implemented. Patients with darker skin must take extra precaution as these options can lead to dyspigmentation. In addition, performing on patients that had Kyrle disease due to diabetes mellitus or have poor circulation can lead to poor healing.  Prognosis  Morbidity and mortality range from both extremes as the significance correlate with the underlying systemic disease.  Recent research  There seems to be beneficial responses to clindamycin therapy as the lesions regress. This leads to the hypothesis that microorganisms may be playing a role in the initial stages of Kyrle disease. A family with Kyrle disease were examined which their skin lesions were benign. However, when three of the young adult members were closely examined, they had posterior subcapsular cataracts and two of those three developed multiple tiny yellow- brown anterior stromal corneal opacities. In order to determine if there is any correlation between Kyrle disease and the ocular observations, more cases of Kyrle disease are to be analyzed. All in all, since Kyrle disease is relatively rare, more cases need to be studied and analyzed in order to understand the underlying pathogenesis and to improve the management of the disease.

Mittermeier (editors): Handbook of the Mammals of the World. Lynx Editions, Barcelona, 2009. are two species classified in the mammalian subfamily Viverrinae, in the family Viverridae. There is one genus, Poiana. Both linsang genera (Poiana and the Asian Prionodon) were formerly placed in the subfamily Viverrinae (of Viverridae), along with several other genera, but recent research suggests that their actual relationships may be somewhat different. The linsangs are remarkable for their morphological resemblance to cats, family Felidae, which is greater than in the other viverrids. As the relationship between linsangs and cats was thought to be rather distant (the two groups belonging to different families within the superfamily Feliformia), this was considered an example of convergent evolution. However, DNA analysis indicates that while the African linsangs (Poiana) are true viverrids closely related to the genets, the Asiatic linsangs (Prionodon) are not and may instead be the closest living relatives of the family Felidae.Gaubert, P. and G. Veron (2003). Exhaustive sample set among Viverridae reveals the sister-group of felids: the linsangs as a case of extreme morphological convergence within Feliformia. Proceedings of the Royal Society London Biological Sciences 270: 2523–2530. The similarities between Asiatic linsangs and cats are thus more likely to be due to common ancestry, while the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent. The name linsang is from Javanese linsang or wlinsang, which used to be wrongly translated as \\"otter\\" in English dictionaries. Linsangs are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards and insects. Typical size is a little over 30 cm (1 foot), with a tail that more than doubles that length. Bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. Both species have yellowish bodies with black markings (stripes, blotches and spots), though the distribution and nature of the markings varies between the two species.

The runoff contest, however, allowed Huffman to consolidate supporters of three other Republican candidates, Austen H. Furse (born 1960), Kenneth R. Sherman (born 1962), and Grant P. Harpold (born 1963), who trailed in the first balloting. Huffman's term extends to January 2011. She succeeds Senator Kyle Janek, a Republican physician who resigned earlier that year for business reasons. Huffman spent $750,000 of her own money in the first Senate campaign. Bob J. Perry of Perry Homes in Houston, no relation to Governor Perry, gave Huffman $125,000. Bell received a large sum from state trial lawyers, and the Texas Democratic Party sent activists to the district in order to conduct block-walking. In addition to Harris County, Senate District 17, said to resemble a crowbar, includes portions of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Jefferson counties. From 1981 to 2002, the seat with a different configuration was held by the attorney J. E. \\"Buster\\" Brown, then of Lake Jackson, and later a lobbyist at the state capitol in Austin. Political career Huffman is the chairwoman of the Senate State Affairs Committee, Vice Chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice, and is also a member of the Senate Committee on Finance and the Legislative Budget Board. Huffman's has been acknowledged by numerous advocacy groups. She was named a \\"Champion for Free Enterprise\\" by the Texas Association of Business, a \\"Taxpayer Champion\\" by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility and a \\"Big Voice for Little Texans\\" by Court Appointed Special Advocates for her work to protect children. She was also named a \\"Patient Care Champion\\" by the Harris County Medical Society, earned the TEXPAC \\"Patient Protection Award\\" from the Texas Medical Association, both for back-to-back legislative sessions, and is the only repeat recipient of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association's \\"Law and Order Award\\" since its inception, for her efforts to improve victims' protections and the criminal justice system. However, she was also cited as being the worst Texas Senator by Texas Monthly magazine. She was again included on the Texas Monthly list of worst Texas legislators in 2015, for, among other things, sponsoring an amendment to a bill that would \\"exclude from personal financial disclosure the holdings of legislators' spouses.\\" He husband, Keith Lawyer, a Houston nightclub owner, had loaned Huffman $500,000 for the 2008 campaign. Huffman won easy re- nomination to the state Senate in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. She defeated her only primary opponent, Derek A. Anthony, 32,962 (81.1 percent) to 7,691 (18.9 percent). She then won the general election on November 4, 2014, beating Democratic candidate Rita Lucido 113,817 (63.34%) to 60,934 (33.91%). In March 2015, Huffman proposed greater protection against libel for journalists who report whistleblower claims which turn out to have been false but which the reporters believed accurate at the time of media release. Huffman's plan died in her State Affairs Committee.\\"Journalists seek libel protection\\", Laredo Morning Times, March 3, 2015, p. 9A. Despite a strong \\"blue wave\\" in Harris County, Huffman won reelection on November 6, 2018, when she defeated her Democratic challenger, Rita Lucido, who had also been her 2014 opponent. Huffman polled 157,910 votes (51.5 percent) to Lucido's 143,465 (46.8 percent). Lucido drew nearly 83,000 more votes in 2018 than she had in 2014. Another 5,380 ballots (1.8 percent) went to the 2018 Libertarian Party choice, Lauren LaCount.

In Edge the game was described as: \\"Under Siege may be a downloadable game, but it’s certainly not throwaway. It’s engaging and, if the controls can be mastered and the bugs forgiven, a satisfying sampler of RTS thrills for the uninitiated, and a stamina test for anyone who thinks they’re hard enough.\\" Posted on 2 June 2011 at EDGE MAGAZINE Online The \\"Digitally Downloaded Website\\", specialized on downloadable contents, gave it a 4 stars out of 5. Reviewer said: \\"There is some fine tuning that the game could have used, however. Difficulty is spotty at best – even on the easiest levels it’s all too easy to accidentally wander into a massive enemy swarm because the fog of war is, frankly, too close to your units. And although the best effort has been done to get the controls down, it’ll never manage to be as intuitive as mouse and keyboard for the strategy genre. But it’s an impressive effort nonetheless, and a warm welcome back for the PSN. Given that everyone gets free PlayStation Plus subscriptions, take advantage of the fact this game is heavily discounted; it’s well worth the budget asking price.\\"Posted by GamesAndBiz at 11:48 PM http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2011/06/review- under-siege-psn.html Eurogamer gave it a 7/10, saying: \\"A game that requires a degree of patience and tolerance before it truly clicks.

The name of these species originated in the Javanese language as, linsang or wlinsang, and previously, was translated incorrectly in English dictionaries as, \\"otter\\". The two African species belong to the family Viverridae and the two Asiatic species belong to the family Prionodontidae. Formerly, both linsang genera (the African Poiana and the Asian Prionodon) were placed in the subfamily Viverrinae (of Viverridae), along with several other genera, but recent research suggests that their relationships may be somewhat different. The linsangs are remarkable for their morphological resemblance to cats, family Felidae, which is greater than in the other viverrids. As the relationship between linsangs and cats was thought to be rather distant (the two groups belonging to different families within the superfamily Feliformia), this was considered an example of convergent evolution. DNA analysis indicates that while the African linsangs (Poiana) are true viverrids closely related to the genets, however, the Asiatic linsangs (Prionodon) are not, and instead, may be the closest living relatives of the family Felidae.Philippe Gaubert and Geraldine Veron, \\"Exhaustive sample set among Viverridae reveals the sister-group of felids: the linsangs as a case of extreme morphological convergence within Feliformia\\", The Royal Society (October 15, 2003). Thus the similarities between Asiatic linsangs and cats are more likely to be due to common ancestry, while the similarities between the two genera of linsangs must be convergent. Linsangs are nocturnal, generally solitary tree dwellers. They are carnivorous, eating squirrels and other rodents, small birds, lizards, and insects. Their typical size is a little longer than 30 cm (1 foot) with a tail that is more than double that length. Their bodies are long, with short legs, giving a low appearance. Both species have yellowish bodies with black markings that include stripes, blotches, and spots, although the distribution and nature of the markings varies between the two species. The species of African linsangs are: *Poiana leightoni - Leighton's linsang *Poiana richardsonii - African linsang The species of Asiatic linsangs are: *Prionodon linsang - banded linsang *Prionodon pardicolor - spotted linsang References Category:Carnivorans Category:Mammal common names ","title":"Linsang"},{"id":"20773333","text":"The Canon de 6 système An XI was a French cannon and part of the Year XI system of artillery.

ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, 32(4), pages 16–21. One source of such systems is the use of randomization, for example in communication protocols like Bluetooth and FireWire, or in security protocols such as Crowds and Onion routing. Stochastic behaviour also arises in many other computer systems, for example due to equipment failures or unpredictable communication delays. Yet another class of systems amenable to this kind of analysis are biochemical reaction networks. PRISM can be used to analyse several different types of probabilistic models, including discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, Markov decision processes and probabilistic extensions of the timed automata formalism. Properties to be verified against these models are expressed in probabilistic extensions of temporal logic. Development of PRISM is primarily carried out at the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford. The tool is open-source software, released under the GNU General Public License.

It has only been released in North America. The project was lead by Anton Kruglyakov and the story was written by Jay Lender and Micah Wright, former writers for The Angry Beavers, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Phineas and Ferb. The story follows Myron Mako, as he and his team go to try and stop the Demolisher, a big red robot out to kill all humans. You control and guide robots entirely using the touch screen to fight other teams robots and take down their bases. You travel through 4 different worlds, each with different themes, and different goals per level. Robocalypse has received positive reception, garnering a 79.8% from GameRankings and 79 from Metacritic. It is often praised for being one of the few real-time strategy games on the Nintendo DS. On September 18, 2009, Vogster released a mobile version of the game on the App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch - titled Robocalypse: Mobile Mayhem, which is no longer available. A follow up, Robocalypse: Beaver Defense, was released for WiiWare in June 2010, which is also no longer available. Plot Robocalypse follows the story of a batch of robots with the brains of World War II veterans that must defeat a group of machines. Gameplay Robocalypse is controlled entirely with the stylus. Up to four players can play together. Development Robocalypse was announced on January 22, 2008 by former SpongeBob SquarePants writer Jay Lender. Reception Robocalypse has received mostly positive reviews, with an aggregate score of 79.8% and 79 from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Daemon Hatfield of IGN awarded it the Editor's Choice in its review, exclaiming that he was glad to see a real- time strategy game made for the Nintendo DS, the genre being so well-suited for the system's touch controls and dual screens. He complimented its controls and AI. He also praised its humor, saying that he finds it to be truly unique. Mike Feinburg of GameSpot also praised it for its tight controls and humor, but described the AI as clumsy and frustrating. Robocalypse was recognized by the KRI games development conference in Moscow as the best game for portable systems. It also received several Nintendo DS-specific nominations from IGN in their 2008 video game awards, including Best Strategy Game, Best New IP, and Most Innovative Design.

Seligman was a member of The Soft Boys and the Thompson Twins, and was a sideman for Thomas Dolby. Seligman was also a member of Bruce Woolley & The Camera Club and The Dolphin Brothers, and backed David Bowie at his performance at Live Aid in 1985. BiographyEarly life= Seligman was born in Cyprus, and his family moved to the UK eight months after his birth, settling in Wimbledon. Influenced by Paul McCartney, Free’s Andy Fraser, and Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads, he learned bass. =Career= Seligman was a founding member of Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club, which also included his friend Thomas Dolby. He played on the band's 1979 debut album English Garden, which featured a version of \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\", which Woolley had co-written with The Buggles. After leaving The Camera Club in 1979, Seligman joined The Soft Boys, replacing founding bassist Andy Metcalfe, and performed on their second album Underwater Moonlight. The Soft Boys broke up in 1980, and Seligman next formed the short-lived band The Fallout Club, which also included Dolby. The Fallout Club disbanded after two singles and Seligman joined the Thompson Twins, appearing on their 1982 album Set and its American counterpart In the Name of Love. Seligman was fired from the Thompson Twins later that year when the band decided to reduce itself to a trio. Seligman then joined Dolby's solo group, and played bass on his albums The Golden Age of Wireless (1982) and The Flat Earth (1984) and the hit single \\"She Blinded Me With Science\\". In addition to his work with Dolby throughout the 1980s, Seligman was also a member of the bands Local Heroes SW9 and The Dolphin Brothers. He also played bass on the first two solo albums by his former Soft Boys band mate Robyn Hitchcock. As a session musician, Seligman performed on albums and singles by Stereo MC's, The Waterboys, Sinéad O'Connor, Transvision Vamp, Morrissey, Nan Vernon, Tori Amos, Kimberley Rew and Alex Chilton. In 1985, Seligman and Dolby appeared as part of David Bowie's backing group at Live Aid. In 1986, Seligman played bass guitar on Bowie's Labyrinth soundtrack album and \\"Absolute Beginners\\". In 2002, Seligman played at the Shanghai Festival with Snail, along with Chris Bell and Jonathan Klein, and in 2007 began working with the Fire Escapes. In 2011–12 he contributed to Thomas Dolby's A Map of the Floating City also appearing with him on tours of the UK and northern Europe, at the Blue Note in Tokyo in February 2012 and at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, the UK in July 2012. In 2014, with fellow Fire Escapers Mark Headley and Lucy Pullin, he completed the Magical Creatures' Wishing Machine collection, also appearing live with them at a summer 2016 William Burroughs-inspired launch party in Brighton, UK. In 2017, Seligman, along with Jon Klein and Australian musicians Paul Cartwright and Paul Smyth released the album Monoplane under the name Neon Sisters. The album features both Seligman and Cartwright on basses, Klein on guitar, Smyth on keyboards with guest appearances by Bruce Woolley and David Bridie. Seligman played a black Fender Jazz bass as his first choice instrument. In addition he has used an Ibanez with a C-ducer contact mic built into the back of the neck, close to the neck/body junction, for his fretless work primarily with Thomas Dolby, but also Peter Murphy and in the ambient collection Sendai, recorded with Japan/Hong Kong-based musician Jan Linton for the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake relief fund, and released by Entropy Records in 2012. =Personal life= Seligman was a lifelong Fulham F.C. fan. After a lifetime in the UK, he moved to Sendai in Japan in early 2005 and subsequently, after a four-year spell back in the UK, returned there in July 2012. He then practiced as a human rights solicitor in London and continued to play music until his death.

Together with Shigella flexneri, it is responsible for 90% of shigellosis cases. Shigella sonnei is named for the Danish bacteriologist Carl Olaf Sonne. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, nonmotile, non-spore-forming bacterium. Pathophysiology This species polymerizes host cell actin. Evolution This species is clonal and has spread worldwide. Analysis of 132 strains has shown that they originated from a common ancestor in Europe around 1500 AD. Causes \\"Group D\\" Shigella bacteria cause shigellosis. Those infected with the bacteria release it into their stool, thus causing possibility of spread through food or water, or from direct contact to a person orally. Having poorly sanitized living conditions or contaminated food or water contributes to contracting the disease. People at risk Infants and toddlers, the elderly, travelers, and ill people are susceptible to the most severe symptoms of S. sonnei disease. Shigellosis is commonly suffered by individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex, as well as non-AIDS homosexual men. The other people who are at risk include the gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Shigellosis could also be passed through HIV-infected persons who already have contracted a more severe and prolonged shigellosis, including having the infection spread into the blood, which can be life-threatening to the person. Bad Bug Book 2d ed. – BBB – Shigella spp., Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook, FDA. Symptoms Infections can result in acute fever, acute abdominal cramping, cramping rectal pain, nausea, watery diarrhea, or blood, mucus, or pus in the stool, which may occur within 1–7 days after coming in contact with the bacteria. Most Shigella infection usually clears up without complications, but if left untreated or delay in diagnosis may lead to some serious complication such as dehydration (especially severe dehydration can lead to shock and death), seizure, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), toxic megacolon, and reactive arthritis.Mayo Clinic Staff. \\"Shigella Infection\\". Shigella Infection Complications. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 24 August 2012. Retrieved 13 May 2015. Persons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. Once someone has had shigellosis, they are not likely to get infected with that specific type again for at least several years. However, they can still get infected with other types of Shigella.CDC Staff\\"\\" Possible complications * Bloodstream infections may occur from Shigella, damaging the intestines which allows it and other germs to travel into the bloodstream. * Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a complication that occurs when bacteria enter the digestive system and produce toxins to destroy red blood cells that may cause bloody diarrhea as a symptom. * Dehydration and seizures occur most often in children, although how Shigella causes these complications unknown. * Rectal prolapse can occur while straining during bowel movements. * Toxic megacolon paralyzes bowel movements or causes passing gas. * Reactive arthritis, which is the inflammation of jointsMayo Clinic Staff. \\"Shigella Infection\\". Shigella Infection Complications. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 24 August 2012. Retrieved 13 May 2015. Prevention No vaccines are available for Shigella. The best prevention against shigellosis is thorough, frequent, and cautious handwashing with soap and water before and after using the washroom and before handling food; also, a strict adherence to standard food and water safety precautions is important. Avoid having sexual intercourse with those people who have diarrhea or who recently recovered from diarrhea. It is also important to avoid swallowing water from ponds, lakes, or untreated swimming pools. Treatment Antibiotic resistance has been reported. Growth in lab It can be grown on MAC agar and TSA, at 37 °C optimally, but it also grows at 25 °C. It is facultatively anaerobic and chemo-organotrophic, and produces acid when carbohydrates are catabolized.

When other members of the cast were performing, Hunter sat in a corner of the studio, keeping time with his foot, until the small boy he employed as his guide would lead him to the piano. Hunter often sang songs in dialect.\\"Guy Hunter,\\" The Capital Times, Sunday, April 8, 1928.

History Plaxton President bodied Dennis Trident 2s at Newquay bus station in August 2011 ECW bodied Bristol VRT at Penzance bus station in April 2014 Plaxton Beaver 2 bodied Mercedes-Benz O814s at Newquay bus station in May 2013 Western Greyhound was established in January 1998 to take over the three vehicles and the contracts of Cornishman Coaches, whose owner was retiring. The new company's managing director was Mark Howarth who had previously managed Western National, the local Badgerline (later FirstGroup) operation, and he was joined by Robin Orbell who had also worked for Badgerline. Within a few weeks R&M; Coaches, another local operator, also sold out to Western Greyhound which brought one more vehicle and an office near Newquay bus station. This left one other independent bus operator in the town, Pleasure Travel Minicoaches, but this went out of business and the contracts were also taken on by Western Greyhound. The company expanded beyond contract and private hire work with its first scheduled services on 14 December 1998. These two routes (592 and 594) were contracts awarded by Cornwall Council and were operated by three new minibuses. Further contracts were awarded in 2001, and double decker buses were added to the fleet to operate school routes relinquished by First Devon & Cornwall. After that many more routes were added to the network including some from Plymouth Citybus and DAC Coaches in the south east, and Hookways in the north. There were also some new routes, such as Newquay to Bodmin, two towns which had not previously been directly connected by bus (the service has not survived). The expanding fleet meant that the company needed a larger depot, and nearby Summercourt was chosen. Initially the depot was on existing premises, but in 2004 a new depot and offices were built. In the same year the ex-Western National bus station in East Street, Newquay was closed on safety grounds and replaced by a new and larger terminal at nearby Manor Road. This is owned by Cornwall Council but was managed on its behalf by Western Greyhound until 2015. Western Greyhound’s town centre shop was also moved to the Manor Road site where it became the bus station enquiry office. The company maintained its bus stops and used satellite tracking to monitor its fleet.

Buses were hired from Anglian Bus, Carmel Coaches, Arriva Midlands, Blackpool Transport, Nottingham City Transport, Norfolk Green, Summercourt Travel, Stagecoach South West and Stagecoach West.

Election system Elections in Illinois are directly administered by 109 election authorities. Seven municipalities each have an election commission as the local election authority only within that municipality. Outside of those, the county clerk is the local election authority in 100 counties, and 2 counties have a separate election commission. The local election authority's tasks include taking voter registration, selecting the polling places, ordering the ballots, training the election judges, overseeing the election itself, and supervising the vote count. The State Board of Elections (SBE) performs certain statewide election functions. Among its functions are providing uniform instructions, forms, and other material to the election authorities; adopting rules consistent with the other election law in Illinois; and approving the voting machines allowed for use by election authorities in Illinois. The SBE is also the election authority for accepting candidate petitions and nominations for certain state and national offices and for modifications to the Constitution of Illinois and other statewide referenda. Elections heldRegular elections= There are four types of regular elections in Illinois: the general primary election and the general election, which occur in even years; and the consolidated primary election and the consolidated election, which occur in odd years. The election day for the general election is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each even year, which is the day usually associated with election day in the United States. Its associated general primary election is held on the preceding third Tuesday in March. The election day for the consolidated election is the first Tuesday in April of each odd year, unless that day is during Passover, in which case the election is the first Tuesday after Passover. Its associated consolidated primary election is held on the preceding last Tuesday in February. The consolidated election was established in 1982; before this, many local government held separate elections on unrelated days at unrelated places. =Special elections= Illinois statutes limit special elections to specific circumstances, prohibiting all other elections from being held at any other time than for the regular elections. Vacancies=United States Congress= If a seat in the United States House of Representatives becomes vacant more than 240 days before the next general election, the governor chooses a date within 180 days and issues a writ of election to hold a special election on the chosen day for that congressional district. Election judgesIllinois high school student election judges= High school students in many states across the country are permitted to serve as election judges (poll workers) in their states, even when the students are not yet old enough to vote. In the 41 states that allow high school students to serve as election judges, the laws typically allow for students to work if they are 16 years of age and in good academic standing at their schools. Specific requirements vary from state to state. Some states do not allow high school students to serve as election judges, or the law has no specific provisions for persons who are not yet eligible to vote.

Prosser also represented the British Lions in their 1959 tour of Australia and New Zealand, and played invitational rugby for the Barbarians. He is often remembered more for his coaching of an extremely successful Pontypool side during the 1970s and 1980s. Rugby playing career Prosser played much of his club rugby for Pontypool, whom he joined in the late 1950s. At club level he was placed mainly in the second row, but later switched to the front row during his international career. Prosser was an enthusiastic student of rugby and believed in regular playing and training.Thomas (1979), pg 138. His playing style was robust and aggressive, whose work rate in the scrum and mauls was tireless. Prosser was often seen as over-vigorous, if not dirty, in some aspects of his play; especially in line outs where he would sometimes use his arms illegally on his opposite jumper. Prosser was first selected for Wales during the 1956 Five Nations Championship, replacing Neath's Courtney Meredith in a game against Scotland. Under the captaincy of Cliff Morgan, Wales won the game 9-3, but Prosser lost his place to Meredith in the next game of the tournament in Ireland. After Wales lost the Welsh game against Ireland, Prosser was back in favour with the selectors and was part of the team that beat France in the last game of the competition. The victory over the French gave Wales the Championship trophy, making Prosser a Five Nations winning player. During the 1957 Five Nations Championship, Prosser was rewarded with a position in the Welsh squad that would see him represent his country in the competition for the next three years without missing a game. It was during the 1957 campaign that Prosser scored his only international points, when he scored a try in a win over France. As well as representing Wales over six Five Nations Championships, Prosser faced two touring Southern Hemisphere teams; Australia in 1958 and South Africa in 1960. In 1959 Prosser was one of nine Welsh players to be selected to play in Ronnie Dawson's British Lions team when they toured Australia and New Zealand. Prosser was not a natural tourist, he had a fear of flyingSmith (1980), pg 363. and was also homesick during the long five-month tour.Thomas (1979), pg 139. He also suffered an injury early in the tour, but after his recovery, he played with his normal good form, impressing in the game against North Auckland. Prosser was chosen to play in the final test against New Zealand, which the Lions won. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 470. * 1958 * 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960 * 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961 * 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961 * 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960 * 1960 British Lions * 1959 Coaching career Prosser was a leading committee man at Pontypool Rugby Club and after retiring from playing rugby was given the role of coaching the first team in 1969.Griffiths (1987), 4:34. Prosser brought the same commitment he practiced in his own personal fitness and training into his coaching techniques. His methods were revolutionary, producing one of the strongest Pontypool teams in the club's history. During Prosser's time at Pontypool, he oversaw the 'Pontypool Front Row', made up of Graham Price, Bobby Windsor and Charlie Faulkner, the three players represented Wales on 19 occasions. The players credited Prosser's commitment to fitness as a major factor in their rugby development.Feared Viet-Gwent reform for a night to remember Telegraph.co.uk 11/01/2005 Prosser coached the Pontypool first team for 18 years until 1987, during which they were unofficial Welsh club champions on five occasions including a hat trick between 1983-1986.

A coiling or coil is a curve, helix, or spiral used for storing rope or cable in compact and reliable yet easily attainable form. They are often discussed with knots. Mountaineer's coil The mountaineer's coil (also alpine coil, climber's coil, lap coil, or standing coil) is a traditional method used by climbers to store and transport a climbing rope. This older style coil is noted as being more prone to twists and tangles than the butterfly coil, and care must be taken upon uncoiling to avoid these problems. =Tying method= Begin by taking hold of the rope in one hand with its end facing you. Coil the rope in arm's length sections with your free hand (extending it away from the other as far as it will reach to ensure each segment is of equal length as it is gathered). Alternate tucking the new gather in front and behind the previous coil to avoid putting a half- turn in the rope with each coil. When the last segment is reached form a short bight atop the gathered rope with its standing end. Grasp the working end and pass it over the bight and back through the center of the coiled rope in a round turn several times, making each new wrap closer to the bight until only a short tail remains. Pass this tail through the bight then grasp the standing end and pull it away from the bight until it is cinched tight around the working end. For added security, ensure both ends are sufficiently long to tie them into a reef knot. Butterfly coil Tying the Butterfly coil, 1-folding or faking-down Tying the Butterfly coil, 2-wrapping Tying the Butterfly coil, 3-finished The butterfly coil (also known as a backpacker's coil) is a method used by climbers for storing and transporting a climbing rope. Slinging the coiled rope over the shoulders and tying it in place for carrying earns the technique its alternative name. Unlike the alpine coil it cannot be attached to a harness for climbing, and thus is useful only for transporting a rope to and from where it must be used. The method is also useful for much smaller items such as for keeping earphone cables from tangling. =Tying method= Depending on the thickness and length, one can use palms of hands stretched out to the sides (crossing over the neck), two knees, passive side palm and elbow, or two fingers of the passive hand. The following is for the extra long climbing rope. Start with both rope ends in one hand. Pull 1.5–2 arm lengths of the pair through and let their ends hang free. Begin coiling the balance of both strands one arm length at a time, alternating the gathers in the opposite hand into two separate \\"lobes\\" (or wings) draping on either side.Bluewater Beta: The Backpacker's Coil With 1.5–2 arm lengths remaining secure the coil by wrapping both strands twice round both lobes approximately 1–1.5' down, then pass a short bight above the wraps and through the coil. Pass both free ends over the top of the coil and through the bight to cinch it tight. Attach the rope for transport by placing the coil atop one's back, with one free end passing over each shoulder. Pass the ends back under the armpits, cross them over the coil, then bring them forward again, securing in front with a square knot. An alternate method draws the doubled rope over the shoulders instead of in front of the climber. Over/under cable coiling Over/under cable coiling refers to a method of storing cables that preserves the capacitance and common-mode rejection ratio built in by the manufacturer with a twist in the cable, and the shielding that encases the twisted pairs within. It allows the cable to lie flat when uncoiled, and makes for easier and faster work. The \\"over/under\\" name refers to the practice of twisting the cable in one direction to make the first coil, and un-twisting it to make the next, and repeating this until all the cable is neatly coiled. Care needs to be taken to keep each end on its proper side of the roll when uncoiling otherwise a knot will appear with every other loop. Connecting the ends on the outside of the loops, or tying them in that position, ensures that the ends don't pass through the loops in storage so there are no knots when the cable is laid out. There are a number of informal terms in common circulation including \\"over/under wrapping\\", \\"countercoiling\\", and \\"flip-coiling\\". =Straight coiling= Straight coiling, or the practice of coiling a cable in the same direction coil after coil, has the similar result to coiling cable on a spool. If the cable comes off the spool the same way it goes on, the internal 'lay' is preserved, and the cable isn't damaged or twisted internally. If a cable is straight coiled and then pulled from the coil, it has the effect as coiling cable on a spool and then pulling the cable off the top of the spool, imparting a twist in the cable with every coil that is removed. To make it lie flat, the twist will need to be removed. The advantages of straight coiling cable are that it will not produce knots when uncoiling and is easily taught and therefore can be accomplished easily by assistants.

Cities are home to the majority of Canada's approximately 35.75 million inhabitants(as of 2015)—just over 80 percent of Canadians lived in urban areas in 2006. Early urbanization - 14,000 BCE - 1850 CESettlements and villages, 14,000 BCE - 1541 CE= During the Wisconsin glaciation 50,000-17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to northwestern North America (Alaska). Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years. Arriving in Canada around 16,500-13,000 years ago after initially inhabiting the territories of Alaska, archaeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first \\"widespread\\" habitation of Canada and further south occurred during the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the late glacial maximum. Yet Canada's first people did not build towns or cities upon arrival. They were few in number compared to the size of the North American continent and most lived a nomadic subsistence lifestyle, following the migration of animal herds that provided food. Over time, Canada's First Nations started to construct different kinds of settlements, though they were generally temporary. For instance, the semi- nomadic peoples of the Maritimes, Quebec, and Northern Ontario, such as the Mi'kmaq, Cree, and Algonquin constructed temporary camps and villages with wigwams and long houses as the basic architecture of settlement. Nomadic First Nations living on the Canadian Prairies developed tipis with thin wooden frames and an outer covering of animal hides for portability in erecting temporary camps, with the people often moving to a new location each day to follow the bison herds. In the interior of British Columbia, semi-permanent settlements were constructed by First Nations with pit houses. In the far north, the Inuit constructed temporary camps with igloos, a domed structure made of snow, and tents made of animal hides in the summer. The Haida constructed villages on Canada's west coast. These people constructed settlements with large houses of red cedar planks, demonstrating advanced carpentry and joinery skills. The most advanced design was the six beam house, named for the number of beams that supported the roof. The front of each house would be decorated with a Totem pole, with the pole and sometimes the house brightly painted with artistic designs. Near 1000 CE, many Iroquoian-speaking communities around the Great Lakes began to switch from a nomadic life to more permanent settlements. The richness of the soil in the St. Lawrence valley, along with the abundance of fisheries nearby and of forests rich in game animals, provided resources for the establishment of Iroquois villages. In what is today Southern Ontario and Quebec, the Iroquois constructed permanent agricultural settlements with populations of several hundred to several thousand people. These villages were made up of long houses and could have fortifications such as palisades. =Settlements, Villages, and Towns, 1541-1850= Aboriginal peoples had been developing different kinds of settlements over thousands of years in Canada, but it was the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century which led to the establishment of the modern cities of Canada. Many of the new arrivals, both French and English, were from cities and brought with them the experience and knowledge of urban life. They used their knowledge and technology for city building, implementing techniques for the construction of permanent buildings, transportation and communication facilities, and the means of producing food for concentrated groups of people. Cities were slow to grow in the early period of European colonization in Canada. Those who arrived did so within a colonial and mercantile context that emphasised the exploitation of the colony for economic purposes at a minimum of imperial expense. With the colonial economies in Canada based to a great extent on the fur trade, cities remained mostly administrative centres for the colonies. It was also a period of conflict between England and France, rival colonial powers until 1763, and between Britain and the United States of America from that point until the mid-nineteenth century. This turmoil discouraged the development of cities. The towns Eastern cities such as St. John's (1583), Quebec City (1608), Montreal (1642), Halifax (1749), Saint John (1604), and Sherbrooke (1793) were founded in these years. More to the west, Toronto was established in 1793 as York. Of these cities, Montreal would become the most prominent city in Canada up to the 20th century. Toronto grew at a quick pace, gaining its status as a city and present name in 1834. Montreal—1642 The area now known as Montreal has been a place of human habitation by Canada's native peoples for the last 8000 years. The first European, Jacques Cartier, reached the site in 1535. However, it was only in 1639 that the first permanent white settlement was established by Frenchman Jerome Le Royer, leading to the establishment of Ville Marie, a Roman Catholic mission, in 1642. After a series of brutal attacks by the Iroquois, defending their territory, the arrival of new colonists in 1653 ensured the future of the city. The settlement became a fur trading centre but endured continuous raids by warring Iroquois until the Great Peace of 1701 guaranteed its safety. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763, all the French territory in North America, including Ville Marie, became part of British North America. The town was subjected to invasion and a brief occupation by American forces in 1775, but they were subsequently routed and Montreal retaken by the British, with Canadian and Indian help. The arrival of British immigrants and the establishment of the North West Company, fur trading rival to the Hudson's Bay Company, with headquarters in Ville Marie, ushered in an era of growth and prosperity. The Eagle Foundry of Montreal built the Äccommodation¨, Canada's first steam powered vessel. The opening of the Lachine Canal in 1825 reinforced the location as a port. Coal gas street lighting was introduced in 1838. The City of Montreal was established in 1832 with 27,000 inhabitants. During the period of its primarily European history, Montreal initially had a Francophone majority but Anglophone immigration tipped the balance by about 1830. From 1844 to 1849 Montreal served as the capital of the United Province of Canada. The rise of the city - 1850-1920Factors of growth= Canada's first cities formed during these years with high population numbers, caused by a high domestic birth rate and the arrival of white, Christian immigrants from Europe, drawn with the hope for a better life in a new world. They served as outposts of civilization in a land that was still mostly wild and inhospitable. In 1851 Canada's population stood at 2.4 million. By 1861 it had grown a third, to 3.2 million and by 1871 to 3.7 million. Economic forces were also at play. The repeal of the Corn Laws in Britain in 1846 provided a symbolic end to the era of mercantilism and ushered in the era of capitalism. Private investment, mostly from Britain, provided the foundation for a nascent industrial structure based on transportation (the steam train), construction, electricity, public works, heavy manufacturing, consumer and industrial services and related financial institutions. The introduction of a number of technological innovations also supported city growth, including the telegraph, water and sewer systems, the telephone, urban transit, the electric light, the skyscraper, central heating and the techniques of light and heavy manufacturing. These new transportation and communications technologies also led to the creation of a new ïnter-urban network of cities which contributed to their growth based on mutual interaction. The fading fear of attack by the USA provided a peaceful context for urban growth and the movement away from colonialism towards democracy gave urban dwellers the power to influence the shape of their cities. The construction of universities and cultural facilities in cities put a more human face on the harsh environment. The British North America Act (BNA), an act of the British Parliament, which established an independent and democratic Canada in 1867, reflected the rural character of the country at that time. Of a population of 3,600,000 almost 2,900,000 were rural dwellers while 700,000 lived in cities. The political forces at play involved both federal and provincial powers. Therefore, the BNA provided areas of exclusive jurisdiction for federal and provincial governments. Because cities were not predominant, the allocation of taxing powers for the financing of their growth, was left in the hands of the provinces. This would have important negative consequences a century later. The Canadian Pacific Railway, created to realize the dream of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald for a transcontinental nation, was almost solely responsible for the emergence of the cities of western Canada during these years. In Quebec, the Roman Catholic Church worked to maintain the rural nature of Quebec society, in the belief that this would help preserve the Catholic nature of the population and reinforce the Church's strength. One notable example of this policy was seen in the church sponsored attempt to ¨colonize¨ the rural Abitibi region of the province by farmers in the early twentieth century. The project failed because the region was only marginally suited to agriculture. This policy served to militate against urban growth in that province. Furthermore, the nature of immigration limited the growth of cities in Quebec. Most immigrants to Canada during these years were English- speaking and preferred to settle in large cities, including Montreal with an existing English speaking population. On the other hand, there were few French-speaking immigrants and the mostly French-speaking cities elsewhere in the province, including Quebec City and Trois-Rivières could not rely on this source for growth. Emigration too had a negative effect on the growth of cities in Quebec. Around 1900, economic conditions in Quebec were very difficult and about 1,000,000 French-speaking Canadians left the province looking for work in the textile mills of New England. By 1901, cities had grown to a point where the Union of Canadian Municipalities was formed to represent their interests. =Changing structures - high rise cores and suburbs= During these years the structures of cities evolved rapidly. In 1850 the city was essentially all ¨downtown¨. The main buildings, serving residential, commercial and industrial functions, were made of wood or stone, mostly four to five stories tall and self-supporting. Streets were of dirt or occasionally cobblestone and strewn with garbage and human excrement. Animals wandered about and horses were everywhere, solo, with rider or pulling wagons or carriages. In larger cities public transit was provided by horse cars on rails. Gas lights provided illumination at night. The force of life was provided by muscle power, animal or human. This changed rapidly. The introduction of the self-supporting steel framed building in the 1880s led to the construction of skyscrapers of six floors and more. The introduction of electricity and telephones was marked by the installation of hundreds of telephone and hydro poles along city streets, supporting electric and telephone cables. Electric street lighting replaced gas lights. The construction of water and sewer systems eliminated human waste from the urban living space. The introduction of municipal garbage collection reduced the presence of garbage. In the latter part of the century, the rise of the new middle class created a demand for housing beyond the city core. This was met by private contractors building individual homes on single lots in newly created suburbs, adjacent to the downtown core. Public transport was provided by the extension of the new electric powered streetcar to the suburbs. The downtown core began to lose its residential vocation and became a space increasingly devoted to commerce, industry and to a lesser extent, public life. In the new century the introduction of the car began to make its own dramatic mark. By 1920, the horse was gone, most cities had paved roads in the downtown core and main paved roads served the rising numbers of cars in the suburbs. At this point the Canadian city came to resemble what we see today. =The cities=Dominance of Montreal The rise of Montreal as Canada's metropolis was the most important feature of urban development during these years. In 1851 the population stood at 57,000, but grew to 90,000 by 1861, becoming in the process Canada's largest city. It would hold this position for more than one hundred years before being surpassed by Toronto. Transportation made Montreal. Situated at the head of the St. Lawrence River, it became Canada's major port and rail centre. Ships from overseas arrived bringing goods and immigrants. First the Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers in 1854 followed by Canadian Pacific Steamship Lines in 1903 operated trans Atlantic passenger liners to Britain. Shippers from the Great Lakes system, notably Canada Steamship Lines Inc. brought grain for export. The great Western Railway from Montreal to Windsor went into operation in 1854 carrying passengers and goods into the hinterland, followed by the Grand Trunk Railway from Montreal to Sarnia in 1860. The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) one of the great railway companies of the world, established its headquarters there. The huge CPR Angus Shops (1904) and Montreal Locomotive Works (1901) formed the heart of Canada's heavy industrial capability, building steam engines and rolling stock for the railways. Canadian Car and Foundry manufactured street cars. Other major manufacturing industries, grew along the Lachine Canal (1825), including Redpath Sugar, Darling and Brady, soap manufacturers, the St. Lawrence Glass Company, the Canadian Rubber Company, Laing Packing and Provisions (1852) and Belding Paul & Co. silk manufacturers provided consumer and industrial goods. The Imperial Tobacco Company (1912) became Canada's largest manufacturer of cigarettes. Morgans, Canada's first department store, opened its doors in 1845. The Montreal Telegraph Company, began offering service in 1847 and Canadian Marconi Company (CMC Electronics) was formed in Montreal in 1903. Financing for this activity was provided by the banks of St. James Street (Saint Jacques Street) which became the heart of Canada's financial sector anchored by the Bank of Montreal (1817) and the Montreal Stock Exchange, founded in 1872. Canada's first skyscraper, the eight-storey New York Life Insurance Company Building, was built in 1889. The elegant Queen's Hotel opened for business in 1863. In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for hockey as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena, was built in Montreal in 1898. Engineering works included a steam-powered municipal water system in operation by 1857 and the massive Victoria Bridge (Montreal) built in 1859. The Montreal City Passenger Railway Company began offering horse-car service in 1861 and converted to electric powered streetcars in 1891. In 1884 the Royal Electric Company began providing electricity to the city. During the First World War, Montreal became a major producer of munitions. Among other things, cordite was manufactured at Beloeil, Quebec, by Canadian Explosives Limited and at Nobel, Quebec, by British Cordite Limited. Montreal's place as the largest French-speaking city in North America, as well as the home of a substantial Roman Catholic population, was reinforced by the establishment of Notre-Dame Basilica (Montreal), the initial construction of which was completed in 1830. French- language newspapers including La Presse (Canadian newspaper) in 1884 and Le Devoir in 1910 and the Monument National theatre stood as pillars of cultural life. McGill University, founded in 1821, and the Montreal Star (1869) and Montreal Gazette (1785, originally a French language publication) newspapers stood as testaments to the vitality of the English-speaking community. The Golden Square Mile, a residential area on the south slope of Mount Royal, became the home of Canada's wealthiest citizens, including William Dow, John Redpath, William Notman, James McGill, John Molson, Sir George Simpson (administrator) and Sir Hugh Allan. By 1921 the city had 618,000 inhabitants. Hopeful beginnings east Toronto, with a population of 30,000 in 1851, and Bytown (renamed Ottawa in 1855) with a population of 8,000, would become respectively the future economic and political capitals of Canada. Toronto (1834) As was the case with many Canadian cities, the place now known as Toronto was inhabited for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, by a number of tribes including the Cayugas, Mohawks, Neutral-Erie, Oneidas, Senecas and Wendat. Between 1750 and 1759 the French operated a trading post, Fort Rouille, in the area where the Canadian National Exhibition is now located. The British purchased of land from the native peoples in 1787 and Governor John Graves Simcoe chose the site for the capital (which he named York) of the newly created Upper Canada. Concerned with military transportation to protect the new colony from US attack, he built roads west to what is now Windsor, east towards Montreal, and north, the present day Yonge Street. York was attacked and burned to the ground by the American Army in 1813 and the Canadians, in retaliation, attacked and burned the White House in Washington to the ground in 1814. Another US attack that same year was defeated. The town was renamed Toronto in 1834 and William Lyon Mackenzie served as the first mayor. The growth of Toronto in the latter part of the century was rapid, with the population passing from 30,000 in 1851 to 56,000 in 1871, to 86,400 by 1881 and to 181,000 by 1891. In part this was due to Irish immigration resulting from the Great Irish Famine between 1845 and 1849. The presence of the Roman Catholic Irish among Protestants led to racial tension, culminating in the Julibee Riots of 1875. Toronto's rise to prominence was initiated by the arrival of the train and telegraph. The railways connected Toronto to a wide hinterland. The Great Western Railway, from Montreal to Toronto to Windsor, was completed in 1854 and the Grand Trunk Railway, from Montreal to Toronto to Sarnia, in 1869. Along with the railways came the telegraph. Toronto was the first Canadian city to get service when it was introduced by the Toronto, Hamilton and Niagara Electro-Magnetic Telegraph Co. in 1846. Industrial mass production, in this case of clothing, became part of Toronto's fabric. Livingstone and Johnston, (later W.R. Johnston & Company), founded in Toronto in 1868, was the first in Canada to cut cloth and sew together the component pieces. It used the newly introduced sewing machine as part of a continuous operation. William E. Davies established Canada's first large-scale hog slaughterhouse in Toronto in 1874. Toronto became the home of the first plastics produced in Canada. The Rathburn Company of Toronto began to produce wood distillates including wood alcohol and calcium acetate, used to make acetic acid or acetone, in 1897. The Standard Chemical Company of Toronto, established in 1897, initiated the production of acetic acid in 1899 and formaldehyde, from the oxidation of wood alcohol, in 1909. This latter product was an essential element in the production of the fully synthetic, phenol-formaldehyde plastic (Bakelite). Heavy manufacturing took hold in nearby cities. General Electric Canada, founded by Thomas Edison in nearby Peterborough in 1892, contributed to heavy manufacturing techniques through the fabrication of large electric generators and electric motors, which were used to supply the rapidly growing Canadian market for electrical generating equipment. Similar heavy electrical products were manufactured by Westinghouse Canada, established in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1897. Steel mills were established there as well. Public services improved city life. A steam-powered municipal water pumping station was in service in Toronto by 1841, the same year that coal gas street lighting was introduced. Horsecar service began in Toronto in 1861. It was operated by the Toronto Street Railways until 1892, when it was replaced by electric streetcar service. The Toronto Power House and the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario began offering electricity to that city and the province in 1906. The growth of the city could be seen in the construction of skyscrapers. The first self-supporting steel-framed skyscraper in Canada was the Robert Simpson Department Store at the corner of Yonge and Queen with six floors and electric elevators, built in 1895. This was followed by the Traders Bank of Canada, (15 floors, Yonge Street, 1905), the Canadian Pacific Building, (16 floors, 1913), the Royal Bank, (20 floors, 1915), the Royal York Hotel, 1929, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in 1931. Canada's first escalator was installed in 1904 at Eaton's Department Store on Queen Street. The beginnings of the rise of Toronto as the cultural capital of Canada were seen in the establishment in 1827 of what would become the University of Toronto and the founding of The Globe (later The Globe and Mail) in 1844. Book publishing also took root. Publishers of note included Musson Book Company, 1894, G.N. Morang, 1897, McLeod & Allen, 1901, the University of Toronto Press, 1901, Oxford University Press, 1904, John C. Winston, 1904, Macmillan Company of Canada Ltd., 1905, McClelland and Goodchild, 1906, (later McClelland and Stewart), Cassell and Company Limited, 1907, J.M. Dent and Sons, 1913 and Thomas Nelson and Sons Limited, 1913. Performing arts space was expanded with the completion of the Grand Opera House, in 1874, Massey Hall in 1894 and the Royal Alexandra Theatre in 1907. The Canadian National Exhibition, established in 1878, became a prominent feature of city and Canadian life. With continued growth the city began to expand at the periphery and newly created adjacent towns were annexed. They included West Toronto, East Toronto, Parkdale and Brockton Village. New Southern Ontario cities - the essence of Canada St. Catharines (1821), London (1826), Hamilton (1846), Oshawa (1850), Kitchener (1854) and Windsor (1854) founded in the mid-nineteenth century would eventually form the core of the most densely populated and heavily industrialized region of Canada. Hopeful beginnings west For the most part, creations of the CPR, Winnipeg (1873), Calgary (1876), Regina (1882), Saskatoon (1883), Vancouver (1886) and Edmonton (1904) were strung like beads on a chain across Canada, linked by the new transcontinental railway. Victoria (1849) had earlier colonial origins. Vancouver would quickly become the most important. Vancouver (1886) Evidence indicates that native peoples, notably the Coast Salish, inhabited the area that became Vancouver for about 10,000 years before the arrival of European settlers. The first Europeans to explore the area included Spanish Captain José María Narváez in 1791 and British Captain George Vancouver in 1792. During his exploration Vancouver met with another Spanish expedition in the command of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores. Simon Fraser was the first white man to reach the area overland, which he did in 1808. However, native resistance to the presence of settlement was strong and it was not until 1862 that the first white settlement, the McCleery Farm, was established in what is now known as the Southlands district of Vancouver. A year later, Moodyville was established on the north shore of Burrard Inlet as home to lumbering activity and a sawmill. Stamps Mill (1867) was established on the south shore of the Inlet in what is now downtown Vancouver. The quality of Vancouver lumber quickly gained a worldwide reputation and was used to provide masts for the Royal Navy and in the construction of the Gate of Heavenly Peace in the Forbidden City, Beijing. A saloon built a mile to the west of Stamps Mill soon became an area of settlement eventually known as Gastown. It was named in honour of the talkative saloon owner ¨Gassy¨ John Deighton. The area was surveyed by the British colonial administrators and formally renamed Granville in 1871. The construction of the first federal penitentiary in New Westminster in 1878, bore witness to the lawlessness of the region. The CPR made Vancouver. William Van Horne, President of the CPR, chose the area as the western terminus for the transcontinental railway and renamed it Vancouver in 1886. Along with the railway came transcontinental telegraph service, also operated by Canadian Pacific. Stanley Park was established by the new city council and a disastrous fire destroyed the city that same year. A new city quickly arose from the ashes complete with a modern water system, the cities' first sewer system in 1886, electricity in 1887 and streetcar services. In 1891, the newly formed Canadian Pacific Steamship Lines began offering trans-Pacific steamship service from Vancouver with three large steel-hulled ships, the \\"Empress\\" liners: India, China and Japan.In 1902, Canadian Pacific completed a trans- Pacific cable telegraph, linking Vancouver with Australia and New Zealand. This reinforced Vancouver's position as a Pacific transportation and communication gateway. The population of the city mushroomed passing from about 5,000 in 1886 to 42,000 in 1900 and it became, in the process, Canada's third largest city. The appearance of the skyscraper provided visual evidence of growth, the first being the Dominion Building, (13 floors), in 1910, followed by the World (Sun) Tower, (17 floors), in 1912. Vancouver society was especially turbulent during these years. The First War saw two general strikes and the city was hit by depression in the 1890s, 1919, 1923 and 1929. Racism was also present. The presence of a large number of Chinese in Vancouver, located there as a result of immigration to work on the CPR, lead to serious anti-Chinese rioting organized in part by the Asiatic Exclusion League in 1907. In 1914, 376 prospective Punjabi immigrants arriving aboard the ship Komataga Maru were refused entry into Canada on a technicality, the enforcement of which was racially inspired. They were forced to return to India. After the first war working-class neighbourhoods, including Mount Pleasant, South Vancouver and Grandview-Woodland, began to appear. The CPR established Point Grey for development as an exclusive neighbourhood in 1908. Shaughnessy Heights was also established for the well-heeled. The founding of the University of British Columbia in 1915 represented a significant development in the cultural field. Holding their own During this period, the centre of Canada quickly shifted west and south leaving St. John's, Halifax, Saint John, Quebec and Sherbrooke far from the centre but still close enough, through marine and rail connections, for them to retain residual economic and demographic weight. The City Dominant - 1920- present Until 1921 Canada was a largely rural nation. However, by that date the balance had shifted. Of Canada's population of 8,787,000 people, roughly 4,300,000, or 50 percent, lived in cities. This was the result of internal urban population growth, the steady influx of the rural population into the cities and the arrival of immigrants, most of whom settled in cities. This shift was permanent and the urban percentage of the population continued to increase for the remainder of the twentieth century. Over 85 percent of Canada's citizens were urban dwellers in 2008. The production of wealth also became concentrated in cities during this period. Rural production (fishing, forestry, agriculture, mining), was outstripped by urban manufacturing and the service sectors. In 2008, about 90 percent of Canada's economy was urban based. =The Golden Age 1920- 1970=A harmonious balance During this period there was a balance in the factors that contributed to city growth. The increase in population was supported by a number of elements including private investment for commerce and industry, which provided jobs and money for consumer spending and public investment in education and infrastructure including, roads, public transit, electric, water and sewer systems. Canada's mostly white, Christian population also provided a homogeneity of values that created a calm and harmonious context for growth. City growth was somewhat stunted during the depression years of the thirties but experienced industrial growth during the hot house years of World War II and the boom associated with pent-up consumer demand in the post war years. This boom was accompanied and fueled by immigration, mostly from Europe. The establishment of the Dominion Conference of Mayors in 1935 was symptomatic of growth of Canadian cities during these years. In 1937, this organization fused with the Union of Canadian Municipalities to become the Canadian Federation of Mayors and Municipalities. This organization was renamed the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in 1976. The cities= Metropolis: Montreal at its peak = Montreal had a population of 618,000 in 1921, which grew to 1.2 million in 1971. The twenties saw many changes in the city and the introduction of new technologies continued to have a prominent impact. The introduction of the car in large numbers began to transform the nature of the city. The world's first commercial radio station, XWA began broadcasting in 1920. A huge mooring mast for dirigibles was constructed in St. Hubert in anticipation of trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service, but only one craft, the R-100, visited in 1930 and the service never developed. However, Montreal became the eastern hub of the Trans-Canada Airway in 1939. Film production became a part of the city activity. Associated Screen News of Canada in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, \\"Kinograms\\" in the twenties and \\"Canadian Cameo\\" from 1932 to 1953. The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the National Film Board of Canada, in Montreal, in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit including the very popular, \\"The World in Action\\" and \\"Canada Carries On\\", series of monthly propaganda films. Other developments in the cultural field included the founding of Université de Montréal in 1919 and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra in 1934. The Montreal Forum, built in 1924 became the home ice rink of the fabled Montreal Canadiens hockey team. Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation founded the Montreal Neurological Institute at the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal), in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases. Research into the design of nuclear weapons was conducted at the Montreal Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada during World War II. In the post-war years Canada formalized its wartime shortwave radio broadcasting activities with the creation of Radio Canada International. In 1945, this international radio broadcasting service was established with production facilities in Montreal and a huge shortwave transmitter site at Sackville, New Brunswick. Television was introduced to Canada by CBC, first in the French language by CBFT in Montreal on 6 September 1952. Radio-Canada established extensive production facilities for French-language programming, especially in the field of television drama. In the early seventies TVA also established a dynamic presence in this field. The Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec (1949) and the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec (1950), were the first shopping centres built in Canada. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal. The completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, in 1959, the Trans-Canada Highway, in 1962, Autoroutes 20 and 40 in Quebec and Highway 401, in Ontario, in 1968 strengthened Montreal's connection with other Canadian cities and with the continent. The construction of the Montreal Subway, in 1966 and Underground Montreal in the mid-sixties eased pedestrian movement in the downtown core and the suburbs. The World Fair, Expo 67 brought Montreal to the attention of the world as never before. La Ronde (amusement park) became Canada’s largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of Expo ’67. Canada's first heart transplant was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard. A number of important skyscrapers were built in the sixties including, Place Ville Marie (Royal Bank), 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), 1962 and the Hôtel Château Champlain, in 1967. Cultural institutions such at La Presse and Le Devoir newspapers and the beautiful Place des Arts (1963) performing arts theatre, symbolized the vigour of the French language in the city as did the development of a very vibrant popular music and theatre scene in the sixties and seventies with noted performers including Robert Charlebois, Louise Forestier, Diane Dufresne, Claude Dubois, Rene Claude and Denise Pelletier to name but a handful among dozens. Further intellectual growth was symbolized by the founding of the Université du Québec in 1968. The Montreal Forum was home to the iconic Montreal Canadiens hockey team which won five Stanley Cup victories in a row from 1955 to 1960 becoming in the process the most successful professional sports team in history up to that time. The star player of the team Maurice Richard gained a reputation that lives to this day. However, the rise of the automobile put an end to streetcar manufacturing in the city. The conversion of the railways from steam to diesel in the 1950s resulted in the closure of Montreal's huge locomotive manufacturing facilities. Political turmoil arose with the mailbox bombings of the separatist Front de Liberation du Quebec in the 1960s. The construction of the Boulevard Metropolitaine in the 1960s, although it improved traffic low, divided the city along an east–west axis. The massive trench of the new north–south six-lane Boulevard Decaire divided the city east from west. = Toronto and Southern Ontario cities - waiting in the wings = These cities experienced strong growth during this period that would see them gain national prominence in the latter part of the century. Toronto: Toronto gained considerable industrial, cultural and demographic strength from 1920 to 1970. The industrial strength of Toronto area was reinforced with the establishment in 1918 of an auto production plant by General Motors in nearby Oshawa, where it produced Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands and by Studebaker Canada Ltd. which produced cars in Hamilton from 1946 to 1966. Steel for the production of these cars came from the nearby mills of Stelco and Dofasco in Hamilton and gasoline, from refineries in Sarnia. The familiar, Canadian Tire, began operations there in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers. The Trans-Canada Airway was extended to Toronto in 1939. The founding of what would become the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1922 and the establishment of the CBC radio English-language radio network headquarters with its associated production facilities in the city in 1936 were signal cultural events. Notable landmarks of the period featured the Royal York Hotel, built in 1929 and Maple Leaf Gardens home to the fabled Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, completed in 1931. Important public works included the massive R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, in 1926 and the Queen Elizabeth Way, completed in 1939. During the Second World War Toronto became an important centre for the production of weapons including the warplanes manufactured by de Havilland Canada and Avro Canada. Military vehicles were produced by General Motors in Oshawa. The Connaught Laboratories (Sanofi-Aventis) at the University of Toronto produced penicillin for wartime use. Industrial capacity gained further strength with the establishment in the fifties, by the Ford Motor Company of Canada of a production plant in Oakville, which would eventually become a suburb of Toronto. The signing of the Auto Pact with the US in 1965 created massive investment in auto production facilities in Toronto and southern Ontario. The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada’s first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer (UTEC) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952. The CBC owned and operated CBLT-TV, Canada's first English-language television station, with related production facilities, went on the air there on 8 September 1952. The first private television broadcaster, CFTO, began operation in 1961. Toronto was home to the construction of a number of advanced aircraft in the post-war years including the Avro Canada Jetliner, the Avro CF-100 jet interceptor and the fabled Avro Arrow. However, the expense of the latter endeavour in the absence of a significant market forced the AVRO into bankruptcy in 1959. Electric energy projects in the sixties and seventies included the Lakeview Generating Station, completed in Mississauga, in 1962 and the Nanticoke Generating Station (largest coal-fired plant in North America), in Nanticoke, Ontario, in 1978. In 1971 electricity produced from nuclear power became commercially available to Torontonians and other Ontarians from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario. The field of transportation saw the completion of a number of significant works both local and national. Local works included the Toronto subway, in 1954 and the GO Transit rail system in 1967. The PATH system built in the sixties, allowed pedestrians to move about the downtown core using underground passages. National projects with Toronto as a hub or important destination included the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1959, the St. Lawrence Seaway, 1959, the Trans- Canada Highway, completed in 1962, and Highway 401 completed in 1968. The Sunnybrook Plaza (1951) and York Mills, (1952), became the first shopping centres in the region. Skyscrapers of note included the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower in 1967, The Simpson Tower, 1968, the Royal Trust Tower, 1969. By 1971 Toronto had a population of 2,630,000. = The rising east and west = Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver would experience sustained growth but not enough to make them the metropolis. Vancouver: In 1921 Vancouver had a population of 232,000. The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 solidified Vancouver's place as Canada's largest western city and the third largest in the country, a place that it holds to this day. The canal made it possible for ships to carry cargo from Vancouver directly to ports in Europe. Freight rates that favoured the use of eastern Canadian ports over Vancouver were eliminated in the twenties and port growth boomed. The Vancouver Harbour Commission was established in 1913 and the shipping activity centred around the Ballentyne Pier, built in 1923, which at the time was the most modern in the British Empire. The rise of the automobile lead to the construction of new bridges over False Creek including: the Granville Street Bridge, (1889 rebuilt 1954), the Burrard Street Bridge, 1932, and the Cambie Street Bridge, (1912 rebuilt 1984). Auto traffic to North Vancouver was facilitated with the construction of the first Second Narrow's Bridge in 1925 and by the completion of the Lion's Gate Bridge, in 1938, across the First Narrows. Crime was a prominent feature of city life. Vancouver mayor L. D. Taylor practised an ¨open town¨ policy that sought to manage activities such as prostitution, bootlegging and gambling, by restricting them to racially oriented areas including Chinatown, Japantown, and Hogan's Alley. He was defeated in 1934 by Mayor McGeer who promised to clean up the city. In 1931 the population of Vancouver stood at 347,000. In the twenties and thirties Vancouver became the western anchor of a number of national communication and transportation networks. These included the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932, the Trans-Canada Telephone System, 1932, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network, 1936 and the Trans Canada Airway in 1938. Cultural life received a boost with the establishment of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra in 1919 and the opening of the Orpheum (Vancouver) theatre in 1927. By 1941 the population had grown to 394,000. During World War II, the air base at Boundary Bay became an important centre for the training of heavy bomber crews. The city also featured prominently in the construction of ships for the war effort. Fear of an invasion by Japanese naval forces lead to Canadian citizens of Japanese ancestry being sent to concentration camps in the BC interior 1942. Many of these citizens were from Vancouver. In 1951 the population stood at 562,000 and further technologies became available. The Park Royal Shopping Centre, in West Vancouver, became the first in the city in 1950 and Empire Stadium, was built to host the 1954 British Empire Games. Vancouver became the western anchor of the new CBC national television network in 1958 and the western hub of the newly completed Trans-Canada Highway in 1962. The giant Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, was built in 1959 for passenger and vehicle ferry service to southern Vancouver Island and the nearby Roberts Bank Superport coal terminal was finished in the late sixties. A second, Second Narrow's Bridge was built in 1960 and the W.A.C. Bennett Dam, was completed in 1967. The establishment of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in 1959 and of Simon Fraser University in 1965, enriched city cultural life. Canada’s first purpose-built auto racing track, the Westwood Motorsport Park was built in nearby Coquitlam, that same year. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond in 1967. By 1971 Vancouver had a population of 1,000,000. =City in decline and subsequent revival - 1970-present=Trouble in the city Canada's population stood at 21 million in 1971 and has grown to 33 million in 2008. City expansion has continued throughout this period. However, Canadian cities have experienced a number of serious problems due largely to the fact that the increase in population has not been supported as it was earlier in the century. While private investment has largely continued apace during these years, public expenditures have not been able to match the increasing demand for public services, including, education, health, welfare, public transport and roads and other infrastructure. This is because the constitution, created 100 years before, was developed for a rural country and did not provide adequate taxing mechanisms for the municipal generation of revenue. Constitutionally, cities were creatures of the province. Entrenched resistance to change, especially at the provincial level, that would see more taxing power transferred to the cities, has prevented effective action to remedy this problem. Furthermore, the social harmony and cohesion of values that characterized the golden age have also been eroded by the changing values of the indigenous increasingly secular, individualistic and materialistic population as well as the arrival of immigrants whose diverse views often conflict with those of their adopted country. Pollution, from industry and car exhaust has become a serious problem. Importantly, the Auto Pact of 1965 and investments by the Big Three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have served to stimulate the growth of the cities of southern Ontario in much the same way that the CPR fuelled the growth of the cities of western Canada 60 years before. Changing structures - urban sprawl and downtown decay This era has been marked by urban sprawl. Population growth has been limited mostly to the suburbs and city boundaries have stretched far into what had been countryside mere decades earlier. With the extension of suburbia the provision of public services has become increasingly expensive as water systems, sewer systems and other structures have radiated from the city core. Of particular note is the construction of superhighways throughout the sixties and seventies. These massive corridors while designed to move increasing volumes of auto traffic also served to physically divide cities. In Toronto Highway 401 divides the city north/south, the Don Valley Parkway(1966), east/west and the Gardiner Expressway(1966) separates the city core from Lake Ontario. In Montreal, the Autoroute Metropolitaine divides the city north/south and Boulevard Decarie, east/west. The Queensway in Ottawa divides the city north/south. The presence of cars has become so dominant that a casual observer seeing a city for the first time would assume that the primary inhabitant was the auto. The displacement of the weight of the residential population from the city centre has begun to remove to market for downtown services and the downtown cores have begun to deteriorate. The construction of huge ¨ shopping centres¨ in suburbia has accelerated this process. In 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada. Although there is deterioration in infrastructure, it is important to note that the kind of slums that characterize many cities in the third world and the cores of many US cities do not exist in Canada. The cities= The new metropolis : Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe = During the seventies the population of Toronto surpassed that of Montreal. In 1971 the populations of the respective Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) for Toronto and Montreal stood at 2.7 million and 2.6 million. By 1981 Toronto had surpassed Montreal with a population of 3 million versus 2.8 million for Montreal. In 2009 there are 5.5 million people in the Toronto area. Factors for the growth of Toronto over Montreal included strong immigration, increasingly by Asians and people of African descent, the increasing size of the auto industry in Southern Ontario, due to the signing of the Auto Pact with the US in 1965, a calmer political environment (Quebec experienced two referenda on separation during these years, one in 1980 and the other in 1995), and lower personal income taxes than in Quebec. Improved transportation facilities aided growth. Union Station (Toronto) provided a hub for passenger rail service in the busy Windsor Quebec corridor and a focus for the subway service. Highway 401 provided an artery for automobile traffic east and west. Toronto Pearson International Airport became Canada's largest and a massive new terminal building has been completed. During this period, three of Canada's largest banks became headquartered in Toronto: the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. These along with the Manulife Financial Corporation, Sun Life Financial Inc. and Toronto Stock Exchange form the financial district, the financial heart of Canada. Toronto also became the corporate capital of Canada with the majority of Canadian companies having their head offices there. Notable examples include: George Weston Ltd., Onex Corp, Magna International Inc., Wal-Mart Canada Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Toronto strengthened its position as the cultural centre of English-speaking Canada during these years. The Globe and Mail and the National Post, two of Canada's most important newspapers have their head offices there. The new CBC Canadian Broadcasting Centre was completed in 1993 and became the corporation's control facility for English language broadcasting in Canada. Also in 1993 Ryerson Polytechnical Institute gained full university status and became, Ryerson Polytechnic University. Roy Thomson Hall became the home of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in 1982. This along with the newly constructed Princess of Wales Theatre and the venerable Royal Alexandra Theatre now form the heart of the theatre district. Cultural institutions including the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Royal Ontario Museum have had their buildings renovated. The Four Seasons Centre became the new home of the Canadian Opera Company and National Ballet of Canada when completed in 2006. The Toronto International Film Festival, established in 1976, has become after Cannes, the most important in the world and now sports a new headquarters, the Bell Lightbox, opened in 2010. Film production has received a boost with the newly completed, Pinewood Toronto Studios, in the east end on the waterfront. Toronto has also been home to the Hockey Hall of Fame (1943), since 1961. The changing high- rise downtown core provided visual evidence of growth. New skyscrapers included, the Royal Trust Tower, 1969, First Canadian Place, 1975, the CN Tower, 1975, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, 1977, the First Bank Tower, 1979, Scotia Plaza, 1988, the Sky Dome, 1989, the BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, 1990 and the Bay Wellington Tower, 1990. New skyscrapers include: One King Street West, 2005, West 1, 2005, Harbourview Estates 2, 2005, Residences of College Park 1, Toronto, 2006, Quantum 2 (Minto Midtown), 2008, the Bay Adelaide Centre West, 2009, the RBC Centre, 2009, Success, 2009 and Montage, 2009. Canada's largest theme park, Canada's Wonderland opened in 1981. Public administration was streamlined when the governments of Toronto and its five adjacent municipalities Etobicoke, North York, East York, York, and Scarborough were fused to form a ¨megacity¨ in 1998. The political heart of the City, Nathan Phillips Square is framed by Toronto City Hall, while the popular heart is focused on the new Dundas Square with its fountains and multiple large screen video panels, located on Yonge Street at the north end of the Eaton Centre. Rosedale, a suburb established in 1909 continues to be home to some of Canada's richest and most famous citizens. However, Toronto faces problems common to large North American cities, ranging from pollution, to urban sprawl, to the deterioration of infrastructure, racial tension and inequality, increasing levels of violent crime, heavy traffic congestion, poverty and lack of public housing. More importantly, recent economic developments have had a considerable negative impact on Toronto and the region. In 2007 the Canadian dollar reached par with the US dollar, causing a decline in the export of the region's manufactured products because of their relative increase in price. Furthermore, the increase in the cost of oil and gas created an additional cost burden for these same manufacturers, resulting in a substantial loss of manufacturing jobs due to plant cutbacks and closures. The simultaneous decline of the North American auto industry with its many factories in the region, due to an increasing inability to compete with Asian auto manufacturers, was accelerated by the increasing price of gasoline, which discouraged consumers from purchasing new cars. This collision of multiple negative factors has hit the manufacturing and technological base of the region's prosperity very dramatically in recent years. The road to continued prosperity for Toronto lies in increased competitiveness through technological and managerial innovation. = Heavyweights = Montreal, population 3,500,000 and Vancouver, metro population 2,300,000 have become poles of attraction based on manufacturing and transportation. Montreal - stagnation: The population of Montreal, a city with an attractive geographical location, has declined over the last thirty years, because of negative economic, social and political, and fiscal factors.Lorne Gunter: Quebec’s subsidized world of wonder, National Post, 23 February 2011 The weight of the Canadian economy has shifted south and west over the last three decades. This has been to the benefit of Toronto, which grew in part because of the Auto Pact signed in 1965, and Calgary, which has grown since the 1980s because of oil. But the shift has been to the detriment of Montreal. Demographically the birth rate in Canada has fallen below replacement rate during this period. Other cities in Canada have relied on immigration for growth, but this option has not been available to Montreal for political reasons. Furthermore, the province of Quebec, in spite of vigorous efforts, has been unable to attract French-speaking immigrants in significant numbers from other parts of the world. There was a net loss of mostly English-speakers from Montreal during these years. Since the 1970s the government of Quebec has responded positively to a growing public demand for social programmes, which by the end of the century were some of the most generous in Canada. In order to finance these programmes, personal income tax in Quebec became the highest in Canada and remains so. This high level of tax has served to further discourage the net immigration to Montreal, from other provinces and from other countries. The government of Quebec also instructed its provincial crown electric utility, Hydro-Québec, with headquarters in Montreal, to offer electricity to both domestic and industrial clients at below market rates. The population of the Island of Montreal has evolved as follows during this period: (1971), 1,959,000, (1981), 1,760,000, (1991), 1,775,000, (2001), 1,812,000. In spite of these factors the economy of Montreal was transformed in the latter part of the century. The heavy manufacturing of the earlier years was replaced by the high value added output of the aviation and pharmaceutical sectors. Notable companies in the former include, Bombardier, Bell Textron, Pratt & Whitney and CAE. The latter sector included Merck Frost and Phizer. Montreal also remains home to a large number of corporate head offices including those of Power Corporation of Canada, the Bank of Montreal, BCE Inc., Alimentation Couche- Tard Inc., Hydro-Québec, Ace Aviation Holdings (Air Canada), Ultramar Ltd. and Metro Inc.. The downtown core did experience some significant construction including, the Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière in 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon in 1992 and the Molson Centre, the new home of the Montreal Canadiens, in 1996. The period began optimistically with the construction of the massive Mirabel Airport to the northwest of the city in 1975. However, this soon turned to disappointment, embarrassment and financial catastrophe as the new huge facility failed to attract traffic and became a sleepy industrial airport at the end of the century. This failure is both a symbol and a practical reflection of Montreal's decline during these years. The 1976 Olympics produced mixed results. They did focus the attention of the world on the city and were a sporting success. However, the stadium was not finished on time, and city of Montreal and the province were left with massive debts that were only paid off early in the new millennium. The French language cultural output of the city has flourished over the last thirty years. Large volumes of French-language television drama for the Radio Canada, TVA and TQS networks are produced weekly. There is a flourishing domestic and foreign film production industry. Special events including the Montreal International Jazz Festival (1980), the Canadian Grand Prix and Just for Laughs (1983), have gained international fame. The greatest export of Montreal on the international scene is surely the Cirque du Soleil, with several permanent shows around the world. Organized crime has changed over the decades. Run mainly by Canadian families of Italian origin, these groups were pushed aside in the eighties by biker gangs. The Outlaws originally gained control of the illegal drug trade and prostitution but in the nineties a brutal turf war saw them replaced by the Hells Angels. Vancouver: Since 1970 Greater Vancouver has grown dramatically with the help of immigration from Asia and from other parts of Canada. Throughout the period, immigrants from South Asia have arrived in large numbers and tended to settle in the south east suburbs, notably in rapidly growing cities like Surrey. Immigrants from South-East Asia, particularly China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Korea, have congregated more in the City of Richmond and on the south side of Vancouver proper. These communities are complex in that they include immigrants with considerable wealth whose influence has had considerable impact on the face of the urban landscape and conventional immigrants of more modest means who contribute to the region's workforce and small-scale capitalism, as well as generations now of children born and raised in the province. The skyline of the city has reflected this growth with new structures including the 62 floor mixed use Living Shangri-La, the tallest building in the city, which opened in 2009. Tourism has increased noticeably with the city having become the starting point for major cruise ship lines operating trips north through the Inside Passage. The world's fair of 1986, Expo'86, focused the attention of the world on Vancouver. The fair was sited at the east end of False Creek which, in the thirty years after World War II, became an industrial eyesore. In the 1970s some of the land was repurposed for housing and the Granville Island Market complex; in the early 1980s still more land was reclaimed and used as the site for the construction of the facilities for the fair. At the same time a rapid transit system, SkyTrain, was built to facilitate the movement of pedestrians around the city. This system was subsequently expanded in the lead-up to the 2010 Winter Olympics. The whole of the area around False Creek has been the site of significant densification of housing, typified by the construction of luxury apartment and condominium towers on the north or Yaletown side and lower- profile condominiums on the south side which includes the Athletes Village built for the 2010 Winter Olympics. While most Canadian cities are characterized by the presence of freeways through part of the downtown core, Vancouver is the exception for the city has, to this point, managed to keep roads of this type out of the city centre. Extensive changes to the regional freeway system are underway, including most notably a new bridge over the Fraser River at Port Mann to replace a 1960s structure. While Vancouver officially brands itself as a green city and does much to encourage rapid and conventional transit, pedestrianism, and cycling as alternatives to automobile travel, the larger urban region continues to depend heavily on the individual automobile. Although Vancouver is a profoundly wealthy city with some of the highest housing prices in North America and, indeed, the world, it is also home to significant poverty and social dislocation. The old core of the city was long home to transient industrial workers who made seasonal use of 'single room occupancy' (SRO) hotels around Main Street and Hastings Street. Since the 1970s that neighbourhood has suffered economically to such a point that the Downtown East Side (DTES) is often characterized as 'blighted' and 'Canada's poorest postal code'. It contains one of the country's highest concentrations of dedicated social housing and social services, and is home to INSITE, the nation's first safe-injection facility. Much of the poverty, transience, substance abuse, and survival sex trade in the neighbourhood has its origins in mental health issues, many of which became acutely visible with the end of mental health institutionalization in the 1980s. Demand for land in a city that is surrounded by mountains and water has increased pressure on the DTES and has generated conflict over the potential for displacement of long-term marginalized residents through 'gentrification.' These changes are rejuvenating aspects of the old downtown's economy while creating new challenges for individuals with complex health, social, and economic issues. As of 2013, the City of Vancouver has a population of 603,000 and the Greater or Metro region has a population in excess of 2,300,000. = Contenders = Oil, national politics and high-tech have made Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa, all cities with populations of one 1,000,000, significant national urban centres. = Regional cities = Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, and Halifax are major regional centres. St John's and Saint John are smaller centres in Atlantic Canada. Whitehorse and Yellowknife are small and more isolated cities in the Canadian north, the serving as the capitals and largest cities of the Yukon and Northwest territories respectively.

It also served to provide housing for workers employed at a plant operated by Boeing and was named after its then-president, Stanley Burke. After the war, many of the homes were sold to returning veterans. The entire village featured almost one bungalow homestyle. The village has since been annexed by the city of Richmond and is the only residential area on Sea Island, which otherwise is dominated by Vancouver International Airport. The village was the hometown of aviation pioneer Dan McIvor.

Taiomah, Tama, Taima, Tiamah, Fai-inah, Ty-ee-ma, lit. \\"sudden crash of thunder\\" or \\"thunder\\") was a Meskwaki (Fox) leader in the early 19th century in present-day Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois. He was often called Chief Tama in historical accounts and was one of the signatories of an 1824 treaty in Washington, DC ceding land to the United States. Life Taimah, from A.R. Fulton's Red Men of Iowa 1882 Taimah was born into a Meskwaki family in their historic territory in present-day Wisconsin. His name was spelled by many variations in historic records. Ty-ee-ma in Meskwaki means \\"sudden crash of thunder\\" or \\"thunder.\\" He grew up in the Meskwaki culture, when they came under increasing pressure from United States encroachment. He became noted among Americans for saving the life of the United States Indian agent at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, by warning him of an assassination attempt. The Meskwaki had long occupied territory around the Great Lakes, in Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois, moving into Iowa. After the Meskwaki migrated from Wisconsin, Taimah became the principal leader of one of their villages near what later developed as Burlington, Iowa. He also maintained a village near Gladstone, Illinois in the 1820s.see Atkinson’s Appendix to Black Hawk's Autobiography (1882). Caleb Atwater mistakenly credited Taimah with being the leader of Quashquame's village, but he was this chief's son-in- law.Caleb Atwater (1831), Remarks Made of A Tour to Prairie du Chien, p.74 In 1820 Taimah was interviewed by Jedidiah Morse at Fort Armstrong in Illinois. Morse was gathering information from tribes as an agent for the US Department of War, which then had jurisdiction over Native Americans. Morse wrote of Taimah: Taimah signed the 1824 treaty in Washington, DC by which the Meskwaki ceded much of their land in Wisconsin to the United States.F.W. Hodge (ed.) (1910), Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, p. 319. He died in 1830. Taimah is buried near what developed as Kingston, about 1/4 mile from the Mississippi River, in a small patch of land in the middle of a corn field. A stone bearing his name is located about 20 rods west. Never having been plowed, this land is covered in trees, and foliage. The gravesite is on private property, and is not open to visitors.

The image on the grave shows Taimah with a stylized Plains Indian headdress, which was not typical of his people's attire; the \\"Tama Indian Tribe\\" refers to the Meskwaki who lived at the Meskwaki Settlement. *He was the namesake of the city of Tama, and Tama County, Iowa. The city is located near the Meskwaki Settlement, founded in 1857 when the Meskwaki were allowed to buy land in the state. Taimah's son was Appanoose;Annals of Iowa (1903) Vol. 6, p. 203 he also became a chief. Appanoose County, Iowa was named for him.

History  Santiago Papasquiaro was very useful to conquer the territory of the main axis. It helped Tepehuanos to defend their territory from the Tarahumara and Chichimecan people. And by the other hand, the territory of Santiago Papasquiaro helped Spanish conquers, who understood the strategic of this land. Priest Jerónimo Ramírez understood the region's natives because they lived well-organized in comparison to the Zacatecos, Jerónimo Ramírez used to work more with the Tepehuano. Since Topia's conquering Spaniards got benefits from Aledaña mines; even when there was not a mission there. La Sauceda settlement was built with the natives from El Valle de Anáhuac Valley separating the Tepehuano territory and El Valle del Guadiana Valley, the capital of Nueva Vizcaya province. The mission was founded in 1597, making Santiago Papasquiaro the center of the activities in all the Tepehuano territory. On November 18, 1616, Santiago Papasquiaro's Spanish population and its church were attacked by the natives. Caciques led the attacks, one of them was Quitlatas. The resulting of the assault was in priests Bernardo Cisneros and Diego de Orozco deaths. In 1620, a mission was established in the same place, even when natives used to strike them still. It was until 1690 when the town was officially established. In the 18th century, the municipality was astounded by three droughts. After the recovery in 1787, the town was titled as a Village. After Independence War, Santiago Papasaquiaro was recognized as the party capital, which lasted until the disappearance of the organization system in 1917. During the Independence War, the municipality's party created a well-organized group who made havocs against the troop of Presidios. This group was commanded by Santiago Baca Ortiz, from the same capital.

In nearly all cases, the child does not survive because it is unable to breathe and eat properly. Even with reconstructive surgery, the tongue is extremely underdeveloped, making unaided breathing and swallowing impossible. CauseTreatment The first challenge to survival is assisted breathing and tubal feeding. This is a lifelong affair, generally requiring the patient to spend nearly all of the time under direct hospital care. American surgeons successfully used bone from the hip of an Irish teenager named Alan Doherty to rebuild a jaw and chin. Surgeons began the procedures in June 2007 and completed the final of seven surgeries on 25 August 2008. Doherty is now able to smile, but is still unable to breathe, eat, or speak on his own.

PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) is one of the two classes of polycomb-group proteins or (PcG). The other component of this group of proteins is PRC1 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1). This complex has histone methyltransferase activity and primarily methylates histone H3 on lysine 27 (i.e. H3K27me3), a mark of transcriptionally silent chromatin. PRC2 is required for initial targeting of genomic region (PRC Response Elements or PRE) to be silenced, while PRC1 is required for stabilizing this silencing and underlies cellular memory of silenced region after cellular differentiation. PRC1 also mono-ubiquitinates histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub1). These proteins are required for long term epigenetic silencing of chromatin and have an important role in stem cell differentiation and early embryonic development. PRC2 are present in most multicellular organisms. The mouse PRC2 has four subunits: Suz12 (zinc finger), Eed, Ezh1 or Ezh2 (SET domain with histone methyltransferase activity) and RbAp48 (histone binding domain). PRC2 can bind to H3K27me3 and repress neighboring nucleosomes, thus spreading the repression. PRC2 has a role in X chromosome inactivation, in maintenance of stem cell fateHeurtier, V., Owens, N., Gonzalez, I. et al.

Aberrant expression of PRC2 has been observed in cancer. Both loss and gain-of-function mutations in PRC2 components have been identified in various human cancers, suggesting complex roles of these components in malignancy. Polycomb group genes directly and indirectly regulate the DNA damage response which acts as an anti-cancer barrier. The PRC2 complex appears to be present at sites of DNA double-strand breaks where it promotes repair of such breaks by non-homologous end joining. The PRC2 is evolutionarily conserved, and has been found in mammals, insects, fungi, and plants. In plants In Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant model organism, several variants of the core subunits have been identified. Homologs of the Suz12 subunit are: Embryonic flower 2 (EMF2), reduced vernalization response 2 (VRN2), fertilization independent seed 2 (FIS2). There is one Eed homolog, fertilization independent endosperm (FIE). three Ezh1/Ezh2 homologs, curly leaf (CLF), swinger (SWN), medea (MEA), and one RbAp48 homolog, multicopy suppressor of IRA1 (MSI1).

Other than the city of Vicente Guerrero, the municipality had 31 localities, the largest of which (with 2010 population in parentheses) was: San Francisco Javier (1,669), classified as rural. It was named for Independence War hero and early President Vicente Guerrero. It is now home to about 200 restaurants and other places to visit, including museums, historical places, and rides. Spanish is the spoken language of the region, although there are approximately 150 speakers of indigenous languages. Vicente Guerrero's principal economic activities are agriculture and ranching. History The area was first visited by European explorer Francisco de Ibarra in 1554, while he was looking for silver deposits. It was later part of the Spanish territory of Nueva Vizcaya, and was part of the Condado del Valle de Súchil (Súchil Valley County), established in 1766. The region came to some recognition during the Mexican Revolution, as Vicente Guerrero's underground tunneled road system was used during the period.

Appearance  U. mammulata is among the largest lichens in the world. The thallus of U. mammulata is usually 4 to 15 centimeters in diameter, but specimens have been known to reach in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. The smooth upper surface is a reddish-brown to grayish-brown color and the lower surface is pitch black.  Ecology  This species is found on boulders and steep rock walls in forests and around lakes. It grows on several types of rock substrate, such as acid rock, sandstone, quartz, and granitic rock.Wisconsin State Herbarium, \\"Wisconsin Vascular Plants: Details Page.\\" http://www.botany.wisc.edu/Wislichens/scripts/detail.asp?SpCode=UMBMAM (accessed Dec 19, 2008). Like most lichens, U. mammulata is sensitive to air and water quality. If conditions are optimal, seeing rocks or cliffs covered in dinner plate sized thalli is not unusual. However, it has been suggested that U. mammulata is not as sensitive to pH and water quality as it is to the frequency and duration of precipitation.

They speak Ogba which forms part of the Igboid cluster of languages in Rivers State of Nigeria. The Ogba people comprise fourteen extended families divided into clans, and occupy an area of about 600 km² in the Niger flood plain. Aligu-Alinso okanu is an Ogba village. The Egi group comprises seventeen communities with a history of natural resources. Oboburu community is famous for the production of pottery and ceramic wares (Okoronkwo Uju-The Artist Journal vol.2 Nov 4 2018) because of the vast deposit of natural clay(Ayatamuno et al-ResearchGate International Journal of Advanced Academic Research ISSN.24889849 2015)). A study conducted in Ogbogu located in one of the largest oil producing regions of Nigeria has utilized two plant species to clean up spills. The first stage of cleanup involves Hibiscus cannabinus. Ali-Ogba speak the Ogba language, consisting of the Egi and Igburu Sections. They both speak one dialect with little difference with each other, having a combine population of about 280,000 people. It is located in the central Orashi-Sombreiro plains of Rivers State, Nigeria. It is one of the major producers of the CRUDE OIL that fuels Nigeria's economic development in recent decades. According to current oil company records, no local government in Nigeria produces as much crude oil and gas as the Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni (ONELGA) local government (Ellah 1995). As a result of the oil industry, Ali-Ogba(Ogba Kingdom) has undergone significant political, social, economic and environmental changes during the past several decades. However, despite its image as one of the main contributors to the wealth of Nigeria, there is much poverty in many communities resulting from unemployment, under-employment, low-wage jobs and deterioration of the natural resource base. At the same time that Ali-Ogba makes very significant contributions to the country's economy, this oil producing area has remained economically marginalized and left in the backwaters of the country's socio- economic and political development. This poses dilemmas for Ali-Ogba people. For example, while the oil industry in Ali-Ogba creates jobs and wealth, these benefits are not equally accessible to many Ogba people and many other Rivers state communities, compared to other Nigerians. This state of affairs in the oil producing communities of Rivers state prompted the Governor, Dr. Odili to speak out this past February urging oil firms to stop giving employment to non-natives at the expense of the natives of the areas of their operation. In the Governor's own words:(Ellah 1995). History Ogba people are subgroup of Igbos who migrated from Anioma in Delta State and Ohaji-Egbema of Imo state. Ali-Ogba have some socio-cultural and political legacies that reinforce their common origin and bind them together as a people with common heritage and destiny. These include: geographic location, migration routes, language and political structure. Geographically, Ali-Ogba stretches from about 4 50 N to 5 30’N and extends from about 6 25 E to about 6 40’ E. Spatially, it covers an area of 920 km2 in the northern part of the Niger Delta region located within the River Niger flood plains.. It is bordered on the west by the Orashi River and on the east by the Sombreiro river. In addition to the main drainage systems, there are the Omoku River and many back swamps, cut offs and interconnecting streams which form a maze of drainage channels superimposed on the area. At the peak of the rainy season, these interconnected waterways are a prominent feature of the landscape. Its location in the Sombreiro-Warri deltaic plains, which consists of coastal plains sands and other tertiary deposits – marine, mixed, and continental deposits typical of deltaic environments situates it in the rain forest zone of southern Nigeria. The area can be divided into four ecological zones: *The Sombreiro river plains (eastwards) *The Orashi River flood plains (westwards) *The central well drained lowlands and farm mosaic (between the Orashi and Sombreiro rivers *The non-tidal freshwater swamps basin. The highest part of Ali-Ogba is the well- drained lowland and farm mosaic with altitude ranging from 15m to 22 m. In general, the land is characterized by a gentle sloping topography of less than 10 degrees in many areas. This relatively low altitude gives the area its characteristics flat and monotonous low relief interspersed by many wetland (swamp /creek basins), which crisscross the central low lands and empty into the two main river systems (Sombreiro and Orashi)(Ellah 1995) As a result of its geographic location, Ali-Ogba enjoys all-year-round high temperatures averaging 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the day with over night lows ranging from 65 to 70 degrees. Also, the area has at least ten months of rainfall totaling over 80 inches per year with very high humidity in the summer months. The climatic conditions and topography support a wide variety of plant and animal life. The flora consists of economic trees especially oil palm trees and a variety of plants species of great pharmacological value as human elixir.(Ellah 1995) Legends of origin Oral history and folklore have it that Ali-Ogba people migrated from what is now called Anioma in Delta State and Igbanke in Edo State across the River Niger.

The economy of Ali-Ogba The physical landscape of Ali- Ogba presents a variety of natural resources: relatively well-drained land and rich soils in many areas, fresh water rivers, creeks and wetlands, secondary forests and abundant sunshine and rainfall all year round. Underneath the earth surface are pools of natural gas and oil.(Ellah 1995) As a result of these endowments, the natural environment supports an agricultural economy based on fishing and farming for production of a wide variety of crops such as cassava, yam, maize, coco-yam, plantain and banana, including many vegetables such as okra, pepper and different types of melon. In addition, fruit trees such as paw-paw (papaya) oranges, guava, mango and pineapples are widely grown in gardens around buildings in the communities. Thus, in many respects, Ali- Ogba mirrors other upland communities of Rivers state in the production of a variety of agricultural products.http://www.citypopulation.de/php/nigeria- admin.php?adm2id=3216 References I remain, sir, your obedient servant by Erediauwa, Spectrum Books (2004).

In 2011, the team suffered a detrimental loss to the team; four student-athletes died in a two-car accident on January 16. Nick Bryson, Cody Hollinger, John Griffith, and Devaughn Lee had attempted to get air in a teammate's car. When they landed, they spun sideways into the other lane and were hit broadside, which sent the car flipping into a nearby field. That year for the team became about adversity and the ability to overcome it. With four crucial players gone, the team was young and inexperienced. The first game of the 2011 season was filled with emotion and was dedicated to the boys tragically lost in the accident. The game had four touchdowns, for a total of 28 points. The town speculated that each touchdown represented one of the boys and the total represented another teammate who had died in another car accident, due to a brain aneurysm in 2010.

In January 1911, he joined Manchester United on an amateur contract, just three months before the team won their second First Division title. Capper's debut came on 23 March 1912, when a spate of injuries – including one to regular outside left George Wall – forced Manchester United to select three debutants for a 1–1 draw with Liverpool at Old Trafford. Capper was later criticised for holding onto the ball too much and failing to use his pace to beat opposing defenders, and he never played for Manchester United again. In May 1913, he was transfer listed and moved to Lancashire Combination side Witton Albion. During the 1913–14 season, he was part of the Witton Albion side that won the Lancashire Combination Second Division, leading to his return to the Football League with First Division Sheffield Wednesday in May 1914. Despite the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, the entire 1914–15 season was completed before football was suspended until 1919; Capper made 24 league appearances during the season, as well as one in the FA Cup, scoring four league goals. One of these goals came in a 7–0 win over Bolton Wanderers on 1 March 1915, in which all five forwards and two half-backs got on the scoresheet. He spent two more seasons with Sheffield Wednesday after the war, making 37 more appearances, before moving to Brentford in August 1921, who had finished 21st out of 22 teams in the inaugural season of the Third Division South. On 11 February 1922, Capper became the first Brentford player to be sent off, receiving his marching orders from referee and future Brentford manager Harry Curtis. In three seasons with Brentford, he made over 100 appearances in all competitions, scoring six goals.

The Model 1835 was manufactured by the United States Armory and Arsenal at Springfield, and was also produced by the United States Armory and Arsenal at Harper's Ferry and other contractors. It was a smoothbore musket and fired a .69 caliber round ball.The Civil War Book of Lists, by Combined Books (Firm), Published by Da Capo Press, 1992 The Model 1835 is sometimes considered to be its own model number, but is often considered to be just a continuation of the Model 1816 Musket. The barrel was slightly longer than the Model 1816 and the total weight of the Model 1835 was slightly higher, but otherwise the Model 1835 was very similar to the Model 1816. Even though the final product was very similar, significantly different manufacturing techniques were used in the creation of the Model 1835, and a great deal of emphasis was placed on parts interchangeability. This paved the way for the Springfield Model 1842 which was the first musket to be constructed of all interchangeable parts.Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology, by Merritt Roe Smith, Published by Cornell University Press, 1980 Most 1835 muskets had their flintlocks replaced with a percussion lock during the 1840s and 1850s.

On Mitrotsavam, devotees worship the Sun for prosperity, health and courage. Surya is glorified in Vedic mantras as the expeller of darkness and evil. The most sacred Gayatri mantra, composed by Sage Vishvamitra, worships the Sun as Savita. Additionally, the Sun is honored by recitation of the Aditya Hridayam-- according to a legend in the Ramayana, Lord Rama was initiated into the worship of Surya with that hymn, which then gave him strength and the power to vanquish evil. Devotees also perform the Surya Namaskara, recite 108 names of Surya, and pray for help to ward off evil, infirmity and disease. At the same time, devotees extoll Mitra (Vedic Mitra-Varuna) as the Pratyaksha devata, the '-minded, far-sighted, thousand-eyed light and fire of the Sun, worship of whom is considered especially beneficial for ailments of the eye and mind.

Founded over 450 years ago, the town of Coneto de Comonfort was originally established as a mining community. It is located in the heart of the Coneto Mining District in the \\"Mexican Silver Trend\\", on the Mesa Central, east of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. This epithermal gold and silver-rich district has a long history of exploration and small scale production, dating back to the mid 16th century. The district is currently being explored by Orex Minerals Inc. (TSX.V: REX) and their project partner Fresnillo plc (LSE: FRES). Geology Gold and silver mineralization is hosted in over 40 epithermal quartz veins and breccias of low to intermediate sulfidation. A corridor of veining extends northwesterly for 17 km and has a width of about 4 km. Individual veins can be traced for up to 2 km and vary from 1 to 20 metres thick. These are exposed in an erosional window of Lower Volcanic Series (LVS) andesite domes, flows, tuff and agglomerate, surrounded by Upper Volcanic Series (UVS) rhyolites and dacites. The main silver-bearing mineral is acanthite and native gold is associated with hydrothermal hematite. The base metal minerals galena, sphalerite and minor chalcopyrite increase with depth. Associated with the mineralized structures are hydrothermal alteration zones, including kaolinitization, silicification, and pyritization.

It is caused by a mutation in the NOD2 (CARD15) gene. Symptoms usually begin before the age of 4, and the disease manifests as early onset cutaneous sarcoidosis, granulomatous arthritis, and uveitis. Cause The elucidation that the gene defect in BS involves the CARD15/NOD2 gene has stimulated many investigators, to define how this gene operates as part of the innate immune system, that responds to bacterial polysaccharides, such as muramyl dipeptide, to induce signaling pathways that induce cytokine responses, and protect the organism. In BS the genetic defect seems to lead to over expression, and poor control of the inflammatory response leading to widespread granulomatous, inflammation and tissue damage. Treatment Treatment has included the usual anti inflammatory drugs such as adrenal glucocorticoids, anti-metabolites and also biological agents such as anti-TNF and infliximab all with varying degrees of success.  History  In 1985 Edward Blau, a pediatrician in Marshfield, Wisconsin, reported a family that over four generations had granulomatous inflammation of the skin, eyes and joints. The condition was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In the same year Jabs et al. reported a family that over two generations had granulomatous synovitis, uveitis and cranial neuropathies. The condition was transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 1981 Malleson et al. reported a family that had autosomal dominant synovitis, camptodactyly, and iridocyclitis. One member died of granulomatous arteritis of the heart and aorta. In 1982 Rotenstein reported a family with granulomatous arteritis, rash, iritis, and arthritis transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait over three generations. Then in 1990 Pastores et al. reported a kindred with a phenotype very similar to what Blau described and suggested that the condition be called Blau Syndrome (BS). They also pointed out the similarities in the families noted above to BS but also pointed out the significant differences in the phenotypes. In 1996 Tromp et al. conducted a genome wide search using affected and non affected members of the original family. A marker, D16S298, gave a maximum LOD score of 3.75 and put the BS susceptibility locus within the 16p12-q21 interval. Hugot et al. found a susceptibility locus for Crohn disease, a granulomatous inflammation of the bowel, on chromosome 16 close to the locus for BS. Based on the above information Blau suggested in 1998 that the genetic defect in BS and Crohn Disease might be the same or similar. Finally in 2001 Miceli-Richard et al. found the defect in BS to be in the nucleotide-binding domain of CARD15/NOD2. They commented in their article that mutations in CARD15 had also been found in Crohn's disease. Confirmation of the defect in BS being in the CARD15 gene was made by Wang et al. in 2002 using the BS family and others. With that information the diagnosis of BS was not only determined by phenotype but now by genotype. Early onset sarcoidosis is BS without a family history, BS has been diagnosed in patients who have not only the classic triad but granuloma in multiple organs.

United States federal law recognises similar doctrines such as the exhaustion doctrine or doctrine of implied license.A recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Transcore, LP v. Electronic Transaction Consultants Corp. (F.3d), April 8, 2009, not yet officially reported, conflates these doctrines in the following terms: \\"TransCore sought to enforce the ’946 patent in derogation of the rights it granted under the TransCore–Mark IV settlement agreement. That attempted derogation is prevented by legal estoppel, which gives rise to the implied license.\\" Id. at -- n.4. A similar effect has also been realised in United States patent law under the doctrine of repair and reconstruction.See Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U.S. 336 (1961). An important difference between the doctrine of non-derogation from grants and other doctrines, particularly implied license, that are used to accomplish similar results is that the doctrine of non-derogation from grants is \\"inherent\\" as a matter of property law and apparently cannot be avoided by a seller's use of language attempting to negative application of the doctrine or by trial counsel's pointing to evidence of intent not to relinquish patent rights or copyright. In contrast, the other doctrines may be vulnerable to contractual disclaimers or evidence of intent not to grant intellectual property rights.

The episode revolves around Burdick (D. W. Moffett), a gay television newsman with AIDS. When his lover dies of the disease, Burdick reveals his own diagnosis on the air to the displeasure of his station manager. The episode was loosely based on Paul Wynne, a newscaster out of San Francisco who died of AIDS in 1990.Tropiano, p. 43 The episode was originally scheduled for December 2, 1990. However, NBC pulled the episode, sparking criticism from gay and AIDS activists. By failing to run this episode, NBC was the only major network not to broadcast a show around World AIDS day. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) met with NBC on December 6 to discuss this and other issues. NBC told GLAAD that the cancellation was prompted by \\"Lifestories\\" low ratings and that the feeling about a boy requiring a bone marrow transplant would have more appeal at the show's 8pm Sunday time slot. GLAAD asked that the \\"Lifestories\\" AIDS episode be rescheduled immediately. They also requested a mother meeting to discuss programming, to which NBC agreed.GLAAD/LA Reports Vol. 2, No. 12 December 1990 page 3. The network rescheduled it for December 18, when Lifestories was changed from being a weekly series to a monthly special. The episode was critically acclaimed, winning a GLAAD Media Award, but financially unsuccessful for the network. Synopsis Steve Burdick is a local television news anchor who keeps his homosexuality private. He and his lover are tested for HIV and both test positive. Burdick struggles to keep himself together as his lover's health declines. When his lover dies, Burdick breaks down on the air and announces the death and that he too is HIV-positive. Station managers want to fire him, but his producer, Barbara Hudson, convinces the station that AIDS reportage is newsworthy and socially responsible. Burdick's pieces are tagged with a viewer discretion advisory. He continues to report until he begins to show symptoms of AIDS, at which time the station managers pull him off the air. Cast *Robert Prosky – Storyteller (voice) *D.W. Moffett – Steve Burdick *Joyce Hyser – Barbara Hudson Scheduling controversy \\"Steve Burdick\\" was originally scheduled to air on December 2, 1990. Had it aired on that date it would have been one of several programs relating to AIDS airing in early December, which is designated World AIDS Month, with December 1 being World AIDS Day. Gay and AIDS activists accused NBC of pulling the episode out of fear of advertiser backlash, a charge that NBC denied. A network spokesperson also denied that network schedulers were aware of World AIDS Month and, in a perhaps unfortunate choice of phrase, characterized the decision to pull the episode as a \\"straight programming decision\\". Series producer Jeffrey Lewis also believed there was an economic motive, saying \\"I suspect a show about AIDS would not be popular with advertisers — particularly (when it focused on) a gay person with AIDS.\\" NBC changed Lifestories from a weekly series to a monthly one in December and on December 5 confirmed that \\"Steve Burdick\\" would be the first of the monthly episodes aired. Reception \\"Steve Burdick\\" was well received by critics. The Seattle Times described the episode as \\"as honest an exploration of AIDS as anything seen on commercial network TV\\". Moffett's performance was singled out for praise, as was Richard Gollance's script, for \\"look[ing] at a number of aspects of the AIDS problem, exploring a variety of attitudes about it\\". The Times marks this as the best episode of the series. The Hartford Courant concurred in this assessment, citing the episode as the most memorable of one of the season's most daring new series. Gollance's script was also praised by critic Jon Burlingame, writing for United Features Syndicate, for delivering accurate information on AIDS and HIV. Burlingame called the episode \\"as much an indictment of commercial television for its skittishness in dealing with the AIDS crisis as it is a show about AIDS patients\\" and speculated that this may have been the reason NBC initially pulled it. He cited this episode, along with two AIDS-themed episodes of NBC's Midnight Caller (themselves the subject of protests from gay and AIDS activistsTropiano, p. 103), as \\"network series TV's finest AIDS-related dramas to date\\". Right-wing activists criticized dialogue from the episode in which Burdick overhears his hospital roommate in prayer and admonishes him that he didn't pay attention well enough in church to learn that God ignores the prayers of \\"faggots\\".Dubin, p. 96 \\"Steve Burdick\\" scored a Nielsen rating of 9.7, equating to approximately 9.5 million viewers, and a 17 share, meaning that 17% of all television sets in use during its time period were tuned to the episode. NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, \\"There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, and one of those is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, there is going to be advertiser sensitivity to it. And if you choose to do it anyway, you better count on losing money.\\"Treichler, pp. 179–80 \\"Steve Burdick\\" won a GLAAD Media Award as the best television drama episode of 1990.

The ferrites, or iron oxide, begins in the form of a spinel and depending on the reaction conditions, dopant metals and support material forms either Wüstites or different spinels. Process description The thermochemical two- step water splitting process uses two redox steps. The steps of solar hydrogen production by iron based two-step cycle are: : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\ce{M^{II}Fe2^{III}O4 -> M^{II}O + 2Fe^{II}O + 1/2O2} &\\\\ce{(Reduction)}  \\\\ce{M^{II}O + 2Fe^{II}O + H2O -> M^{II}Fe2^{III}O4 + H2} & \\\\ce{(Oxidation)} \\\\end{cases} Where M can by any number of metals, often Fe itself, Co, Ni, Mn, Zn or mixtures thereof. The endothermic reduction step (1) is carried out at high temperatures greater than , though the \\"Hercynite cycle\\" is capable of temperatures as low as . The oxidative water splitting step (2) occurs at a lower ~ temperature which produces the original ferrite material in addition to hydrogen gas. The temperature level is realized by using geothermal heat from magmaSentech 2008-Analysis of geothermally produced hydrogen on the big island of Hawaii or a solar power tower and a set of heliostats to collect the solar thermal energy. Hercynite cycle  Like the traditional iron oxide cycle, the hercynite is based on the oxidation and reduction of iron atoms. However unlike the traditional cycle, the ferrite material reacts with a second metal oxide, aluminum oxide, rather than simply decomposing.

This leads to lower radiation losses, which scale as temperature to the fourth power. Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages of the ferrite cycles are: they have lower reduction temperatures than other 2-step systems, no metallic gasses are produced, high specific H2 production capacity, non-toxicity of the elements used and abundance of the constituent elements. The disadvantages of the ferrite cycles are: similar reduction and melting temperature of the spinels (except for the hercynite cycle as aluminates have very high melting temperatures), and slow rates of the oxidation, or water splitting, reaction.

Active in the Communist movement from 1926 as a political cartoonist and muralist, Burck quit the Communist Party after a visit to the Soviet Union in 1936, deeply offended by political demands there to manipulate his work. Upon his return to the United States, Burck drew political cartoons for two large mainstream dailies, the St. Louis Post Dispatch and then, for 44 years, the Chicago Daily Times (later as the Chicago Sun-Times). Burck was awarded the 1941 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. BiographyEarly Years= Jacob Burck was born Yankel Bochkowsky on January 10, 1907, in Wysokie Mazowieckie, Poland (then Russia)https://sztetl.org.pl/en/towns/w/791-wysokie-mazowieckie/96-local- history/68142-local-history, the son of ethnic Jewish parents, Abraham Burke, a bricklayer, and Rebecca Lew Burke. Burck emigrated to the United States at age seven and lived in Cleveland until 1924. He attended the Cleveland School of Art on a scholarship after he was discovered on a Cleveland sidewalk sketching instead of attending elementary school. Thereafter, Burck moved to New York City, where he studied at the Art Students League of New York (ASL) under Albert Sterner and Boardman Robinson. It was there that he met and married fellow art student Esther Kriger, in 1930. =New York Years= \\"Working Class Bulwark,\\" a cartoon by Burck from The Daily Worker, circa 1934. Burck first worked professionally as an artist as a portrait painter, an occupation which he pursued full-time for one year. He subsequently worked for a short time as a sign painter, his 1935 official biography claiming this decision was related to Burck's belief that this constituted \\"a more wholesome means of earning a living [than painting society portraits].\\" Nevertheless, Burck continued his artistic practice, including portraiture. Burck joined the revolutionary movement in 1926.Andrew Hemingway, Artists on the Left: American Artists and the Communist Movement, 1926-1956. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2002; pg. 31. In 1927 or 1928, Burck began to draw occasional editorial cartoons for the Communist Party's daily newspaper, The Daily Worker, as well as its monthly artistic-literary magazine, The New Masses. He went on staff at The Daily Worker full-time as cartoonist in 1929. Burck's political cartoons were a regular feature in the Daily Worker's annual collection, Red Cartoons, published each year from 1926 to 1930. His material was also gathered for a full-length book in 1935, a 248-page work entitled Hunger and Revolt. Burck was close friends with Alexander Calder, Whittaker Chambers (husband of ASL classmate Esther Shemitz), Langston Hughes, Meyer Schapiro, and many other figures in the New York art and progressive scene. During this period, he exhibited with other prominent artists, including: George Grosz, José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, Reginald Marsh, Jean Charlot, Thomas Hart Benton, Hugo Gellert, William Gropper, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Julio Castellanos, John Flannagan (sculptor), and Louis Lozowick. In 1931, Burck was a founding Director of the \\"New York Suitcase Theater\\", along with playwright Paul Peters, poet Langston Hughes, and writer Whittaker Chambers.Tanenhaus, Sam (1997). Whittaker Chambers: A Biography. Random House. Burck's work was exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Art's First Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Sculpture, Watercolors and Prints, which opened in December, 1933.https://whitney.org/exhibitions/biennial-1933 During the mid-1930s, Burck was a contributing editor of Labor Defender, monthly magazine of the Communist Party's legal defense organization, International Labor Defense. He also contributed work to the official organ of the party's social and fraternal organization, the International Workers Order. In 1934, \\"The American Scene No. 1: A Comment upon American Life by America's Leading Artists\\" was published, a portfolio of six lithographs by Burck and his colleagues, George Biddle, Adolf Dehn, George Grosz, Reginald Marsh, and José Clemente Orozco.https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-american-scene- no-1-a-comment-upon-american-life-by-americas-leading-artists-167119 Burck was an accomplished muralist and exhibited groups of murals along with Edward Laning in the gallery of the Art Students League.Hemingway, Artists on the Left, pg. 33. Burck was commissioned by the Soviet travel agency, Intourist, to create a five-panel mural for its New York offices, depicting the construction of large-scale industry in the Soviet Union. A New York Times review of studies for the murals stated, \\"Mr. Burck has arranged his figures with uncommon skill, achieving a pattern of splendidly organized vitality.\\"New York Times, February 10, 1935 Plans were changed however and the panels were shipped to Moscow for display at the Museum of Modern Western Art prior to being installed in Intourist's Moscow office. This was a period in which the so-called \\"Cult of Personality\\" around Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was in full swing. While adapting the murals for the new location, Burck took umbrage to the Soviet government's insistence that he modify the content of his work to glorify Stalin. The couple returned without completing the mural. This episode marked the end of Burck's connection with the Communist movement. =Chicago Years= \\"If I Should Die Before I Wake\\", for which Burck received the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning After returning from the USSR, Burck went to work as an editorial cartoonist for the St. Louis Post Dispatch, before moving to the Chicago Daily Times in 1938. Burck's incisive and biting style led to his daily cartoons being syndicated by Field Newspaper Syndicate of Field Enterprises in more than 200 newspapers across the United States. Burck's signature style, with India ink with brush, grease pencil, or lithograph crayon, was soon adopted by Bill Mauldin and most other editorial cartoonists of the 1940s and 1950s. Burck won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning while at the Chicago Daily Times in 1941 for a cartoon titled, If I Should Die Before I Wake. In 1942, he received the inaugural Society of Professional Journalists prize for editorial cartooning, the Sigma Delta Chi Award. Burck's continued style and criticism through cartooning of politicians, hypocrisy, and social injustice left him an open target during the Second Red Scare of the 1950s. Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un- American Activities Committee investigated his early, radical associations. In 1953, they attempted to have the bohemian Burck (who had neglected to formalize his US citizenship) deported. The Government claimed that Burck had joined the Communist Party in 1934 and remained a member at least through 1936. Burck denied ever joining the Party, claiming membership had been pressed on him by his employer, the Daily Worker. Burck's defense was able to demonstrate \\"a long record of anti-communism... [was] exemplified in his political cartoons.\\" Charges were eventually dropped after a sustained legal defense funded personally by the publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times, Marshall Field III. \\"Friends and Elations,\\" Time magazine, April 19, 1954. The deportation order was formally vacated by an act of the United States Congress in April 1957. Burck's syndications dropped drastically because of the government case, but he continued to produce daily editorial cartoons for the Chicago Sun-Times, successor to the Chicago Daily Times, over a 44-year career. A long-time member of the Cliff Dwellers Club in Chicago, Burck received the 1971 Merit Award \\"for distinguished service to the arts in Chicago.\\" Burck's final published editorial cartoon appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times on February 23, 1982. Over the course of his career he was responsible for drawing over 10,000 editorial cartoons. =Death and Legacy= Jacob Burck died on May 11, 1982, at the age of 75, of injuries sustained in a fire in his home caused by a smoldering cigarette. He was preceded in death by his wife, Esther, who died in 1975, and survived by his children, Joseph M. Burck (senior designer at Marvin Glass and Associates) and Conrad. WorksArt= Burck was a prominent painter and sculptor through the 1960s and 1970s. Burck's original works were collected by several presidents of the United States including Harry S Truman and Richard Nixon. Burck's work is also in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art,https://www.moma.org/collection/works/72583?association=portfolios&locale;=zh&page;=1&parent;_id=72582&sov;_referrer=association The Smithsonian Institution, The National Gallery of Art,https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.33254.html The Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art,http://collection.whitney.org/artist/198/JacobBurck the Philadelphia Museum of Art,http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/70208.html the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the- american-scene-no-1-a-comment-upon-american-life-by-americas-leading- artists-167119 the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the University of Michigan Museum of Art. His evocative portrait of Hugh Hefner, the smoke from Hef's pipe forming a group of writhing bodies, hung in the Playboy mansion in Chicago. His work is part of the \\"Capital and Labor\\" portion of the Library of Congress online exhibit Life of the People: Realist Prints and Drawings from the Ben and Beatrice Goldstein Collection, 1912-1948. =Books= According to art historian Andrew Hemingway, \\"Burck was singled out for special treatment in 1935 when the Daily Worker published a 250-page volume of his cartoons under the title Hunger and Revolt. The book also contained 11 essays by prominent people including John Strachey and Henri Barbusse. (In addition, Hemingway notes, \\"Within the John Reed Club Burck had a reputation as a formidable polemicist who was widely read in the 'history and theory of art.' His occasional pieces in the Daily Worker certainly show him as a capable writer, and in 1935 he published an article \\"For Proletarian Art\\" as part of a debate in the American Mercury.\\") * Red Cartoons from the Daily Worker 1928.

He grew up in West Babylon, New York and was a standout high school athlete before attending and graduating from the University of Maine, where he played for the Maine Black Bears football team. Belcher was named an All-American twice in college after switching in his junior year from linebacker to defensive end. Belcher was considered a strong small-school NFL prospect, but was not selected in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was later signed as a free agent by the Chiefs and became a regular starter at inside linebacker in 2010. His most productive season was in 2011, when he had 61 tackles and 26 assists. He was re-signed by Kansas City before the 2012 season and played in the team's first 11 games. Belcher died on December 1, 2012 in a murder- suicide, slaying his girlfriend, 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins, before driving to the Chiefs' training facility and shooting himself in the head with a handgun. Early years The son of John Belcher and Cheryl Shepard, Belcher grew up on Long Island, New York, and attended West Babylon High School in West Babylon, New York. He wrestled and played football there under head coach Albert Ritacco between 2001 and 2004. He was a three-time All-American as a wrestler, and played as a linebacker, offensive tackle, nose guard and fullback on the football team. He was captain of the football team for two seasons and led West Babylon to two Long Island Football Championships playoff appearances, although the team did not reach the title game. The team had its first-ever undefeated regular season in 2004, when Belcher was a senior, but lost in the Suffolk County Championship game. The school retired his number 52 jersey, and he returned to the school frequently later in his career to give pregame speeches to the team. Though he had an accomplished high school career, Belcher was a second-team All-Long Island selection in 2004 and was named to Newsday's list of the best players of the decade for the 2000s, but was not heavily recruited by major college football programs. College career Belcher attended the University of Maine, a Division I FCS school, and played on its Black Bears football team. Playing as an outside linebacker, he was fourth on the team in tackles in his first two seasons, registering 58 as a freshman in 2005 and 52 as a sophomore in 2006. Belcher had a standout season as a junior after he was switched from linebacker to defensive end. The Associated Press named him a second-team All-American, while Sports Network named him a third-team All-American. He led Maine's collegiate conference, the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), with 10 sacks and 17 tackles for a loss. His sacks total was seventh-highest in the nation. Belcher was named a second- team preseason All-American by Lindy's Publications before his senior season in 2008, when he also served as a team co-captain. He led the CAA again with 17.5 tackles for losses. He also had 7.5 sacks and was the association's defensive player of the year. After the season, Belcher was named by the American Football Coaches Association and the Walter Camp Foundation as a first-team All-American in the Football Championship Subdivision, a grouping of smaller schools in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. He was the fourth multiple-time All-American in Black Bears history, following John Huard, Aaron Dashiell and Stephen Cooper. Belcher, who was a strong student in high school and college, graduated from Maine with a degree in child development and family relations. \\"He always did his work, sat right up front,\\" Ritacco, Belcher's high school coach and 10th-grade biology teacher, said later. After graduating from college, he won an Academic Momentum Award from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports' Scholar- Baller Program. Professional career Prior to the 2009 NFL Draft, Belcher was considered one of the best small-school prospects and was expected to move to outside linebacker in the NFL. He was projected by Sports Illustrated as a sixth-round draft pick. =Kansas City Chiefs= After going undrafted, Belcher signed a free agent contract with the Chiefs in March 2009. At 228 pounds, he was considered small for an inside linebacker, but made three starts as a rookie and played in all of the team's games. He had 33 tackles and two assists as Kansas City finished with a 4–12 win-loss record for last place in the AFC West division. Belcher became a regular starter in the 2010 season, registering 53 tackles and 31 assists. The Chiefs finished with a 10–6 record and reached the playoffs. Kansas City lost 30–7 to the Baltimore Ravens in the wildcard round; Belcher had one and a half sacks and nine tackles in the game. Belcher continued as a starter in the 2011 NFL season, recording 61 tackles and 26 assists. Kansas City finished last in the AFC West with a 7–9 record, and head coach Todd Haley was replaced by defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel with three games remaining in the season. The Chiefs re-signed Belcher in March 2012 to a one-year contract worth around $1.9 million. Prior to his death, Belcher played in 11 games during the 2012 season, including 10 starts. He had 33 tackles and five assists as the Chiefs started with a 1–10 record. Personal life Belcher was involved in community activities in Kansas City in 2011, visiting a nearby military base and a local elementary school to promote an NFL program for children. He also traveled back to West Babylon every year and gave motivational speeches to students. Death The Chiefs' practice facility near Arrowhead Stadium where Belcher killed himself By late 2012, Belcher was living with his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, and their three-month-old baby, Zoey, at 5401 Crysler Avenue in Kansas City. Belcher and Perkins were introduced through Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles, whose wife was a first cousin of Perkins. Perkins had also done volunteer work in the community, and with the Chiefs as part of its Women's Organization, a group of players' wives and significant others who do charity work and run awareness campaigns. Friends stated that the couple argued frequently, including after Perkins returned home at 1:00 A.M. from a Trey Songz concert at the Midland Theatre on the night of November 30, 2012. After the argument, Perkins went to the Power and Light District, an entertainment area by the Midland and Sprint Center in downtown Kansas City. Belcher was also in the Power and Light District with a different woman. After losing the woman in the crowd, Belcher drove to her apartment, but she was not home at the time. Police found him there at 2:50 A.M., after receiving a 911 call about a suspicious person in a car parked on Armour Boulevard. He told police he was waiting for his girlfriend, and forgot the code to her apartment. The police discussed the temporary tags on the car and urged him to go inside the building, saying they were \\"trying to cut [him] a break here.\\" Belcher did not smell of alcohol and was not slurring his words, police said. He was later buzzed into the building by neighbors and allowed to stay for the night. Belcher returned home between 6:30 A.M. and 7:00 A.M., and had another argument with Perkins. In the ensuing argument, Belcher pulled out a handgun, shot and murdered Perkins in front of his mother, Cheryl Shepherd. Police arrived at the house at around 7:50 A.M., following a call from Shepherd, who had recently moved there from West Babylon, New York, to help the couple care for Zoey. The baby was heard crying in the background when Belcher's mother called. Perkins, who was 22 years of age, had been shot in the neck, chest, abdomen, hip, back, leg, and hand, a total of nine times. After murdering Perkins, Belcher drove his 2007 Bentley Continental GT about five miles to a parking lot at the Chiefs' practice facility next to Arrowhead Stadium. He stepped out of the car with a gun pointed to his head when he encountered Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli. Belcher told Pioli that he murdered his girlfriend, and thanked him before asking for Pioli and Chiefs owner Clark Hunt to take care of his daughter. Pioli tried to persuade Belcher to drop the gun. Then, Chiefs Head Coach Romeo Crennel, along with linebackers coach Gary Gibbs, arrived and joined the effort. Police had been dispatched to the scene at 8:01 A.M. As the sound of sirens approached, Belcher told the men that he had to kill himself and \\"can't be here.\\" He knelt down by a car, made a sign of the cross, and shot himself in the head. A photograph from the scene showed Perkins' blood smeared over the chrome gearshift of Belcher's vehicle, as well as broken glass on the dashboard. On January 14, 2013, the Jackson County Medical Examiner's office released autopsy reports, showing that Belcher had a blood alcohol content of 0.170 mg/dL in his system, more than double the legal driving limit in Missouri. The Chiefs had a game scheduled at Arrowhead against the also- struggling Carolina Panthers the day after the murder-suicide. The game went on as scheduled, following discussions between the NFL, Crennel, and the Chiefs' team captains. No formal mention was made of the shooting at the game, although there was a moment of silence for \\"victims of domestic violence and their families.\\" The Chiefs defeated the Panthers 27–21. Belcher was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy at the time of his death, according to a medical report. A service for Belcher was held on December 5 at the Landmark International Deliverance and Worship Center just southwest of Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs' practice was scheduled around the event. Pioli and one of Belcher's uncles spoke at the closed service. A funeral for Perkins took place the following day at the Ridgeview Family Fellowship in Blue Ridge, Texas. Another service was held December 8 in Austin, Texas, where her father lives; Perkins was buried in Pflugerville, Texas. Clark Hunt attended the service. Perkins was born in McKinney, Texas, attended elementary and middle school in the Dallas suburb of Garland, and graduated from Anderson High School in Austin in 2009. Police revealed that the handgun Belcher used to kill his girlfriend was different than the one he used to take his own life. Belcher had other guns at his house, some of which he used to go to a shooting range. All were legally owned. The day after the shooting, NBC broadcaster Bob Costas, quoting Jason Whitlock, said during a segment of Sunday Night Football that \\"in the coming days, Jovan Belcher's actions and their possible connection to football will be analyzed. Who knows? But here, wrote Jason Whitlock, is what I believe. If Jovan Belcher didn't possess a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.\\" The comments prompted criticism and support from both sides of the gun control issue. Belcher was buried on December 12 at the North Babylon Cemetery in North Babylon, New York, following an open casket funeral at the Upper Room Christian Church in Dix Hills, New York. The hearse passed his childhood home in West Babylon en route to the cemetery. =Wrongful death lawsuit= In December 2013, his body was exhumed from the North Babylon cemetery at the request of his family to conduct tests on whether he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). On December 31, 2013, Belcher's mother filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Missouri state court against her son's former team, the Kansas City Chiefs. The lawsuit claimed that \\"In the months leading up to Decedent's death, Defendant was aware of Decedent's symptoms and signs of cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment. Defendant micromanaged virtually every aspect of Decedent's life when it came to his physical abilities to perform in the workplace, including analyzing his diet, speed, strength and body-mass index.

The novella was published in 2004 by Canongate Books.  Plot  This novella is set in a plague-ridden London in 1593. Someone calling himself \\"Tamburlaine\\", the name of the hero in one of Marlowe's most famous plays, has written a libelous and heretical pamphlet in a style of writing similar to Marlowe's. Marlowe is called before the Privy Council which accuses him of writing the pamphlet; however, he protests his innocence. Marlowe is sentenced to death for this blasphemous writing and only has three days to figure out who really wrote the pamphlet and track that individual down. Marlowe becomes entangled in a web of intrigue, plots and counterplots before his eventual murder.  Factual basis  The novella is based on the last days of Marlowe's life. An individual writing under the name Tamburlaine published a bill about London threatening Protestant refugees who had settled in the city. The author wrote in the same style and alluded to Marlowe several times. A few short days later, Marlowe was murdered by an acquaintance after arguing over a bill. To this day, there is still controversy regarding the reasons for and circumstances of Marlowe's death. The title of the novella was taken from the last words spoken by Tamburlaine in Marlowe's play Tamburlaine the Great: \\"Tamburlaine, the scourge of God, must die.\\" Reception The novella has received both praise and criticism, called a \\"gothic thriller\\" and \\"existential puzzle piece\\". On the negative side, one reviewer felt the \\"narrative fails to convey adequately the sense of trepidation and urgency that one would expect from such a desperate man\\" and Alan Wall in The Guardian called it \\"buccaneering tosh\\".Alan Wall, \\"Zounds Familiar\\", The Guardian, 3 July 2004  Play adaptation  Fittingly for a novella based on a famous playwright, the book was adapted for the stage by Kenny Miller in 2007. Miller also transformed and directed Welsh's first novel, The Cutting Room, into a stage production. The play was produced by Glasgay! and Tron Theatre in Glasgow.

Don Young, the incumbent and a member of the Republican Party, was re-elected to a twentieth term to serve in the 112th Congress from January 3, 2011 until January 3, 2013. A primary election was held on August 24, 2010. Background Alaska's population was 66 percent white, 13 percent Native American, 6 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian (see Race and ethnicity in the United States Census); 91 percent were high school graduates and 27 percent had received a bachelor's degree or higher. Its median income was $66,293. In the 2008 presidential election Alaska gave 59 percent of its vote to Republican nominee John McCain and 38 percent to Democratic nominee Barack Obama. Republican Don Young was the incumbent. Young was re-elected with 50 percent of the vote in 2008. Campaign In 2010 Young's opponent in the general election was Democratic nominee Harry Crawford, a member of the Alaska House of Representatives and former ironworker. John R. Cox and Sheldon Fisher, a former telecommunications executive, also sought the Republican nomination. Andrew Halcro, a former member of the state House of Representatives who unsuccessfully tan for Governor of Alaska in 2006, said in September 2009 that he would challenge Young in the 2010 Republican primary, but in February 2010 said he was reconsidering his decision. Gabrielle LeDoux, a former member of the state House of Representatives who sought the Republican nomination in the district in 2008, said in July 2009 that she would not run in 2010 if Young sought re-election. Crawford was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Ethan Berkowitz, the former minority leader of the state House of Representatives who unsuccessfully challenged Young as the Democratic nominee in 2008, said in December of that year that he was considering running again, but said in July 2009 that he would not run. Young raised $1,001,015 and spent $887,310. Crawford raised $240,439 and spent $235,571. Fisher raised $177,981 and spent the same amount. In a poll of 710 voters, conducted by Public Policy Polling (PPP) on January 27 and 28, 2010, Young led with 49 percent to Crawford's 34 percent, while 17 percent were undecided. A PPP poll of 1,306 likely voters, conducted on August 27 and 28, 2010, found that Young had the support of 55 percent while 36 percent favored Crawford and 8 percent were undecided. In a poll of 573 registered and likely voters, conducted between September 23 and 27, 2010 by Ivan Moore Research, Young led with 65 percent to Crawford's 32 percent, while 4 percent were undecided. A poll of 1,678 likely voters, conducted by PPP on October 9 and 10, 2010, found Young leading Crawford by 58 percent to 36 percent, while 6 percent were undecided. Prior to the election FiveThirtyEight's forecast gave Young a 100 percent chance of winning and projected that he would receive 65 percent of the vote to Crawford's 35 percent. On election day Young was re- elected with 69 percent to Crawford's 31 percent. Young was again re-elected in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.

It is a remake of the 1985 NES port of Irem's arcade version of Tim Martin's Spelunker and it was available on the PlayStation Network's Store. While in terms of gameplay the game does not differ greatly from the original, it adds HD graphics, although the NES version can still be played, as well as 100 all-new levels over 10 different locations. A Japanese-only version titled Spelunker Black was later made available on the PlayStation Store in 2010. It features Black Spelunker as the new protagonist along with a much narrower field of vision. It was first announced on TGS 2008. It was released in Japan on March 26, 2009, the rest of Asia on July 28, 2009, in North America on November 23, 2010, and in Europe on August 10, 2011. In 2015, Square Enix announced a free- to-play sequel for the PlayStation 4 titled Spelunker World.  PlayStation Home  Irem has released a PlayStation Home themed space based on the remake, Minna de Spelunker, in the Japanese version of PlayStation Home on March 19, 2009, and the Asian version on July 23, 2009. This space is called the \\"Gathering Place for Spelunkers\\" and includes a Message Board, a video screen, seating for the avatars, a Stone Monument which is a credits reel of the developers, eight artifact displays, three in-lounge avatars that tell the users something (Weedy Spelunker?, Wise Boy, & Muttering Old Man), and a full game launching support feature accessed by the Stone Statues of the Moon & Sun or the Stone Statues of the Wind & Rain. There are also dancing purple ghost that come out at certain times. There is also an expansion to the space, called \\"The Bat-infested Abandoned Mine Cave\\", that takes users deeper into the cave of the Gathering Place for Spelunkers. Here they can play Flashbang Launcher where they collect the Flashband, the Underground Key (Red), and the Dynamite without getting hit by bat guano, then they play Rocks that can be destroyed by dynamite and blow up rocks with the dynamite collected, then they play Minecarts and ride a cart to a place where they get chased by a boulder to a room. In the room there is a shop with Minna de Spelunker related items. There is also a door called The door to the 2nd level underground? which when accessing, gives the users a prize, but cannot be opened until a later time. The game of Minna de Spelunker supports Home rewards such as a spelunker costume for the users avatars.  Spelunker Black  Logo for Spelunker Black An additional version, titled Minna de Spelunker Black, was released on January 7, 2010 for Japan. Although it was never localized, western media has referred to the game as Spelunker Black. The Black version is a re-release of Spelunker HD with minor changes in gameplay and a new playable character. A large portion of the player's vision is now obscured by darkness throughout the stages. A flare can be released into the air to temporarily grant the player a broader field of vision. The game's increased difficulty contributed to its low popularity compared to its original version. It was later removed from the PSN alongside Spelunker HD when Tozai Games acquired the publishing rights of the series from Irem. The base game was then republished under Tozai Games, but the Black version remains delisted to this day.

The fortification was established by the Spanish Army in 1752 at the site of present-day Tubac, Arizona. Its ruins are preserved in the Tubac Presidio State Historic Park. HistorySpanish Period= The presidio housed a garrison of about fifty cavalry and or infantry soldiers and was intended to protect Spanish settlements and missions in the valley of the Santa Cruz River. In 1766, the garrison had 51 officers and men, and a settlement of forty families had grown up around the post. In 1774, Tubac's commander, Captain Juan Bautista de Anza, assembled the expedition that explored a land route from the Santa Cruz Valley to California. A reorganization of frontier defenses in 1775 resulted in the transfer of the garrison. The force under Lieutenant Juan Fernandez Carmona was enlarged to fifty-six officers and men and received orders to proceed forty miles north to a site within present-day downtown Tucson, Arizona. There they constructed the Presidio San Augustin del Tucson in 1775 under the orders of Captain Hugh O'Conor. Eventually a new garrison formed in the Tubac presidio, which campaigned against the Apaches for decades until the Mexican War of Independence. An early map of the presidio and surroundings. In 1775 and 1776, de Anza escorted 240 colonists from San Miguel de Horcasitas (in Sonora, Mexico), to Monterey, California. Leaving the colonists at Monterey, de Anza continued north as far as present-day San Francisco, where he selected sites for the mission and presidio. By the early years of the 19th century, Tubac's garrison continued to protect the area from raids by Apache Indians. In 1804, the post had two officers, two sergeants and eighty-four men. There were also eight families of Spanish settlers and 20 Indian families living within the presidio land allotment of five square miles. The garrison community had 1,000 head of cattle, 5,000 sheep, 600 horses, 200 mules, and 15 burros and 300 goats, and had an annual harvest of 1,000 bushels of wheat and 600 bushels of corn. =Mexican Period= Following the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821, the presidio was abandoned and the settlement was in ruins when settlers from the United States reached the Santa Cruz Valley in the late 1840s, no official garrison manned the fortress and it remained abandoned along with the settlement for most of the Mexican period. For a short while in 1846 during the Mexican–American War, Tubac was home to a large company of Mexican troops, over 200 men. The Mexicans had retreated from Fort Tucson just before the American Mormon Battalion captured it. After the war Tubac was abandoned until Americans traveling for the California Gold Rush decided to settle there instead. =American Period= Tubac officially became an American settlement in 1853 after the Gadsden Purchase. At this time Tubac was home to several dozen people and was a company town for the mining company of Charles D. Poston. The post was manned by a small team of militia and was attacked repeatedly by Apaches in the eighteenth century. The last attack was the Siege of Tubac in 1861. American militia and civilians were besieged in the fort until rescued by the Confederate States militia under Captain Granville H. Oury of Fort Tucson. Tubac was abandoned again after the siege but reoccupied by the United States Army during and after the American Civil War for several years. The main two original presidio buildings remained intact after the turn to the 20th century and are now tourist attractions. The presidio of Tubac was resettled in the 1880s and by the 1886 surrender of Geronimo, the Apache were no longer a threat to settlers in that part of Arizona. The fort was from that point not of military value in terms of strategic location.

They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episodes of the fifth season, and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by Jeffrey Blitz and written by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show. In this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's fire safety skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a comedic roast of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an illegally downloaded movie at work starring Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman, and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim temporarily. Both parts of \\"Stress Relief\\" originally aired together on February 1, 2009 immediately following NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII, and The Office writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. Guest stars Black, Alba and Leachman do not interact with the regular characters themselves, but rather appear in a film within the episode. The Office creator Greg Daniels said this was done to keep the episode more grounded in reality. The episode received generally positive reviews, with Time magazine declaring it the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. The episode is considered a favorite by many fans of the series. Many commentators particularly praised the chaotic cold open scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers with a simulated fire as part of a twisted safety demonstration. Because it aired following the Super Bowl, \\"Stress Relief\\" was the most viewed episode of The Office with 22.9 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research during its original broadcast. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, and received another nomination for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series. SynopsisPart one= Annoyed that none of his co-workers paid attention to the fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, ramming the copier at doors, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy and wears its face, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign. With tensions running high in the office, Michael tries to calm his workers down with yoga and meditation sessions. However, Michael soon realizes he is actually the source of his employees' stress when Stanley’s stress reader beeps uncontrollably whenever Michael is nearby. Michael hands the stress reader to Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and is horrified when the same result occurs. Pam Beesly’s (Jenna Fischer) parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage, and Pam’s father is staying with her and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Jim attempts to cheer Pam up by watching a pirated movie titled Mrs. Albert Hannaday with Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) (they do not know how to access such films while Andy does, so they have to watch the movie in Andy's company). The film stars Jack Black, who is engaged to a character played by Jessica Alba, but falls in love with her elderly grandmother, played by Cloris Leachman. During the movie, Jim and Pam discuss Pam’s parents' situation, but Andy believes their comments are directed at the characters in the film, leading him to conclude they are \\"movie geniuses\\" finding hidden depths in the film. =Part two= Michael believes the employees are stressed because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each of the office and warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight manages to trick Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. When Michael roasts Stanley, (\\"Stanley, you crush your wife during sex, and your heart sucks\\"), Stanley laughs heartily, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him. Pam asks Jim to talk to her father and convince him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam. In the final scene of the episode, the ending of the illegally downloaded movie is revealed: Jack Black visits Cloris Leachman with flowers and a new walker, only to discover her affair with another young man and he walks away heartbroken. Production The Office actor and producer Paul Lieberstein wrote \\"Stress Relief\\" \\"Stress Relief\\" was directed by Jeffrey Blitz and written by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show. The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 1, 2009, immediately after the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII. NBC decided to air The Office after the Super Bowl, rather than another show, due to positive feedback the series received from short promo commercials it aired during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Some criticized the decision to place an episode of The Office, an already established NBC series, after the Super Bowl instead of a new show, and suggested it meant the network lacked any exceptional new material. In writing the script for the episode, Lieberstein said he sought to appeal to newcomers to the series and attract them to the show, without alienating regular viewers: \\"We wanted to do a stand-alone comedy episode that could bring people in.\\" Lieberstein said the script drew less attention to long-standing story arcs, which new viewers would not understand. Lieberstein said, \\"It almost had an air of a pilot in a way, where we had to reintroduce everything. We wanted it to be extremely funny and extremely funny up front.\\" The Office creator Greg Daniels said he felt the episode had to focus on physical comedy and easily accessible set pieces. Daniels said, \\"I looked at all the shows that followed the Super Bowl in years past and I feel that a comedy would be a good choice in the current climate. People want to laugh so we're trying our best to supply some laughs.\\" Actor Rainn Wilson said of the episode, \\"It's a great opportunity for people to revisit the world of The Office and hopefully get into our style of comedy.\\" The two parts of \\"Stress Relief\\" ran an hour long (including commercials), compared to the typical half-hour length of most The Office episodes. Since the end of the second season, the series had begun occasionally showing longer episodes (which they dubbed \\"super-sized\\") on special occasions. Unlike other episodes of The Office, \\"Stress Relief\\" included an extended main title sequence that included the names and images of the entire supporting cast of the series, in order to afford them recognition in anticipation of the high post-Super Bowl viewership. The opening scene, in which the characters frantically scramble to escape the Dunder Mifflin office due to what they believe is a fire, took about a day-and-a-half to shoot. It took much longer than the average 45 minutes of shooting time for a scene of that length due to the amount of stunt work involved. Due to the pressure of following the Super Bowl, actress Jenna Fischer said, \\"I don't think we've ever worked so hard on an episode in the history of our show.\\" The Office actor and writer B. J. Novak, who did not appear in \\"Stress Relief\\", said of the episode, \\"It's awesome. After this airs, people are going to refer to the Super Bowl as the Pre-Office Football Spectacular.\\" In anticipation of particularly high viewership due to the Super Bowl, NBC officials encouraged The Office producers to feature celebrity guest appearances in the episode. Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman all made guest appearances in \\"Stress Relief\\" as a result. However, they do not interact with the cast and characters of The Office, but rather appear separately in a bootleg film called Mrs. Albert Hannaday, which the characters watch within the episode. Greg Daniels said this was done because it \\"helps keep the show grounded and less like I Love Lucy\\". Lieberstein also said the casting decision made sense because, \\"If we're just casting some salesman that comes into the office and it's Jack Black, it's hard to believe that.\\" \\"Stress Relief\\" marked Black's fourth television appearance in five years: he previously appeared in the Fox sitcom Cracking Up in 2004, the Comedy Central series The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show in 2004, and the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons in 2007. Steve Carell said of Leachman's performance, \\"She is that extra seasoning. That extra spice to the pot that makes for a delicious comedy gumbo.\\" Cultural references Just before Dwight starts his fire simulation, he said his co-workers previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on the computer program Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, \\"PowerPoint is boring\\". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, \\"Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!\\" A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they no longer have to pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because \\"he's more for you guys\\"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of \\"Stayin' Alive\\", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with \\"I Will Survive\\" by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs \\"You Make My Dreams Come True\\" by Hall and Oates, \\"All Out of Love\\" by the soft rock duo Air Supply, \\"Have a Little Faith in Me\\" by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and \\"Lady\\" by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday. Michael describes the roast as an event in the style of televised comedy specials that air on the cable network, Comedy Central. In describing the upcoming roast, Michael says he plans to call YouTube, an online video sharing website, to record the event. During the roast, Pam says Michael's penis is so small, \\"If it were an iPod, it would be a Shuffle\\", a reference to the smallest of the Apple Inc. portable media player brands. Kelly said she would rather kiss Lord Voldemort, the hideous antagonist of the Harry Potter novels and films, than Michael. Andy sings a song about Michael, \\"What I Hate About You\\", to the tune of the rock song by The Romantics, \\"What I Like About You\\". Angela makes a joke, \\"If you put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott\\", which is modeled after the \\"you might be a redneck\\" one-liner jokes by comedian Jeff Foxworthy. While roasting his co-workers at the end of the episode, Michael says to Andy, \\"Cornell called and they think you suck\\", a reference to Cornell University, the Ithaca, New York college the Andy character attended. Ratings In its original American broadcast on February 1, 2009, \\"Stress Relief\\" was viewed by 22.9 million viewers in 13.34 million homes, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched episode of The Office and the only episode to reach over 20 million viewers. The episode drew a 10.6 rating and 14.46 million viewers between the ages 18 and 49. It more than doubled the show's previously highest rating in the age group, and constituted the largest 18–49 rating for an NBC entertainment telecast in four-and-a-half years, since the tenth season finale of the medical drama series ER on May 13, 2004. An estimated 37.7 million viewers watched at least six minutes or more of \\"Stress Relief\\". As expected, The Office benefited highly from following the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII, which was seen by 98.7 million average viewers, making it the most watched Super Bowl in history at the time. Critical reception \\"Stress Relief\\" received generally positive reviews. Time magazine named it the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. \\"Stress Relief\\" was voted the third highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 8.89 out of 10. Stanley's heart attack in response to Dwight's fake fire drill ranked number 10 in phillyBurbs.com's top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office. Many critics particularly praised the opening scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers by simulating a fire. The sequence included scenes such as Kevin looting a vending machine amid the chaos, Michael throwing a nearby projector out of the conference room window to call for help, Oscar's legs crashing through the ceiling as he tries to crawl out, Angela tossing her cat through an open ceiling tile only for it to fall through another tile, Jim and Andy using the copier as a battering ram, and the latter's reaction to a series of popping caps: \\"The fire is shooting at us!\\" Alan Sepinwall, television columnist for The Star-Ledger called it a \\"balls to the wall, gut-busting, amazing Office episode\\", and called the fire opening scene \\"not only the best Office pre-credits sequence ever, but an all- time sitcom classic\\". Sepinwall said \\"Stress Relief\\" was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the Mrs. Albert Hannaday subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars. TV Guide writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, \\"This was one of my favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the whole way through.\\" Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called \\"a very satisfying ending to the roast saga\\". He called the Black/Leachman romance \\"creepy and hilarious\\", but described the Jim and Pam romance subplot as the weak link of the episode. David Krone of the Los Angeles Daily News said although he had mixed feelings about the fifth season so far, he found \\"Stress Relief\\" to be \\"one of the season's best efforts\\". Krone specifically praised the Jim and Pam subplot and Dwight's character, adding, \\"It's a pretty perfect way to unwind – or, if your team lost, to become reanimated – after the Super Bowl.\\" Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said the episode \\"was funny from start to finish\\", particularly praising Dwight Schrute's role and the Michael Scott roast. However, Ingebritson said he was disgusted by the Leachman nude scene from Mrs. Albert Hannaday. Will Leitch of New York magazine, said the episode was funny, but \\"curiously unfocused [like] two half-hour episodes awkwardly spliced together. He praised the Black/Leachman film, the trouble Dwight kept getting in, and the Jim and Pam subplot, which he called \\"a rare Pam-Jim plot point that worked\\". However, he called the Michael roast \\"yet another Michael- wanting-to-be-loved-and-still-be-the-Boss subplot that takes over the second half\\". Not all reviews were positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek said the episode started strong with the fire scare scene, but \\"tapered off into a disjointed plot\\" that she felt would not win new viewers. She said many jokes went too long and lost momentum, but nevertheless wrote \\"a lot of the episode’s humor was engaging and smart\\". Lorenzo Perez of The News & Observer said the Pam subplot was \\"overworked\\" and lacked impact, and the Dwight character was over-the-top, proving The Office writers clearly have no idea how to rein him in. Perez also expressed doubt the show would attract a new audience because it ran too late into the night following the Super Bowl. However, Perez said he enjoyed the Black/Leachman cameos. Terry Morrow of the Knoxville News Sentinel said, \\"This particular visit to The Office doesn't pop like most episodes\\". Morrow praised the Black/Leachman film, but said, \\"To be upstaged by a B-plot, one not involving the show's main characters at all, is a bit of a misdirection the show doesn't need in a post-Super Bowl time slot.\\" USA Today critic Robert Bianco said the plot was extremely thin and the Black and Leachman cameos were humorless and grotesque. Bianco wrote, \\"Unfortunately, in an hour you get at most a handful of funny moments. So if you want funny from a comedy, look elsewhere.\\" Awards Jeffrey Blitz won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for \\"Stress Relief\\". Dean Holland and David Rogers were also nominated for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series. \\"Stress Relief\\" accounted for two of the ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations The Office received for the show's fifth season.

The project design flood flow capacity for the outlet is . (Dead link) =Construction= In a reversal of normal building procedures construction of the bridges began first, as well as the Bayou Teche floodgates at Calumet. Including the elevated roadways across the flood basin, and the Southern Pacific Railroad swing bridge in Baldwin as well as the three span K-truss bridge in Calumet, a total six bridges were built on dry land between Baldwin and Calumet. The dredging of the approximately of Wax Lake Outlet, that begins at Six Mile Lake (Yellow Bayou), and the \\"Charenton Drainage and Navigation Canal\\", that began at Bayou Teche in Baldwin, both started in 1941 and was completed in 1942. Wax Lake Delta Aerial view of the Wax Lake Delta in 2005 The Wax Lake Delta is a river delta in Louisiana that was formed by rapid deposition of sediment following the creation of a canal through Wax Lake off of the Atchafalaya River in 1942. It is roughly 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Morgan City adjacent to the Atchafalaya delta. It receives 34 million tons of sediment per year.Pushing Back the Sea In the 64 years between 1941 and 2005, Wax Lake was completely filled with sediment, and the delta prograded approximately 8 km into the sea. The Wax Lake Delta's distributary channels form via deposition of mouth bars. The first branch to the west is Campground Pass and further south there are the three main branches, East Pass, Greg Pass and Main Pass.Wax Lake outlet passes- Louisianasportsman.com: Retrieved 2016-08-07 The mid-channel is eroded and deposited downstream at the mouth of the river (usually during a period of higher water flow), which will create a new path of flow around it. There is then an added deposition upstream, thus causing the river to bifurcate. This results in the familiar dendritic pattern. Because it was entirely created during an observable period and, other than the creation of the canal, was not altered by humans, it has often been in studies of deltaic formation. In the time since Hurricane Katrina, it has also served and as a model for delta regrowth in the Mississippi River Delta region in order to restore habitat and protect against storm surge.

The order of precedence in the Catholic Church is organized by rank within the hierarchy according first to order, then jurisdiction, and finally to titular or ad personam honors granted to individuals despite a lack of jurisdiction. Emeritus ecclesiastics are counted among the latter. Precedence may also apply to feasts or actions, as for example in the order of precedence of liturgical days. Sources At this time, a current table of precedence in its entirety is not published by the Holy See. However, the principles of precedence present in the Codes of Canon Law, and the customs of precedence longstanding, inform any formulation of an order of precedence. Some contemporary authors have compiled reference texts complete with a table of precedence based on such principles, and these, though helpful, remain unofficial in nature. Though the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia offered a brief order of precedence based on these principles, it was updated and replaced by the New Catholic Encyclopedia in 1967, which was further updated with a Revised Edition in 2002. The current Catholic Encyclopedia does not include an entry on \\"precedence\\". Since the publication of the first edition, in 1911, several changes have rendered its order of precedence substantially out of date, including the publication of three codes of canon law (1917, 1983, 1990), an ecumenical council (1962-65), and multiple apostolic constitutions that affect the topic. Principles and customs As noted above, the first consideration for precedence is always the hierarchy of order: first bishops, then presbyters, next deacons. At earlier times in the Church's history, deacons were ranked above presbyters, or the two orders considered equal, but the bishop always came first. Laity (including lay ecclesial ministers, religious, seminarians, et al.) are not part of the hierarchy of order. The next principle is the hierarchy of jurisdiction: one who has authority over other persons has the right of precedence over them. This considers a person's office, and therefore can include laity, particularly lay ecclesial ministers and religious. Relatedly, those with jurisdiction take precedence over those with titular, ad personam, or emeritus titles, so someone serving in a specific office (e.g., diocesan bishop) has precedence over someone with a titular claim to the same rank (e.g., titular bishop) or someone who used to serve in an equivalent office (e.g., a retired bishop). Generally speaking, function, or the exercise of office, has precedence over purely honorary titles. De facto precedence should be applied where, a non-ordained religious or lay ecclesial minister serves in an office equivalent listed below (e.g., a diocesan director of Catholic Education is an equal office to an episcopal vicar, a pastoral life director an equal office to pastor, though with respect to the principle of the hierarchy of order noted above). Among honorary titles, geographic extent is considered (e.g., the national primate has precedence over a titular patriarch, as the former has an honorary title extending over an entire country, but the latter only over a single diocese). If two persons hold the same office, precedence is given to the one of a higher order (e.g., of two episcopal vicars, one being a presbyter and the other an auxiliary bishop, the bishop takes precedence). If two persons are of the same order and office, the one who was promoted earlier takes precedence (e.g., of two metropolitan archbishops, whoever was promoted to a metropolitan see first has precedence). If two persons of the same order and office were promoted at the same time, precedence goes to the one who was ordained first (to that order) (e.g., of two priests appointed as pastors at the same time, whoever was ordained presbyter first has precedence). In the case of cardinals of the same rank created at the same consistory, precedence is given according to the order in which their names were published. In their own dioceses, bishops have precedence before other bishops and archbishops, but not before their own metropolitan. A metropolitan archbishop has precedence before all other bishops and archbishops (except the Pope, his Patriarch, or his Primate) within his own province, and a patriarch has precedence over other patriarchs within his own jurisdiction. Similarly, in their own parishes, pastors have precedence before other presbyters and deacons, even monsignors, but not before their own dean or archdeacon. Diplomatic precedence in the Holy See's diplomatic corps incorporates the Congress of Vienna (1815) and the updated Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961). The office of nuncio (papal ambassador) is primarily a diplomatic rank and not of an ecclesiastical nature. Most nuncios are ordained as titular archbishops, and would be ranked accordingly. If, however, the nuncio is present in a diocese or at an event acting as the personal representative of the pope, as for example at the ordination of a bishop, he is granted precedence accordingly, taking precedence over even cardinals present. Patriarchs of autonomous (sui iuris) churches have precedence above all other bishops of any rank, including cardinals. This has been defined in law since 1990. From 1965–1990, they were ranked as equal to Cardinal-bishops. It remains the case that, if a patriarch is also made a cardinal in the Latin Church, he is created at the rank of cardinal-bishop, without a named see, but retains his place of precedence. From the 1917 Code of Canon Law until the motu proprio of Paul VI in 1965, cardinals of all ranks took precedence over patriarchs. The current practice reflects a more Catholic, and less Latinized, ecclesiology.

Etymology  From the Greek opisthen (behind) and orchis (testicle), Opisthorchis is a genus of trematode flatworms whose testes are located in the posterior end of the body. Sebastiano Rivolta is generally credited with discovering the first opisthorchid, which he named Distoma felineus, in a cat in Italy in 1884. However, the fluke may have been mentioned by Karl Rudolphi in 1819, and in 1831, Gurlt published a textbook that included a drawing of a fluke that was almost certainly Opisthorchis. By the end of the 19th century, Distoma contained so many species that Raphaël Blanchard introduced the genus Opisthorchis for elongated flat flukes with testes in the posterior end of the body. He chose Rivolta's Opisthorchis felineus as the type species.

The structure functioned as an apartment building until 1996 at which time it was purchased by Calgary geologist Philip Young. The building was subsequently upgraded and converted into offices for Columbus Energy Corporation, a junior Oil and Gas Company owned by Mr. Young.

The band mixes polyrhythm with samples and other electronic sounds and noise rock. History These Are Powers were an avant-garde, experimental noise dance band from Brooklyn, New York founded by singer and guitarist Anna Barie and bassist Pat Noecker (Liars) in 2006. =2006-2008= With drummer Ted McGrath, These Are Powers recorded the Silver Lung 7\\" and Terrific Seasons LP originally released on HOSS Records and later re-released by Dead Oceans. The early recordings were inspired by African polyrhythms, Der Blaue Reiter, John Cage, Alice Coltrane, and Pandit Pran Nath. During this period, the band founded the genre of Ghost Punk and often drew comparisons to arty experimenters Sonic Youth, Throbbing Gristle and This Heat. Live shows were treated as loud, psychedelic exorcisms with long, improvised passages. =2008-2011= Producer Bill Salas (Brenmar) replaced McGrath as drummer for These Are Powers originally on a standing electro-acoustic drum kit before transitioning later into more electronic production. The band wrote their Taro Tarot EP and the All Aboard Future LP in Salas' hometown of Chicago between several American and Canadian DIY tours. Influences at this time were Top 40 American Hip Hop, UK Dubstep, 1990s House music and New Age. These Are Powers increasingly collaborated with other musicians, dancers, visual artists, designers and videographers for their album artwork, performances, costuming, set design, and gallery events, becoming more of a collective than a band. They gained a reputation worldwide for their high energy live shows, often in unusual venues. TAP performed increasingly in Europe, as well as in museums and galleries. In 2009 they had an artist residency in China and played shows nationwide, organised by Beijing label Maybe Mars and promoters Split Works. Their final release was their CANDYMAN 12 inch on RVNG Intl. The artwork for the album was by Kevin O'Neil and inspired by the fetish of Sploshing. The band announced in early February, 2011 that they had broken up during a memorial show for late promoter Ariel Panero at Death By Audio. Noecker played a prepared bass with a wooden dowel put under the strings which functioned as an additional 3rd bridge, shortening the string length to cause an altered musical scale with the fret positions. This would be the precursor to a custom designed bass, called \\"The Burner Bass\\" by experimental Dutch luthier Yuri Landman which Noecker now uses in his solo project RAFT. In 2012, Anna Barie moved to France founded the experimental electronic duo DUBAI with producer and engineer Johannes Buff. Pat Noecker revived his solo project RAFT in late 2011 and Bill Salas continues to DJ and produce as BRENMAR.

He was a member of parliament (MP) from 1885 to 1900 and from 1903 to 1918, taking his seat as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  Political career  Born in Limerick, he was a student for the priesthood at the Irish College in Paris, but left due to a cholera epidemic and later married Bessie McCoy,( Conor said they eloped, but they were both 25 years old and both fathers were witnesses at the wedding).Conor Cruise O'Brien, States of Ireland, London, Hutchison, 1972, pp.19, 31, 334. In his youth he was a member of the IRB and was active in the Land League. He was imprisoned on six occasionsOnline biography of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington for his part in the Land War.Letter quoted by Conor Cruise O'Brien At the 1885 general election he was elected unopposed as MP for South Galway and held that seat until the 1900 general election. His re-election in Galway was unopposed in 1886 and 1895. but at the 1892 general election, when the Irish Party split over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell and Sheehy joined the anti- Parnellite majority, he was opposed by a Parnellite candidate, whom he defeated with a majority of nearly two to one. In the same election he stood in Waterford City, but failed to unseat the Parnellite John Redmond.Walker, op. cit., page 378 The two factions of the Irish Parliamentary Party reunited for the general election in 1900, but Sheehy did not stand again and was out of parliament for the next three years. After the death in August 1903 of James Laurence Carew, the Independent Nationalist MP for South Meath, Sheehy was selected as the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate in the resulting by- election in October 1903. Carew had allegedly been elected in 1900 as a result of a series of errors in nominations, and his predecessor John Howard Parnell stood again, this time as an Independent Nationalist. Sheehy wonwith a majority of more than two to one, and held the seat until he stood down at the 1918 general election.Walker, op. cit., page 368  Personal and family life  David was the son of Richard Sheehy and Johanna Shea, and was the brother of Mary Sheehy and Eugene Sheehy. He and his wife, Bessie, had seven children, of whom six survived to adulthood. One of his daughters, Mary (born 1884) married the MP Thomas Kettle. Hanna (born 1877), became a teacher and married the writer Francis Skeffington; they had one son, Owen, who was seven years old when his father was murdered by the Captain Bowen-Colthurst in Portobello Barracks, Rathmines, during the 1916 Rising. Kathleen married Freeman's Journal and Irish Independent journalist Frank Cruise O'Brien; the contrarian politician and writer Conor Cruise O'Brien was their son. Margaret (born 1879), an elocutionist, actress and playwright, married solicitor Frank Culhane; they had four children; after his death she married her godson, the poet Michael Casey. Sheehy's two sons, Richard and Eugene, were barristers. The writer James Joyce, who lived nearby as a youth, often visited the family home, 2 Belvedere Place, where musical evenings and theatricals took place every Sunday evening. Joyce entertained the family with Italian songs. In 1900 Margaret wrote a play in which the Sheehys and their friends, including Joyce, acted. Joyce took a particular liking to Eugene and had a long-lasting but unrequited crush on Mary.James Fairhall, James Joyce and the Question of History, (Cambridge University Press, 1995) page 85. Joyce's novel Ulysses wittily describes an encounter between David Sheehy's wife, Bessie, and Father John Conmee, SJ, rector of Clongowes. Their daughter Mary is the spéirbhean longingly pursued by the protagonist in the story Araby in Joyce's collection Dubliners. Another daughter, Kathleen, may have been the model for the mockingly nationalist Miss IvorsEllmann, Richard, James Joyce, OUP paperback (1983), citing interview with Mrs Mary Sheehy Kettle, 1953 in the story The Dead, which concludes Dubliners.

Born in Coxhoe, County Durham, he played for Ferryhill Athletic, Crook Town, Sunderland, Notts County, Darlington, Manchester United, Hull City, Northampton Town, Rossendale United and Great Harwood. Career Born in Coxhoe, Mitchell began his football career with nearby Northern League side Ferryhill Athletic before joining rivals Crook Town. Crook won the Northern League in 1926–27, but came under investigation by the Durham County Football Association for illegal payments to amateur players. In the wake of the investigation, Mitchell left the club for Football League First Division side Sunderland in December 1927. He did not make a first-team appearance for Sunderland, however, and spent the season playing for the club's reserve team. In August 1928, he dropped down a division to join Notts County, but he was again unable to break into the first team with the East Midlands club, and after another season of reserve team football, he returned to the North-East with Third Division North side Darlington in June 1929. In his first season with Darlington, Mitchell became a regular in the team's forward line, but despite the team scoring 108 goals during the season (the most in the Football League), Mitchell only found the net seven times in 31 appearances. Although they were the league's top scorers, Darlington finished 13 points behind second-placed Stockport County in third, and missed out on promotion to the Second Division. The following season was more productive for Mitchell as he almost doubled his goals tally to 13 in 37 appearances, but the team as a whole was unable to do the same and they finished 11th out of 22 teams. The same was true in 1931–32, with Mitchell scoring 12 goals in 31 appearances while Darlington languished in mid-table.Tweddle (2000). In April 1932, Mitchell joined Second Division side Manchester United for £600, but only made one appearance – at outside right against his former club, Notts County, on 18 March 1933 – before being placed on the transfer list.Dykes (1994), pp. 267–8.

The players are wearing gymslips, which were common attire for netballers throughout much of the early 20th century. The history of netball can be traced to the early development of netball. A year after basketball was invented in 1891, the sport was modified for women to accommodate social conventions regarding their participation in sport, giving rise to women's basketball. Variations of women's basketball arose across the United States and in England. At the Bergman Österberg physical training college in Dartford, England, the rules of women's basketball were modified over several years to form an entirely new sport: \\"net ball\\". The first codified rules of netball were published at the start of the twentieth century, and from there the new sport spread throughout the British Empire. From the beginning, netball was widely accepted as a sport suitable for women. Domestic netball competitions arose in several countries during the first half of the 20th century. Starting from the 1920s, national associations were formed to organise the sport in netball-playing nations. International matches were played sporadically in the early 20th century, but were hampered by varying rules in different countries. By 1960, the rules of netball were standardised internationally. An international governing body was formed to oversee the sport globally, now called the International Netball Federation (INF). The second half of the 20th century saw international competition expand, with the sport's premier international competition, the INF Netball World Cup, starting in 1963. Netball has also been contested at the Commonwealth Games since 1998. Today, netball is popular in Commonwealth nations, and is reportedly played by over 20 million people worldwide. It remains primarily a women's sport, although male participation is increasing in some countries. Further developments to the sport are being trialled, including a shortened version of the game played in a World Series format; netball is also being advocated for possible inclusion in the Olympic Games.  Origins from basketball  Naismith's original \\"basket ball\\" court in Springfield, Massachusetts Netball traces its roots to basketball. Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in the United States, who was trying to develop an indoor sport for his students at the YMCA Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. His game was first played in the campus gymnasium on a court roughly half the size of a regulation NBA court today, between two teams of nine players. It was played with a soccer ball that was shot into closed-bottom peach baskets that were nailed to the gymnasium wall. Women teachers became interested in Naismith's game soon afterwards. Senda Berenson, a physical education instructor at nearby Smith College, read an article on Naismith's game, and in 1892 adapted his game for her female students. Berenson devised rules that maintained feminine decorum and slowed down potentially \\"strenuous\\" play. She divided the playing court into thirds, each containing three players per team that could not leave their assigned zone. Players also could not hold the ball for more than three seconds, dribble it more than three times, or snatch the ball from another player. The first game of women's basketball was played in 1892 at Smith College. By 1895, women's basketball had spread across the United States, with variations of the rules emerging in different areas. Published rules for women's basketball first appeared in 1895, written by Clara Gregory Baer, who was working as a physical education instructor at Sophie Newcomb College in New Orleans during the 1890s. Baer introduced women's basketball to her female students at Sophie Newcomb College as early as 1893. According to the International Netball Federation, Baer received a copy of the basketball rules from Naismith, but she misinterpreted his unclear drawings marking the zones that players could best control, believing that they were restrictions on player movement. Naismith noted that Baer's game was substantially different from his version and recommended that she give her sport a different name. In 1895, Baer published the rules of her game under the name \\"basquette\\"; these were the first published rules for women's basketball. The rules of this game were substantially different from Berenson's, although similarly adapted for women's participation. Each player was assigned a zone on court to which they were confined, and so a game with seven players per team was played on a court with seven zones. She also forbade dribbling of the ball and guarding, introduced alternating offensive/defensive roles after each goal was scored, and developed rules to maintain elegant posture among players.. Eventually, the first unified rules of women's basketball were published in the Spalding Athletic Library Rules for Women's Basket Ball in 1901, with Berenson as editor and with some rules adopted from Baer's game.. Starting from 1918, the rules of women's basketball were gradually rewritten to more closely resemble men's basketball, and today basketball is played under the same rules by men and women. However, a different sport emerged when basketball arrived in England.  \\"Net ball\\" in the British Empire  alt=A group of 15 women in long-sleeved shirts and ankle-length skirts on a grass netball court Basketball was first introduced to England in 1892 through the YMCA at Birkenhead in Merseyside, although the sport did not gain significant popularity in that country for another two decades. Basketball was also taught at other institutions in England, either by visiting American instructors or by English people returning from visits to North America. In 1893, Martina Bergman-Österberg informally introduced one version of basketball to her female physical training students at the Hampstead Physical Training College in London, after having seen the game being played in the United States. Madame Österberg advocated physical fitness for women to better prepare them for motherhood and in the wider context of women's emancipation.. Basketball was more formally introduced to Madame Österberg's college by an American lecturer, Dr Toles (alternatively spelled \\"Toll\\"), in 1895. This version of the game was played with waste paper baskets for goals that were hung on walls; there were also no lines, boundaries, or circles as in the modern game. The rules of this game were modified at Madame Österberg's college (which moved to Dartford, Kent in 1895) over several years. Substantial revisions were made during a visit in 1897 from another American teacher, Miss Porter, who introduced rules from women's basketball in the United States; the game also moved outdoors onto grass courts, the playing court was divided into three zones, and the baskets were replaced with rings that had nets. By this time, the new sport had also acquired a new name: \\"net ball\\". The first codified rules of netball were published in 1900 or 1901 by the Ling Association (later the Physical Education Association), with 250 copies of the rules published. From England, the game of netball was spread to all corners of the British Empire. In some countries, the sport still retained the name \\"women's (outdoor) basketball\\" upon its arrival. \\"Women's basketball\\" arrived in Australia reportedly as early as 1897, although most sources agree that it was established in that country around the start of the 20th century. \\"Women's basketball\\" arrived in New Zealand in 1906 or 1907. from Australia. By 1909, \\"netball\\" was also being played in schools in Jamaica. Netball spread throughout much of the British Empire during the first half of the 20th century.  Development in the early 20th century  alt=Female umpire and male umpire watch as young girls shoot a ball at a netball hoop. From the start, netball was developed as a women's sport: existing outside the sphere of male-dominated sports, netball did not encounter the initial social opposition that faced women in other sports in the early 20th century. Women's participation in netball in the early 20th century was widely accepted, as the sport avoided physical contact and did not involve male participation. The sport spread substantially through the school systems of many netball-playing countries. National netball associations were established, starting from the 1920s, to administer various organised netball leagues and organisations on a national level. The first such organisation was the New Zealand Basketball Association, which was formed in 1924. Equivalent organisations were formed in other countries, including the All England Net Ball Association in 1926, the All Australia Women's Basketball Association in 1927, and the Jamaican Netball Association in 1957. In 1949, wheelchair netball was introduced at the Grand Festival of Paraplegic Sport and was played at every festival until 1954. Competitive netball in the early 20th century mostly comprised local leagues or nationwide domestic tournaments. International competition was initially hindered by variations of rules in different countries. Australia and New Zealand contested the first international game of netball (still called \\"women's basketball\\" in both countries) in 1938, when the New Zealand team toured Australia, playing local and state teams as well as the Australian national team. At the time, Australia played seven-a-side netball, while New Zealand played nine-a-side. For these matches, Australian seven-a-side netball was adopted, along with some netball rules from England. In their one encounter for that tour, Australia's national team defeated New Zealand 40–11. England played Scotland and Wales in the first international matches of \\"netball\\" in 1949, with England winning 25–3 in both games.  Standardisation and the global game  Netball sculpture in Trinidad and Tobago outside the National Stadium, used for the 1979 World Netball Championships Following the 1956 Australian tour of England, the first efforts were made in earnest to establish unifying international rules for netball. These efforts culminated in 1960 with representatives from key netball-playing countries – including England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka (then \\"Ceylon\\"), as well as the West Indies – agreeing on a regularised set of rules, with seven- a-side teams; an international body was also formed to govern the sport globally, called the International Federation of Women's Basketball and Netball (now the International Netball Federation). The sport was referred to as \\"netball\\" in most countries, although New Zealand and Australia still used the name \\"women's basketball\\"; both countries eventually adopted the name \\"netball\\" in 1970. This meeting also resulted in the creation of a world tournament to be played every four years, now called the Netball World Cup. The inaugural tournament was played in Eastbourne, England in 1963, and tournaments have since been played quadrennially. Since their inception, Australia has dominated the World Championships, winning 11 of the 14 tournaments played. The most recent tournament was the 2015 Netball World Cup in Sydney, with Australia emerging as winners. The next tournament is scheduled for 2019 in Liverpool.  Expanding international competition  Malawi and Fiji at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Following the global standardisation of netball rules, international netball competition expanded during the second half of the 20th century. It was included for the first time in 1985 at the World Games, a sporting competition held every four years for sports that are not contested at the Olympic Games. Netball has not been included in the World Games since. During the 1988 Australian Bicentenary celebrations, a youth netball tournament was organised in Canberra involving U-21 teams from around the world on 15–24 July.. This tournament proved to be a success, and has continued to be held roughly every four years, presently as the World Youth Netball Championships. Fiji hosted the next tournament in 1992, followed by Canada in 1996, Wales in 2000 and the United States in 2005. The most recent tournament was held in the Cook Islands in 2009, with Australia U21 emerging as champions. At the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, netball was included in the programme as a demonstration sport. Netball became a competitive sport in the Commonwealth Games at the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur. Australia won the inaugural netball competition in 1998, and again at the 2002 Games in Manchester. New Zealand won the next two netball competitions at the 2006 Games in Melbourne and the 2010 Games in Delhi. Netball has since become a \\"core sport\\" at the Commonwealth Games (for women only). Netball has never been contested at the Olympic Games, nor has it been shown as a demonstration sport. However, netball became an Olympic \\"recognised sport\\" in 1995, paving the way for its possible inclusion as a competitive sport in the future. A campaign in England was started in 2008 for netball to be included as a demonstration sport at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, which was supported by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Smaller regional tournaments emerged in the 1990s and early 2000s giving increased competition for second-tier nations, including the Asian Netball Championship and the Nations Cup. Netball has also been included in various smaller multi-sport events, including the Pacific Games, All-Africa Games, World Masters Games and the Arafura Games. Increased international competition led to the development of the INF World Rankings in 2008, in which the performances of national teams could be compared. Higher-ranked national teams often compete on an annual basis, either in one-off tests or as part of tours. The Australian and New Zealand national teams have traditionally dominated the international game, although England and Jamaica are becoming increasingly competitive against their Antipodean counterparts.  Elite domestic competitions  ANZ Championship pre-season game in Sydney, March 2009 Nationwide netball competitions emerged in different countries in the first half of the twentieth century, starting from the 1920s. These were primarily contested between local-level clubs or regions/states. Elite domestic competitions did not emerge until the late twentieth century. These competitions have usually involved franchises rather than club or representative teams, and have focused on gaining a larger profile for the sport, as well as attracting greater sponsorship, investment and media coverage. The Commonwealth Bank Trophy (CBT) was the first elite domestic competition in Australia, starting in 1997. It succeeded the Mobil League, which was still a state-representative club-based competition. The Commonwealth Bank Trophy was televised on ABC Sport, although coverage was usually limited to a few live games and a weekly highlights series. The competition lasted for eleven years, playing its final season in 2007, after which it was replaced by the ANZ Championship. New Zealand introduced its first elite domestic competition in 1998, when the previous Coca-Cola Cup, a nationwide domestic competition contested between regional- representative teams, was reorganised into a franchise-based competition, with each franchise incorporating one or more New Zealand regions. After four years, the competition became known as the National Bank Cup (NBC). Unlike its counterpart in Australia, the National Bank Cup received wide media coverage in New Zealand. During this time, netball achieved a higher profile in New Zealand than in Australia. The NBC played its last season in 2007, after which it was replaced by the ANZ Championship. Britain introduced the Netball Superleague in 2005. It replaced the previous Super Cup, which started in England in 2001, and was established to improve performances on the domestic and international stages. The Superleague started with eight teams, seven from England and one from Wales; a Scottish team was added for the 2008–09 season. Sky Sports began televising the competition in 2006, attracting an overall netball viewing audience of 2.5 million people after its first year, and coinciding with a 6% increase in netball participation at grassroots level in England. The Commonwealth Bank Trophy in Australia and the National Bank Cup in New Zealand played their last seasons in 2007. Netball Australia and Netball New Zealand convened to replace them with a joint domestic competition to start in 2008, contested between domestic franchises from both nations: the competition became known as the ANZ Championship. For the first time, all matches were telecast live in both countries. Player salaries were increased to a point where the sport is now semi-professional in both countries, with the expectation that the sport will eventually become fully professional.  Present status and future  Netball sculpture in New Zealand The INF reports that over 20 million people currently play netball in more than 80 countries, with 74 national netball associations affiliated with the worldwide governing body. It is the most popular team sport for women in Australia and New Zealand, and remains a popular women's sport throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, including in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Jamaica. Television coverage has increased the profile of the sport in countries with elite domestic competitions, but in many cases not to the extent of well-established male-dominated sports. Netball has also yet to reach the status of a fully professional sport in any country. Further developments to the sport are being trialled. A new shortened version of the sport was announced by the INF in December 2008, which was called \\"fastnet\\" (now \\"Fast5\\"). Featuring six-minute playing quarters, long-distance shots worth multiple points, and \\"power plays\\" in which goals count for double points, the new version of the sport has been likened to cricket's Twenty20 as well as Rugby sevens. The format is primarily used in the World Netball Series, which was first contested in October 2009 and is held annually. This new competition has been contested between the top six netballing nations, according to the INF World Rankings. Major international competitions in the immediate future include the 2013 World Youth Netball Championships and the 2014 Commonwealth Games, both held in Glasgow. Fast5 tournaments have emerged in several countries following the introduction of the World Netball Series in 2009. Efforts were also started in England in 2008 advocating netball's inclusion in the Summer Olympic Games programme, either as a demonstration sport or as a fully competitive sport in future Games.Netball includes having 4 defenders including the centre and 4 attackers also including the centre.

The U.S. 73rd Congressional Senate bill S. 3580 was signed into law by the 32nd President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt. Background Between 1933 and 1936, the US Congress in conjunction with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, passed several economic programs with the goals of giving work (relief) to the unemployed, reforming business and financial practices, and causing economic recovery during the Great Depression. Roosevelt was interested in farm issues and believed that general prosperity would not return until farming was prosperous. Many different programs were directed at farmers. The first 100 days of his presidency produced a federal program to raise farm incomes by raising the prices farmers received, which was achieved by reducing total farm output. The Agricultural Adjustment Act created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) in May 1933 and reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations, especially the Farm Bureau and debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, Rexford Tugwell, Lewis C. Gray and George Peek. Amendments to bankruptcy law The 73rd Congress passed legislation in June 1934 to amend the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. S. 3580 , was enacted on June 28, 1934. H.R. 5884 , was enacted on June 7, 1934. Content The Frazier–Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act restricted the ability of banks to repossess farms, amended the previously-voluntary Section 75, and added subsection (s)Collier on Bankruptcy, 8-1200, P 1 b., which delayed foreclosure of a bankrupt farmer's property for five years during which the farmer made rental payments. The farmer could then buy back the property at its currently-appraised value over six years at 1% interest or remain in possession as a paying tenant.(no login required to see necessary information) The S. 3580 bill was named for North Dakota Senator Lynn Frazier and North Dakota Representative William Lemke. Court case The law was challenged by secured creditors, and by May 1935, the US Supreme Court reviewed the law in Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford. The Act was ruled unconstitutional because it deprived secured creditors of their property rights, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Modification and renewal Congress responded by enacting the revised Frazier–Lemke Act and naming it the \\"Farm Mortgage Moratorium Act\\" in 1935. The terms were modified to limit the moratorium to a three-year period. The revision also gave secured creditors the opportunity to force a public sale, but the farmer could redeem the sale by paying the same amount. The law was challenged, but the Supreme Court upheld the law in Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank of Roanoke. After expiring in 1938, the act was renewed four times until 1949, when it expired.

It features a 24-inch (61 cm) barrel and a 5-round magazine. It was built as a cadet rifle, designed to mimic the M1903 Springfield rifle for training purposes.The N.R.A. Book of Small Arms, By Walter Harold Black Smith, National Rifle Association of America, Military service publishing company, 1948 It was produced in several different versions until World War II, when shortages of materials made production of a training rifle impractical. The M1922M1 variant was introduced in 1925. This version had a new bolt head, an improved firing mechanism, modifications to the chambering, and a new rear sight. The stock was also modified to incorporate a flat based pistol grip.Rifles of the World, By John Walter, Krause Publications, 2006 The M1922M1 NRA variant was introduced in 1927. This rifle basically consisted of the improved M1 version's action in the original 1922 version stock. This version was made for civilian use only and was not purchased by the U.S. Military.Rifles of the World, By John Walter, Krause Publications, 2006 The M2 variant was introduced in 1933. This version featured a simplified bolt and a shallower pistol grip on the stock. \\"M1922\\" was not included in the M2's designation. All versions of the M1922 used what would be the safety lug on the 1903 bolt as the locking lug. Initial problems with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug. This mechanism consisted of an Allen key screw that passed through the locking lug bearing against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass pin that bore against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was not threaded but held in place by a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.Rifles of the World, By John Walter, Krause Publications, 2006 See also * Springfield Rifle References Category:Bolt-action rifles of the United States Category:.22 LR rifles Category:Springfield firearms ","title":"Springfield Model 1922"},{"id":"20776315","text":"Ibrahima Simang Sané (born 11 November 1989) is a Senegalese footballer who last played as a forward for French Championnat de France Amateur side US Roye-Noyon.

Taxonomy Carl Linnaeus originally described Venus gallina from the Mediterranean Sea in 1758. It was not clear whether da Costa's 1778 Pectunculus striatulus was a different northern species or not. Linnaeus afterwards mentioned that his V. gallina also occurs in '. In 1952, following Dodge, the name Chamelea gallina was considered to be valid. There were for a while two recognised subspecies: the Mediterranean C. g. gallina, and the Atlantic C. g. striatula. However by 2016, the two subspecies were elevated to the species level, and listed separately on the database WoRMS. Characteristics Two beachworn valves of Chamelea gallina from Wales The shell is solid and thick, with two equal sized valves and up to five centimetres long. It is broadly triangular but asymmetrical, having a round anterior margin but a somewhat elongated posterior. The periostracum is thin and the ligament connecting the two valves is narrow. The lunule is short and heart-shaped, light brown with fine radiating ridges. The shell is sculptured with about fifteen concentric ridges. The colour is whitish, cream or pale yellow, sometimes shiny, and usually with three red-brown radiating rays. Distribution Chamelea gallina occurs on Eastern Atlantic coasts, from Norway and the British Isles, Portugal, Morocco, Madeira and the Canary Islands. It is also found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea and is abundant in the Adriatic Sea. Biology Chamelea gallina lives under the surface of clean and muddy sand at a depth of between five and twenty metres. It is a filter feeder, taking in a variety of microalgae, bacteria and small particles of detritus. Uses This species is used for food. In 1995 the total recorded catch was 42,000 tons with the largest catches being taken by Italy and Turkey. The shells are mostly caught with dredges but some bottom trawling is done and some aquaculture takes place in Italy.  European law  The European Union regulament n° 1667/2006 at article 3. has forbidden the commerce of clams having a lenght inferior to 25 millimeters. The full list of the forbidden marine species is available as an annex of the Habitats Directive. The new EU limit to the lenght of clams came into force in 2010. Two years later, the sanctions started to include a fine untill a maximum of 4,000 euros, besides to the seizure of the catch and the closure of the activity. The norm recalled a decree adopted by the Italian President Saragat in 1968 and created a severe economic damage for the Italian enterprises belonging to the ittic sector, characterized by a production of clams 22 millimeters long. That type of clam is an historic production of the Adriatic Sea mainly in Venice and Chioggia, but also in Rimini and the Romagnole Coast), and even in Campania due to the climate change and a new different mean saltiness of the Italian seas. which blocks the adult claim's growth at a diameter of around 22 mm. Against an intensive lobbying activity of the Spanish deputies at the European Parliament, in June 2016 the Italian parties reached a temporary triennal exception to the limit, in order to avoid the crisis of the ittic sector and to protect an Italian typical production. On 9 October 2019, the exception was firstly delayed for another year untill 31 December 2020. Italian organizations are pressing to the EU Parliament to concede a new dispensation form the limit of 25 millimiters.

Personal History  George Streisinger was born in Budapest, Hungary, on December 27, 1927. Because they were Jewish, in 1937, his family left Budapest for New York to escape Nazi persecution. Streisinger attended New York public schools and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1944. He obtained a B.S. degree from Cornell University in 1950, and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1953. He completed postdoctoral studies at the California Institute of Technology from 1953 to 1956. He married Lotte Sielman in 1949. Streisinger accepted a post at the University of Oregon Institute of Molecular Biology in Eugene in 1960.Monte Westerfield- George Streisinger at the 10th European ZebraFish Meeting, Budapest, Hungary 3-7 July 2017.Streisinger was well known as an innovative professor in and out of the classroom, conscripting a dance class to illustrate protein synthesis, and often requested beginning and non-major biology students. He was very politically active, organizing grass-roots resistance to the Vietnam war and legislative opposition to John Kennedy's civil defense program. He testified to successfully ban mutagenic herbicides in Douglas fir reforestation, and led and won a battle to exclude secret war department research from the University of Oregon campus. His wife, Lotte, was a noted artist and community activist, and the founder of the Eugene Saturday Market, the inspiration for the Portland Oregon Saturday Market.History of Eugene Saturday Market http://www.eugenesaturdaymarket.org/smhist.html Lotte Streisinger – Artist, arts supporter and advocate for peace , Eugene Weekly, 2017-12-21  Research  Monte Westerfield-George Streisinger at the 10th European ZebraFish Meeting, Budapest, Hungary 3-7 July 2017.Following his graduation from Cornell, George under- took graduate studies in the genetics of T-even coliphage with S. E. Luria in the Bacteriology Department of the University of Illinois. His studies revealed phenotypic mixing, in which a phage with a host-range genotype of one phage type was found in a particle who was phenotypically dissimilar. When published in 1956, these studies had profound impact on the study of viral biology. During his postdoc at Caltech, with Jean Weigle, he undertook further studies on T2 × T4 hybrids, which led to the discovery of DNA modification (by glucosylation). At the University of Oregon, Streisinger pioneered the study of zebrafish in his lab. Zebrafish can be genetically modified easily, and researchers can modify them to mimic the traits of certain diseases. In analyzing these created diseases, scientists seek solutions to diseases which affect humans. Over 5,000 researchers in 450 labs throughout 31 countries study zebrafish, and many of them received their initial training at the University of Oregon.

Fictional Character Biography  Otto is the main character of the series H.I.V.E. (Higher Institute Of Villainous Education) In the beginning of the series he is 13 years old. Hailing from England, he was orphaned at birth and left at the doorstep of an orphanage called St. Sebastian's. As a toddler he would pick up books and would stare at the words and absorb the information. By the time he was barely in his preteens, Otto smoothly ran St. Sebastian's as the official leader of St. Sebastian's was very-weak minded, and due to him knowing what they were studying in school and acting arrogantly towards the teachers he had the leader of St. Sebastian's \\"tutor him\\". In reality he was free to do what he wanted, and the leader could use the money she was given to use however she wanted. Soon after he found out that the Prime Minister wanted to cut funding for many orphanages throughout Great Britain, mostly in the slum areas which is where St. Sebastian was. Otto, in an attempt to ruin the PM's credibility and keep the money flowing, builds a robotic mind control device. On the 13th anniversary that he was left at the orphanage (which he celebrates as his birthday) he uses the robotic device and publicly shames the British Prime Minister by forcing him to insult himself and his ministers. Also forcing him to moon the audience. Immediately after the PM mooned everyone during what would be his last press conference, Otto is knocked out by Nero's most trusted Agent, Raven, and is taken to HIVE. On the helicopter he meets Wing who would later be his roommate and best friend. Not wanting to stay at H.I.V.E. for the required six years, he immediately begins forming a plot to escape. Wing goes on board with the idea along with two other friends, Laura and Shelby. Otto has displayed an odd ability near the end of the Overlord Protocol where his conscious mind is subdued and his unconscious commands his hands to type a series of commands in the H.I.V.E.Mind that would have normally taken three hours to put in. He gets kidnapped in Dreadnought and is controlled throughout Rogue by an organic substance (Animus) that allows him to be programmed by H.O.P.E and attempts to kill his friends on several occasions but blacks out before he can kill them. In Escape Velocity, he finds out that he has the ability to interface with any digital technology and control it, and that he is a clone of Number One (explaining his white hair and his ability to absorb information). In Dreadnought he further develops his abilities and eventually saves the president of America. This gets him captured by H.O.P.E., a brutal security force who are actually evil, who use him as a slave by pumping him full of Animus fluid. In Rogue, Otto is a slave to H.O.P.E. who now goes after and starts killing people in the committee in G.L.O.V.E. Darkdoom announces that Otto has to be executed, but Nero sends Raven and Wing to bring him back. Meanwhile, Laura and Cypher look at a new computer system that is faltering H.I.V.E.'s system, which was really H.I.V.E. Mind coming back online. They manage to save Otto and get the Animus fluid out of him, while in the process, killing H.O.P.E.'s leader, Jason Drake and Cypher. It was now learned that Overlord is after Otto to make him his new permanent home. In Zero Hour, Raven gets infected by Animus and takes Otto, Wing, Laura, Shelby, Franz, Nigel, and Lucy hostage. They were all saved and taken to the Megalodon submarine with Alpha Stream Alumni where they plan out how to end the battle. They save Raven from the Animus, defeat Overlord, stop the supposed Nanites from getting lose, and save them all. In the process, Lucy dies for Otto as a sacrifice. The battle isn't over yet though. The Disciples, which is a group that supported Overlord is still out there, and they need to be stopped. In Aftershock, the members of G.L.O.V.E. are furious that Nero was planning to take out G.L.O.V.E., so they sabotage him and his school by joining the Disciples. Chief Dekker, the head of security for H.I.V.E., is a part of the Disciples, and blackmailed Laura to betray her friends for her family's safety. The Disciples murder Alpha students and take Laura, Nigel, Tom, and Penny hostage in the hands of Anastasia Furan. Since Otto was partly involved without knowing he was, he was expelled from H.I.V.E., but he is allowed to return if he, H.I.V.E. Mind, and Raven can bring back the Alpha students. There are strong hints that Otto may have a romantic interest in his friend Laura Brand at the school. At the beginning of Zero Hour he starts a romantic relationship with Lucy Dexter, although in the end of the book, she is shot. In the next book Aftershock, Laura questions Otto if what he whispered to her one day was true or not. Turns out, Otto whispered \\"I love you\\" to Laura as he lay close to death, as Laura shares the same feelings for Otto. Otto shares with her that even though he seemed interested in Lucy Dexter, he always had romantic interests in Laura. This was even proven in the first book, Higher Institute of Villainous Education, when they were talking to each other, and Otto claimed that she was a pretty red-haired Scottish girl with some of the most striking green eyes he has ever seen. Otto's name comes from his experiment number 0110 given to him by Overlord (something he found ironic). Besides mentioning that Otto's name came from his friend's cat, Mark Walden has made no announcements on the origin of Otto's characteristics.

Signs and symptoms The person experiences sneezing as a result of sexual thoughts, arousal, intercourse, or orgasm. Sneezing occurs independent of external nasal stimuli or allergens, and may occur at any point during a sexual experience. Both men and women are affected by the phenomenon. Causes Mahmood Bhutta, an otorhinolaryngologist at John Radcliffe Hospital, states that sexually induced sneezing may be genetically determined, and may result from the way the central nervous system is wired: Another possible explanation concerns the existence of erectile tissue in the nose, which may become engorged during sexual arousal, triggering a sneeze. Cranial nerve zero (autonomic) is also located in the nasal cavity. Its purpose is unknown, but it is thought to play a role (or used to play a role) in detecting pheromones. Treatment Nasal decongestants may prevent sexually induced sneezing. History The phenomenon was noted as early as 1897 in 's remarks before the British Medical Association at a meeting in Montreal. It was later commented upon in print in 1901 in Gould and Pyle's Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine: In 2008, Mahmood F. Bhutta and Harold Maxwell performed the first full-scale investigation of the phenomenon. Before their research, the most recent mention in published research was a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1972, which involved a 69-year-old man, who had bouts of severe sneezing after orgasm. The two doctors noted that men and women often sought help or explanations for the disorder on internet chat rooms and forums. Bhutta stated that these people often felt embarrassed bringing up the disorder with a doctor, and were more comfortable seeking advice anonymously. The internet, he stated, could potentially be a new tool for medical researchers to investigate unusual or embarrassing symptoms that patients might not be comfortable discussing with their physicians.

It was set in Gerry Ryan's house in the fictional Ryantown. The show was broadcast during the autumn-spring season. History Following on from an earlier Saturday night show Secrets, RTÉ devised a new vehicle for Gerry Ryan. The target audience for Ryantown was teenagers and twenty-somethings. Producer Julie Parsons described it as a \\"family show\\" set in a house in which \\"neighbours drop in and people sit around and cook and watch TV\\" with the TV content being provided by Ryantown News, with its anchor Reggie Ryan, Gerry Ryan's \\"twin brother.\\" Each week a real couple's wedding video was featured and Brendan Donoghue did surprise outside broadcasts. The show was described as Secrets 2 and a mixture of Noel's House Party and The Big Breakfast. =Production= Ryantown was broadcast on RTÉ One on Saturday evenings from 7:05 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The show was recorded on the previous Tuesday before broadcast in Studio 1 in the RTÉ Television Centre at Donnybrook, Dublin 4. =Criticism= Described as a \\"dog's dinner\\" and derided as \\"the low-point of Gerry Ryan's TV career which has never hit the heights\\", the show's main running gag was that Ryan had a disobedient dog. Brenda Donoghue would arrive on the doorsteps of householders with a roving camera and there was also an identity parade dubbed \\"Who's Married to Who?\\". Ryantown was named thereafter as one of the \\"Top 10 Worst Irish TV Programmes\\" by the Irish Independent and Ryan was later to admit that it was all horribly \\"half-baked\\" and \\"should have been taken off the air after a few shows\\". . The presenter describes Ryantown as \\"the worst television experience I've ever had in my entire life\\", with producer Julie Parsons (who had previously worked on The Gay Byrne Hour) nearly having a nervous breakdown, according to Ryan.

The newspaper was founded in 1916 by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) politician Otto Braun. Initially, the newspaper carried the devise 'Upper Silesian Free Press - Organ of the Upper Silesia Agitation District of the Social Democratic Party of Germany'.Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918-1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49. Düsseldorf: Droste, 1997. p. 39 As Kattowitz/Katowice was transferred to Poland after the Silesian Uprisings, the devise of the newspaper was changed to 'Organ of the German Social Democratic Party of Poland for the Working People'. Volkswille became the central party organ of the German Social Democratic Party of Poland (DSPP), which had been formed out of the remains of SPD, USPD and SDAPÖ branches in areas that were now within the Polish republic. As Upper Silesia was divided between Germany and Poland, a new SPD organ (Oberschlesisches Volksblatt) was founded in the parts of Upper Silesia that remained in Germany. When the DSPP merged into the German Socialist Labour Party in Poland (DSAP), Lodzer Volkszeitung became the new central party organ of the unified party. Volkswille continued to published though, being the DSAP organ in Katowice.Lakeberg, Beata. Das Judenbild in den Presseorganen der deutschen Sozialisten in der Zweiten Polnischen Republik In January 1931 the Bielsko DSAP organ Volksstimme was, due to lack of funds, merged into Volkswille. In 1933, Volkswille was converted from a daily to a weekly newspaper. The cause was rather simple, the German Machtübernahme meant that financial subventions from Germany for Volkswille ceased.Blachetta- Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918-1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49.

Between 1922-1924 the editor was Dr. Wilhelm Wolf, chairman of AfA-Bund. From 1924 to 1935 the DSPP chairman Johann Kowoll served as the Volkswille editor. Edition In January 1928 Volkswille was estimated to have a daily circulation of about 1,800-1,900. By 1932, the daily circulation had risen to around 4,000-5,000. But soon thereafter, circulation shrunk. In August 1933, the now-weekly newspaper had around 1,200 subscribers. Around 800 of them lived in the Katowice area and 400 in Bielsko.

He is the originator of the Sissener family of Norway. Biography Colonel Guilliame Sissener was born in Brussels in 1779. He started his military career as a soldier in Napoleon Bonaparte's army in 1799. After being captured by the Russians, he escaped in 1807 and joined the Royal Danish Lifeguard in Copenhagen. In January 1808, Sissener was promoted to Lieutenant with the 1st. National Infantry Regiment at Trondheim. This is when he took the name Wilhelm, the Norwegian equivalent of Guilliame. In 1810, another soldier of Napoleon, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (1763–1844), was elected King of Sweden, and took the name Karl Johan. In 1814, France's ally Denmark was forced to give Norway up to Sweden. Sissener benefitted from his common origin with the new King, and rose quickly in the military ranks. In 1814, he was promoted Captain and in 1818 Sissener was transferred to the 1st Akershus Brigade (Akershusiske infanteribrigade). He moved into the historic site of Brensmork in Eidsvoll with his wife Maren Hals, the daughter of a highly ranked soldier. In April 1837, Wilhelm Sissener became Commandant of Kongsvinger Fortress, and two years later he was promoted to Colonel. During his life at Brensmork, the Sissener family made close ties to the Wergeland family. The famous Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland mentions several members of the Sissener family in his poems. Sissener and King Karl Johan were good friends, and when the King visited Christiania (now Oslo), Sissener was always by his side. =Marriage and children= He moved into the historic site of Brensmork in Eidsvoll with his wife Maren Hals, the daughter of a highly ranked soldier. The couple had eleven children: #George Fredrik von Krogh Sissener (1809–1851) #Philip Jacob Johannes Sissener (1811–1883) #Anna Hedvig Wilhelmine Sissener (1814–1898) #Ulrik Fredrik Sissener (1816–1853) #Johanne (Hanna) Elisabeth Caroline Sissener (1818–1891) #Laura Eleonora Bernhardine Sissener (1820–1881) #Mathilde Dorthea Eugenia Sissener (1820–1887) #Peter Johan Brandt Sissener (1822–1885) #Joseph Frantz Oscar Sissener (1824–1881) #Alexander Eliseus Laurentius Boutet Sissener (1826–1896) #Peder Lykke Elisar Wolfgang Sissener (1831–1906) =Death and afterward= Wilhelm Sissener died 29 December 1846.

In this operation, done by the American forces' ships under the auspices of the Republic of China government, over one million Japanese were carried back to their homeland, from 1946 to 1948. The Post- War Status of the Japanese in China's Northeast Region Immediately after the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, about 1.5 million Japanese people were left in China. The majority were in what was formerly Manchukuo, mostly farmers and merchants. Some of the able-bodied men among them were being sent by the Soviet forces to Siberia for forced labor. Engineers and medical doctors were beginning to be asked for cooperation by the Chinese Communist forces. Activities Leading to the Repatriation The Japanese government did almost nothing for this population in the confusion after their defeat in the war. Three young men from Anshan (Kunio Maruyama, Hachiro Shimpo and Masamichi Musashi) volunteered to report the situation to Japan, and met with the Japanese government in Tokyo. They later met with General Douglas MacArthur, then the head of the Allied Occupation Forces, who immediately decided on the Japanese repatriation from Huludao.Paul K.

From May 7, 1946 (when the operation began) till August 1948 (when it ended as Huludao was under pressure from the Communist forces), about 1,050,000 Japanese people were repatriated. Many had died in Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang during the 1945-46 winter before this repatriation began. Those who reached Huludao in the worst conditions and died there were buried in the nearby Cishan mountain (), in simple tombs facing east, toward their homeland.

The image above of the Celebration program shows the event closing on Saturday, October 9, 1909. A report to the New York state legislature in 1910 by the official celebration Commission, as shown on the website of this reference, lists the celebration as ending on Monday, October 11, 1909. The maritime achievements of Hudson and Fulton foreshadowed the importance of the river to New York's progress and identity. Organizers used the event not only to display the success of the two men, but also the status of New York City as a world city and the achievements of its citizens.Fordham University's Hudson–Fulton Project  The commission  The Celebration was created and organized by the Celebration Commission, consisting of a large group of wealthy and influential New Yorkers, such as J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and others. The commission, over the course of its long planning period (from 1905 to 1909), established dozens of committees to oversee every detail of the event, from the Celebration's official symbols to the role of New York's children.\\"Chapter1, Origin of the Hudson–Fulton Celebration\\" , Hudson River Maritime Museum  New light  Electricity played a major role in the celebration, as ships and memorials were illuminated over the course of the two-week celebration. The illumination of the naval fleet on September 25 was followed by a display of fireworks in the evening that reflected off the Hudson River. These fireworks were shot over the naval fleet from the Jersey Shore, so that they could be seen from Riverside Park. The Committee commissioned one company to regulate the fireworks; this would not only ensure a uniform display across the State but also, because the company could set off the fireworks in rapid succession, invoke historic memory of the signal fires that Hudson used to navigate along the coast. The Commission allocated $83,000 from its budget of $934,447 for a total of 107,152 illuminations, including various types of lights and fireworks, installed for the celebration; in addition to the town halls and bridges, these lights also illuminated the Statue of Liberty, Grant's Tomb, Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, the Washington Arch, and some museums, like the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. A diversity of light was used to electrify the city. For the Celebration alone, 500,000 incandescent light bulbs were installed, in addition to the other 500,000 incandescent lights already in use around the state. 3,000 Flare arcs and 7,000 arc lights were used, as well, in addition to searchlights, which lit Grant's Tomb and the Statue of Liberty. Washington Arch and its surrounding streets were festooned with lights.  Parades  The historical and carnival parades took place between September 25 and October 9, 1909. The historical parade provided a visual education to the city's diverse population and visitors, and the carnival parades conveyed the city's culture. The parade consisted of fifty-four floats divided into four divisions, which constituted the \\"periods\\" of New York history up to 1909 – the Indian Period, the Dutch Period, the English or Colonial Period, and the American or United States Period, also referred to as the Modern Period. An enormous float preceded all four divisions – this was the title car for the event as a whole. This massive introduction to the parade's theme depicted \\"The History of the Empire State\\", and included, among other things, a canoe and a steamboat, a wigwam and a skyscraper, and the Statue of Liberty. The Carnival Parade was held later in the week, on the evening of October 2, 1909. It traversed the same route as the Historical Parade. The Carnival Pageant illustrated the great body of Old World folklore that has inspired so much of the beautiful imagery of the poetry, song and drama of all civilized nations. Unlike its sister event, the historical parade, the carnival parade was not divided up into divisions. It did, however, have a grand title car – a dragon spouting flames and carrying a scroll bearing the theme of the parade – \\"Music, Literature, and Art\\". The following forty-nine floats proceeded to illustrate what was suggested in the title. There were several straight allegorical floats, portraying \\"colors\\", \\"peace\\", and \\"song\\", and depicting scenes like \\"The Crowning of Beethoven\\", a float upon which a bust of the composer was crowned by \\"Fame\\", and surrounded by dancing \\"Muses\\". But the themes were also represented through mythology. Floats illustrated tales from the Bible, a Queen of Sheba float; from German folklore, floats of Lorelei, the Death of Fafner, and so on; from classical mythology, floats of Medusa and Diana; from fairytales, a fairies float and a Cinderella float; from Egyptian customs, and so on. The culture represented was extensive. The final float of the Carnival Parade brought the focus back to America, with a representation of \\"Uncle Sam Welcoming the Nations\\", displaying the hospitality and peaceful desires of the United States. Both the historical and carnival parades were met with decent success. New Yorkers’ evident enjoyment of the spectacle indicates that the Celebration Commission did its job well. Its messages of continuity, progress, and grandeur were present along with the floats, but it is difficult to evaluate the popular response to these intended lessons. Regardless of whether they understood the commission's messages, the audience enjoyed both parades. The crowd itself, delighting in its city, may in fact have been the more important spectacle in New York's history than the massive floats that depicted it.  Sailing sea and sky  One way the memories of Hudson and Fulton were honored was in the replication of the Hudson's Half Moon and Fulton's Clermont, the sailboat and steamship each respectively navigated on the river. Both vessels were newly replicated, displayed, and dedicated with great fanfare, and were included in the Celebration's grand naval parade of American and foreign warships, which emphasized the United States’ naval supremacy in the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, the Celebration's military parade on Manhattan Island showcased American national identity and pride while simultaneously promoting international peace. The celebration also was a display of the different modes of transportation then in existence. The famous RMS Lusitania represented the newest advancement in steamship technology at the time and was likewise put on display in 1909, only six years before it was sunk by German U-boat in 1915. Wilbur Wright (back to camera) and mechanic Charlie Taylor fix a canoe to the Wright A Flyer used during the Celebration. The Celebration also included public flights by Wilbur Wright, who had won world fame with demonstration flights in Europe in late 1908 and spring 1909. Using Governor's Island as an airfield, on September 29 he flew around the Statue of Liberty. On October 4 he made a 33-minute flight over the Hudson River to Grant's Tomb and back, enabling perhaps a million New Yorkers to see their first airplane flight. Glenn Curtiss also appeared, but made only very brief flights, preferring not to challenge the windy conditions.Casey 1981, pp. 51–53.  City history  Although Hudson, Fulton, and their achievements were the foundation of the Celebration, the commission also aimed to emphasize the history of New York City and State, from the Native American communities to the metropolitan city of 1909. This narrative was illustrated by the Celebration's Historical Parade, which depicted four periods of New York history: the Native American Period, the Dutch Period, the English or Colonial Period, and the American or Modern Period. The Dutch portion of the parade was particularly significant to the Celebration because Dutch contributions to New York history were particularly revered at the time, inspired by a revisionist history movement known as \\"Holland Mania\\" sweeping the country. This was made manifest in New York by the creation of the Holland Society of New York, an exclusive club aiming to underscore the Dutch presence in New York, from Dutch values such as religious tolerance to the importance of education. Education remained important in 1909, and was a distinct aspect of the Celebration Commission's goals for the event. The Historical Parade, for example, was a way for the commission to teach the diverse population demographics of New York City—many of whom were recent immigrants – about the history of both the United States and the city in which they now lived. Now more than ever, the children of immigrant families were particularly sought out by the public school system; Progressive reformers considered the education of children, especially the children of immigrants, paramount, because they were seen as the future of New York. The children of New York had a specialized role in the Hudson–Fulton Celebration. Hundreds of thousands participated in a Children's Festival, which embraced all nationalities and classes. Even children from marginalized groups like African Americans were allowed to participate. The Children's Festival employed dances, patriotic displays, and history lessons, which mirrored the civic lessons taught in Lower East Side settlement houses.  Reform  The Hudson–Fulton Celebration of 1909 was linked to several reform movements sweeping New York City, in addition to Progressivism. These included the Conservation and Preservation movements, which led to the creation of the Historical Preservation Society. This organization worked to restore and establish landmarks and parks; these goals would be seen in the Celebration, in the many dedications of monuments which occurred over the course of the festivities. These monuments promoted the history of the city, and provided, like the Historical Parade, a visual history lesson for New Yorkers. Similar to the Progressives’ City Beautiful Movement, these memorials hoped to develop a unified civic identity for the diverse inhabitants of New York City. To express New York's civic identity and its emerging cultural preeminence, the Commission organized a Carnival Parade. Its floats displayed the music, art, and literature of the Old World, in an attempt to link New York to London, Paris, and other European metropolises. This event was a night celebration which illuminated New York, creating an exciting and festive atmosphere.  Culture  The cultural refinement displayed in the Carnival Parade was an example of New York's status as a cosmopolis as displayed on the iconic Fifth Avenue. History and culture were present in the dozens of museum exhibitions designed specifically for the event to attract tourists from Europe and other parts of the United States. As the Carnival Parade's floats and marchers moved down Fifth Avenue, spectators looked on in awe. They memorialized their visit to New York with postcards from the Celebration, a hobby that consumed America and bolstered the importance and economic development of the America's postal service. The post office of New York, as well as the city's transportation system, were integral to the success of the 1909 Celebration, as they served to connect the vast American continent and spread awareness of both the event and the city. This momentous occasion was much more than the commemoration of Henry Hudson and Robert Fulton – it was also a recreation of New York's history, a promotion of the city's culture, a window into the social movements of the time, and an attempt to strengthen New York's national reputation and international status. The elaborate preparations of the commission were not in vain; this last great celebration in New York City was appreciated by millions in 1909, and is a success worth remembering today. A commemorative plate was produced by Royal Doulton China, The \\"Areo\\" Plate, which shows Wilbur Wright who flew up the Hudson River for the event, as well as other means of transportation including airships and boats in the river.

FitzPatrick subsequently resigned his position and was followed within twenty-four hours by the bank's non-executive director, Lar Bradshaw and chief executive, David Drumm. A new chairman of Anglo, Donal O'Connor, was quickly appointed from the board, a move welcomed by the Irish Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan. A number of investigations have been launched into the reasons behind the three resignations. The Central Bank of Ireland is carrying out a review of the bank's dealings, although its Financial Regulator, Patrick Neary, has also since resigned his position. So too did a number of other chairmen, directors and executives involved with Anglo, Irish Life and Permanent and Irish Nationwide. Within days of the initial admission, an announcement was made that Anglo Irish Bank would be one of three (alongside Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland) that would be recapitalised by the Irish government. The recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank was expected to be effected in mid-January 2009, following an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM). Lenihan instead unexpectedly announced the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank the night before the EGM due to difficulties he encountered with the recapitalisation process. Recapitalisations of the other two banks mentioned were expected by the end of March 2009 but, according to Taoiseach Brian Cowen, were expected to be finalised in early February 2009 at a total of €7 billion. The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on 21 January 2009 followed two more resignations earlier that month. On 7 January 2009, another director, Willie McAteer, resigned, becoming the fourth casualty of the controversy. Two days later the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary retired amidst much criticism over his handling of the affair. After the nationalisation, the Chairman of Irish Nationwide, Dr Michael Walsh, resigned on 17 February, one week to the day that government- appointed directors announced they were investigating a deposit of billions of euro by Irish Life and Permanent, placed in Anglo Irish Bank before the end of its financial year. Taoiseach Brian Cowen denied claims that he was protecting a \\"Golden Circle\\" of wealthy financiers from being identified. This mysterious group of ten businessmen is said to have received loans from Anglo Irish Bank in return for buying shares, in a move designed to keep the bank afloat. Background Starting in 1986, Seán \\"Seanie\\" FitzPatrick spent eighteen years as chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, during which time the bank grew from a small operator into the third-largest bank in Ireland. When he became the bank's chairman in 2005, handing over the position of chief executive to David Drumm, the bank was recording annual profits of over €500 million. The Anglo share price peaked at €17.60 in May 2007, an increase from under €1 ten years previously. Anglo was valued at nearly €13 billion and FitzPatrick's 4.5 million Anglo shares were worth nearly €80 million at this time. Prior to FitzPatrick's resignation, the Anglo share price had already dropped to €0.32, a drop of 98% with the entire bank valued at a low €242 million and FitzPatrick's stake reduced to €1.5 million. The Financial Regulator first uncovered the €87 million loans in January 2008 when inspectors from the regulator's offices carried out an inspection into the loan book of rival lender, Irish Nationwide Building Society. The inspectors noticed that a large loan was provided to FitzPatrick at Anglo Irish Bank and later repaid. The Regulator discovered at a later date that similar loans were provided to FitzPatrick in September 2008 and repaid by him in October 2008. When the issue was raised with Anglo Irish Bank it was discovered that there were further loans between the two banks over an extended period of eight years. It is uncertain which officials, if any, within the bank knew about the loans. Every Anglo annual report contained a note displaying the total loans given to directors of the bank. This total was measured at a single point in time. In the case of Anglo this occurred on 30 September. FitzPatrick, instead of revealing the true figures of his loans, transferred some of them to Irish Nationwide Building Society, returning them to Anglo at a later date. He acted in a manner that thwarted transparency of Anglo's loan book. Financial authorities investigated if there were breaches of corporate governance. The Chief Executive of the Financial Regulator said that \\"a lay person would expect that issues of this nature and this magnitude would have been picked up\\" by the external auditors, Ernst & Young.FitzPatrick Anglo loans were more than €87m After receiving legal advice Ernst & Young declined to appear before a parliamentary committee. This in turn led to inaccurate figures for the total directors' loans given for eight consecutive years in the end of year Anglo accounts. 2008 was the first occasion on which FitzPatrick revealed his true figure, that of €87 million or twice the total of the other twelve directors' loan figures. The situation was described as Ireland's version of Enron, the American energy company which went bankrupt in 2001, and it was said that the principals would have been immediately arrested if this had occurred in the United States.If FitzPatrick lived in New York, he'd have been arrested  Resignations  Anglo Irish Bank = FitzPatrick issued a statement on the evening of 18 December 2008, linking his resignation with a €87 million loan he had from the bank. Ireland's Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan welcomed the appointment of a new chairman, Donal O'Connor, an official with a substantial commercial track record, saying he \\"seems a natural choice\\" for the role. FitzPatrick's resignation came little over two months after he had admitted that his former bank had made mistakes but insisted it had not been \\"reckless\\". Alongside FitzPatrick's resignation came that of Bradshaw who had held a loan jointly with FitzPatrick, a loan that was temporarily transferred to another bank prior to a year end audit without the knowledge of Bradshaw. On the evening of 19 December, Drumm announced he would step down with immediate effect, but said he will continue to work with the chairman through a transition phase until a replacement chief executive is agreed upon. > It is appropriate for me to step down today given last evening's > announcement in relation to the resignation of Seán FitzPatrick and given > the strong statement of support for the Bank and its recapitalisation > programme by the Minister for Finance.

On 7 January 2009, Willie McAteer resigned his position as finance director and chief risk officer. On 15 January 2009 the Government of Ireland nationalisedTaxpayer is picking up ailing Anglo Irish BankWhat the implications are for savers and investors as State takes over Anglo Anglo Irish Bank and its shares were suspended on the Dublin and London Stock Exchanges. On 19 January 2009, the balanceAnglo Irish directors step down, bank downgraded of the Board, who had served while FitzPatrick was chairman, resigned. The consequence of Anglo's nationalisation caused steep Bank shares lose half their value in market 'carnage' falls, up to 50%, in the market value of the other two large banks on 19 January 2009. =Financial Regulator= Following reports of a communication breakdown at the office of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the Financial Regulator Patrick Neary on 9 January 2009 announced his decision to retire as of 31 January that year. Neary's weakness in dealing with the issue has received much criticism, with Green Party Senator Dan Boyle calling for a strengthening of powers within the organisation and saying that confidence in Irish financial services had been eroded by events of the previous six months. Financial observers indicated that a replacement for Neary might have to be located in the United States or in Britain. There were also reports that the Financial Regulator may have known of the loans for eight years prior to their revelation. The Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton called for the board and senior management of the Financial Regulator to be sacked. The Financial Regulator hired a partner from Ernst & Young, to advise on the €440 billion bank guarantee scheme in January 2009, despite the fact that serious questions have been asked about why Ernst & Young did not spot the massive loans that former chief executive Seán FitzPatrick concealed from his shareholders for eight years. Consultants Mazars, which reviewed their operations said \\"that regulatory expertise was lacking in some areas.\\" =Irish Nationwide= On the evening of 17 February 2009, the Chairman of the building society Irish Nationwide, Dr Michael Walsh, resigned his position. =Irish Stock Exchange= On 23 February 2009, the former Anglo Irish Bank director Anne Heraty unexpectedly resigned from the board of the ISEQ. The following morning, Dublin's ISEQ index fell over 3% to stand at 1,987, a 14-year low. The last time it stood under the 2,000 level was the middle of 1995. =Dublin Airport Authority= On the evening of 24 February 2009, the chairman of the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), Gary McGann, announced his decision to step down from the board, stating that his decision had been influenced by his former non-executive directorship of Anglo Irish Bank. Outcome and nationalisation Anglo Irish Bank has said it would review its policy on directors' loans following FitzPatrick's resignation. The Financial Regulator announced he would be examining the loans issued by Anglo Irish Bank to all its directors, claiming he became aware of the existence of the loans \\"following an inspection earlier this year\\". Ultimately he became a victim of the controversy and subsequently announced his retirement. The Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board (CARB) undertook an investigation into the \\"circumstances around the issue of inappropriate directors' loans at Anglo Irish\\"and into the performance of Ernst and Young. The Irish Association of Investment Managers expressed how it was \\"surprised and disappointed\\" at the controversy and announced it would be writing to Anglo's new chairman to describe its worries. The Irish State subsequently announced it was to become the majority shareholder in Anglo Irish Bank by injecting €3 billion into the bank. Opposition party Fine Gael opposed this move and stated on 14 January 2009 that the bank should be shut down but the following evening the Irish government announced that recapitalisation was no longer a serious option and nationalised the bank instead.Government nationalises 'fragile' Anglo Irish Bank Lenihan stated that \\"clear blue water\\" had been inserted between the old and new versions of Anglo and defended the nationalisation by saying that if the government were to let the bank fail it would be saying to Ireland and other economies that the country was \\"closed for business\\". At an Emergency General Meeting held at the Mansion House, Dublin on 16 January 2009, the bank's shareholders angrily voiced their opinions on FitzPatrick's involvement in the bank's downfall and their lack of confidence in the banking sector. The auditors, Ernst & Young were also criticised for failing to detect the loans during their audits. At the EGM the total level of loans to directors was announced as €179 million. =Legislation= Emergency legislation to nationalise the bank, titled the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill 2009, was voted through Dáil Éireann, being approved by 79 - 67 before passing in Seanad Éireann without a vote on 20 January 2009. During the Seanad's debate on the bill, Senator Shane Ross claimed that \\"no-one was being told the truth about Anglo Irish Bank\\" and called the EGM of the previous Friday \\"a disgrace show[ing] corporate Ireland at its worst, as there were no answers to any questions\\". Senator Joe O'Toole advocated the chasing of those responsible for the bank's nationalisation \\"even into the courts\\", saying that a person could be imprisoned for failure to pay a household bill, yet those who caused the loss of jobs and pensions might not. President Mary McAleese then signed the Anglo Irish Bank Bill at Áras an Uachtaráin the following day. = Discussion = The bank's internal auditors appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 3 February 2009 to discuss the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank. The bank's head of internal audit, Walter Tyrrell, told the Oireachtas committee that the movement of loans by Seán FitzPatrick into the bank and back out again could only have been known by FitzPatrick himself and the executive of his account, claiming that loans were tested by means of random sampling and that FitzPatrick's loans had not once been selected - however one loan he held with a partner was chosen. Fine Gael's Kieran O'Donnell expressed his amazement that each of the directors' loans were not tested. On 11 February 2009, Lenihan revealed plans under which €3.5 billion ($4.5 billion, £3.1 billion) each would be provided by the government's purchase of options intended to re-capitalise Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.  Findings  Review = The Financial Regulator, on the recommendation of the Irish Finance Minister, ordered an \\"urgent review\\" of directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank, saying it has a \\"very serious view\\" of the issue. It claimed the loans were \\"first brought to its attention on December 17th 2008\\" and that a committee had been established to investigate the matter. Irish Minister for Social and Family Affairs Mary Hanafin said the Financial Regulator had \\"serious questions\\" to answer over its supposed lack of knowledge of the loans and the Irish Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government John Gormley asked the Financial Regulator to explain what he termed \\"extraordinary complacency\\" in relation to the situation at Anglo Irish Bank. The opposition party Fine Gael's deputy leader and finance representative Richard Bruton quizzed the Minister for Finance on his announcement that he would provide the necessary capital to Anglo Irish Bank. = Further Hidden Loans (Deposits) Controversy Involving Irish Life & Permanent = On 12 February 2009, details of a further controversial transaction which had the effect of misrepresenting the end-of- year accounts of Anglo-Irish Bank came into the public domain. Anglo-Irish Bank lent €4bn to Irish Life & Permanent (IL&P;) for 1 day by way of inter- bank loan, and a subsidiary of Irish Life placed a deposit of a similar amount with Anglo, which was recorded as a customer deposit. Following a discussion with the Minister for Finance, a board meeting of IL&P; accepted the resignation of two senior IL&P; executives. = The \\"Golden Circle\\" = On 17 February, Taoiseach Brian Cowen informed Dáil Éireann of his knowledge of a group of ten wealthy businessmen who had come together to buy shares in Anglo Irish Bank in 2008 in a transaction which is now at the centre of an investigation by the Office of Corporate Enforcement. Cowen has since denied suggestions put forth by the Opposition that he was attempting to protect anyone involved in this so-called \\"Golden Circle\\". The mystery has been discussed in Dáil Éireann since its revelation, with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Green Party leader John Gormley calling for the names to be made public if a legal way of doing so could be found. Anglo Irish Bank's annual report alongside the PricewaterhouseCooper report on the bank were both published on 20 February but Tánaiste Mary Coughlan stated beforehand that the ten would not be named in either report. The Anglo report revealed that the bank lent €451 million to the ten \\"Golden Circle\\" clients, a 50% increase on previous estimates of €300 million. That same evening, Brian Lenihan also issued a statement containing extracts from the report carried out by PricewaterhouseCooper for the Financial Regulator. The morning before its publication, Ulick McEvaddy appeared on RTÉ Radio 1 alongside the Socialist Party's Joe Higgins, where he stated that the ten were \\"heroes\\" in his opinion (Joe Higgins disagreed). The Sunday Times published the names of four of the Golden Circle members on 22 February. The four members of the elite are Gerry Gannon, Joe O'Reilly, Seamus Ross and Jerry Conlan. The same article declared that Sean Mulryan, Patrick Doherty, Sean Dunne, Derek Quinlan, Denis O'Brien, JP McManus, John Magnier, Noel Smyth, Michael Whelan, Jim Mansfield, Richard Barrett, Johnny Ronan and Fintan Drury were not among the chosen ten. Minister Dick Roche has since stated that the ten cannot be named. On 23 July 2012 the Irish Independent identified the ten members of the golden circle as Belfast-born developer Paddy McKillen, Mennolly Homes's Seamus Ross, auctioneer Brian O'Farrell, John McCabe of McCabe Builders, developer Gerry Maguire, Belfast's Patrick Kearney, Gerry Gannon of Gannon Homes who had a stake in the K Club Ryder Cup golf resort, Kildare businessman Jerry Conlan, Sean Reilly of the McGarrell Reilly firm and developer Joe O'Reilly. = Fraud search = On 24 February 2009, members of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation executed a District Court warrant at the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank on St Stephen's Green, Dublin. The warrant, issued the previous day, allowed the Gardaí, acting on behalf of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to enter the premises and seize documents that may show crimes committed under section 20 of the Companies' Acts.

He was also part of the team that planned the National Health Service (NHS) and as deputy Chief Medical Officer and subsequently Chief Medical officer campaigned against smoking, and for immunization against polio and diphtheria.  Early life and education  Godber was born on 4 August 1908, the son of Bessie Maud (née Chapman) and Isaac Godber, a nurseryman in Willington, Bedfordshire; he was the third of seven children, 5 boys and 2 girls. When he was eleven he lost the sight of one eye due to an accident. Godber was educated at Bedford Modern School between 1917 and 1920,Joyce Godber, The Harpur Trust 1552–1973, 1973, p.169 at Bedford School between 1920 and 1927,Obituary, The Ousel, 2009, pp.167–168 and at New College, Oxford, where he read medicine, gained a rowing blue and took part in two losing boat races. He was partly inspired to pursue the public health by his Warden, the historian H.A.L. Fisher who had been Lloyd George's Education Secretary. Another mentor was a young New College don, Richard Crossman, who was later to become Godber's Secretary of State for Health and Social Security. He did his clinical training at The London Hospital and qualified in 1933.  Career  After completing his clinical training he was employed in a variety of junior posts that gave him an insight into the state of the nation’s health. At a casualty ward in a municipal hospital in London's Docklands, he found that many of his patients were people with serious diseases who were too poor to go to their GP and too proud to ask for a free service. Godber became convinced that a state-funded health service based on need was required. Due to the loss of an eye the medical specialities open to him were limited, also, while he wanted to work in medicine, he did not want to take fees from patients. He therefore decided to specialise in public health medicine and attended the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine earning a diploma in public health in 1936. In 1937 Godber became a county medical officer in Surrey where he worked on communicable diseases. In 1939 he joined the Ministry of Health as a medical officer. During World War II he worked in Birmingham administering the wartime Emergency Medical Services. Godber served as Deputy Chief Medical Officer from 1950 to 1960. He was instrumental is persuading the Royal College of Physicians to form a committee on smoking and lung cancer in 1958. Their report Smoking and Health, published in 1962 was important in bringing the link to the attention of the public. Godber was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Bath in 1979. He was appointed CB in 1958, KCB in 1962 and GCB in 1971. Godber celebrated his 100th birthday in August 2008 and died on 7 February 2009.

Divided into three parts, the first and third sections are written from Bella Swan's perspective and the second is written from the perspective of Jacob Black. The novel directly follows the events of the previous novel, Eclipse, as Bella and Edward Cullen get married, leaving behind a heartbroken Jacob. When Bella faces unexpected and life-threatening situations, she willingly risks her human life and possible vampire immortality. Meyer finished an outline of the book in 2003, but developed and changed it as she wrote New Moon and Eclipse, though the main and most significant storylines remained unchanged. Little, Brown and Company took certain measures to prevent the book's contents from leaking, such as closing forums and message boards on several fansites and providing a special e-mail address for fans to send in links to leaks and spoilers online. Breaking Dawn was released on August 2, 2008 at midnight release parties in over 4,000 bookstores throughout the US. From its initial print run of 3.7 million copies, over 1.3 million were sold in the US and 20,000 in the UK in the first 24 hours of the book's release, setting a record in first-day sales performance for the Hachette Book Group USA. The book was highly successful, selling over 6 million copies in 2008, and was the third best-selling novel of 2008 behind Twilight and New Moon. Unlike the series' previous three entries, Breaking Dawn received mixed reviews from critics. It is also the most controversial book of the series, as adult themes and concepts are explored more directly than in its predecessors. However, the novel was awarded the British Book Award for \\"Children's Book of the Year\\". It was translated in 38 languages with rights sold to over 50 countries. The book has been adapted into a two-part movie, with the first part released on November 18, 2011 and the second part released on November 16, 2012. Plot summary Breaking Dawn is divided into three separate parts. The first part details Bella's marriage and honeymoon with Edward, which they spend on Isle Esme, a private island off the coast of Brazil that Carlisle owns. Two weeks into their honeymoon, Bella realizes that she is pregnant. Because the fetus is part-vampire, her condition progresses at an unnaturally accelerated rate. Bella and Edward immediately return home to Forks, Washington, where the fetus continues to develop at an abnormal speed, causing Bella severe physical and emotional distress. The second part of the book is written from the perspective of Jacob Black, a Quileute Native American who, like other members of his tribe, can shape shift into a wolf. Knowing of Bella's wish to become a vampire, he is immediately suspicious when she returns from her honeymoon and the Cullens keep her father, Charlie, from seeing her. Believing the Cullens have broken their treaty not to bite another human, he advances on their home intending to kill Edward. He arrives and discovers that Bella is undergoing a difficult pregnancy in which the fetus is draining her life away. Jacob begs Bella to abort the fetus to save her life, as neither Carlisle, a doctor, nor Alice who can see the future, are optimistic about Bella's prognosis. Despite concerns that her pregnancy will be fatal, Bella is determined to continue it, believing she can survive long enough to give birth and then be transformed into a vampire. As the wolves are telepathic, they hear Jacob's thoughts about Bella. Fearing Bella will give birth to an uncontrollable, bloodthirsty child, they want to kill her and the fetus. Jacob accepts his bloodline as the true pack leader in order to break free from the alpha, Sam's control. He goes to warn the Cullens that the wolf pack plans to kill Bella. En route to the Cullens, Seth Clearwater, a younger pack member, also breaks away and joins Jacob. He notes that once they formed their own pack, they can no longer hear the other wolves' thoughts. They patrol the Cullens' property and soon after Leah, Seth's older sister and the lone female wolf, joins them. Bella enters labor as the baby begins fighting its way out, breaking her body. Edward is forced to perform a cesarean section, saving the baby. As Bella is dying, Edward injects his venom into her heart. Jacob, believing Bella is dead, blames Bella's infant daughter Renesmee. He goes to kill the infant, and instead \\"imprints\\"—an involuntary response in which a shape-shifter finds his soul mate—on her. The third section shifts back to Bella's perspective, describing her painful transformation, finally waking to find herself changed into a vampire. Fully recovered, she enjoys her new life and vampire abilities. Renesmee grows rapidly into a toddler, and is spotted at a distance by Irina, a vampire from the Alaskan coven. Misidentifying her as an \\"immortal child,\\" a human child who has been turned into an uncontrollable vampire, Irina presents her allegations to the Volturi who outlawed the creation of such creatures. As the largest and most powerful vampire coven, the Volturi see Renesmee and the Cullens as a threat and plot to destroy them. Foreseeing their arrival, the Cullens gather other vampire clans from around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee has forged an unbreakable bond and mutual protective pact between the Cullens and the Quileute, ending the hatred between them. As local and foreign vampires arrive, the Cullen house becomes the headquarters and training ground for the assorted vampires and the Quileute wolf packs. Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses, the Volturi discover that they have been misinformed on Renesmee's identity, and execute Irina in an unsuccessful attempt to instigate a full battle. The Volturi brings up the Cullens' pact with the Quileute wolves and the uncertainty of Renesmee's future in an effort to further provoke hostilities, naming her as a possible threat to the secret existence of vampires. Alice and Jasper, who had left prior to the gathering of the Cullen's allies, return with a Mapuche called Nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire- human hybrid like Renesmee. With him is his biological aunt, Huilen, who explains that her sister fell in love with a vampire and became pregnant with his child, though she died in childbirth. When Nahuel was born, he bit his aunt and made her immortal. Nahuel proves that hybrids pose no threat, and the Volturi agree to leave the Cullens alone. The Cullens and their allies return to their homes in peace, realizing that the Volturi may one day return. When Edward and Bella are alone, she allows him to read her mind for the first time, sharing her feelings about him. BackgroundDevelopment= Originally, Meyer wrote a book titled Forever Dawn, which was a direct sequel to Twilight. While the basic storyline remained the same, Forever Dawn was narrated completely from Bella's point of view, the werewolves and Jacob were \\"only sketchily developed\\", Victoria and Laurent were both alive, and there was an epilogue. Meyer went on to say that she \\"may post some extras someday if I ever have time to go back through the Forever Dawn manuscript—it's just as long as Breaking Dawn.\\" The part that took Meyer the longest time to write of Breaking Dawn was the half-chapter describing the 3 months after Bella's transformation into a vampire because \\"the amount of time per word put into that section was probably ten times what it was in any other part of the book\\" and Meyer liked to write minute by minute, but didn't think it would be exciting. Meyer decided to include the pregnancy in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across the legend of the incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer said in an interview with Shannon Hale, published in The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide, that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to \\"tone down the violence a little\\". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were \\"a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be\\" in the past and acknowledged that they were \\"taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [as] relatable for a lot of people.\\" Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, \\"every point up until that point in the story [the transformation] I would say I could step into this story right here and I could do everything she could do which made it really fun.\\" Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and \\"enjoyed very much\\" writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was \\"a little bit harder\\" as she couldn't step in into the story anymore. In regard to Renesmee's unique name, Meyer wrote that she \\"couldn't call her Jennifer or Ashley. What do you name the most unique baby in the world? I looked through a lot of baby name websites. Eventually I realized that there was no human name that was going to work for me, so I surrendered to necessity and made up my own.\\" Meyer states in regard to ending the series: =Influences= The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both influenced Breaking Dawn. Meyer decided that Alice would write her instruction to Bella on a page from The Merchant of Venice to give a clue that the final confrontation at the end of the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one at the end of the play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a page from, but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with the story, so Meyer changed it. The idea of imprinting, which existed in Forever Dawn, was inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. Meyer described it as \\"the magic of setting things right—which doesn't happen in the real world, which is absolutely fantasy\\", and decided to introduce it earlier–in Eclipse–so she wouldn't have to explain it later. =Cover art= Meyer described the cover as \\"extremely meaningful\\" and said that she was \\"really happy with how it turned out\\". The cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire series; she began as the physically weakest player on the board, the pawn, but at the end she becomes the strongest, the queen. The chessboard also hints at the conclusion of the novel \\"where the battle with the Volturi is one of wits and strategy, not physical violence.\\" =Title= The title, Breaking Dawn, is a reference to the beginning of Bella's life as a newborn vampire. Wanting to add a \\"sense of disaster\\" to the title to match the novel's mood, she called it Breaking Dawn. Another reason for giving the book this particular title is that it matches the book's plot, which centers on \\"a new awakening and a new day and there's also a lot of problems inherent in it\\". ReleaseMarketing= Entertainment Weekly magazine released an excerpt of Breaking Dawn on May 30, 2008. Stephenie Meyer also revealed a 'Quote of the Day' from Breaking Dawn for about three weeks prior to its August 2, 2008 release. The first quote was released on Meyer's website on July 12, 2008. The first chapter of Breaking Dawn, \\"Engaged\\", was released in the special edition of Eclipse. Breaking Dawn was officially released on August 2, 2008 through midnight release parties in over 4,000 bookstores, most of which involved costume and trivia contests, crafts, and face painting. Godiva also made a Twilight-themed chocolate bar, which was released in Barnes & Noble book stores at the release parties. A four-city Breaking Dawn Concert Series, featuring Stephenie Meyer and Blue October's Justin Furstenfeld, coincided with the novel's release. The concert series sold out three of its four locations on the day that tickets went on sale, selling out in under an hour in one city. =Publication= Prior to the novel's release, the first three Twilight books had already sold 8.5 million copies throughout the US and over 2 million copies in the UK. Breaking Dawn was one of the most anticipated books of 2008 with The Guardian noting, \\"Teenagers across the world are anxiously awaiting the next instalment of author Stephenie Meyer's vampiric series of novels.\\" To meet the high demand, Little, Brown Books added a printing of 500,000 additional copies just prior to publication of the title, bringing initial print run to 3.7 million. The book sold 1.3 million copies in the US and 20,000 copies in the UK in its first 24 hours of release, as well as 100,000 copies in Canada during its first weekend. Breaking Dawn debuted at #1 on USA Today's top 150 best sellers list and has gone on to spend over 58 weeks on the list. It was also the biggest-selling children's book of 2008 with over 6 million copies sold. A special edition of Breaking Dawn was released on August 4, 2009, containing a DVD of the Breaking Dawn Concert Series and an interview with Meyer. Reception Critical reception of Breaking Dawn was mixed. Lev Grossman wrote, \\"First, since there's a lot of one-star reviews up on Amazon, let me say up front: I loved Breaking Dawn.\\" Cara von Wrangel Kinsey of School Library Journal responded with a positive review, describing the book as \\"captivating\\" and noting, \\"While this novel is darker and more mature than the earlier titles, Meyer's twists and turns are not out of character.\\" The Charlotte Observer agreed and called the book \\"pretty darned good\\", but criticized the book's length saying, \\"I wish [Stephenie Meyer] hadn't felt compelled to pack so much into one volume. It should have been two books.\\" Mary Harris Russell of the Chicago Tribune also responded with a positive review and hailed the book as a \\"fun read\\", noting that Stephenie Meyer \\"continues to produce witty writing about families, teenagers and popular culture\\", while Time called the book \\"a wild but satisfying finish to the ballad of Bella and Edward\\" and gave it a rating of A-. An article in The Daily News Tribune said of Breaking Dawn, \\"Some of the dialog is a bit stilted,... but, if you stay close to Meyer's rich and prodigious narrative, you too might fall in love with its suspense and moving sensitivity\\". Publishers Weekly stated that the main problem with Breaking Dawn was that, \\"Essentially, everyone gets everything they want, even if their desires necessitate an about-face in characterization or the messy introduction of some back story. Nobody has to renounce anything or suffer more than temporarily—in other words, grandeur is out.\\" In an article by The Associated Press, journalist Sara Rose wrote on NewsOK.com that fans of the series would love \\"engaging characters, great humor, a distracting obsession with beauty, focus on the minutiae of emotions\\"; however \\"casual readers may be disappointed with a lot of build-up and little action.\\" The Independent called the book, \\"shockingly, tackily, sick-makingly sexist\\" and said that \\"Bella Swan lives to serve men and suffer.\\" Entertainment Weekly graded Breaking Dawn with a D, criticizing the birth scene and Bella's \\"unwavering passion for Edward\\" and having no other goals. The Washington Post also responded with a negative review, making comments such as, \\"Meyer has put a stake through the heart of her own beloved creation,\\" and \\"Breaking Dawn has a childbirth sequence that may promote lifelong abstinence in sensitive types.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Meyer responded to the negative response of many fans to the book and called it the \\"Rob Effect\\"; she said that the fans need time to accept the ending of Breaking Dawn, just as they needed time to accept Robert Pattinson playing the role of Edward in the Twilight movie. =Awards and honors= Breaking Dawn was the recipient of a British Book Award for \\"Children's Book of the Year\\". In the 2009 \\"Children's Choice Book Awards\\", the novel was chosen as \\"Teen Choice Book of the Year\\" and Meyer won the \\"Author of the Year\\" award. Film adaptations Summit Entertainment announced in November 2008 that they had obtained the rights to the fourth book in Stephenie Meyer's series, Breaking Dawn. The studio greenlit an adaptation of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn in April 2010. The film was split into two parts; the first part of the film was released on November 18, 2011, and the second part was released on November 16, 2012. Bill Condon directed both parts; Stephenie Meyer co-produced the film along with Karen Rosenfelt and Wyck Godfrey. In July 2010, Summit announced that the film would be shot in Vancouver, Canada, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Maggie Grace plays the part of Irina in the film, while Mackenzie Foy plays Renesmee, Edward and Bella's half-vampire, half-human child. The infant Renesmee was portrayed by a robot. It was filmed at the Canadian Motion Picture Park Studios (CMPP). The film did not follow the book strictly, as many of the scenes were created from scratch to add tension to the narrative.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Norwich opened as a prison in 1887, on the site of the Britannia Barracks (the former home of the Royal Norfolk Regiment). The prison has had a variety of roles over the years, but today acts as a prison for Category B & C inmates. The impressive barrack block which stood behind the facade served as a Category C prison for some years from the 1970s but was demolished in the 1980s and replaced by a modern Category B prison block. The Victorian prison which stands at the end of Knox Road behind the old Barracks site was built in the mid-19th century as part of the reformation of the penal system brought about by the great prison reformers of that time. These included Elizabeth Fry. In January 2003 a report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons severely criticised Norwich Prison for factors including poor cleanliness and the failure of its anti-drug and anti-bullying programmes. The report also criticised the lack of work and education opportunities at the jail for inmates. In November 2004 the Prison Reform Trust criticised levels of overcrowding at Norwich Prison. The trust stated that nearly half of all single cells at the jail here holding two prisoners, and inmates were spending too much time locked up in their cells. At around this time Norwich became the only prison in England and Wales to have a unit exclusively for elderly male prisoners (mainly serving life sentences). This has meant that a number of high-profile elderly prisoners have been held at HMP Norwich in recent years.

Other courses offered include ESOL, Food Hygiene, First Aid, Health and Safety, NVQ Catering, Art and Craft and pre-release work programmes. A number of workshop places are available across the prison for inmates including Printing, Textiles, Contract packing Services and Gardens.

At age 14, while in training for the Anglican Church, Clews traveled to New York City, where he \\"began to perceive the possibilities that presented themselves to a young man.\\" Career Shortly thereafter, Clews emigrated to the United States in 1853. His first job was at a pottery import business, working as a junior clerk for Wilson G. Hunt & Company. He organized the firm of Stout, Clews & Mason and eventually brought his brother James Clews over from England to help him manage a branch of the brokerage firm. In 1859, he co-founded Livermore, Clews, and Company, what was then the second largest marketer of federal bonds during the United States Civil War. In 1877, he split away and started Henry Clews & Company, a member of the New York Stock Exchange, which made him enormously wealthy. In an 1886 article in The New York Times, his firm was referred to thusly: > \\"They have called together a staff of assistants who for ability and > character are unsurpassed, and from the senior member down to the lowest > clerk they are one and all actuated by the same idea, and are untiring in > their efforts to further the interest of the patrons and also that of the > firm itself.

Reptilase, an enzyme found in the venom of Bothrops snakes, has activity similar to thrombin. Unlike thrombin, reptilase is resistant to inhibition by antithrombin III. Thus, the reptilase time is not prolonged in blood samples containing heparin, hirudin, or direct thrombin inhibitors, whereas the thrombin time will be prolonged in these samples. Reptilase also differs from thrombin by releasing fibrinopeptide A, but not fibrinopeptide B, in its cleavage of fibrinogen.Other causes of prolonged reptilase time include the presence of fibrin degradation products, which interfere with fibrin polymerization.

She wrote a work on the correct behaviour of women, two extracts of which are preserved by Stobaeus. According to Stobaeus, Phintys was the daughter of Callicrates,Stobaeus, iv 23.11 who is otherwise unknown. Holger Thesleff suggests that this Callicrates might be identified with Callicratidas, a Spartan general who died at the Battle of Arginusae. If so, this would make Phintys a Spartan, and date her birth to the late fifth century BC, and her floruit to the fourth century. I. M. Plant considers this emendation \\"fanciful\\". Iamblichus mentions Philtys in his list of female Pythagoreans;Iamblichus, Life of Pythagoras, 267 he says that she was from Croton and that her father was called Theophrius. I. M. Plant believes that Iamblichus' Philtys, though also a Pythagorean and similarly named, is distinct from Stobaeus' Phintys. Two fragments attributed to Phintys are preserved in Stobaeus. However, not all scholars agree that the fragments are authentic: Lefkowitz and Fant argue that the works attributed to female Pythagoreans, including Phintys, were actually rhetorical exercises written by men. They are written in the Doric dialect, and amount to about 80 lines of prose. The language used dates to around the fourth century BC, although some features of it appear to be deliberate archaisms; it was likely actually composed in the third century BC, though a date as late as the second century AD was suggested by Friedrich Wilhelm in 1915. The fragments discuss the differences between men and women, and argues for chastity as the most important virtue for women. She gives a series of ways that women ought to practice self-control, concluding that the most effective way is to only have sex with her husband in order to produce legitimate children. Along with her defence of women's chastity, Phintys argues that the practice of philosophy is appropriate for women as well as men.

Biography Lady Vataça was the daughter of Princess Eudoxia Laskarina (1248–1311) of the Empire of Nicaea and Guillermo Pietro I, Count of Ventimiglia and Lord of Tende (~1230-1283). Eudoxia was the fourth daughter of Theodore II Laskaris and sister of young emperor John IV Laskaris, who was withdrawn from the throne by co-regent Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. After the conquest of Constantinople, Michael proclaimed himself sole ruler, blinding and displacing the young emperor and marrying the remaining princesses to foreigners. Eudoxia, still a child, married in 1261 in Constantinople with Count Pedro of the House of Ventimiglia and Tende (a region that retains the Byzantine double-headed eagle as a symbol), traveling then to Liguria. At the same time must have fled from the Byzantine court Constance II of Hohenstaufen (Ann of Sicily) (1230–1307), widow empress of John III Doukas Vatatzes (c. 1193-1254) Eudoxia's grandfather, returning to her native Sicily were her brother Manfred of Sicily ruled. In 1266, after the death of Manfred and conquest of Sicily by Charles of Anjou, Constance fled to Aragon where her niece Constance of Sicily (1249–1302) was consort of Peter III of Aragon and mother of Elizabeth of Aragon. Eudoxia also sought Aragon to escape Angevin dominance of Genoa or/and by the time her husband died. Both Byzantine noble ladies where protected and respected at the court, probably given their importance in the medieval fights and diplomacy between Aragon, Sicily and Byzantine Empire, thus explaining Vataça and Queen Elisabeth proximity, friendship and interests. Tomb of Vatatza Lascaris, 1336, Old Cathedral of Coimbra, surrounded by Byzantine double-headed eagles. In 1288, Lady Vataça accompanied Princess Elizabeth to Portugal for her wedding with King Denis of Portugal. As a court lady and friend of the future Saint Elizabeth of Portugal, to whom she was related as a descendant of Andrew II of Hungary, father of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, she was charged with the education of her children. She remained in the service of Queen Elizabeth of Portugal and as a Maid of King Afonso IV of Portugal, and was created Lady of the Commands of Santiago do Cacém and of Sines, etc. She married firstly in 1285 or 1288 Martim Anes de Soverosa, who died on 30 May 1296, without issue, and married secondly after 1296 Pedro Jordán de Urríes, Lord of Loarre, who died in 1350, and who distinguished himself at the service of the Aragonese Crown in Sicily and rendered effective help to Alfonso III of Aragon before the nobles of the Union, and had one son. In 1302 she went with the first born Constance of Portugal to Castile, for her wedding with Ferdinand IV of Castile, to seal the peace between the two kingdoms. There she stayed until the death of Constance, who had left the infant Alfonso XI of Castile in her care while the queen herself went to Avila, where the court was to decide the tutorship of the infant king. Constance died on the journey and Vataça returned to Portugal. In 1317, Lady Vataça established a small court in Santiago do Cacém castle, given to her by King Denis in 1310/15, where she dedicated herself to the administration of her large possessions until 1325 or 1332, when she followed Queen Elisabeth of Portugal to Coimbra. She died there in 1336 and her impressive tomb in the Old Cathedral of Coimbra, attributed to the sculptor Mestre Pero, is surrounded by double-headed eagles, symbol of the Laskaris dynasty and the Byzantine Empire. Her son Pedro Jordán de Urríes y Lascaris di Ventimiglia, Lord of Loarre and of Alquézar, was a Bailiff, a General in 1356 and a Royal Councilman of Aragon. He bought King Peter IV of Aragon the village of Alquézar for fifty thousand escudos. He founded the Chapel of Saint Anton – today of Saints Cosmo and Damian – at the temple of Saint Dominick, of Huesca, and established there a Confrary. He married Toda Martínez de Riglos and had a son and a daughter.

Although most notable now for their lead singer Shakin' Stevens, who went on to become one of the UK's most popular artists of the 1980s, the band released several records and toured extensively throughout the 1970s. A version of the Sunsets, containing original members, still tours annually in the UK, Europe and Australia. HistoryEarly years= Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets evolved from the rock and roll scene in and around the Penarth and Ely areas just outside Cardiff. One of its leading lights since the late 1950s was the Backbeats, a band fronted by Robert Llewellyn (who performed under the name of Rockin' Louie) and managed by Paul 'Legs' Barrett, a local entrepreneur and \\"card-carrying Communist\\". A keen fan of the group was a youngster named Michael Barratt who frequently used to approach Louie for singing and dancing tips and, soon enough, Michael was being referred to as 'Rockin' Louie II'.Barrett, Paul; Hayward, Hillary (1983). Shakin' Stevens. W. H. Allen (London). By the mid 1960s however, Michael had formed his own band. Originally named the Olympics, then the Cossacks, they finally decided to call themselves the Denims, by which point they found themselves as a support act to Michael's heroes, the Backbeats. Eventually, when the Denims fell apart, Michael wasted no time in forming a new group named the Rebels. It was this outfit that Paul Barrett reluctantly came to see after a recommendation early in 1969. Although distinctly unimpressed with the band itself, Barrett saw something in their young singer who, only a few years earlier, had been hanging around looking for ideas from the Backbeats. He offered to manage Michael on two conditions: firstly, he would have to ditch his group and, secondly, he must find himself an exciting new stage name. Agreeing to both suggestions, the ambitious young Welshman promptly left the Rebels and then, inspired either by the memory of an old school friend playing bat and ball or maybe even an eccentric local roadsweeper, Michael Barratt became Shakin' Stevens.Heatley, Michael (2005). Shaky. Michael O'Mara Books (London). Deciding that the group would be named Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets, Paul Barrett set about assembling a backing band for his new protege. Several musicians passed through the ranks of the Sunsets during these early days. There was a transitional period as the Backbeats evolved into the Sunsets which saw Dave Goddard and Sid Petherick briefly retained from the old band on bass and lead guitar respectively. Then, after two short lived guitarists by the names of Alan Langford and Mike Bibby, the band finally settled upon Carl Petersen. Early bass player Stephen Prior was soon replaced by Steve Percy, while the original drummer Brian Williams was replaced after Paul Barrett had managed to persuade former Backbeats frontman Rockin' Louie to hammer out a rhythm for the Sunsets. On saxophone was Paul Dolan (actually a guitarist who was a veteran of the Cardiff music scene for many years), and this early line-up was completed by London born Trevor Hawkins on piano, who had offered his services when the formative band played a gig at the Northcote Arms in Southall. As a hardcore rock and roll fan, Paul Barrett was both surprised and amused at John Lennon's appearance at a rock and roll revival show in Toronto in September 1969 and promptly wrote a letter to the music press inviting Lennon to audition for the Sunsets. The offer may have escaped the Beatle's attention, but it was enough for the Rolling Stones management to offer the group a support slot at their forthcoming show at the Saville Theatre in London on 14 December. The resultant gig suggested that Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets were not quite ready for the big time. A nervous Shaky was disconcerted at having to use Mick Jagger's PA system and, when realising he had left his drumsticks back in Cardiff, Louie had to borrow a pair from Charlie Watts. On discovering his snare stand was also missing, he resorted to resting the drum on an upturned fire bucket. =False dawns= The Rolling Stones gig soon proved to be the first of many false dawns for Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets. After a few low key dates around Cardiff, 1970 saw the band returning to the Northcote Arms in London. Among the crowd during one of these gigs was the Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who wrote a generous review of the experience for his column in the weekly music paper Disc. He was so impressed with the Sunsets that he even offered the group a record deal with his Dandelion label. With John Peel as producer, the group recorded a number of tracks which Paul Barrett, and some members of the Sunsets, felt were not quite up to scratch. Peel was keen to release the tracks on a 10\\" LP but the band were concerned that they were seen as nothing more than a novelty act and subsequent events were to distance the band from the radio personality. Shortly after the Peel sessions, the band were rehearsing at a venue in Cardiff named the Drope when they happened to be overheard by local hero Dave Edmunds as he passed in his car on the way to his bass player John Williams' nearby house. As a member of the Raiders, Edmunds had been a performer on the same Cardiff circuit as the Backbeats in the late 50s and early 60s. Since then, however, he had gone on to greater things forming Love Sculpture who had a top 5 hit in the UK with \\"Sabre Dance\\" in 1968. Recognising the ex-Backbeats and being suitably convinced by their performance, Dave offered to record Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth. With Edmunds promising to get the Sunsets signed to his current label Parlophone, this effectively put an end to the band's association with John Peel. Although a much more successful foray into the studio than the Dandelion tapes, the sessions were not without their problems. Remembering Rockin' Louie as a frontman from the Backbeat days, Dave Edmunds insisted Louie sang lead vocals on several of the tracks, much to Shaky's annoyance. One of Louie's vocals was for the Smiley Lewis song \\"I Hear You Knocking\\". Although it was, at the time, an unfamiliar song to Edmunds, he was inspired to record his own version later that same year. As promised, Dave Edmunds got the band signed to Parlophone and the album A Legend was issued in October 1970. The album received some positive reviews, particularly for the authenticity of Edmunds' production which was full of 50s style slapback echo. Preceded in August by the single \\"Spirit Of Woodstock\\" (backed by the Big Al Downing and The Poe Kats Rockabilly rocker from the 1950s \\"Down On The Farm\\", which was sung by Louie and was Edmunds' preference for the A-side) the album sold poorly despite both sides of the single receiving some airplay. The Sunsets' fortunes began to deteriorate further when Dave Edmunds' own version of \\"I Hear You Knocking\\" was released as a single and began storming up the charts. When Parlophone had initially declined to release the song, Edmunds offered it to MAM Records instead. However, as soon as the record had reached number one in the UK and was on its way to selling five million copies, the EMI label claimed a breach of contract. The resulting backlash saw Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets removed from the Parlophone roster. Following the Parlophone disappointment, the band experienced a few personnel changes. After a drunken episode which saw him smash a full bottle of whisky over Shaky's head, bassist Steven Percy was asked to leave the Sunsets. Also, unhappy with being based in Cardiff, Trevor Hawkins decided to leave the group and return to London. Their replacements were bass player George Chick, who offered an exciting visual element with his wild stage performance, and Bristolian rock and roll pianist Mike 'Ace' Skudder, who was also no slouch when it came to entertaining an audience. With the new line-up the band recorded a cover of Fats Domino's \\"All By Myself\\" for a compilation album called Battle Of The Bands. The producer on the session was Donny Marchand, an American now resident in the UK. Marchand promised the Sunsets that, with his connections in the music business, he could get them a contract with CBS Records. True to his word, CBS did indeed offer the band a deal and Marchand took the Sunsets into Morgan Studios in Willesden to record their second album, I'm No J.D., which was issued in the autumn of 1971. Halfway through the sessions, Carl Petersen left and the album was completed with the ace Welsh rock and roll guitarist Mickey Gee. Although he remained with the Sunsets to play a few gigs after the sessions had finished, his stay with the band was short lived. However, Mickey Gee was to perform a major role in Shakin' Stevens' success of the early 80s, adding his distinctive lead guitar to many of Shaky's biggest hit records. With CBS reportedly ignoring Donny Marchand's advice to release the album as a budget price record, I'm No J.D. sold, in Marchand's own words, \\"1,000 copies\\". Unsurprisingly, CBS dropped the band shortly after the album was released. Early in 1972, the band were offered the chance to record another album with Donny Marchand for the budget label Contour, a subsidiary of Polydor. The Sunsets were reluctant to agree at first having yet to receive royalties from Marchand for I'm No J.D.. However, with the promise that the financial issues would soon be resolved, the band (with new guitarist Willie Blackmore) went into Majestic Studios in Clapham and rush recorded the album (along with the single \\"Sweet Little Rock And Roller\\") in one day. The Sunsets were disappointed with the results and yet again the record, named Rockin' And Shakin' , failed to sell. Despite their lack of chart success, Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets were still a popular live act enjoying regular and well attended gigs across the UK. They had developed a loyal and enthusiastic following, so much so that they were voted the 'Top British Rock And Roll Group (Of The Old School)' in NME's 1972 poll. Their reputation as a live act soon spread to Europe and the group embarked on a tour of Sweden in August 1972. By this point, the line-up had changed again with Ian Lawrence replacing Blackmore on guitar and Tony Britnall (previously with the Fortunes and Jigsaw) becoming the new sax player. Britnall was another showman to complement George Chick and Ace Skudder, not to mention the actual frontman Shakin' Stevens. The Sunsets had now grown into a formidable live act which was being lapped up by the Europeans who, unlike British audiences, had yet to tire of rock and roll music. =The Dutch years= A meeting in the autumn of 1972 with a Dutchman named Cyril Van Der Hemel convinced Paul Barrett that Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets should forget about the unprofitable one-off record deals in Britain and should instead concentrate on the much more lucrative live circuit on the European continent. Van Der Hemel ran a production company named Tulip which focused on promoting British acts who had failed in their homeland. He promised the Sunsets professionally run tours in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe and a Dutch record contract which the band might actually be able to make some money out of. With nothing to lose, Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets readily accepted the Tulip deal and, as a result, spent a large part of 1973 touring the Netherlands with a reasonable amount of success. A record deal was struck with Dureco Records which resulted in the release (via the Pink Elephant label) of the album Shakin Stevens & Sunsets and the singles \\"Honey Honey\\" and \\"Spirit Of Woodstock\\" (a re- recording of their debut single). The Sunsets were considered successful enough in the Netherlands for them to be placed above Argent on the bill at that August's Emmen Festival, much to the disgust of the progressive rock giants who were something of a big deal in the UK at the time. The band were also beginning to enjoy some exposure on European TV, most notably a typically raucous performance on the German show Hits A Go Go. The album and \\"Honey Honey\\" single were eventually licensed to the Emerald Gem label for release in the UK but, perhaps predictably, both sunk without trace. It would be well over two years before Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets were to release anymore records in Britain. Not that the Sunsets were short of gigs in the UK. One notable appearance around this time was at the 21st birthday party for Kenneth Tynan's daughter at the Young Vic theatre in London. Amongst the star studded crowd were Peter Sellers and Liza Minnelli as well as the Irish novelist Edna O'Brien who apparently took a keen interest in Shakin' Stevens, inviting him back to her Chelsea flat. The happily married Shaky only agreed on the proviso that he could bring the rest of the band with him. Early 1974 saw yet more upheavals in the band's line-up as both Ian Lawrence and George Chick left the group to be replaced by Mike Lloyd Jones and Malcolm Priest on lead guitar and bass respectively. The irrepressible Tony Britnall also decided it was time to move on and chose to remain in the Netherlands, where he later become involved in the team behind the Stars on 45 phenomenon of the early 80s. In spite of the many British and European touring commitments, Shaky still found time to record a cover of Ricky Nelson's \\"Lonesome Town\\", although this time backed by Dureco session musicians rather than the Sunsets. Thanks in part to a prominent TV appearance, the single (still credited to Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets) actually managed to reach the Dutch Top 20. Later during 1974, the Sunsets took advantage of a friend's offer to knock up some demos in his Dutch recording studio. Ironically, these rough recordings, including versions of \\"Tiger\\", \\"Silver Wings\\" and \\"Sugaree\\", were later licensed to numerous labels throughout the 1980s and would end up as probably the most widely distributed of all the music made by Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets. With Dureco requesting a new LP from the Sunsets, 1975 found Paul Barrett attempting to create a concept album exploring the relationship between the gangsters of the 1930s with the 'outlaw' music created by the rock and roll stars of the 1950s. Taking his lead from the notorious bank robber John Dilinger, Barrett named the album Manhattan Melodrama (a reference to the film Dillinger watched shortly before he was shot dead). However, yet again, the band felt they were not given the time to create the record they wanted and, once producer Schell Shelvekins had spent months overdubbing synthesizers and remixing the album to his satisfaction, the Sunsets had just about disowned the project. When the record was finally released later in 1975 (only in the Netherlands), even the sleeve failed to gain the band's appreciation: \\"I wouldn't have packaged potatoes in that cover\\", complained Paul Barrett. With the Dureco agreement at an end, Paul Barrett struck a deal with Dutchman Pieter Meulenbroeks who owned the small Dynamite label. Finding themselves in the most basic of studio facilities the Sunsets produced their most authentic sounding rock and roll recordings since A Legend. The first fruits of these sessions were the five track \\"Frantic\\" EP which was only released at the time in France by the Skydog label. A rare UK release occurred in 1976 when the Phil Bailey-produced single \\"Jungle Rock\\" was issued on the Mooncrest label. Nobody was particularly surprised when the single flopped but, when Hank Mizell's original version was reissued weeks later and effortlessly made its way to number three in the UK singles chart (in a manner reminiscent of their 'near miss' with \\"I Hear You Knocking\\"), it seemed as if the Sunsets were fated to never make the big time. The Dynamite sessions produced more Dutch-only releases in a single (\\"You Mostest Girl\\"), EP (\\"Sexy Ways\\") and 10\\" album (C'mon Memphis) but these were to prove the final original releases by Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets. Shakin' Stevens in 1976 =Beginning of the end= In the Autumn of 1976 Phil Bailey (who had produced the \\"Jungle Rock\\" single) approached Track Records with a view to them signing a band he was managing named Rock Island Line. He persuaded Track's Danny Secunda and Mike Shaw to come and see Rock Island Line perform at Warwick University in a bill which also happened to include Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets. By this point the Sunsets had Ian Lawrence back playing steel guitar alongside Mike Lloyd Jones, while George Chick had also returned to replace Mal Priest on bass. Clearly out-performing Rock Island Line, Track's scouts ignored Bailey's group and instead Danny Secunda invited Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets to record two songs with him at Gooseberry Studios. Those songs, \\"Lightning Bar Blues\\" and \\"Lend Me Your Heart\\", remain unreleased but, according to Paul Barrett are amongst the best recordings the Sunsets ever made. Despite their initial interest, Track seemed unsure of their next move. Should they try and attach the Sunsets to the emerging punk rock movement or should they just focus on making Shakin' Stevens a solo star and ditch his backing group? Track's indecision could not have been helped by the increasingly perilous financial state in which the label currently found itself. After another recording session with the Sunsets (this time produced by Charlie Gillett) Track decided on option number two and brought in Mike Hurst to produce a Shakin' Stevens solo single. The result, \\"Never\\" was released by Track in March 1977. Sensing which way the wind was blowing, George Chick, Ian Lawrence and Mike Lloyd Jones all left the Sunsets for good and formed a new band named Quarter Moon. Paul Barrett wasted no time in inviting ex-roadie Johnny Chop (real name Colin Hopkins) to take over bass and recruiting Danny Wild to play lead guitar. While Track offered Shaky a solo contract on the strength of \\"Never\\", Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets were still regularly gigging as a unit, particularly in London at venues such as the Hope and Anchor, Islington and the Greyhound pub in Fulham. In September, Track requested a video for Shaky's next single \\"Somebody Touched Me\\" single and it was during shooting at the Rock Garden in Covent Garden that Paul Barrett encountered the band Fumble. Contemporaries of the Sunsets on the rock and roll circuit, they informed Barrett that they had a landed a job as the in-house band for Jack Good's upcoming Elvis - The Musical. With three actors portraying the King, Barrett discovered that the role of the 'middle Elvis' was still up for grabs and immediately realised that Shaky was perfect for the part. While Shaky himself was initially uninterested, he eventually accepted the part after one of Jack Good's team, Annabel Leventon, came to watch him perform at the Greyhound with the Sunsets. Paul Barrett was especially keen for Shaky to take the role, realising it was the chance of a lifetime for the singer. Even the rest of the Sunsets were happy for Shaky to take the part, despite the fact that it would most likely leave them without their front man for at least six months. The plan was for Rockin' Louie to take over as lead singer until Shaky was ready to return, by which point the band's profile would be boosted by having a leading West End star fronting the group. As it turned out, Shaky was never to return to the group and their gig at the Broom in Woolwich on 25 October 1977 turned out to be Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets' last performance together. =Life after Shaky= As soon as Shaky began rehearsals for Elvis-The Musical, the Sunsets pressed on with their plan to have Rockin' Louie as their frontman. This worked fine until one evening at the Rock Garden (the same venue which had proved the catalyst in Shaky's change of fortune) when an audience became disappointed by the non-appearance of Shakin' Stevens as well as the crazy pianist Ace Skudder, who inexplicably failed to turn up for the gig. The venue's management apparently used this as a reason to negotiate a rebate from Paul Barrett, a suggestion which nearly ended in a violent confrontation. Barrett washed his hands of the group shortly after. While Skudder appeared on Shakin' Stevens' self titled solo album for Track (released shortly before the label went bust), The Sunsets persisted for a few more years before Louie left and re-formed the Backbeats with Sid Petherick and Dave Goddard. By the early 1980s, after signing to Epic Records, Shakin' Stevens finally found chart success, enjoying the first of four UK number one singles in 1981 with \\"This Ole House\\" and eventually becoming one of the most successful acts of the 1980s. This unexpected popularity led to an interest in Shaky's back catalogue. EMI had already reissued A Legend in 1979 as a result of his appearance in Elvis-The Musical and decided to re-release it again in 1981 on their budget MFP label. Both I'm No J.D. and Rockin' And Shakin' were reissued by Pickwick in new sleeves with up to date pictures of Shaky and both were confusingly titled Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets. The reissue of I'm No J.D. even earned a respectable placing in the album charts (although apparently without resulting in any royalty payments to the Sunsets). The Dutch recordings (many issued in the UK for the first time) were re-released by a variety of labels such as Mint and Magnum Force. The most readily available of the Sunsets recordings seemed to be those hastily recorded Dutch demos from 1974, which Phil Bailey had managed to get hold of and licence to as many budget labels in Europe as he could contact. Some of these releases included new recordings featuring Rockin' Louie and even Paul Barrett on vocals and had nothing whatsoever to do with Shakin' Stevens, despite his now immediately recognisable image being prominently displayed on the front cover. As late as 1993, long after the rush of interest in Shaky's history had subsided, Paul Barrett's sense of injustice at monies owed still persisted. As a result, Shakin' Stevens found himself in Cardiff High Court alongside Dave Edmunds facing charges of non-payment of royalties from former Sunsets Rockin' Louie, Carl Petersen, Steve Percy and Paul Dolan. The prosecution claimed that the former band members were due a share of royalties which Shaky and his management had received from the reissue of A Legend in the early eighties. The judge agreed and, while the unpaid royalties only amounted to around £70,000 to be divided amongst all of them, the court costs ended up costing Shaky and Dave Edmunds £500,000. While Shaky was willing to call a truce after that court case, Paul Barrett was still seething from the non-payment of royalties from the I'm No J.D. and Rockin' And Shakin' albums. As a result, Barrett reissued both albums on a single CD in 2005 under the uncompromising title of How To Be Awarded Two Gold Records And Not Be Paid A Penny In Royalties, complete with sleeve notes inviting both Sony and Universal (who now officially owned the rights to the two records) to sue him if they believed their copyrights had been infringed. Neither label responded to Barrett's challenge. After a period of several years away from the limelight, Shakin' Stevens enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to his winning appearance in the 2005 hit UK TV show Hit Me, Baby, One More Time which led to his performance at the 2008 Glastonbury Festival. Meanwhile, a version of the Sunsets still exists to this day featuring ex-Backbeats bassist (and original Sunset) Dave Goddard alongside guitarist Lewis Clayton, pianist Neil 'Nutrocker' and drummer Buzz Baker. In recent years the Sunsets has been fronted by Shakin' Stevens' nephew, Levi Barratt. Because of Steven's commercial success since the 1980s, many of the original records issued by him and the group are now collectors items. For example, their recording of \\"Honey Don't\\" (issued on CBS Records in Sweden, 1973) sold for more than UK£ 340 in 2013. Other records that have sold for over £100 include their Parlophone issued single \\"Spirit Of Wood Stock\\" and their debut album, A Legend.

He was also a director for the Saskatchewan section of the United Farmers of Canada. Kemper was elected during the 1934 Saskatchewan general election, representing Gull Lake as a member of the Farmer-Labour Group (FLG). The FLG was founded in 1932.

Kunitz-type Soybean Trypsin Inhibitors are usually specific for either trypsin or chymotrypsin. They are thought to protect seeds against consumption by animal predators. Background Two types of trypsin inhibitors are found in soy: the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI). KTI is a large (20,100 daltons), strong inhibitor of trypsin, while BBI is much smaller (8,000 daltons) and inhibits both trypsin and chymotrypsin.[Soybean Protease Inhibitors in Foods], DiPietro CM, Liener IE, 1989. J Food Sci. Both inhibitors have significant anti-nutritive effects in the body, affecting digestion by hindering protein hydrolysis and activation of other enzymes in the gut. In soy, KTI is found in much larger concentrations than BBI is soy, however, to achieve the highest nutritional value from this ingredient, both of these inhibitors must be denatured in some way. Whole soybeans have been reported to contain 17–27 mg of trypsin inhibitor per gram. Structure Proteins from the Kunitz family contain from 170 to 200 amino acid residues and one or two intra-chain disulfide bonds. The best conserved region is found in their N-terminal section. The crystal structures of soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), trypsin inhibitor DE-3 from the Kaffir tree Erythrina caffra (ETI) and the bifunctional proteinase K/alpha-amylase inhibitor from wheat (PK13) have been solved, showing them to share the same beta trefoil fold structure as those of interleukin 1 and heparin-binding growth factors. Despite the structural similarity, STI shows no interleukin-1 bioactivity, presumably as a result of their primary sequence disparities. The active inhibitory site containing the scissile bond is located in the loop between beta-strands 4 and 5 in STI and ETI. The STIs belong to a superfamily that also contains the interleukin-1 proteins, heparin binding growth factors (HBGF) and histactophilin, all of which have very similar structures, but share no sequence similarity with the STI family. Action and Consequences of Trypsin Inhibitors Trypsin inhibitors require a specific three-dimensional structure in order to follow through with inactivation of trypsin in the body. They bind strongly to trypsin, blocking its active site and instantly forming an irreversible compound and halting digestion of certain proteins. Trypsin, a serine protease, is responsible for cleaving peptide bonds containing carbonyl groups from arginine or lysine. After a meal, trypsin is stimulated by cholecystokinin and undergoes specific proteolysis for activation. Free trypsin is then able to activate other serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin, elastase, and more trypsin (by autocatalysis), or continue breaking down proteins.[Principles of Biochemistry], Horton HR, Moran, LA, Scrimgeour KG, Perry MD, Rawn JD, 2006. However, if trypsin inhibitors (specifically KTI) are present, the majority of trypsin in the cycle of digestion is inactivated and ingested proteins remain whole. Effects of this occurrence include gastric distress, and pancreatic hyperplasia (proliferation of cells) or hypertrophy (enlargement of cells).[Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the rat pancreas produced by short-term dietary administration of soya-derived protein and soybean trypsin inhibitor], Smith JC, Wilson Fd, Allen PV, Berry DL, 1989. J Appl Toxic. The amount of soy inhibitors is directly related to the amount of trypsin it will inhibit, therefore a product with high concentration of soy is suspect to produce large values of inhibition. In a rat model, animals were fed either soy protein concentrate or direct concentrate of the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor. In both instances, after a week the rats showed a dose-related increase in pancreas weight due to both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. This indicates that long-term consumption of a diet high in soy with strong trypsin inhibitor activity may produce unwanted effects in humans as well. Inactivation of Trypsin Inhibitors A significant amount of research is being done to determine the best method of inhibitor inactivation. The most successful methods found so far include: * Heat * Freezing * Addition of Sulfites Cancer Research While trypsin inhibitors have been widely regarded as anti-nutritive factors in soy, research is currently being done on the inhibitors’ possible anti-carcinogenic characteristics. Some research has shown that protease inhibitors can cause irreversible suppressive effect on carcinogenic cell growth. However, the mechanism is still unknown. The cancers showing positive results for this new development are colon, oral, lung, liver, and esophageal cancers. Further research is still necessary to determine things such as the method of delivery for this natural anti- carcinogen, as well as performing extensive clinical trials in this area.[The Role of Soy Products in Reducing Risk of Cancer], Messina M, Barnes S, 1991.

It began on a small, secret, and informal basis shortly after the treaty was signed,but it was openly and massively expanded after the Nazi Party came to power in 1933. Despite its scale, German re-armament remained a largely covert operation, carried out using front organizations such as glider clubs for training pilots and sporting clubs, and Nazi SA militia groups for teaching infantry combat techniques. Front companies like MEFO were set up to finance the rearmament by placing massive orders with Krupp, Siemens, Gutehofnungshütte, and Rheinmetall for weapons forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. Carl von Ossietzky exposed the reality of the German rearmament in 1931 and his disclosures won him the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize but he was imprisoned and tortured by the Nazis, dying of tuberculosis in 1938.Richard J. Evans, The Third Reich in Power 1933–1939. Penguin Books. . Pg. 153 Von Ossietzky's disclosures also triggered the re- armament policy in Great Britain, which escalated after Adolf Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in 1933.UK War Production Despite notable warnings by von Ossietzky, Winston Churchill and others, successive governments across Europe failed to effectively recognize, cooperate, and respond to the potential danger posed by Germany's re-armament. John Neville Thompson, \\"The Failure of Conservative Opposition to Appeasement in the 1930s\\" Canadian Journal of History 3.2 (1968): 27-52. Outside of Germany, a global disarmament movement was popular after World War I and Europe's democracies continued to elect governments that supported disarmament even as Germany pursued re-armament. By the late 1930s, the German military was easily capable of overwhelming its neighbors and the rapidly successful German conquests of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France proved just how poorly prepared Germany's neighbors were to defend themselves. HistoryWeimar era= Germany's post-1918 rearmament began at the time of the Weimar Republic, when the Chancellor of Germany Hermann Müller, who belonged to the Social Democratic Party (SPD), passed cabinet laws that allowed secret and illegal rearmament efforts.Wilhelm Deist, Wehrmacht and the German Rearmament (1981) During its early years (1918–1933), the rearmament was relatively small, secret, and supported by a cross-section of Germans motivated by a mixture of patriotism-based nationalism and economics-based nationalism. The latter motive viewed the Treaty of Versailles, which was ostensibly about war reparations and peace enforcement. France wanted to make sure Germany would never again be a military threat. However, in the mid-1930s Britain and France would decline to fight another war to enforce the Versailles Treaty, thus bringing the treaty's effects to an end. An example of the Weimar clandestine rearmament measures was the training and equipping of police forces in a way that made them not just paramilitary in organizational culture (which most police forces are, to one degree or another) but also well prepared to rapidly augment the military as military reserve forces, which the treaty did not allow. Another example was that the government tolerated that various Weimar paramilitary groups armed themselves to a dangerous degree.Benjamin Ziemann, \\"Germany after the First World War–A violent society? Results and Implications of recent research on Weimar Germany.\\" Journal of Modern European History 1.1 (2003): 80-95. Their force grew enough to potentially threaten the state, but this was tolerated because the state hoped to use such militias as military reserve forces with which to rearm the Reichswehr in the future. Thus various Freikorps, Der Stahlhelm, the Reichsbanner, the Nazi SA, the Nazi SS, and the Ruhr Red Army grew from street gangs into private armies. For example, by 1931 Werner von Blomberg was using the SA in preparation for border defense in East Prussia. One of the reasons why this militarization of society was difficult to prevent relates to the distinction between the government executive and the legislature. The democratically elected government, being composed of groups of people, inevitably reflected the factional strife and cultural militarism among the populace. But the German Revolution of 1918–19 had not truly settled what the nature of the German state ought to be; Weimar Germany after its revolution was not very far from civil war—the different factions all hoped to transform the German state into the one that they thought it should be (which would require violent suppression of the other factions), and they expected their private armies to merge into the state's army (the Reichswehr) if they could manage to come to power. During the Republic's era of democracy, they all participated in the democratic definition of coming to power (winning votes), but many of them, on all sides, planned to abolish or diminish democracy in the future, if they could first get into position to do so. During the Weimar era, there was extensive economic interaction between Germany and the Soviet Union, and a component of German re-armament was covertly holding military training exercises in the Soviet Union to hide their extent from other countries. Germany–Soviet Union relations of the interwar period were complex, as bellicosity and cooperation coexisted in tortuous combinations.Gordon H. Mueller, \\"Rapallo Reexamined: a new look at Germany's secret military collaboration with Russia in 1922.\\" Journal of Military History 40.3 (1976): 109. =Nazi government era: 1933-1945= After the Nazi takeover of power in January 1933, the Nazis pursued a greatly enlarged and more aggressive version of rearmament. During its struggle for power, the National Socialist party (NSDAP) promised to recover Germany's lost national pride. It proposed military rearmament claiming that the Treaty of Versailles and the acquiescence of the Weimar Republic were an embarrassment for all Germans.Hakim, Joy (1995). A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 100–104. . The rearmament became the topmost priority of the German government. Hitler would then spearhead one of the greatest expansions of industrial production and civil improvement Germany had ever seen. Third Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, one of the most influential Nazi figures of the time,Wilhelm Frick (1877–1946) and Hjalmar Schacht, who (while never a member of the NSDAP) was an initially sympathetic economist, introduced a wide variety of schemes in order to tackle the effects that the Great Depression had on Germany, were the main key players of German rearmament policies (see Reichsbank § Nazi period). Dummy companies like MEFO were set up to finance the rearmament; MEFO obtained the large amount of money needed for the effort through the Mefo bills, a certain series of credit notes issued by the Government of Nazi Germany.Nuremberg Trials discussion of the Mefo bill Covert organizations like the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule were established under a civilian guise in order to train pilots for the future Luftwaffe.Ernst Sagebiel 1892–1970 Although available statistics do not include non-citizens or women, the massive Nazi re-armament policy almost led to full employment during the 1930s. The re-armament began a sudden change in fortune for many factories in Germany. Many industries were taken out of a deep crisis that had been induced by the Great Depression. By 1935, Hitler was open about rejecting the military restrictions set forth by the Treaty of Versailles. Rearmament was announced on 16 March, as was the reintroduction of conscription.Fischer, Klaus (1995). Nazi Germany: A New History, p. 408. Some large industrial companies, which had until then specialized in certain traditional products began to diversify and introduce innovative ideas in their production pattern. Shipyards, for example, created branches that began to design and build aircraft. Thus, the German re-armament provided an opportunity for advanced, and sometimes revolutionary, technological improvements, especially in the field of aeronautics.Blohm & Voss Geschichte v. 1933/1938, Die Rüstungskonjunktur ab 1933 Work by labour historians has determined that many German workers in the 1930s identified passionately with the weapons they were building. While this was in part due to the high status of the skilled work required in the armaments industries, it was also to do with the weapons themselves - they were assertions of national strength, the common property of the German nation. Adam Tooze notes that an instruction manual given to tank crews during the war made clear this connection:Tooze, Adam. The wages of destruction: The making and breaking of the Nazi economy. Penguin, 2008, p.163 > For every shell you fire, your father has paid 100 Reichsmarks in taxes, > your mother has worked for a week in the factory ... The Tiger costs all > told 800,000 Reichsmarks and 300,000 hours of labour. Thirty thousand people > had to give an entire week's wages, 6,000 people worked for a week so that > you can have a Tiger. Men of the Tiger, they all work for you. Think what > you have in your hands! The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) would provide an ideal testing ground for the proficiency of the new weapons produced by the German factories during the re-armament years. Many aeronautical bombing techniques (i.e. dive bombing) were tested by the Condor Legion German expeditionary forces against the Republican Government on Spanish soil with the permission of Generalísimo Francisco Franco. Hitler insisted, however, that his long-term designs were peaceful, a strategy labelled as Blumenkrieg (\\"Flower War\\").Evidenced in a January 1937 speech prior to the outcry over the bombing of the Basque city of Guernica, known by the Luftwaffe as Operation Rügen. Hitler speech to Reichstag 30 January 1937 available via the German Propaganda Archive. Re- armament in the 1930s saw the development of different theories of how to prepare the German economy for total war. The first amongst these was 'defence in depth' which was put forward by Georg Thomas. He suggested that the German economy needed to achieve Autarky (or self-sufficiency) and one of the main proponents behind this was I.G. Farben. Hitler never put his full support behind Autarky and aimed for the development of 'defence in breadth' which espoused the development of the armed forces in all areas and was not concerned with preparing the German economy for war. The re-armament program quickly increased the size of the German officer corps, and organizing the growing army would be their primary task until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Count Johann von Kielmansegg (1906–2006) later said that the very involved process of outfitting 36 divisions kept him and his colleagues from reflecting on larger issues. In any event, Hitler could boast on 26 September 1938 in the Berlin Sportpalast that after giving orders to rearm the Wehrmacht he could \\"openly admit: we rearmed to an extent the like of which the world has not yet seen\\".Domarus, Max, Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations, 1932-1945, Vol 2, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, Inc., 1992, , 756 p.  Toleration shown by other states  Since World War II, both academics and laypeople have discussed the extent to which German re-armament was an open secret among national governments. The failure of Allied national governments to confront and intercede earlier in Germany is often discussed in the context of the appeasement policies of the 1930s. A central question is whether the Allies should have drawn \\"a line in the sand\\" earlier than September 1939, which might have resulted in a less devastating war and perhaps a prevention of the Holocaust. However, it is also possible that anything that caused Hitler not to overreach as soon and as far as he did would only have condemned Europe to a more slowly growing Nazi empire, leaving plenty of time for a Holocaust later, and a successful German nuclear weapons program, safely behind a Nazi version of an iron curtain. George F. Kennan stated: \\"Unquestionably, such a policy might have enforced a greater circumspection on the Nazi regime and caused it to proceed more slowly with the actualization of its timetable. From this standpoint, firmness at the time of the reoccupation of the Rhineland (7 March 1936) would probably have yielded even better results than firmness at the time of Munich\\".Kennan, George (1951). American Diplomacy. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. pp. 79 = American Corporate involvement = Some 150 American corporations took part in German re- armament, supplying German companies with everything from raw materials to technology and patent knowledge. This took place through a complex network of business interests, joint ventures, cooperation agreements, and cross- ownership between American and German corporations and their subsidiaries. Resources supplied to German companies (some of which were MEFO front companies established by the German state) by American corporations included: synthetic rubber production technology (DuPont and Standard Oil of New Jersey), communication equipment (ITT), computing and tabulation machines (IBM), aviation technology (which was used to develop the Junkers Ju 87 bomber), fuel (Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of California), military vehicles (Ford and General Motors), funding (through investment, brokering services, and loans by banks like the Union Banking Corporation), collaboration agreements, production facilities and raw materials. DuPont owned stocks in IG Farben and Degussa AG, who controlled Degesch, the producer of Zyklon B, a chemical that was later used to murder millions of people in Nazi death camps. This involvement was motivated not only by financial gain, but in some cases by ideology as well. Irénée du Pont, director and former president of DuPont, was a supporter of Nazi racial theory and a proponent of eugenics.

Domestication  Remains of dogs and pigs have been found in the oldest Neolithic settlements of the Yangshao (circa 4000 BC) and Hemudu (circa 5000 BC) cultures. Canine remains similar to the Dingo have been found in some early graves excavated in northern China.

Dogs as ceremonial sacrifice  According to Bruno Schindler, the origin of using dogs as sacrificial animals dates back to a primitive cult in honour of a dog-shaped god of vegetation whose worship later became amalgamated with that of Shang Di, the reigning deity of the Shang pantheon. Systematic excavation of Shang tombs around Anyang since 1928 have revealed a large number of animal and human sacrifices. There was hardly a tomb or a building consecrated without the sacrifice of a dog. At one site, Xiaotong, the bones of a total of 825 human victims, 15 horses, 10 oxen, 18 sheep and 35 dogs were unearthed. Dogs were usually buried wrapped in reed mats and sometimes in lacquer coffins. Small bells with clappers, called ling (鈴) have sometimes been found attached to the necks of dogs or horses. The fact that alone among domestic animals dogs and horses were buried demonstrates the importance of these two animals to ancient Chinese society. It's reflected in an idiom passed down to modern times: \\"to serve like a dog or a horse.\\" (犬馬之勞). Shang oracle bones mention questions concerning the whereabouts of lost dogs. They also refer to the ning (寧) rite during which a dog was dismembered to placate the four winds or honour the four directions. This sacrifice was carried over into Zhou times. The Er ya records a custom to dismember a dog to \\"bring the four winds to a halt.\\" (止風). Other ceremonies involving dogs are mentioned in the Zhou li. In the nan (難) sacrifice to drive away pestilence, a dog was dismembered and his remains buried in front of the main gates of the capital. The ba (軷) sacrifice to ward off evil required the Son of Heaven, riding in a jade chariot, to crush a dog under the wheels of his carriage. The character ba gives a clue as to how the ceremony took place. It is written with the radical for chariot (車) and a phonetic element which originally meant an animal whose legs had been bound (发). It was the duty of a specially appointed official to supply a dog of one colour and without blemishes for the sacrifice. The blood of dogs was used for the swearing of covenants between nobles. Towards the late fifth century BC, surrogates began to be used for sacrifice in lieu of real dogs. The Dao De Jing mentions the use of straw dogs as a metaphor: Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs; the sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.In Chinese: 天地不仁 以萬物為芻狗 聖人不仁 以百姓為芻狗. Chen Guying ed. Laozi zhu yi ji ping jie 老子注譯及評介 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1984) at 78. Incidentally the term \\"straw dogs\\" became the title of a book of philosophy by John Gray (Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals) and a 1971 film. However, the practice of burying actual dogs by no means died out. One Zhongshan royal mausoleum, for example, included two hunting dogs with gold and silver neck rings. Later, clay figurines of dogs were buried in tombs. Large quantities of these sculptures have been unearthed from the Han dynasty onwards. Most show sickle-shaped tails not unlike the modern shiba inu or akita inu.  Dogs as food  Dogs, along with pigs, constituted the major source of animal protein in ancient China. \\"Dog butchers\\" (狗屠) was a specific (and lowly-regarded) profession. They are called \\"idle and untrustworthy\\" by Fan Ye. Dog butchers who rose to prominence include the strongman Zhu Hai, the musician Gao Jianli, and general Fan Kuai (all circa third century BC). The ancient word for dog meat was ran (肰). The Old Chinese character meaning \\"to burn\\" or \\"to roast\\" showed dog meat on top of a fire (然). The Bencao Gangmu (Compendium of Materia Medica) divides dogs into three categories: the (田犬) or watchdog, the (吠犬) or barking dog, and the (食犬) or edible dog.本草綱目, 獸之一（畜類二十八種）：「時珍曰︰狗類甚多，其用有三︰田犬長喙善獵，吠犬短喙善守，食犬體肥供饌。」 (Chinese Text Project) (Chinese source text at zh.wikisource.org) With the exception of the liver every part of the animal was considered edible. At the banquets of feudal lords a dish of dog's broth and glutinous rice was considered a great delicacy. For summer, dried fish fried in pungent dog's fat was thought to be cooling. When dog's meat was prepared as sacrificial meat it had first to be marinated in vinegar and pepper.  Dogs for hunting  Dogs were associated with hunting from very early times. Many words for hunting in the Chinese language are written with the radical for dog - for example, lie (獵: hunt), shou (狩: winter hunt), huo (獲: bird hunt). The Shang kings recognised \\"Dog Officers\\" (犬) who were involved in hunting in a specific area beyond the royal domain. One oracle bone records: \\"If the king joins with Qin, the Dog Officer at Cheng, there will be no regrets and he will have no disasters.\\" There is one reference to dogs in the Shi Jing, China's earliest anthology of poetry: Swiftly runs the crafty hare, But it is caught by the hound.In Chinese: 躍躍毚兔 遇犬獲之. From Song 198, 'Qiaoyan', Legge translation. In the Warring States period, the kingdoms of Han and Yan were thought to produce the best hunting dogs. Because of their importance and numbers, there was at Shanglin an \\"inspector of kennels\\" (狗監; goujian) who oversaw the raising and training of the hunting dogs for the Han court. There is pictorial evidence from early Han tomb tiles of large dogs with collars in the typical pointing position - the body in a slightly crouching position, neck extended horizontally, and one forepaw being under and raised several inches above ground - standing before a flock of geese in flight and several running deer.Thomas T. Allsen, The Royal Hunt in Eurasian History (Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006) at 57.  Cultural perceptions  It is clear from the role of dogs in ceremony and as food that they were held in some esteem. Book of Rites, ch.4, quotes Confucius ordering his disciple to perform the respectful burial for his dog and saying: Nevertheless, classical literature usually qualified dogs as hui treacherous, jiao crafty and si restless. The Quanrong (犬戎), literally \\"Dog nomad-tribe\\", were enemies of the settled civilizations from the time of the Zhou Dynasty onwards. The tribe claimed descendancy from two large white dogs and worshipped a totem in their honor. The word for dog was sometimes used in human names. Sima Xiangru, for example, had the nickname Quǎnzǐ (犬子), meaning \\"Dog-son\\". The term Quǎner (犬兒, meaning [My] dog of a son) has been used as a term of self-cheapening deference in reference to one’s own son, mostly in front of others as a form of respect. Such practice is now considered obsolete. =Dogs in legend= According to ancient folk legends, solar eclipses take place because dogs in heaven eat the sun. In order to save the sun from demise, ancient people formed the habit of beating drums and gongs at the critical moment to drive away the dogs.

Division lineup The Bobrov Division is currently made up of the following teams: * Dinamo Riga * Dynamo Moscow * Jokerit Helsinki * Severstal Cherepovets * SKA Saint Petersburg * Spartak Moscow Lineup historyInitial lineup (2008)= In the first KHL season, the division alignment was determined by team strength and the Bobrov division consisted of: Salavat Yulaev Ufa, Atlant Moscow Oblast, HC Dinamo Minsk, Metallurg Novokuznetsk, Severstal Cherepovets and Spartak Moscow. =Re-alignment in 2009= With the geographical alignment of the divisions for the 2009–10 season, the composition of the Bobrov division was completely changed. Only Spartak Moscow and Dinamo Minsk remained in the division. They were joined by the two other teams from Moscow, CSKA Moscow and Dynamo Moscow, as well as SKA Saint Petersburg and Dinamo Riga. Thus, the division was made up of the most westerly teams of the KHL. =Dynamo-MVD merger (2010)= In 2010, Dynamo Moscow merged with HC MVD (from the Tarasov Division). The new team, UHC Dynamo, took the place of the old Dynamo in this division. Dinamo Minsk left for the Tarasov Division and was replaced by HC Lev Poprad in this division. However, later Lev was excluded from the league and the Bobrov Division became the first division in the history of the KHL to have the number of teams at 5 instead of 6. =2011 expansion= In 2011, the KHL expanded for the first time beyond the borders of the post-Soviet states by admitting HC Lev Poprad, a newly formed team that is based in Poprad, Slovakia. =2012 expansion= The expansion to 26 teams for the 2012–13 season caused some re-alignments among the Western conference divisions. The two newcomers Slovan Bratislava from Slovakia and HC Donbass from Ukraine were added to the Bobrov division. In the meantime, two Moscow teams, Spartak and CSKA were moved to the Tarasov Division, while Vityaz Chekhov moved to Bobrov. HC Lev Poprad was dissolved and replaced by a new organization, Lev Praha from Prague, Czech Republic. This brought the number of teams in the Bobrov division to 7, representing 5 different countries. =2013 expansion and re- alignment= The expansion to 28 teams for the 2013–14 season caused some re- alignments among the Western conference divisions; as such, Croatian newcomer KHL Medveščak Zagreb were added to the Borbov division, while HC Vityaz, HC Donbass and Dynamo Moscow were moved to the Tarasov Division and replaced by Dinamo Minsk and CSKA Moscow. =2014 expansion to Helsinki= Lev Praha had to withdraw prior to the 2014–15 season for financial reasons, whereas Jokerit from Helsinki, Finland joined. Furthermore, CSKA Moscow and Atlant Moscow Oblast swapped divisions. =2015 Spartak returns= Spartak Moscow returned to the KHL for the 2015–16 season, while Atlant Moscow Oblast left the league.

Tavares was known professionally simply as Flash. Early life Tavares was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on October 29, 1920. He was a self-taught musician who learned by listening to the radio and Cape Verdean music at an early age. Tavares, a longtime resident of Hyannis, Massachusetts, was considered to be an influential cultural figure within the Cape Verdean American community in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The father of all five members of Tavares, whose hits included More Than a Woman and Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel, Tavares advocated for traditional Cape Verdean music. Following his death in 2008, it was noted that \\"Flash inspired a lot of kids to play music, and he kept the Cape Verdean musical heritage alive.\\" Tavares remained active within the musical community well into his 80s, in spite of an early diagnosis of prostate cancer. He was able to travel to Cape Verde and continued to perform solo until he was 84 years old.

It is a co-production of New Zealand, the United States and South Africa. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James, and was adapted from Blomkamp's 2006 short film Alive in Joburg. The film is partially presented in a found footage format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of humanity, xenophobia and social segregation, begins in an alternate 1982, when an alien spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. When a population of sick and malnourished insectoid aliens are discovered on the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Twenty years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson, who is about to try to escape from Earth with his son and return home, crosses paths with a bureaucrat leading the relocation named Wikus van der Merwe. The title and premise of District 9 were inspired by events in Cape Town's District Six, during the apartheid era. A viral marketing campaign for the film began in 2008 at San Diego Comic-Con, while the theatrical trailer debuted in July 2009. District 9 was released by TriStar Pictures on 14 August 2009, in North America and became a financial success, earning over $210 million at the box office. It also received acclaim from critics, who praised the film's direction, performances, themes, and story, with some calling it one of the best science fiction films of the 2000s, and garnered numerous awards and nominations, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing.  Plot  In 1982, a giant extraterrestrial spaceship arrives and hovers over the South African city of Johannesburg. An investigation team finds over one million malnourished aliens (derogatorily called \\"Prawns\\") inside, and the South African government relocates them to a camp called District 9. However, over the years it turns into a slum, and locals often complain that the aliens are filthy, ignorant lawbreakers who bleed resources from humans. Following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a huge weapons manufacturer, to relocate the aliens to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints MNU employee and his son-in-law Wikus van de Merwe, to lead the relocation. Meanwhile, three aliens, Christopher Johnson, his young son CJ and his friend Paul, search a District 9 garbage dump for alien fuel in Prawn technology, which Christopher has had them spend the last twenty years synthesizing enough of to enact his plan. They finally finish in Paul's shack as the relocation begins but when Wikus comes to the shack to serve Paul a notice, he finds the hidden container with the fuel and accidentally sprays some of it in his face while confiscating it. Paul is killed by Koobus Venter, a cruel MNU mercenary. Wikus begins mutating into a Prawn, starting with his left arm injured after the fuel exposure. He is immediately taken to the brutal MNU lab, where researchers discover his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, that is biologically restricted for them. Wanting to capture this human/alien hybridity before Wikus fully transforms, Smit orders Wikus's body to be vivisected and harvested for its profitable properties. Wikus, however, overpowers the lab personnel and escapes. While Venter's forces hunt for him, a smear story is broadcast, one that reaches Wikus' wife and Smit's daughter Tania, claiming Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a contagious disease from copulating with aliens. Wikus takes refuge in District 9, finding Christopher and the spaceship's concealed command module dropship underneath his house. Christopher explains to Wikus the confiscated fuel is crucial to his plan of reactivating the dropship, and if he can get them in the dropship to the mothership he can cure Wikus. Wikus attempts to acquire weapons from the District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo, who wants to eat Wikus's alien arm to gain alien abilities. Wikus, however, seizes an alien weapon and escapes. Wikus and Christopher force their way through MNU to the lab and retrieve the fuel. However, after seeing the barbarous experiments MNU has performed on his people in the lab (including a dissected Paul), Christopher tells Wikus he must return home as fast as possible for help and cannot undo Wikus’ mutation until he returns in three years due to the limited supply of the fuel. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher down and attempts to fly the module to the mothership himself, but it is shot down by Venter's forces. Venter captures Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes the MNU convoy and seizes Wikus. Meanwhile, CJ, remaining hidden in the dropship, remotely activates the mothership and a large, alien, mechanized battle suit in Obesandjo's base. The suit guns down the Nigerians, and Wikus enters the suit and rescues Christopher from the mercenaries. Heading to the dropship, the two come under heavy fire, and Wikus stays behind to fend off the mercenaries, buying time for Christopher, who promises to return after three years and heal Wikus, to leave. After all of the other mercenaries are killed, Venter finally cripples the suit and is about to execute Wikus when slum aliens attack and dismember him alive. Christopher makes it into the dropship with CJ, and the dropship is levitated via a tractor beam back into the mothership, which leaves Earth. MNU's experiments are exposed, and the aliens are moved to the new camp, named District 10. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. Meanwhile, a now fully-transformed Wikus is shown in a junkyard crafting the flower for his wife.  Cast  San Diego Comic-Con during July 2009 David James portrayed Koobus Venter * Sharlto Copley as Wikus van de Merwe, a mild-mannered, bumbling, awkward bureaucrat at the MNU Department of Alien Affairs, who becomes infected with an alien fluid, slowly turning him into one of the \\"prawns\\".

The film also refers to contemporary evictions and forced removals to suburban ghettos in post-apartheid South Africa, as well as the resistance of its residents. This includes the high-profile attempted forced removal of the Joe Slovo informal settlement in Cape Town to temporary relocation areas in Delft, plus evictions in the shack settlement, Chiawelo, where the film was actually shot. Blikkiesdorp, a temporary relocation area in Cape Town, has also been compared with the District 9 camp earning a front-page spread in the Daily Voice.Blikkiesdoprp housingdisaster has become Cape Flats' own...District 9 in The Daily Voice, South Africa, 3 October 2009 The film emphasizes the irony of Wikus and the impact of his experiences on his personality, which show him becoming more humane as he becomes less biologically human. Chris Mikesell from the University of Hawaii newspaper Ka Leo writes that \\"Substitute 'black,' 'Asian,' 'Mexican,' 'illegal,' 'Jew,’ 'white,’ or any number of different labels for the word 'prawn' in this film and you will hear the hidden truth behind the dialogue\\". Themes of racism and xenophobia are shown in the form of speciesism. Used to describe the aliens, the word \\"prawn\\" is a reference to the Parktown prawn, a king cricket species considered a pest in South Africa. Copley has said that the theme is not intended to be the main focus of the work, but can work at a subconscious level even if it is not noticed. Duane Dudek of the Journal Sentinel wrote that \\"The result is an action film about xenophobia, in which all races of humans are united in their dislike and mistrust of an insect-like species\\". Another underlying theme in District 9 is states' reliance on multinational corporations (whose accountability is unclear and whose interests are not necessarily congruent with democratic principles) as a form of government-funded enforcement. As MNU represents the type of corporation which partners with governments, the negative portrayal of MNU in the film depicts the dangers of outsourcing militaries and bureaucracies to private contractors.  Production  Development = Neill Blomkamp at the San Diego Comic-Con 28 July 2008 Producer Peter Jackson planned to produce a film adaptation based on the Halo video-game franchise with first-time director Neill Blomkamp. Due to a lack of financing, the Halo adaptation was placed on hold. Jackson and Blomkamp discussed pursuing alternative projects and eventually chose to produce and direct, respectively, District 9 featuring props and items originally made for the Halo movie. Blomkamp had previously directed commercials and short films, but District 9 was his first feature film. The director co-wrote the script with his wife, Terri Tatchell, and chose to film in South Africa, where he was born. In District 9, Tatchell and Blomkamp returned to the world explored in his short film Alive in Joburg, choosing characters, moments and concepts that they found interesting including the documentary-style filmmaking, staged interviews, alien designs, alien technology/mecha suits, and the parallels to racial conflict and segregation in South Africa, and fleshing out these elements for the feature film. QED International financed the negative cost. After the 2007 American Film Market, QED partnered with Sony's TriStar Pictures for distribution in several territories. = Filming = The film was shot on location in Chiawelo, Soweto during a time of violent unrest in Alexandra (Gauteng) and other South African townships involving clashes between native South Africans and Africans born in other countries. The location that portrays District 9 is itself a real impoverished neighbourhood from which people were being forcibly relocated to government-subsidised housing. Several scenes were shot at the Ponte building. Filming for District 9 took place during the winter in Johannesburg. According to director Neill Blomkamp, during the winter season, Johannesburg \\"actually looks like Chernobyl\\", a \\"nuclear apocalyptic wasteland\\". Blomkamp wanted to capture the deserted, bleak atmosphere and environment, so he and the crew had to film during the months of June through July. The film took a total of 60 days of shooting. Filming in December raised another issue in that there was much more rain. Due to the rain, there was a lot of greenery to work with, which Blomkamp did not want. Blomkamp had to cut some of the vegetation in the scenery to portray the setting as desolate and dark. The film features many weapons and vehicles produced by the South African arms industry, including the R5 and Vektor CR-21 assault rifles, Denel NTW-20 20 mm anti-materiel rifle, BXP submachine gun, Casspir armoured personnel carrier, Ratel infantry fighting vehicle, Rooikat armoured fighting vehicle, Atlas Oryx helicopter and militarized Toyota Hilux \\"technical\\" pickup truck. Blomkamp said no single film influenced District 9, but cited the 1980s \\"hardcore sci-fi/action\\" films such as Alien, Aliens, The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Predator and RoboCop as subconscious influences. The director said, \\"I don't know whether the film has that feeling or not for the audience, but I wanted it to have that harsh 1980s kind of vibe—I didn't want it to feel glossy and slick.\\" Because of the amount of hand-held shooting required for the film, the producers and crew decided to shoot using the digital Red One 4K camera. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch used nine digital Red Ones owned by Peter Jackson for primary filming. According to HD Magazine, District 9 was shot on RED One cameras using build 15, Cooke S4 primes and Angenieux zooms. The documentary-style and CCTV-style cam footage was shot on the Sony EX1/EX3 XDCAM-HD. Additionally, the post-production team was warned that the most RED Camera footage they could handle a day was about an hour and a half. When that got to five hours a day additional resources were brought in, and 120 terabytes of data was filled.Attack Of The Terabytes = Visual effects = Already as a young child living in South Africa, Blomkamp was captivated by artwork and visual effects. \\"I knew I wanted to be in movies ... So I thought I wanted to be in special effects, like model-making and prosthetic effects.\\" The combination of knowing he would find a career in the visual effects area and the advancement of technology allowing better computer graphics capabilities led him to work at a Canadian post-production company as a visual effects artist. The aliens in District 9 were designed by Weta Workshop, and the design was executed by Image Engine. Blomkamp wanted the aliens to maintain both humane and barbaric features in the design of the creatures. According to Terri Tatchell, the director's writing partner, \\"They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don't tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge.\\" The look of the alien, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was meant to initially evoke a sense of disgust from viewers but as the story progresses, the audience was meant to sympathize with these creatures who had such human-like emotions and characteristics. Blomkamp established criteria for the design of the aliens. He wanted the species to be insect-like but also bipedal. The director wanted the audience to relate to the aliens and said of the restriction on the creature design, \\"Unfortunately, they had to be human-esque because our psychology doesn't allow us to really empathize with something unless it has a face and an anthropomorphic shape. Like if you see something that's four-legged, you think it's a dog; that's just how we're wired ... If you make a film about an alien force, which is the oppressor or aggressor, and you don't want to empathize with them, you can go to town. So creatively that's what I wanted to do but story-wise, I just couldn't.\\" Blomkamp originally sought to have Weta Digital design the creatures, but the company was busy with effects for Avatar. The director then decided to choose a Vancouver-based effects company because he anticipated making films there in the future and because British Columbia offered a tax credit. Blomkamp met with Image Engine and considered them \\"a bit of a gamble\\" since the company had not pursued a project as large as a feature film. Aside from the aliens appearing on the operating table in the medical lab, all of them were created using CGI visual effects. Weta Digital designed the 2½-kilometre-diameter mothershipCinefex 119, page 31 and the drop ship, while the exo-suit and the little pets were designed by The Embassy Visual Effects. Zoic Studios performed overflow 2D work. On-set live special effects were created by MXFX.MXFX Physical Special Effects = Music = The music for District 9 was scored by Canadian composer Clinton Shorter, who spent three weeks preparing for the film. Director Neill Blomkamp wanted a \\"raw and dark\\" score, but one that maintained its South African roots. This was a challenge for Shorter, who found much of the South African music he worked with to be optimistic and joyful. Unable to get the African drums to sound dark and heavy, Shorter used a combination of taiko drums and synthesized instruments for the desired effects, with the core African elements of the score conveyed in the vocals and smaller percussion. Both the score and soundtrack feature music and vocals from Kwaito artists.  Marketing  Sony Pictures launched a \\"Humans Only\\" marketing campaign to promote District 9. Sony's marketing team designed its promotional material to emulate the segregational billboards that appear throughout the film. Billboards, banners, posters, and stickers were thus designed with the theme in mind, and the material was spread across public places such as bus stops in various cities, including \\"humans only\\" signs in certain locations and providing toll-free numbers to report \\"non- human\\" activity. This marketing strategy was designed to provoke reactions in its target audience, namely: sci-fi fans, and people concerned with social justice. Hence the overtly obvious use of fake segregational propaganda. According to Dwight Caines, Sony's president of digital marketing, an estimated 33,000 phone calls were made to the toll-free numbers during a two- week period with 2,500 of them leaving voicemails with reports of alien sightings. Promotional material was also presented at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, advertising the website D-9.com, which had an application presented by the fictional Multi-National United (MNU). The website had a local alert system for Johannesburg (the film's setting), news feeds, behavior recommendations, and rules and regulations. Other viral websites for the film were also launched, including an MNU website with a countdown timer for the film's release, an anti-MNU blog run by fictional alien character Christopher Johnson, and an MNU-sponsored educational website. An online game for District 9 has also been made where players can choose to be a human or an alien. Humans are MNU agents on patrol trying to arrest or kill aliens. Aliens try to avoid capture from MNU agents whilst searching for alien canisters. This digital approach to marketing follows a rising trend among digital natives who develop marketing trends and techniques which are appropriate to the digital age, and is cost-efficient due to its reliance on social media and communications. This breaking down, and circumvention of existing marketing structures follows postmodernist theory in cinema.\\"Film Marketing\\"> WETA released in July 2010 Christopher Johnson and Son as sculptures. According to the American Humane Association, the film displays an unauthorized \\"no animals were harmed\\" end credit, which is a registered trademark of the group.Unauthorized End Credits  Reception  Box office = District 9 grossed US$115.6 million from the United States and Canada, with a worldwide total of $210,819,611, against a production budget of US$30 million. Documents from the Sony Pictures hack revealed the film turned a profit of $67 million. It opened in 3,048 theatres in Canada and the United States on 14 August 2009, and the film ranked first at the weekend box office with an opening gross of US$37.4 million. Among comparable science fiction films in the past, its opening attendance was slightly less than the 2008 film Cloverfield and the 1997 film Starship Troopers. The audience demographic for District 9 was 64 percent male and 57 percent people 25 years or older. The film stood out as a summer film that generated strong business despite little-known casting. Its opening success was attributed to the studio's unusual marketing campaign. In the film's second weekend, it dropped 49% in revenue while competing against the opening film Inglourious Basterds for the male audience, as Sony Pictures attributed the \\"good hold\\" to District 9s strong playability. The film enjoyed similar success in the UK with an opening gross of £2,288,378 showing at 447 cinemas. It was just as popular in South Africa, where it was filmed on location. = Critical response = Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on a sample of 312 reviews, with an average score of 7.81/10. The website's consensus states, \\"Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, District 9 has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received a score of 81 based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Sara Vilkomerson of The New York Observer wrote, \\"District 9 is the most exciting science fiction movie to come along in ages; definitely the most thrilling film of the summer; and quite possibly the best film I've seen all year.\\" Christy Lemire from the Associated Press was impressed by the plot and thematic content, claiming that \\"District 9 has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but it's really more of a character drama, an examination of how a man responds when he's forced to confront his identity during extraordinary circumstances.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum described it as \\"...madly original, cheekily political, [and] altogether exciting...\\" Roger Ebert praised the film for \\"giving us aliens to remind us not everyone who comes in a spaceship need to be angelic, octopod or stainless steel\\", but complained that \\"the third act is disappointing, involving standard shoot-out action. No attempt is made to resolve the situation, and if that's a happy ending, I've seen happier. Despite its creativity, the film remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction.\\" Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend says the film is unique in interpretation and execution, but considers it to be a knockoff of the 1988 film Alien Nation.Too Close To Call: 10 Ways District 9 Is An Alien Nation Knockoff , review by Josh Tyler, Cinema Blend, 10 August 2009 IGN listed District 9 at #24 on a list of the Top 25 Sci-Fi Films of All Time. = Political response = Nigeria's Information Minister Dora Akunyili asked movie theatres around the country to either ban the film or edit out specific references to the country, because of the film's negative depiction of the Nigerian characters as criminals and cannibals. Letters of complaint were sent to the producer and distributor of the film demanding an apology. She also said the gang leader Obesandjo is almost identical in spelling and pronunciation to the surname of former president Olusegun Obasanjo. The film was later banned in Nigeria; the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board was asked to prevent cinemas from showing the film and also to confiscate it. Hakeem Kae-Kazim, a Nigerian-born British actor, also criticized the portrayal of Nigerians in the film, telling the Beeld (an Afrikaans-language daily newspaper): \\"Africa is a beautiful place and the problems it does have can not be shown by such a small group of people.\\" However, the Malawian actor Eugene Khumbanyiwa, who played Obesandjo, has stated that the Nigerians in the cast of District 9 were not perturbed by the portrayal of Nigerians in the film, and that the film should not be taken literally: \\"It's a story, you know. It's not like Nigerians do eat aliens. Aliens don't even exist in the first place.\\" Teju Cole, a Nigerian-American writer, has commented that the \\"one- dimensionality of the Nigerian characters is striking,\\" even when taking into account that District 9 is meant to be a fable. He suggests two possible explanations for Blomkamp's narrative choice: first, that it is meant to reflect anti-foreigner sentiment within South Africa, or second, that it simply represents an oversight on Blomkamp's part. In 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by David Sirota in Salon.com in an article concerning white savior narratives in film. Alexandra Heller Nicholas discusses Wikus's self-identity in District 9 as problematic due to him being a white man and the hero of the film. Nicholas argues that a white savior \\"disempowers the film’s allegory to apartheid that comments on the corruption of the South African government\\" as well as the discrimination black South Africans dealt with during and post-apartheid. Making Wikus the \\"white savior\\" backtracks from the main message of District 9 which is to show the audience the detrimental effects \\"of colonialism brought by the Western world\\". Another point Nicholas makes is that District 9 is a \\"stereotypical White Savior film\\". She states that the plot is about a white man working for the government, who has roots \\"in South Africa's apartheid culture\\", involuntarily joins the \\"victims of apartheid\\". In this case, instead of black people, it's prawns.Emilye Denny (2017). \\"There is no need for a White Savior\\". Challening Borders. Doctor Shohini Chauduri wrote that District 9 even echoes apartheid in its title, as it is reminiscent \\"of District 6 in Cape Town, declared a whites-only area under the Group Areas Act...\\" She also discusses how the wide shots used in District 9 strongly emphasize the idea of exclusion under apartheid. The separation of people and \\"prawns\\" into human and non-human zones mark South Africa's social divisions.Dr. Shohini Chaudhuri, Cinema of the Dark Side. 2014 (Uninvited Visitors pp.135-143) = Accolades = District 9 was named one of the top 10 independent films of 2009 by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. The film received four Academy Awards nominations for: Best Motion Picture of the Year (Peter Jackson, Carolynne Cunningham), Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell), Best Achievement in Film Editing (Julian Clarke), Best Achievement in Visual Effects (Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, Matt Aitken); seven British Academy Film Awards nominations: Best Cinematography (Trent Opaloch), Best Screenplay – Adapted (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell), Best Editing (Julian Clarke), Best Production Design (Philip Ivey, Guy Potgieter), Best Sound (Brent Burge, Chris Ward, Dave Whitehead, Michael Hedges, Ken Saville), Best Special Visual Effects (Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, Matt Aitken), Best Director (Neill Blomkamp); five Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations: Best Makeup (Won), Best Screenplay, Adapted (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell), Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Action Movie; and one Golden Globe nomination: Best Screenplay – Motion Picture (Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell). It is the fifth TriStar Pictures film ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (the previous four were As Good as It Gets, Jerry Maguire, Bugsy and Places in the Heart). It won the 2009 Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.  Home media  The Blu-ray Disc and region 1 code widescreen edition of District 9 as well as the 2-disc special-edition version on DVD was released on 22 December 2009.

District 9 will be released on 4K Blu-Ray on 13 October 2020.  Future  On 1 August 2009, two weeks before District 9 was released to cinemas, Neill Blomkamp hinted that he intended to make a sequel if the film was successful enough. During an interview on the Rude Awakening 94.7 Highveld Stereo breakfast radio show, he alluded to it, saying \\"There probably will be.\\" Nevertheless, he revealed that his next project is unrelated to the District 9 universe. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Blomkamp stated that he was \\"totally\\" hoping for a follow-up: \\"I haven't thought of a story yet but if people want to see another one, I'd love to do it.\\"Mueller, Matt. \\"Neill Blomkamp Talks District 9 — RT Interview\\" , Rotten Tomatoes, 3 September 2009. Blomkamp has posed the possibility of the next movie in the series being a prequel. In an interview with Empire magazine posted on 28 April 2010, Sharlto Copley suggested that a follow-up, while very likely, would be about two years away, given his and Neill Blomkamp's current commitments. In an interview with IGN in June 2013, Blomkamp said, \\"I really want to make a District 9 sequel. I genuinely do. The problem is I have a bunch of ideas and stuff that I want to make. I'm relatively new to this—I'm about to make my third film, and now the pattern that I'm starting to realise is very true is that you lock yourself into a film beyond the film you're currently working on. But it just doesn't work for me.\\" Referring to a potential sequel, Blomkamp said \\"[he] want[s] to make District 10 at some point\\".Neill Blomkamp Talks About A District 9 Sequel And Star Wars As 2020, there's no update on the sequel of whether it is in development or cancelled.

Biography Much of Cassidy’s career was in civil engineering. He studied at the University of Newcastle, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil). His career included stints abroad between 1975 and 1985. In the late 1980s, Cassidy became CEO of the construction company Abigroup. Having built and diversified the company, Cassidy retired as CEO of Abigroup in early 2004. In 1982, Cassidy purchased the grazing property Merilba at Kingstown, where he became associated with the breeding of South Devon cattle, as well as other livestock, and more recent times, the growing wine grapes on the property. Cassidy was appointed chancellor by the University Council on 11 December 2003, and was installed at a graduation ceremony the following March. In 2007, Cassidy was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to university administration, to the civil engineering and construction industries, and to the community. He also became involved with other educational institutions, including the New England Conservatorium of Music and the New England Girls School, where in 2006 he underwrote the school’s A$ 4 million debt. In 2008, Cassidy became embroiled in a dispute with the university vice-chancellor, Alan Pettigrew over the demarcation of roles between the two offices. In June 2008, the staff passed motions of no confidence in the chancellor. Despite attempts at mediation by Sir Laurence Street, on 10 November 2008, it was announced that Cassidy's appointment as chancellor would not be renewed for a second term, and he was replaced by Richard Torbay.

While a baby can be delivered vaginally when either the head or the feet/buttocks are the leading part, it usually cannot be expected to be delivered successfully with a shoulder presentation unless a cesarean section (C/S) is performed. Frequency and causes Shoulder presentations are uncommon (about 0.5% of births) since, usually, toward the end of gestation, either the head or the buttocks start to enter the upper part of the pelvis, anchoring the fetus in a longitudinal lie. It is not known in all cases of shoulder presentation why the longitudinal lie is not reached, but possible causes include bony abnormalities of the pelvis, uterine abnormalities such as malformations or tumors (fibroids), or other tumors in the pelvis or abdomen. Other factors are a lax abdominal musculature, uterine overdistension (i.e., polyhydramnios), multiple gestation, placenta previa, a small fetus, or a fetus with some abnormality. Further, if the amniotic fluid sac ruptures, the shoulder or arm may become wedged as a shoulder presentation. Diagnosis Inspection of the abdomen may already give a clue as it is wide from side to side. Usually performing the Leopold's maneuvers will demonstrate the transverse lie of the fetus. Ultrasound examination delivers the diagnosis and may indicate possible causes such as multiple gestation or a tumor. On vaginal examination, the absence of a head or feet/breech is apparent. Shoulder presentations are classified into four types, based on the location of the scapula: *Left scapula-anterior (LSA) *Right scapula-anterior (RSA) *Left scapula-posterior (LSP) *Right scapula- posterior (RSP) Management While a transverse lie prior to labor can be manually versed to a longitudinal lie, once the uterus starts contracting the uterus normally will not allow any version procedure. A shoulder presentation is an indication for a caesarean section. Generally, as it is diagnosed early, the baby is not damaged by the time of delivery. With the rupture of the membranes, there is an increased risk of a cord prolapse as the shoulder may not completely block the birth canal. Thus the caesarean section is ideally performed before the membranes break. =Delivery of the second twin= The delivery of the second twin in a transverse lie with a shoulder presentation represents a special situation that may be amenable to a vaginal delivery. As the first twin has just been delivered and the cervix is fully dilated the obstetrician may perform an internal version, that is inserting one hand into the uterus, find the baby’s feet, and then bring the baby into a breech position and deliver the baby as such. =Impaction= During labor the shoulder will be wedged into the pelvis and the head lie in one iliac fossa, the breech in the other. With further uterine contractions the baby suffocates. The uterus continues to try to expel the impacted fetus and as its retraction ring rises, the musculature in the lower segments thins out leading eventually to a uterine rupture and the death of the mother. Impacted shoulder presentations contribute to maternal mortality. Obviously a cesarean section should be performed before the baby has died, but even when the baby has died or impaction has occurred, C/S is the method of choice of delivery, as alternative methods of delivery are potentially too traumatic for the mother. If the baby is preterm or macerated and very small a spontaneous delivery has been observed. History Internal version according to Siegemundin, 1690 Prior to the arrival of C/S the fetus usually died during protracted labor and the mother's life was at risk as well due to infection, uterine rupture and bleeding. On occasion, if the baby was macerated and small, it collapsed sufficiently to be delivered. The shoulder presentation was a feared obstetrical complication. In 1690 Justine Siegemundin, a German midwife, published Die Kgl. Preußische und Chur-Brandenburgische Hof-Wehemutter. This treatise for midwives demonstrated abnormal presentations at birth and their management. She was the first to describe a two-handed method of performing an internal rotation of the baby to extract it as a breech (a variation of which is performed today on the second twin, see above) using a sling. The procedure was useful provided the fetus was not impacted. Once the uterus had contracted around the baby tightly, destructive interventions were used to save the life of the mother.

Playing career Young attended the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and he was the team's MVP in 1978. After graduation, he managed to land a contract to play in the Netherlands Honkbal Hoofdklasse baseball league and he played there in 1979 and 1980 and realized that there were other opportunities for American players to ply their skills around the globe. He sent his resume around and was contacted in 1981 by the Queensland Rams, an Australian Baseball League team, which he also player-coached and led to a national championship (the Claxton Shield) in 1982. Managerial careerAmerica= Because the Australian and American seasons do not overlap, Young was able to pursue opportunities on both continents, and in 1985 landed the job of coach with the Medicine Hat Blue Jays, his first in organised baseball. In 1989, he managed the Bluefield Orioles in the Appalachian League and the Wausau Timbers in the Midwest League in 1990. He was a coach with the Rochester Red Wings in 1991 and 1992, then returned to managing with two seasons in the Cleveland Indians organisation. =Australia= At the same time, he was becoming a major player in the development of baseball in Australia, landing a coaching job with the Australian national team. He managed the team at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. He was twice named the International Baseball Federation coach of the year, in 1997 and 1999, for his work with the Australian national team. This included its results in two Intercontinental Cups, a bronze medal in the 1997 tournament and then to a gold medal at home in 1999. Young's work down under coincided with a period when Australian baseball was booming, producing Major League players like Dave Nilsson, Mark Hutton, Cam Cairncross, Shayne Bennett and Chris Snelling, all of whom reached the major leagues. This boom is linked to Young's work, as he is the one who developed the idea of the Australian Baseball Academy, which is jointly funded by Major League Baseball and aims at grooming Australian baseball talent. The number of Australian players signed by MLB has quadrupled since the Academy's foundation. =Cricket= Young's career took another twist in 2000 when the Australian cricket federation approached him for help. Fielding has long been an under-developed aspect of cricket, as teams have concentrated on developing bowlers and batsmen. The Australians, observing how fielding was a central part of baseball, decided to exploit an opportunity by having Young coach their players on catching, throwing and positioning. Young was appointed as an assistant coach until 2005 when his contract was not renewed and instead moved back to Chicago to manage the Rockford Riverhawks. During the 2005 Ashes series the Australian teams fielding had slipped and the side lost the Ashes to England for the first time since 1987.Buchanan sends for US help John Buchanan then made the decision for Australia to have a full-time fielding coach and Young became speculated in the media as the first baseball coach to coach a national cricket team and announced he would like to finish his managerial career doing it.Cricket beckons USA baseball coachesBeefy should shut it, says Young In 2009 he spent three weeks working with the Indian cricket team as a fielding consultant.

When no live gavel-to-gavel meetings were underway, other local or statewide public affairs programming was carried.  Demise  Officials at the Oregon State Capitol planned to discontinue the broadcast of the Oregon Channel after the 2011 session, concluding that the channel's viewership had dropped too low to justify costs. Both the lack of interest from local Salem/Portland-area Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable television channels and the failure of broadcasters to produce a reasonable agreement for transmission to other Government-access television (GATV) channels across Oregon ended the service.

Hewson began in the chorus of the company but moved up from smaller roles to larger ones on tour and then again from smaller roles to larger ones at the Savoy Theatre in London. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 27. Biography Hewson was born in Swansea, Wales. He was the son of John Jones Hewson (born 1829) and his wife Elizabeth (born 1833), proprietors of the Union Workhouse, Mount Pleasant, Swansea. His older sister was Jane (born 1868), and his younger brother was Howell (born 1878).1891 census =Early roles= Hewson grew up in Swansea. He joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company 1894 as a member of the chorus of the original production of Mirette at the Savoy Theatre in London. He soon went on tour with the company, doubling in the small roles of Captain Corcoran and Calynx in Utopia Limited and playing Francal in Mirette. In early 1895, he took the larger roles of Mr. Goldbury in Utopia, Gerard de Montigny in Mirette, Tommy Merton in The Vicar of Bray, and Ferdinand de Roxas in The Chieftain. He reverted to smaller roles later that year but took on the new bass-baritone roles of Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box that summer and Arac in Princess Ida in the autumn.Stone, David. Jones Hewson at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 12 February 2007 Back at the Savoy Theatre in November 1895, he played Pish-Tush in a revival of The Mikado. He soon added the role of Selworthy in the curtain raiser After All!, a role that he would play whenever this piece was revived at the Savoy thereafter. In March 1896, he created the role of the Herald in the original production of The Grand Duke at the Savoy Theatre, earning an encore from the Savoy audience and praise from the critics.Collected early reviews of The Grand Duke Occasionally, he substituted for Rutland Barrington in the lead role of Ludwig in The Grand Duke. He also played Pish-Tush in matinee performances that summer and again, later the same year, in the Savoy's revival of The Mikado and sometimes played the title role or Pooh-Bah during that long run. =Later roles= He next created the role of Baron Vincentius in His Majesty (1897), also substituting at times in the larger role of King Mopolio. Later the same year he played Sir Richard Cholmondeley in the first Savoy Theatre revival of The Yeomen of the Guard to good notices\\"Savoy Theatre\\", The Times, 6 May 1897, p. 10, col. E and added the role of the Rt. Hon. Claude Newcastle in the curtain raiser Old Sarah, another role that he repeated in revivals. In The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (1897–98), he played Captain Hochheimer (and sometimes Baron Grog). He appeared at the benefit performance of Trial by Jury held for Nellie Farren in March 1898. Later that year at the Savoy, he played Luiz in the first Savoy revival of The Gondoliers, created the role of Nicholas Dircks in The Beauty Stone and played Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre in a revival of The Sorcerer.Jones Hewson, The Savoy Photo Gallery at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive He also played the Counsel to the Plaintiff in Trial by Jury and Sir Marmaduke Pointdextre in The Sorcerer when they were revived together in the autumn of 1898. Hewson went back on tour at the beginning of 1899, reprising his role of Tommy Merton in The Vicar of Bray, and then toured in seven leading baritone roles in repertory: Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Pirate King in Pirates, Lord Mountararat in Iolanthe, the title role in The Mikado, Sergeant Meryll in Yeomen, Giuseppe in The Gondoliers and Mr. Goldbury in Utopia Limited, until August 1899, when he left the company for ten months. He returned to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy as a replacement for the role of Abdallah during the original production of The Rose of Persia in the summer of 1900.

Fourteen-year-old Brian Rossiter had been arrested for a public order offence on the night of 10/11 September 2002, falling into a coma whilst in custody at Clonmel garda station. Prior to his arrest, Rossiter had been assaulted by Noel Hannigan, who was later found guilty of this offence and sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. However, the case was the focus of much controversy and media speculation within Ireland, owing to concerns as to whether the injuries that caused Rossiter's death occurred, not as a result of Hannigan's assault, but while he was in custody. Rossiter's father took High Court action against the gardaí and called for CCTV cameras to be installed in all garda stations around Ireland, in every area of the station. An inquest into the death returned an open verdict and led to damages being paid to the boy's family. Background Brian Rossiter was the fourth of seven children born to Pat and Siobhán Rossiter. Brian moved to Wexford on 31 August 2002 with his mother and three younger siblings after the separation of his parents. On 6 September 2002, he returned to Clonmel with his mother for the weekend, staying with his older sister Sharon (who was then aged 23). Due to return to Wexford on 8 September, he missed the bus and at around 12:30 am in the early morning of 9 September, was assaulted by Noel Hannigan near his sister's house on Cashel Street. Hannigan later admitted that he had headbutted Brian \\"four or five times\\" but denied punching him or kneeing him in the face. Rossiter sustained two black eyes and complained of a headache later that day and again on 10 September. On 10 September at approximately 9:30 in the evening, Rossiter, having allegedly drunk some cider and smoked some hash, was arrested along with his 14-year-old friend, Anthony O'Sullivan, for a public order offence. Another 14-year-old, Daniel Leahy, a friend of theirs, was arrested for criminal damage at the same time. Both O'Sullivan and Leahy alleged that they were assaulted by arresting gardaí officers. O'Sullivan claimed that Rossiter had told him he had also been assaulted by the gardaí. The Gardaí stated that whilst Brian gave abuse following his arrest, he then calmed down and fell asleep in his cell. They further stated that when they attempted to rouse him from his sleep at 09:30 the following morning, they could not wake him. Local doctors were called and Brian Rossiter was subsequently taken to St Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel before being transferred to Cork University Hospital. A garda investigation into the cause of his injuries was soon \\"at an advanced stage\\". Meanwhile, in Cork, consultant neurosurgeon Charles Marks extracted a clot from Brian Rossiter's brain, but he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead shortly after 5:30 on the afternoon of 13 September 2002. His funeral took place on 17 September 2002. High Court proceedings The Rossiters took High Court action at the Four Courts, Dublin. Brian Rossiter's father took High Court proceedings against the gardaí, alleging their wrongful arrest of his son. He later threatened to do so for a second time in July 2005. A settlement was eventually reached in July 2008 which meant that an inquest into his son's death could hear evidence from two UK-based Professors of Forensic Pathology whom the Coroner had previously refused to call as witnesses. In addition, further civil action against the State was taken by the Rossiters in December 2008, after they were informed that internal Garda disciplinary proceedings were \\"none of their business\\". Hannigan sentencing In November 2006, Noel Hannigan was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for assaulting Brian Rossiter. He had also been charged with manslaughter and assault causing serious harm, but these charges were later withdrawn, when a second inquiry, in addition to the statutory inquiry already announced, was launched in July 2005 to look into the reasons for charging Hannigan with manslaughter. Inquiry On 30 June 2005, a statutory inquiry was announced by the then Irish Minister for Justice Michael McDowell into Brian Rossiter's death, with the Minister apologising to the family for the way the case had been handled so far. The inquiry, led by Senior Counsel Hugh Hartnett was criticised by Rossiter's family for its limited scope. Pat Rossiter expressed his lack of confidence that the inquiry would be permitted to ask if his son had been killed at the garda station, and if so, who was responsible. The family threatened not to participate. There was a disagreement over legal fees. McDowell, though, insisted that the inquiry would have full powers. On 5 December 2005, the statutory inquiry into the death of Brian Rossiter opened in Dublin. It was expected to last for three months and to hear from 120 witnesses in private session. The Rossiter family's solicitor, Cian O'Carroll of Lynch and Partners, spoke of his belief that the terms of reference would still not allow the inquiry to get at the key issue, which he said was whether Rossiter had died from injuries inflicted inside the garda station or not, and, if he had sustained these injuries inside the garda station, then who had caused them. Pat Rossiter spoke of feeling \\"a bit anxious and a bit apprehensive\\" at the start of the inquiry but he also \\"hoped for the best\\". The Irish government had agreed to pay the family's out-of-pocket expenses, and for some of the preparatory work involved in the case. The inquiry found no evidence that Rossiter had been assaulted inside the garda station, but found that he had been unlawfully detained by the gardaí. It sat for 80 days between December 2005 and September 2006, heard from 100 witnesses, including seven of Clonmel's gardaí, and reported in April 2008. In February 2008, Rossiter's family had criticised the Minister for Justice Michael McDowell, believing that he had set up the inquiry under the wrong Act. With the inquiry completed, however, an inquest into Brian Rossiter's death could now be held, as soon as a private action taken by the Rossiter family against Cork City Coroner, to allow evidence from two UK-based Professors of Forensic Pathology to be admissible, was settled. InquestPreliminary hearing= On 29 May 2007, a preliminary hearing took submissions from the Rossiter family and the State heard from the Cork City Coroner that she had questioned the time it was taking for the report into the circumstances surrounding Brian Rossiter's death to be published. Doctor Myra Cullinane told the hearing that she had twice written to the Hartnett Inquiry but had received no reply. =Inadequacies and contradictions= Brian Rossiter died from epidural hematoma to his skull. Above is an instance of nontraumatic epidural hematoma in a young woman. The grey area in the top left is organising hematoma, causing midline shift and compression of the ventricle. The inquest proper began early in December 2008. Mary Furlong, a friend of Brian Rossiter's mother, told the inquest how she had witnessed a red mark the size of a two euro coin on the boy's left cheek when she visited him in hospital, claiming that such a mark had not been there earlier that week. Witness Anne Marie Hannigan claimed that all of her statement had not been read out in court, a statement which she alleged was to have contradicted that of Garda Pádraig Jennings and Garda Pádraig Frawley. She told the inquest that the gardaí had used force when they were arresting Rossiter and his friend, Anthony O'Sullivan, denying that she was making this up for her own satisfaction. A GP described her shock and despair upon her discovery of Rossiter's comatose body. Brian Rossiter's father told the inquest that a detective garda had informed him that his son had taken as many as sixteen ecstasy tablets, was \\"drunk out of his mind\\" and \\"as high as a kite\\", and yet later toxicology reports showed no evidence of this. Three medical experts gave conflicting evidence into the nature of Brian Rossiter's injuries. Neurosurgeon Charles Marks, the consultant who operated on Brian when he was admitted to Cork University Hospital, said he believed \\"on the balance of probability\\" that Rossiter sustained the fatal injury 56 hours before his admission to hospital – a time corresponding to the Hannigan assault. Ireland's State Pathologist, Doctor Marie Cassidy told the inquest that she was unable to pinpoint the precise time at which Rossiter sustained his death injury – she said people were \\"getting caught up in trying to be specific, to date things that were impossible to date.\\" Professor Christopher Milroy, a British Home office pathologist for 17 years and a reviewer of Rossiter's file, said it was more likely that he had sustained the injury which killed him subsequent to the Hanning assault, and closer to the time that he was found unconscious in his Clonmel prison cell. On the day before the jury retired, a forensic pathologist said that it was impossible for him to determine whether the fatal strike had been inflicted late on the evening of 8 September, around the time that Hannigan's assault had taken place, or at a later date. =Verdict= On 12 December 2008, a jury retired after hearing evidence for eight days and returned an open verdict, after finding in accordance with medical evidence supplied that the boy died from an extradural haemorrhage due to blunt force trauma to the head. The jury felt that it was not possible to make a definitive statement concerning how Brian Rossiter had died – the Coroner had given them the option of delivering an open verdict or a narrative verdict, and had ruled out the option of a verdict of unlawful killing. Settlement On 19 December 2008, a settlement of €200,000 plus legal costs and a written expression of regret, acknowledging wrongdoing on the part of the gardaí, was reached in the civil lawsuit taken by Rossiter's family against the Garda Commissioner, the Irish Minister for Justice and the Irish State. Mister Justice Richard Johnson approved the settlement. The Irish State acknowledged its acceptance that Rossiter's detention was unlawful, that the Treatment of Persons in Custody Act was not followed appropriately and that issues surrounding his death were not sufficiently investigated. The jury also made two recommendations relating to the treatment of persons in garda custody. These were that medical attention should be called to any garda station for any person, and especially those under the age of 17, if there were obvious signs of any injury or weakness, and that social services should be made available to gardaí at all times. Reaction Rossiter's parents described their six-year battle for justice as \\"gruelling\\" but expressed the wish that their son's death had not been in vain and welcomed the recommendations made by the jury regarding improvements in health and safety, in cases where young people are detained. Rossiter's father said he would have gone further: > \\"I would have gone further. I think there should be cameras in all areas of > the Garda stations around the country – in corridors, entries, as well as > exits. I think it's very important that CCTV should be in all areas of every > Garda station.\\" Awards Investigative journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes received a Media Justice Award in 2005 for his coverage of this case.

At least one station above 51, Fox affiliate WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh (channel 53), signed off its analog signal on the original February deadline, thereby allowing it to participate in the SAFER Act.http://pbrtv.com/blog/entry_902.php The act was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 23, 2008 and the FCC was given until January 15, 2009 to finalize the related rules and regulations.DTV Nightlight Bill Becomes Law, Broadcasting & Cable, 23 December 2008 The initial FCC- generated list of eligible stationsFCC's list of eligible SAFER Act stations was published on December 29, 2008.FCC flips on the night light, Radio Business Report, December 29, 2008 Other stations were encouraged to apply, especially in media markets where no station was listed. Stations only required a special temporary authority (STA) from the FCC to be a part of the service. Limited presence of advertising and sponsorship was permitted, insofar as it is needed to allow news broadcasts from the main digital station to be simulcast onto the nightlight channel during an emergency.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-2A1.pdf Commercial activity was otherwise limited to mere identification of sponsors. An updated FCC list of eligible stations, released January 15, 2009, identified twenty-eight stations nationwide which have expressed interest in conducting these broadcasts.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-2A2.pdf The cost per station to operate the transmitters for one month has been estimated at $3,500 to $15,000, depending on the frequency, power level, and local electric rates. Low-power TV (LPTV) stations are not required to transition to digital broadcasting, thus the bill does not affect them. Because of this exception, several stations throughout the nation, such as Washington, D.C.'s WJLA (ABC) and WDJT-TV (CBS) in Milwaukee, took advantage of the loophole by moving network programming from their former analog full- power stations to purchased or leased LPTV stations in order to continue to provide some form of analog network programming and local news to their market area until such time as digital adoption has been deemed sufficient by the stations. WJLA ended their extended service shortly after the nightlight period, while the special dispensation by CBS for WDJT to air the network on their station ended on December 31, 2009, at which time it began to transmit Me-TV station WBME-TV's main signal until Weigel's low-power analog signals in Milwaukee were turned off at the beginning of 2013. After June 12, 2009, a low-power analog station in Chicago, not required to shut down after 30 days like other nightlight stations, aired newscasts that otherwise could not be seen by a number of people after the transition while stations attempted to solve technical and reception problems. The FCC reported 121 stations providing nightlight service in 87 markets after the June 12, 2009 transition. All of the stations were supposed to be off the air by July 12, 2009, and David Fiske of the FCC said no investigation was planned to ensure compliance. Fiske said someone would have to report a full-power station for violating the rule. Continuation of full-power broadcasting beyond this date was considered to be unlikely, as the stations would have to incur the costs of operating two transmitters. While Nielsen estimated that 1.7 million people still could not pick up a digital signal as of July 1, 2009, former acting FCC chair Michael Copps said giving nightlight stations more time was not planned.

A corporal and later second lieutenant in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 () during the Second World War, he was killed in 1944. Early life Gregers Gram was born in Vestre Aker in 1917 as the son of Harald Gram, later known as stipendiary magistrate of Oslo. He was named after his paternal grandfather Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram, who served as Norwegian Prime Minister in Stockholm and County Governor of Hedmark. Gram did not pass his examen artium at the first try, but later enrolled at the University of Oslo to study law. Second World War When German troops invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, Gregers Gram became active in the resistance movement. After serving as a soldier in the early battles following the German invasion, he soon became involved in propaganda activity and the illegal press, he had to flee from Norway in 1941. After arriving in Great Britain, he was recruited by the Special Operations Executive and received military training with the Norwegian Independent Company 1. He was paradropped into Norway together with Max Manus on 12 March 1943, and the two performed a successful sabotage mission (Operation Mardonius). Gram and Manus left Norway after Operation Mardonius, returning to the United Kingdom, where they stayed until October 1943. Gram was awarded the British Military Medal as a result of his participation in the operation, the recommendation for the award describes how Manus became ill with pneumonia shortly after they arrived in Norway, meaning that Gram had to undertake much of the organisation on the ground, and also nursing Manus during his recovery. The most successful attack was on 28 April 1943 which resulted in the sinking of two ships, and damage to a third, despite the fact it was a very light night, and water conditions were such that the canoes generated a very visible phosphorescence in their wake. Gram was also decorated with Norway's War Cross with sword in summer 1943, presented to him by King Haakon at a ceremony at the training school STS 26 in Scotland, near Nethy Bridge. In addition to Gram, Manus, and Rønneberg and Poulsson from the Rjukan missions, also received the War Cross with sword at this ceremony. Also present were Crown Prince Olav, Minister of Defence Oscar Torp, and Chief of Defence of Norway General von Tangen Hansteen. In October 1943 Gram (along with Manus, Einar Juvén and C.F. Wiborg) returned to Norway to perform a second operation, known as Bundle, targeting German ships. Other sabotage missions followed, coordinated within Oslogjengen, Milorg's sabotage group in Oslo led by Gunnar Sønsteby. Parallel to his saboteur activity, Gram continued his involvement with propaganda, including the black propaganda Operation Derby directed towards German soldiers. In particular he was involved in an attack organised by Sønsteby which destroyed German records about the Norwegian workforce, and his attack on an oil storage depot. Gram was killed on 13 November 1944 in an ambuscade in a café at Grünerløkka in Oslo. Together with fellow resistance member Edvard Tallaksen, Gram was set up at a meeting with faux Nazi deserters. Shooting ensued, and Gram was killed at the hands of Gestapo. His father Harald Gram, who was also involved in the resistance movement, survived the war. Legacy Bust of Gregers Gram outside Njårdhallen, Oslo. At the time of his death, the process of recommending Gram for the British Military Cross was already under way (this medal was not generally awarded posthumously at the time). The recommendation particularly mentions the successful sinking of a German patrol vessel in Oslo harbour in February 1944, and the daring, but unsuccessful, daylight attack on the troopship Monte Rosa. His Military Medal was presented to his father on 7 February 1945 by Sir Victor Mallet, who was then head of the British Legation in Stockholm. To commemorate Gram a bust was erected near Njårdhallen, in the Ullern borough of Oslo, in 1994. The road Gregers Grams vei in Oslo has been named after him. In 2008 he was portrayed in the Norwegian film Max Manus by actor Nicolai Cleve Broch.

It was created by Leonora Thuna, and produced by Thomas L. Miller, Edward K. Milkis and Robert L. Boyett, in association with Garry Marshall's Henderson Productions and Paramount Television. It is a period piece comedy set during World War II, which was the producers' 1940s answer to their top 1950s-themed hits Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley. Synopsis Set in Washington, D.C., in 1942, Goodtime Girls told the story of four women who found themselves having to share a small attic apartment at the Coolidge Boarding House, due to a regional apartment shortage, which occurred as a result of women striking out on their own and supporting themselves during wartime. In the beginning, three of the girls—Edith Bedelmeyer (Annie Potts), Sioux City native Betty Crandall (Lorna Patterson), and Loretta Smoot (Georgia Engel)--had agreed to share space together in the attic at Coolidge. However, just when they thought things couldn't get more cramped, Camille Rittenhouse (Francine Tacker), a snobbish reporter who was covering a newspaper story on the apartment shortage, wound up being their fourth roommate when she herself lost her apartment and was in need of a new place. This didn't immediately sit well with the other women, not only because of the tight quarters barely accommodating four, but since Camille's holier-than-thou personality clashed with the others, especially with Edith, who became the unofficial leader of the group. The gang did learn to get along, as they grew closer in a time when a lot of emotional and moral support was needed for each other, with America working on \\"getting Uncle Sam out of a jam\\". The ladies also had a lot of fun things to look forward to; despite the shortage of consumer goods, cars, and men, many soldiers and sailors on military leave passed through to romance them. Edith and Betty, who were younger and single, were most frequently sought after by these bachelors. Loretta was the middle-aged war bride, who was holding out hope for her husband's safe return. Then there were two resident single men in the building, macho hustler cabbie Frankie Millardo (Adrian Zmed), who lived downstairs with his buddy Benny Loman (Peter Scolari), a street performer whose pantomime, juggling and unicycle acts were part of the regular physical comedy and pratfalls seen in every episode. Frankie, who had been the one who drove Betty, Edith and Loretta to the boarding house, wants to prove himself by joining the military but is turned down because he has flat feet. Frankie and Benny often joined in the girls' escapades, escorting them around town and engaging in periodic jitterbug and big band dance sessions. With play came work: Edith was employed at the Office of Price Admissions, as mentioned, Camille was a newspaper reporter, Betty worked for the U.S. Secretary of War, and Loretta, at The Pentagon for bureaucrat General Culpepper (seen in guest appearances by Richard Stahl). The boarding house was run by its namesakes, George and Irma Coolidge (Merwin Goldsmith and Marcia Lewis), a married couple who controlled their units very strictly. Also seen around was Skeeter (Sparky Marcus), a young boy who spent a lot of time with the Coolidges. Scheduling Goodtime Girls premiered in January 1980 on Tuesday nights, immediately following Happy Days, of which this series, unlike others produced by Garry Marshall and Miller/Milkis/Boyett, was not spun off from or in any ways connected to, storyline-wise. ABC kept the show on through the end of February sweeps, but then pulled it off the schedule for over a month until it returned in April, when it then aired for three consecutive weeks in a Saturday 8:30/7:30c slot. The show was then taken off again, and since it garnered small audiences during both these runs, the network officially cancelled the show during May 1980 upfronts. Five more original episodes turned up on Fridays at 8:30/7:30c that August, leading up to the final produced episode's broadcast on August 29, 1980. The series' third episode (\\"Night and Day\\") was the only one that ABC chose not to air during its run, for unexplained reasons.

Adrian Zmed (Frankie Millardo) would later gain more fame as Officer Vince Romano on the series T.J. Hooker on ABC and later CBS. He would also host the show Dance Fever. Lorna Patterson (Betty Crandall) worked with Francine Tacker (Camille Rittenhouse), who was married to the man Lorna herself would later marry, actor Robert Ginty. Francine Tacker originally was Elizabeth Logan in the TV adaptation of the novel and movie, The Paper Chase, and would later be the second of three actresses (Morgan Fairchild and Priscilla Beaulieu Presley would be the others) who played Jenna Wade on the series, Dallas. Patterson would gain later fame in the TV adaptation of the movie Private Benjamin, playing the title role of Judy Benjamin, the role played in the movie by Goldie Hawn. Georgia Engel (Loretta Smoot) was already well-established from her being well known as Georgette Baxter from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, while Annie Potts (Edith Bedelmeyer) would later achieve fame with the movie Ghostbusters, where she played Janine Melnitz, her long-running role of pragmatic interior designer Mary Jo Shively in the comedy, Designing Women, her role of Mary Elizabeth Sims on the Lifetime drama Any Day Now, and as Sheldon Cooper's Mee Maw in Young Sheldon. Providing further synergy between the family of Marshall-produced shows, actors from Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley, respectively, guest starred on Goodtime Girls. Scott Baio appeared in one episode as Edith's younger brother who decided to enlist for the war. Michael McKean guest starred in another as a war veteran who was recovering in a local Washington, D.C., hospital after losing his legs in battle.

The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price, which in turn led to its nationalisation on 21 January 2009. Early life Drumm was born in November 1966, in the seaside suburb town of Skerries in north County Dublin. Career He joined Deloitte and Touche from school to train as a chartered accountant. In 1988 he moved to the venture capital wing of the International Fund for Ireland, from which he obtained a position of assistant manager with Anglo Irish Bank. After rising through the ranks, he was made Chief Executive from 2005. Drumm resigned his position following the resignation of chairman Seán FitzPatrick in December 2008, amid mounting revelations over hidden loans. The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price which in turn led to the bank's nationalisation on 21 January 2009. =Post Anglo-Irish= Drumm subsequently moved with his family to Massachusetts, US, where in 2010 he filed for bankruptcy under US law. The hearing at the Boston-based court heard from the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which fought Drumm's claims for bankruptcy, as he owed it €9 million. It was alleged during the case that Drumm had transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during the bankruptcy proceedings. In early 2015, the court ruled the application inadmissible, ruling that he could be held liable for debts of €10.5m in Ireland. In a 122-page ruling, the judge found Drumm was \\"not remotely credible\\", his conduct \\"both knowing and fraudulent\\", and accused Drumm of telling \\"outright lies\\". Subsequently, the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) recommended a number of charges be brought against Drumm, following investigation into Anglo Irish Bank by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Director of Corporate Enforcement. In January 2015, it was reported that the DPP was seeking the extradition of Drumm, and had filed papers with the US authorities. Drumm was arrested by US Marshals based in Boston on Sunday 11 October 2015, and expected to face extradition proceedings. It was announced on 13 March 2016 that Drumm would be extradited back to Ireland from Boston to Dublin, to face 33 charges in the Irish Criminal Courts on 14 March. On 14 March, he was arrested by the Garda Síochána at Dublin Airport on arrival from Boston and taken to Ballymun Garda Station, where he was charged with 33 counts including forgery, counterfeiting documents, conspiracy to defraud, the unlawful giving of financial assistance in association with the purchase of shares, and disclosing false or misleading information in a management report. Conviction On 6 June 2018, he was convicted of two charges of false accounting and conspiracy to defraud. His former colleagues John Bowe and Willie McAteer, along with the former chief executive of Irish Life & Permanent Denis Casey, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud in June 2016 and jailed for 6 years.

Following her performance of \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\" during the Super Bowl, Houston decided to carry it over into a concert to honor the troops, their families, and military and government dignitaries of the Gulf War.Kennedy, Dana. \\"Whitney Houston aims for normalcy.\\" St. Petersburg Times. March 29, 1991. Page 3D. The concert was originally scheduled as an HBO special, with Whitney singing for the troops on Easter Sunday. But by the time of the scheduled concert, the war was over and it was billed as a \\"Welcome Home, Heroes\\" concert, with Whitney performing in a Virginia naval hangar to welcome home military personnel returning from Iraq. About the event Whitney told The Salina Journal: \\"I was thinking about doing something else for the fellows over there and I was considering going overseas. Then the war ended and this came up.\\" Development and broadcast First, the United States Department of the Navy arranged for Whitney to fly out to meet the USS Saratoga, a cruise ship her men called \\"The Sara\\". The singer stayed overnight on the ship joking and laughing with the men, and even took a turn on the \\"mess line\\" serving dinner. After the visit to the Saratoga, Whitney went to Norfolk, Virginia to prepare for the concert. The Governor of Virginia, L. Douglas Wilder, was invited and some top military officers who had served in the Gulf, but most of the seats were reserved for enlisted men and women of Desert Storm and their families. Because they were more troops than seats for the Easter Sunday's show, on March 31, 1991, 3,000 from the Army, Airforce, Navy, Marines and the Coast Guard were invited to the dress rehearsal on Saturday night. The concert was broadcast live on HBO. The cable network agreed to unscramble its signal allowing it to be available to over 50 million cable households. It gave HBO their highest ratings ever at the time. About the concert, Whitney said: > Until I spent time with these military people, I didn't really appreciate > how special they are. I was surrounded by courteous, brave men and women... > I sang my heart out to them... and still felt them give more in return. I > salute our troops, those who have returned and those still serving around > the world, and thank them from the bottom of my heart.

Biography Azizi was born in Tacheng to an influential Uyghur trader family originally from Artux (Artush). He attended school in Xinjiang and then moved to the Soviet Union, joining the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and studying at the Central Asia Political Institute in Tashkent.Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland by S. Frederick Starr He returned to Xinjiang as a Soviet agent, instigating the Soviet-backed Ili Rebellion against the Republic of China government in northwest Xinjiang. He served as Minister of Education in the Second East Turkestan Republic and Commissioner of Education in the Zhang Zhizhong Ili Rebel-Kuomintang coalition government from 1945–1948. In September 1949, Saifuddin attended the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference endorsed by the Communist Party of China (CPC), becoming a member of the new Communist government. In October, the 1949 Chinese revolution brought the Communists to power in Xinjiang and in China more generally; at this point, Saifuddin held various posts for Nationalities and Political and Legal Affairs for the new government. From December 1949 through January 1950, he accompanied Mao Zedong in his trip to Moscow to negotiate the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and it was there on December 27, 1949 where he quit the CPSU and joined the CPC in accordance with recommendation of Mao himself. In 1955, he registered with Mao his strong objection to proposals to name Xinjiang the \\"Xinjiang Autonomous Region\\", arguing that \\"autonomy is not given to mountains and rivers. It is given to particular nationalities\\". As a result, the administrative region would be named \\"Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region\\". Uyghur linguist Ibrahim Muti'i opposed the Second East Turkestan Republic and was against the Ili Rebellion because it was backed by the Soviets and Stalin. Saifuddin Azizi later apologized to Ibrahim and admitted that his opposition to the East Turkestan Republic was the correct thing to do. At the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing, he secured the role of regional Chairman of Xinjiang, a job he kept from 1955 to 1978, with a brief respite during the Cultural Revolution. He was a vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the First through Seventh National People's Congress and an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the 10th and 11th CPC Central Committee.

Peck, and published by him in 1900.Bradford C. Peck, The World a Department Store: A Story of Life Under a Coöperative System, Lewiston, ME and Boston, privately printed, 1900. The book was one entrant in the wave of utopian and dystopian writing that occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Kenneth M. Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity: America in Utopian Writings, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984. Moreover, Peck's book was one of the minority of utopian works of the time that was linked to an effort at practical application of its ideas.Wallace Evan Davies, \\"A Collectivist Experiment Down East: Bradford Peck and the Coöperative Association of America,\\" New England Quarterly, Vol. 20 (December 1947), pp. 471-91.Francine C. Cary, \\"The World a Department Store: Bradford Peck and the Utopian Endeavor,\\" American Quarterly, Vol. 29 (Fall 1977), pp. 370-84. The Cooperative Bradford Peck (1853-1935) has been compared to King Gillette as a successful businessman of the Gilded Age who nonetheless advocated views that were, to some degree, anti-capitalist and pro-socialist.Susan L. Mizruchi, \\"Realist utopias,\\" in: Sacvan Bercovitch, general editor, The Cambridge History of American Literature, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2005; p. 721. Peck followed the Horatio Alger pattern in American life,Cary, p. 372. rising from want to commercial success; a native of Lewiston, Maine, he built the largest department store in the state in its time. In reaction to the chaotic business conditions of the Panic of 1893, Peck began to develop a commitment to the emerging cooperative movement. Peck formed a local co-operative association in 1899, and soon promoted it into the \\"Coöperative Association of America.\\" His goal was to link producers with consumers as directly as possible, eliminating all expenses of \\"middle-men\\", bankers and interest payments, and advertising costs, and so creating a far more efficient and economical business model than the one dominant in America in his generation. The Association established a co-op grocery and restaurant, and opened a reading room; Peck later transferred the ownership of his department store to the Association so that its profits would support the cause. Peck organized conventions and other activities to promote the co-operative movement. The Association tried to form a co-operative community in Oregon in 1906, but without success. The Lewiston co-op shut down in 1912, when the C.A.A. lost its lease on its headquarters. Peck, however, remained a vigorous advocate of his views until his death at age 82. He also wrote The World a Department Store, his only novel, to promote his vision. The book sold for $1.00 per copy; royalties went to the Association. (A British edition was issued by the publisher Gay & Bird, also in 1900.) Influences By his own admission, Peck was an admirer of Edward Bellamy and his famous novel Looking Backward (1888); he was also influenced by Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879) and Charles Sheldon's In His Steps (1896).Davies, p. 472. When Peck published his novel, it \\"caught the imagination of some socialists in the same way as Bellamy's works had.\\"Robert S. Fogarty, All Things New: American Communes and Utopian Movements, 1860-1914, Lanham, MD, Lexington Books, 2003; p. 173. The book The plot of the novel begins on April 7, 1925. The opening chapters introduce two young men, George Wilkinson and Harry Childs, and their girlfriends, Mabel Clay and Alice Furbush.\\"Alice Furbush\\" -- another book about the co-operative movement, The Co-opolitan, had been published in 1898, two years before Peck's; the author had employed the pseudonym \\"Zedina Forbush.\\" The young men are roommates, as are the young women; they all work for various functions of Coöperative City. They are struck and fascinated by the story of Percy Brantford, which they read in that morning's newspaper. Brantford had been a successful businessman of the late nineteenth century -- though like many men of that type he suffered from the intense stresses, anxieties, and uncertainties of the commercial world. He used a sleeping potion to combat his insomnia. On the night of December 31, 1899 (in popular reckoning, the last day of the century), Brantford took a double dose of his sleeping powder; he lapsed into a coma and slept for 25 years. The young people read the news story that recounts Brantford's sudden awakening in a local nursing home. The committee that runs the City appoints Childs and Wilkinson to be Brantford's guides in his adjustment to the new social and economic reality. Brantford is amazed to learn that the co-operative movement has transformed the Lewiston he knew into Coöperative City, which is run on a vastly different and improved system. Most of the book is devoted to explanations of the workings of the Coöperative Association of America, and how it has come to dominate the former Lewiston and spread to New York City, Chicago, and other major cities. Wilkinson and Childs detail all major aspects of the new system, to Brantford's wondering admiration. The new system has eliminated poverty, tenements, slums, litter, and other evil aspects of the old economy. Some of the details of Peck's plan are effective forecasts of later developments. The members of the C.A.A. use \\"coupon checks\\" instead of the \\"old-style microbe- breeding currency.\\"The World a Department Store, p. 34. Photo IDs are used. Both men and women pursue physical fitness, and work out in gymnasiums. The public school system monitors the schoolchildren's nutritional needs. Brantford, for his part, reminisces about the bad old days of Gilded-Age capitalism; he recalls a system so irrational and rapacious that every man in business necessarily had a \\"dishonest career....\\" He recalls brokers on the stock exchanges as \\"a lot of maniacs, running wild...,\\" and makes similar remarks on the conditions of the earlier age.WDS, pp. 20 and 35. The plot retains at least a vestigial human-interest storyline. The young people have a neighbor named Helen Brown; she and Percy Brantford develop a romance, and in the end the three couples join in a triple wedding. Throughout his book, Peck stresses that the new economic and social system has moral and ethical and even religious implications. The regime of Coöperative City and the C.A.A. empowers a \\"true cooperative Christian existence\\" instead of frustrating people's normal drives to neighborliness and virtue. Through co-operation, humanity has formed itself \\"into a practical Christian organization....\\"WDS, pp. 99 and 189. The book begins with a Preface and Prospectus written by a clergyman; Peck closes his novel with a chapter on the religious, ethical, and social implications of his plan. As a result, Peck's novel has been termed a Social Gospel book.Gary Scott Smith, The Search for Social Salvation: Social Christianity and America, 1880-1925, Lanham, MD, Lexington Books, 2000; p. 316. Style Peck was not an experienced writer, and made no pretensions to literary quality in his work; his book has been criticized for its \\"inept and pretentious style.\\"Davies, pp. 473-4. He wrote in the manner of popular magazines, travelogues, and advertising copy; Coöperative City is \\"the most beautiful city in all the world,\\" and its buildings and features are described as \\"delightful,\\" \\"elegant,\\" \\"heavenly,\\" and \\"magnificent.\\" As Brantford progresses through his tour of the city, his comments are along the lines of \\"Wonderful, wonderful! and what marvelous changes from my former life!\\" In describing a private home, Peck writes, \\"Our readers, no doubt, will feel interested to know something of the character and style of this beautiful home....Here was to be found every convenience and luxury known to those living in the last century.\\"WDS, pp. 11, 224-5, 262. Beyond the verbal expression, Peck's aesthetic is shaped by his professional experience: his future is clean and polished, well-organized and brightly displayed. His world is very much like a department store. The illustrations Peck's book was furnished with multiple illustrations by Harry C. Wilkinson. This sets it apart from most Utopian works of the era, though King Gillette's The Human Drift (1894) was similarly well-illustrated. Wilkinson's pictures show outside views and floor plans of the buildings lavishly described by Peck, as well as street plans of the city's neighborhoods, and a \\"coupon check\\" book.

The former monastic church survived a parish church until 1876 when it was demolished. The present Vor Frue Kirke was built on the site between 1877-1878.  History  Vor Frue Kloster = Aalborg was the area's largest town and the abbey was built on property donated by the diocese. Nor is it clear whether the early nuns were in fact Benedictines. In 1140 Sigurd Slembe, pretender to the Norwegian throne, was buried inside the abbey church, as recorded by the priest Kjeld Kalv, known while serving at the church for his piety. The abbey over time developed into a complex consisting of a large church and three ranges forming a rectangular enclosure to separate the nuns from the world. The church was also used daily by the residents of Aalborg, though the nuns were separated from the congregation by iron gates around the choir. The tower of the church was one of the three church towers which can still be seen on Aalborg's city logo. The church and abbey buildings underwent a significant expansion in the late 15th century and were reconstructed in late Brick Gothic style. In the mid-1520s, Lutheran ideas swept through northern Jutland and Viborg and Aalborg became centres of Lutheran reaction against Roman Catholic institutions, customs and doctrines. The Franciscans were expelled from Aalborg, and support for the nuns vanished. In 1534 Aalborg was the site of a siege and massacre at the end of Skipper Clement's rebellion. King Christian III's army laid siege to the city and when the walls were stormed, the city was sacked. The city's churches and monasteries, including Vor Frue Kirke, were stripped of anything valuable by the mercenaries who ravaged the city. Two years later Denmark became officially Lutheran and all religious houses and their income properties reverted to the crown. King Christian gave the abbey to the city with the stipulation that the nuns be permitted to remain under the supervision of a local noble. =Vor Frue Kirke= Altar of Vor Frue Kirke Vor Frue Kirke became one of the city's parish churches. The last nun left the former abbey in 1560 and the town converted one of the ranges into a residence for the new Lutheran pastor. The other ranges were demolished. Several epitaphs were added to the walls of the nave. Burial chapels were added by noble families beneath the church, of which the Scheel family chapel is still extant beneath the present building. A new pulpit, which is still preserved in the present church, was donated before 1579, In 1876 Vor Frue Kirke had become so dilapidated that it was decided to demolish it and build a new church in its place. It was built of the red brick in neo-romanticism between 1877-1878 following drawings by architect Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann (1837–1922) and inaugurated on December 22, 1878. The altarpiece was designed by Gnudtzmann with the altar designed by architect Hermann Baagøe Storck (1839–1922) and paintings by artist Johan Georg Frans Schwartz (1850–1917). Two of the bells in Vor Frue Kirke have been preserved from the earlier building. One of them was cast in the 12th century and is the oldest bell still in use in Denmark. The other from 1518 was recast in 1861 when it cracked, and again in 1919 when it cracked a second time.

Sponsored by IBM during the 1990s, it successfully guided Japan's personal computer manufacturing companies at that time into standardising to an IBM PC-compatible and open architecture. History Before the advent of the IBM PC in 1981 in the United States, there were many different varieties and designs of personal computer. Examples from that era include the Tandy RadioShack and Commodore. These machines were each based upon a different computer architecture and the software programs that ran on them were compatible only with the machine they had been designed for. In Japan, except for the MSX, this situation continued well into the early 1990s, because three of Japan's major electronics manufacturers (NEC, Sharp and Fujitsu) had also designed their own unique personal computers; although NEC with its NEC 9801 was at that time the most successful. The American computer manufacturer IBM had entered the Japanese market with its own IBM 5550 computer. Japanese-language-capable computers at the time, however, had special requirements in terms of processor capability and screen size, and IBM's JX project, emphasizing compatibility with the IBM PC, enjoyed limited success. The whole situation was felt by many to be hindering the healthy growth of the Japanese computer industry, particularly since domestic and overseas software vendors had to develop, test and support many different software programs to run on the many different kinds of personal computers sold in Japan. IBM developed the operating software DOS/V in Japan, and licensed it to other Japanese PC manufacturers. To promote the IBM PC architecture on which DOS/V worked, IBM sponsored a consortium which was named the PC Open Architecture Developers' Group (OADG) in 1991 and made public its internal architecture and interfaces. At the height of this enterprise, the consortium included amongst its members the major Japanese PC manufactures, such as Toshiba and Hitachi, and overseas manufacturers such as Acer of Taiwan and Dell of the United States. Together, they not only strove to develop a unified architecture, but also produced a number of DOS/V-compatible application software programs and participated in the major computer shows. By the time Microsoft's computer operating system Windows 95 had arrived in 1995, the IBM PC architecture, using DOS/V, was already a predominant force in Japan.

Van Loc worked as a policeman, police inspector and commissioner in his native Marseille for many years. He later wrote an autobiography about his career as a police officer and played himself in a television series based on his life. He created the first GIPN. He was nicknamed \\"le Chinois\\" (\\"the Chinese\\") despite his Vietnamese descent. Career Of Vietnamese descent , Georges Nguyen Van Loc was born in the Panier district in Marseille, in a working class environment. He spent his childhood in Marseille and he got his contacts with the future godfathers of the Marseille milieu, in particular Gaëtan Zampa aka Tany Zampa . Georges Nguyen Van Loc began his career in the police force in Algeria, at CRS 203 unit in Oran (created February 28, 1957), as a Peace Officer. He had already been in this country during his military service. Dubbed the \\"Chinese\\", he created in 1972 the first National Police Intervention Groups (GIPN) unit. Setup first in Marseilles, its purpose is to fight against organized crime or terrorism and manage crisis situations: madmen, hostages, escorts or riots. An anecdote among many recounts that, at the beginning of the 1980s, he and his team dressed up as nurses to arrest a drug addict who was holding his mother hostage, in a building in Marseille. The divisional commissioner Van Loc commanded the GIPN of Marseille for more than fifteen years and successfully handled the most difficult situations. One of his pride was not to have on his account any death on duty of the police officers in his teams. He retired in 1989. After writing autobiographical novels, from volume 1 Le Chinois in 1989 to volume 6 in 2006, he played his own character in the television series Van Loc, of which he was the main character from 1992 to 1998.

Role Due to the inherent dangers in the use of flight vehicles, national aviation authorities typically regulate the following critical aspects of aircraft airworthiness and their operation: * design of aircraft, engines, airborne equipment and ground-based equipment affecting flight safety * conditions of manufacture and test of aircraft and equipment * maintenance of aircraft and equipment * operation of aircraft and equipment * licensing of pilots Air traffic controllers, Flight dispatchers and maintenance engineers * licensing of airports and navigational aids * standards for air traffic control. Depending on the legal system of the jurisdiction, a NAA will derive its powers from an act of parliament (such as the Civil or Federal Aviation Act), and is then empowered to make regulations within the bounds of the act. This allows technical aspects of airworthiness to be dealt with by subject matter experts and not politicians.Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Library An NAA may also be involved in the investigation of aircraft accidents, although in many cases this is left to a separate body (such as the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in Australia or the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the United States), to allow independent review of regulatory oversight. An NAA will regulate the control of air traffic but a separate agency will generally carry out air traffic control functions. In some countries an NAA may build and operate airports, including non-airside operations such as passenger terminals; the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines being among such national authorities. In other countries, private companies or local government authorities may own and operate individual airports. History The independent development of NAAs resulted in differing regulations from country to country. This required aircraft manufacturers in the past to develop different models for specific national requirements (such as the BAe Jetstream 31), and impeded airline travel into foreign jurisdictions. The Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) was signed in 1944 and addressed these issues. This then led to the establishment by the United Nations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1947 which now oversees member states, and works to implement regulatory changes to ensure that best practice regulations are adopted.ICAO ICAO'S Aims A European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was created in 2003, with regulatory and executive tasks in the field of civilian aviation safety. It is not a national authority as such, and European Union members continue to have their own agencies.

March 6, 1976) was an illustrator of books and magazines best remembered for a series of covers done for The New Yorker featuring her invented Peabody family.  Early life  Mary Petty was born in Hampton, New Jersey to Robert Davison Petty, a law professor at the New York Law School, and Florence Servis, a schoolteacher. In 1922, Petty graduated from the Horace Mann School in New York City. She did not formally study art, but taught herself to draw.  Artistic career  Petty met New Yorker cartoonist Alan Dunn around 1925 and he encouraged her to sell her work. Petty published her first drawing on October 22, 1927, in the New Yorker, which itself was only in its second year of publication. New Yorker publisher Harold Ross gave Petty's cartoons his top grade of \\"AAA.\\" Petty's style was characterized by her \\"gentle satirization of New York City's Victorian era society.\\" Artist bio by Domenic J. Iacono for the Mary Petty Exhibit at Syracuse University She portrayed upper-class families in scenes of wealth and privilege. While somewhat satirical, her drawings were also affectionate. One family recurred in her drawings, to which she assigned the name \\"Peabody.\\" Petty was a naturally reticent person, and while her work began appearing in the lauded new magazine, Petty herself did not come to The New Yorker offices for some time and thus \\"for a long time nothing at all was known about her-- except that she regularly submitted a new and distinctive kind of drawing.\\"\\"Mary Petty and Her Drawings\\" by James Thurber. Originally appeared in This Petty Pace by Mary Petty (Knopf) and later republished in the Thurber collection Credos and Curios (Harper & Row). Even after becoming a part of the office scene, few knew her well. James Thurber said all he knew of her background was that she \\"was born in a brownstone house on West End Avenue. Her father was a professor. She did not have a particularly happy childhood. That's all, brother.\\"\\"Mary Petty and Her Drawings\\" Petty contributed to the New Yorker for thirty-nine years, publishing 273 drawings and 38 covers. Her last New Yorker cover was published on March 19, 1966 and showed elderly \\"Mrs. Peabody\\" pulling on a broken calling cord. Petty illustrated several books, including one of her New Yorker cartoons, published in 1945. Petty rarely took ideas from outside sources (only twice, according to Thurber). Roz Chast, a New Yorker cartoonist from a later era, is a great fan and proudly owns \\"an ancient book by that early, inimitable cartoonist\\" (along with \\"vintage Steig, early Helen Hokinson, and, of course, all of Charles Addams\\"; 39).  Personal life  On December 8, 1927 Petty and Alan Dunn (1900–1974) were married. They had no children.  Later life & death  Petty was assaulted and beaten by a mugger on December 1, 1971 and was found three days after the incident on Ward's Island. She never wholly recovered and died five years later at the Pine Rest Nursing Home in Paramus, New Jersey.

It is located near the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern Great Barrier Reef, 96 km due east nor east of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, and 450 km north of the state capital Brisbane. The island is part of the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands, and is part of the Capricorn and Bunker Group of island and forms part of the Capricornia Cays National Park. It is also part of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area.  General  One Tree Island is a rubble or shingle cay at the eastern end of a coral reef which is about 5.5 km by 3.5 km in size Vegetation consists of scattered velvet soldierbush and Scaevola taccada with several small groves of Pisonia grandis. A small pond of brackish water is situated near the centre of tile cay. A research station conducted by Sydney University is located on the cay. Geomorphology and landscape The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef.Hopley, D. (1982) The Geomorphology of the Great Barrier Reef – Quaternary Development of Coral Reefs. Wiley- Interscience Publication, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., New York The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day. Geologically the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period, they are mostly around 5000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plain on which today's reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago) the sea level began to rise, until it stabilised at its present level around 6000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays. One Tree Island is a Shingle cay and part of a Lagoonal Platform Reef:Fairbridge, R. W. 1950b. \\"Recent and Pleistocene coral reefs of Australia\\". J. Geol. 58: 330-401  History Discovery= In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship Albion was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group. During a second whaling voyage from England in the Albion he discovered the Bunker Islands off the Queensland coast.http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010163b.htm The Albion was 362 tons and registered in London, the ship was fitted with 10 guns, and a crew of 26; she was built in Deptfordand, Britain ownered by, Messrs. Champion; and used for general cargohttp://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei- McN01Hist-t1-b6-d23.html The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King RN initially in the Mermaid and later in the Bathurst. The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Blackwood in HMS Fly which was accompanied by the Bramble. The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board the Fly and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays. Current uses The island and reef are zoned for scientific research in a Zoning Plan under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, 1975 =Research station= One Tree Island Research Station which was established in 1976 and accommodates up to 20 visiting scientists. It is a strategically located facility with a long history of documented research relating to reef and cay environments, with particular relevance to research where the relative absence of human impact is important and valued as a scientific benchmark. The research station, operated by Sydney University, is located on a special lease over a small part of One Tree Island Research Station. The research Station provides basic accommodation. Three new buildings were constructed in 1987 to replace the former scientists' accommodation building, the resident officers' house and the wet laboratory/workshop/storage building. The fourth building, the main laboratory and station office, was constructed in 1983 and is cyclone- resistant. The new buildings provide comfortable living on the island, with timber-louvred windows, coral rubble and timber floors, screens and ceiling fans. Solar panels backed up by a 240 V diesel generator provide electricity to a 120 V DC battery bank and 240 V AC inverter for lighting and laboratory equipment. For cooking LPG powered appliances are used. The only freshwater supply for the island is rainwater which is stored in (rainwater) tanks. The station faced funding cuts in 1994.

In 2002 Fenway acquired the molding equipment and customer base of Premier Tile. The price for the acquisition was 8.25 million. The firm was founded in 1994 by Richard Dresdale (formerly Clayton, Dubilier & Rice) and Peter Lamm (formerly Butler Capital Partners) and has over $2 billion of capital under management. Since inception, the firm has raised three private equity funds. Fenway's first fund, closed on approximately $525 million of capital commitments in 1996 and just two years later, in 1998, the firm raised an additional $900 million of capital. As a result of several investments made in the 1998 fund, prior to the collapse of the dot-com bubble, performance in that fund was affected. Nevertheless, the firm was able to raise a successor fund in 2006 and 2007 with approximately $700 million of commitments from institutional investors. Investments Among the firms most notable investments are Targus, 1-800 Contacts, Coach America,Coach America bought by Fenway Partners . AltAssets, 2006 Riddell, Bell Sports and Easton. Targus Corporation Fenway Partners acquired Targus Group International, an Anaheim, California-based company, for the sum of $382.5 million on November 22 of 2005.http://www.fenwaypartners.com/uploads/news33.pdf During the acquisition of Targus, the managing director at Fenway Partners, Timothy Mayhew, was quoted saying; “Targus has many of the elements Fenway looks for, including a leading market position, a diversified revenue base with high barriers to entry, strong free cash flow and dynamic industry characteristics. Targus was the original creator of carrying cases for portable computers and have since expanded into multiple electronics accessories including; backpacks, locks, keyboards and keypads, privacy screens, to name a few,http://www.targus.com/ca/ and most recently with their acquisition of Sena, a high quality leather case maker, into the market of cases for smart phones. 1-800 Contacts In 2007, Fenway Partners acquired 1-800 Contacts, a vendor and distributor of brand name contact lens, located in Draper, Utah. The price set for the acquisition of 1-800 Contacts was at premium of 21% over the highest reported share value within the last year and 34% over the closing price within the last month. In total, the purchase price was valued at $340 million. On June 20th of 2012, Co-Founder of Fenway Partners, Peter Lamm, was quoted stating “We are very pleased with the outcome of our investment in 1-800 Contacts” after Fenway Partners sold 1-800 Contacts to WellPoint Inc., a health benefits firm, for a sum of roughly $900 million. Riddell Sports Group On July 7, 2003, Fenway Partners proudly announced their acquisition of Riddell Sports Group a sporting goods manufacturer. Riddell helmets are worn by more than 85% of NFL players, and in 2002 they released the first computer engineered football helmet in its efforts to help reduce concussions among athletes. As the leading manufacturer of football helmets, among other products such as pads and collectible replica items, Riddell posted revenues of over $100 million in 2002, the same figure for which it was acquired by Fenway Partners the following year. Bell Sports Bell Sports, a helmet and apparel manufacturer, was acquired by Fenway Partners in August 2004. Bell was acquired for an estimated $240 million.http://www.billboard.com/news/hot- product-1000611426.story#/news/hot-product-1000611426.story The purchase of Bell Sports, whose owner investors had planned to sell the company back in April, was powerful move for Fenway Partners as it planned to merge its newest asset with their recently acquired Riddell Sports Group.

New York Times, 2003 Mergers Riddell Sports Group/Bell Sports “This is a merger of strengths in a sense” stated Tim Mayhew, managing director for Fenway Partners, who acquired Riddell Sports Group in 2003, and Bell Sports in 2004. The purchase of Bell was very fitting in expanding Fenway’s market share in the sports industries. By combining both these industry leaders, Bell from action sports and Riddell from the football industry, the company will now have the largest research and development facility, based in Santa Cruz, California., geared towards head protection in the world. Combined, these companies will now be producing over 8 million helmets a year and is expected to earn revenues upwards of $300 million in 2004. CEO and president of Bell Sports, Bill Fry, was appointed to lead the combined companies’ management team due to his efforts in putting Bell back on top of their market, since he joined in 2001. Bill Sherman, Riddell CEO will remain in his current position as well as serving on the board of directors in regards to the company. Riddell Bell Holdings/Easton Sports Inc. Two years after the merger of Riddell and Bell, Fenway Partners were at it again by proposing a merger with their newest entity Riddell Bell Holdings and Easton Sports Inc. Easton is a sporting goods industry leader with departments spanning from cycling to baseball, hockey, motocross and even archery. In the past Easton has consistently earned yearly revenues similar to those of Riddell Bell and as a combined entity is expected to break the $600 million mark. Easton Sports Inc. was a subsidiary company of Jas D. Easton and its only subsidiary who was part of the merger. The head of Easton Sports, Jim Easton, was appointed Chair of the new combined entity. While the Riddel Bell merger earned Fenway a world leader in research and development in their fields, this merger created a behemoth in the sporting goods industry which will be “unsurpassed” stated Bill Sherman CEO of Riddell. Anthony Palma, who served as Easton’s CEO and president until 2008, said about Fenway’s new prized entity; “This company is now the number one baseball company, the number one football company, the number one in bike helmets, number one in snow helmets and the number one hockey innovation company. Yeah, there's a lot of number ones here. We like that.\\" Miscellaneous The firm was named loosely in reference to Fenway Park, but the firm is based in New York City and has no connections with the Boston Red Sox, Fenway Park or Fenway Sports Group.

Critiques From the Reviews= \\"Kelidar is the longest Persian novel written to date, and surely one of the finest. The present translation is of parts I and 2 only, which are sufficiently self-contained to make for satisfying reading and which also give a good idea of what the whole is like. (...) Doulatabadi's style is that of a traditional Persian storyteller, in that he constructs his tale in a linear fashion, speaks through an omniscient narrator, and uses a balanced mixture of narrative and dialogue.

Marquez was born in Zamboanga City, Philippines. Youth career Alfonso Marquez played for the high school team of Ateneo de Zamboanga where he was mentored by a Jesuit priest. He was later scouted by coach Eddie Gullas who convinced him to suit up for the Green Lancers collegiate team of the University of Visayas (UV). He came into wider public attention due to UV's upset 74-63 win against the Ateneo de Manila in an intercollegiate tournament in Manila in 1957. In that game, Marquez who was 19-years-old at that time is the third highest UV scorer accounting for 16 points for the Green Lancers. Club career Marquez joined Ysmael Steel Admirals in 1958. He won six championships as a part of the Ysmael Steel squad. An all-around player, he could play the center, forward and guard positions. He later played for MERALCO and Mariwasa during the 1970s in the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association. International career Marquez was a former member of Philippine national team. His performance playing with the University of Visayas gained the attention of head coach Baby Dalupan helping Marquez secure a place in the Philippines roster for the 1959 FIBA World Championship in Chile. Marquez has also suited up for the Philippines at the Olympic Games participating in 1960 edition in Rome and the 1968 edition in Mexico City. In the 1960 Summer Olympics, the Philippines placed 11th and in 1968, the national squad placed 13th. Marquez played a significant role in the Philippines' 63-60 win against South Korea in the play off for 13th place. Marquez contributed the most points for the Philippines in that game scoring 18 points while his Korean counterpart Shin Dong-pa made 16 points for his team. Retirement and later life Marquez retired from competitive basketball to focus on his family. He held a management position at the Kamuning branch of Meralco and later held a position in the government accounts department in the main office of the same electricity company. In his later years leading to his death on April 15, 2020, Marquez had been in frail health.

He worked for the Detroit Free Press from 1927–1966 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1955 for an editorial on the cause of an unauthorized strike by an autoworkers local that idled 45,000 Chrysler workers. Newspaper career Writer and editorial director = Born in 1901 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Royce Howes moved to Detroit and began a long career with the Detroit Free Press in 1927. He remained with the Free Press for 39 years until his retirement in 1966. Howes eventually served as the editorial director of the paper. In 1955, Howes wrote an editorial that was covered in other papers about the role of the newspaper in American society. He began with a dissection of the tangible things in a newspaper—paper and ink. But he concluded that news \\"is all things to all men. What it is depends on who is defining it. And it is YOUR definition, not the editor's, which matters.\\" Howes's colleague at the Free Press, columnist Malcolm Bingay, said of Howes: \\"My friend and colleague, Col. Royce Howes, knows a great deal about a surprising number of things that ordinary mortals never think about. That is why he is such a successful novelist and short story writer.\\" =Pulitzer Prize= Pulitzer Prize Howes received the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for an editorial published July 16, 1954, titled \\"An Instance of Costly Cause and Effect Which Detroiters Should Weigh Soberly\\". He also won the National Headliner Award for editorial writing. Howes's award-winning editorial concerned an unauthorized July 1954 strike by a local of the United Automobile Workers' union. The strike shut down production at Chrysler Corporation and put 45,000 Chrysler workers out of work. In awarding the prize to Howes, the Pulitzer organization noted that Howes's editorial impartially and clearly assessed the shared responsibility of both labor and management. The Pulitzer Prize organization found that > the editorial made a notable contribution to public understanding of the > whole program of the respective responsibilities and relationships of labor > and management in this field. Military service Howes also served in the U.S. Army during World War II, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and receiving the Bronze Star. He was an editor for the Army newspaper \\"Stars and Stripes.\\" AuthorBiographer of Edgar Guest= Howes was a close friend for many years of the prolific American poet, Edgar A. Guest. Guest published his poetry in the Detroit Free Press, and Howes served as Guest's long-time editor and eventually as his biographer. The Los Angeles Times said of Howes's biography of Guest: \\"His editor and longtime friend Royce Howes has written the biography Guest deserves ... Royce Howes has done a biography of a likeable and human man in not too adulatory a fashion; and it is readable.\\" The Yuma Daily Sun noted: \\"Hearty friendship and mutuality of association combined with author competence have produced a book which, in the most vital sense, will be of interest to all Americans.\\" =Crime novelist= In the 1930s and 1940s, Howes also wrote and published numerous crime novels, many for the \\"Crime Club\\". The \\"Crime Club\\" novels were popular in the 1930s and were described as \\"a mark which always signifies, if not a masterpiece of detective fiction, at least an entertaining one.\\" His crime novels include: * \\"Death on the Bridge\\" published in 1935 for the Crime Club. * \\"The Callao Clue\\" published in 1936 by the Crime Club. The Callao Clue is a shipboard murder mystery with a detective trying to solve the murder before the ship reaches port. The Galveston Daily News called it a rather ingenious and thrilling melodrama.\\" * \\"Death Dupes a Lady\\" published in 1937 for the Crime Club. One reviewer wrote the following about Death Dupes a Lady: > Mr. Howes rings the bell with a vengeance in this his fourth murder > thriller. It is five-star in every respect: the plot is grimly exciting ...; > the characters are rounded and full-bodied men and women ...; and there are > sparkles of humor, just a dash of spice, and the whole thing is excellently > written. Indeed, Death Dupes a Lady is the murder thriller pick of those > that have come this way this season. * \\"Murder at Maneuvers\\", a tale of sudden death in an army training camp, published in 1938 for the Crime Club. * \\"Death Rides a Hobby\\", published in 1939 for the Crime Club. The Los Angeles Times described \\"Death Rides a Hobby\\" as \\"an amusing mystery of how an amateur photographer finds death in his own lens. Another reviewer said: \\"This story, gently titled Death Rides a Hobby, shows camera fiends what their friends think of them, with a bit of humor, some ingenuity and even some finesse.\\" * \\"Night of the Garter Murder\\" published in 1939. * \\"The Nasty Name Murders\\", story about the murder of the Second Officer on a \\"hell ship,\\" published in 1939 by the Crime Club. The Oakland Tribune noted that Howes's recurring character, homicide Capt. Ben Lucias, \\"is always a pleasant mystery companion.\\" Another reviewer offered the following praise for Howes's latest work involving Capt. Ben Lucias: > You can't beat these murder-thrillers about Capt. Ben Lucias for good solid > workmanlike killing, catching and confessing. ... (Howes) misses no > opportunities, produces clues effectively, and runs them to earth with equal > satisfaction for all concerned but the murderer—he, she or they strike three > times here. * \\"The Case of the Copy-Hook Killing\\", published in 1945 for the Crime Club.

Although it is located closer to the eastern (Hong Kong and Shenzhen) shore of the estuary, it was until 2009 administratively part of the prefecture-level city of Zhuhai, whose main administrative center is located on the west shore of the river. The jurisdiction of Nei Lingding Island was handed over to Shenzhen in 2009. 内伶仃岛归属深圳市管辖 , sznews.com, 2009-09-26  History  In May 1513, the Portuguese explorer Jorge Álvares arrived at an island near the coast of China they called \\"Tamão\\". This was the first contact of Europeans with China via the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope.Construction of Lung Kwu Chau Jetty - Cultural Heritage Impact Assessment Tamão was fortified by Simão de Andrade and reclaimed by the Chinese during the expulsion of the Portuguese in the 1520s. Western scholarship, following J. M. Braga, generally contends that this \\"Tamão\\" is Nei Lingding, the main island in the mouth of the Pearl River, 6 km off the coast of the mainland. Recent Chinese scholarship finds this identification to be insufficiently proven, however, and suggests a number of other potential islands including the nearby and far larger Lantau Island. As of 1814 Nei Lingding (then romanized as \\"Lintin\\") was called the \\"outer anchorage\\" for European ships traveling to Canton (Guangzhou). They would have to stop at the island, have their cargo inspected and measured by the Chinese customs officials stationed at the island, and pay customs duties. In 1821, when the Chinese government prohibited importation of opium into the country's ports, Lintin became a base for drug smugglers; hulks of old boats, anchored near the island, served as warehouses and depots where imported opium would be reloaded onto smaller boats to be smuggled into Guangzhou and other ports. Edmund Roberts visited the island in 1832, and noted that there were \\"seven to eight ships\\" smuggling opium, including American boats. From the 1830s until the cession of Hong Kong in the 1840s, Lintin Island was the main base for British merchants in the Pearl River Delta area.\\"Shameen: A Colonial Heritage\\" , By Dr Howard M. ScottChina in Maps - A Library Special Collection The island was also a stopping point during monsoon season for ship repair. Ships would stay on the island upwards of six months. Demographics As of 1814, the population was estimated to be less than 60; in 1821, just under 2,000. When Edmund Roberts visited in 1832, he noted a population of approximately 5,000.

From about 1907 to 1914 she lived with her mother (critic Mrs Minnie Goodman) at Loughton in a house then called Hacienda, now Kilindini, Steeds Way, Loughton. In 1920 she married a dramatic collaborator, Kai K. Ardaschir, in London. She returned to the United States intermittently and in the 1920s permanently, and died on May 25, 1940 at the Medical Arts Center in Manhattan at age 55. She is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

Apparently unrepentant, he received 25 concurrent life sentences and is required to serve a minimum of fourteen and a half years in prison. His original sentence was life with a minimum period of 19 years 6 months, but this was overturned on appeal having been ruled excessive. After this and a similar incest case in Swindon in 2003, independent inquiries were set up to examine the way in which the case was dealt with by local authorities, the medical profession, and child help agencies. \\"British Fritzl\\" The defendant in the case was referred to as the \\"British Fritzl\\", \\"The Gaffer\\" (a name he called himself), or \\"Mr. X.\\" Because of a court order to protect his daughters and their seven surviving children his name has not been formally revealed: sufficient information was released for locals to know his identity and it was shared worldwide via forums for survivors of child sexual abuse, (often overlapping) mental health support for PTSD, and vigilante anti-paedophilia activists. Unlike in previous cases, no disclosure of police records or child protection files by corrupt (ex)-professionals who had worked the case was necessary for him to be exposed notwithstanding the injunctions. He was responsible for bringing about many pregnancies with his two daughters from the early 1980s until his arrest in 2008. Parallels were drawn between him and Josef Fritzl, the perpetrator of an Austrian incest case which had come to light a few months earlier. Prolonged incestuous abuse The man continued the abuse by frequently relocating his family to keep them isolated, keeping them out of school when they had any visible injuries, and threatening them with violence. The children's mother had left some years before due to the violence she endured. The sexual abuse began when the girls were eight and ten years old. The perpetrator would call their names in the middle of the night, and even smear \\"fake blood\\" on their doors while they were sleeping. He used threatening behaviour to enforce the abuse, including beating the victims and pushing their heads close to a gas fire so they were scorched if they moved away. He threatened to kill both them and their children if they told anyone of the abuse. All the children said he dominated the family. To begin with, the attacks occurred every day, then frequently every two to three days, with the one daughter babysitting while the other was raped. He continued to rape them while they were pregnant. His two daughters had nineteen pregnancies between them, including five miscarriages, five terminations and two children dying soon after birth. Seven of their children survived. He was said to have 'taken pleasure' from the harm he was inflicting, and the fathering of the children, despite the difficult pregnancies and deaths. If they took contraceptive pills, he told them to stop it and they felt they had to obey. The women's relationships with their current partners gave them the courage to come forward. Although the man at first denied the crimes, DNA testing confirmed that he was the father of the women's children. The women said that while his imprisonment gave them the knowledge that he could not physically touch them again, the suffering he caused would continue for many years and they now had to concentrate on finding the strength to rebuild their lives. Response of government and local authorities Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister at the time, responded to the concerns of MPs from Sheffield, including Nick Clegg the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and David Blunkett by saying he was \\"outraged at the unspeakable abuse committed\\", and any changes to the system that were needed would be made. The case had gone undetected by social services agencies, schools and hospitals, despite the numerous pregnancies, and despite the girls at times having unexplained injuries. Schools put facial injuries of the girls down to bullying. The victims had hidden from hospitals that the children were fathered by their own father. The man had previously been faced with reports of the incestuous rape of his daughters in a police complaint filed by their brother, but no action was taken by the police, as they considered the brother's word to be hearsay evidence that would not hold up in court, and because the girls would not say anything, due to intimidation. Family members reported their concerns to the authorities over two decades but nothing was done. Social workers stated that because the father moved the family so often, the girls had little opportunity to form close relationships with teachers, other professionals, or anyone else, reducing the chance of the incest being disclosed. They were known to social services in both Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire, but the abuse was not recognised. In 2008, the family doctor who failed to recognise or report the abuse was suspended by the General Medical Council. In summing up, the judge stated that although the phrase was overused, it was difficult to imagine a worse case; he had not seen a similar case in forty years of criminal law practice, with no action taken, in spite of obvious signs and agencies' suspicions, and that was why it was going to independent Serious Case Review into the failings of the local authorities and the police, to be conducted by Professor Pat Cantrill. Medical guidelines Doctors were said to have failed professional guidelines of the General Medical Council by not informing the authorities, and the handling of the case, together with the failure of institutions to share information with each other, breached recommendations following a review of another case of protracted incest four years before in Swindon. The family doctor who failed to recognise the signs had already been suspended by the GMC four years before, due to his falling below the minimum standard to the extent that he was exposing patients to risk. Before this doctor's suspension and subsequent departure from practice, the father would bring his daughters with the complications from their nineteen pregnancies and other injuries to him if they needed to see a doctor, even when they moved out of the area. The County Council's director of children's services said treatment of such cases was now handled differently from when the childhood abuse occurred. Child protection The case coincided with several other cases in the United Kingdom which highlighted possible problems with the efficiency of child protection services. Prime Minister Gordon Brown stated that the whole country was appalled at the crime and the many chances there may have been for the abuse – which continued for 28 years – to be stopped. The father was said by his sister-in-law to have been motivated in part by wanting to keep for himself the money paid to him by the state in child support for the numerous children. There were said to have been 150 opportunities for authorities to notice what was happening. For several months, the women tried to pay their father to stop him raping them by giving him £100 a month. They gave him whisky, hoping his drinking would lead to his death. They had called ChildLine, but the organisation was unable to guarantee that their children would not be taken from them, which their father had said would happen, so they ended the call.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 11th- century. It has marginalia and liturgical matter. The manuscript is quoted in edition of the Novum Testamentum Graece.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels with only one lacunae (Luke 23:31-24:28). The text is written in two columns per page, 25-28 lines per page.K. Aland, M. Welte, B. Köster, K. Junack, Kurzgefasste Liste der griechischen Handschriften des Neues Testaments, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York 1994, p. 54. The initial letters are written in red and blue. It was corrected by the first hand. The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, with their (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages. There is also a division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons (written below Ammonian Section numbers), and the harmony written at the bottom. It contains the Epistula ad Carpianum, Eusebian Canon tables at the beginning, lists of the (tables of contents) before each Gospel, liturgical books with hagiographies (synaxaria and Menologion). According to the colophon, the Gospel of Matthew was written in Hebrew 8 years after the Lord's Ascension, that of Mark was written in Latin 10 years after the Ascension, Luke, in Greek, 15 years after, and John 32 years after.Bruce M. Metzger, \\"Manuscripts of the Greek Bible. An Introduction to Greek Paleography\\", Oxford University Press, New York - Oxford 1991, p. 120.  Text  Folio 122 recto The text of the Luke 22:43-44 is transferred to follow after Matthew 26:39. The pericope de adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) is not placed in the Fourth Gospel, but after Luke 21:38. The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Caesarean text-type. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III. It belongs to the textual family – Ferrar Group. According to the Claremont Profile Method it is a weak member of the Ferrar Family. The manuscript was considered by Birch as the best of the Vienna codices.  History  Sambucus brought the manuscript to Vienna The manuscript is dated by the INTF to the 11th century. The manuscript was written in southern Calabria. According to Scrivener \\"the manuscript was written in Calabria, where it belonged to a certain Leo [i.e. Leo \\"Hamartolos\\"], and was brought to Vienna probably in 1564\\". The person responsible for bringing it to Vienna was Sambucus, the imperial librarian. It once belonged to Zacharias of Taranto. The manuscript was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Griesbach. It was examined by Treschow, Alter, Birch, Ferrar, Abbott, C. R. Gregory (1887), and Kirsopp & Silva Lake. Alter used it in his edition of the Greek text of the New Testament.Novum Testamentum Graecum, ad Codicem Vindobonensem Graece expressum: Varietam Lectionis addidit Franciscus Carolus Alter, 2 vols. 8vo, Vienna, 1786-1787. It was collated by Ferrar. J. Rendel Harris found some affinities with the Old Syriac version. Currently the codex is located at the Austrian National Library (Theol. Gr. 188) at Vienna.

It is a very complex species which easily hybridizes, resulting in numerous hybrids and cultivars brought into horticulture since the 1990s. The specific epithet microphylla, from the Greek, means \\"small leaved\\". In Mexico it is called mirto de montes, or \\"myrtle of the mountains\\". Description S. microphylla 'Hot Lips'Salvia microphylla grows to tall and wide, blooming in its first year and growing to full size in its second year. The leaves are ovate shaped, of varying sizes, and smooth or lightly covered with hairs. When crushed, the leaves have a strong fragrance, which has been described as pleasant and mint-like, but also as similar to that of blackcurrants, leading to the use of \\"blackcurrant sage” as an English name for this species.See e.g. It sometimes spreads underground, producing dense patches. Along with its cultivars and hybrids, S. microphylla blooms heavily in late spring and again in autumn, with sporadic flowering year-round in mild conditions. The flowers are arranged in whorls, with a wide range of color: magenta, red, pink, and rose. Taxonomy S. microphylla Botanist Carl Epling considered Salvia microphylla to have three geographical races, though the wide variation still causes confusion today, and there are conceivably more than three races. Adding to the confusion, Salvia microphylla is often mistaken for Salvia greggii, with which it frequently hybridizes. Epling distinguishes between the two by the S. microphylla leaves, which have serrated edges, compared to the narrow, elliptic, and smooth-edged S. greggii leaves — and by a pair of papillae inside the S. microphylla corolla. In the U.S. it is sometimes called \\"Graham's sage,\\" as it was named Salvia grahamii by George Bentham. It was also named Salvia neurepia by Merritt Lyndon Fernald. Both these botanic names are considered invalid as they are later than microphylla. There is also confusion between Salvia microphylla and Salvia lemmonii, which was named by Asa Gray. Later, Gray began calling it Salvia microphylla var. wislizeni, considering it to be a variety of S. microphylla, though most taxonomies still consider S. lemmonii to be a unique species. S. lemmonii has leaves that are long, which are furry and sharp-pointed, along with flowers that are often vermilion or magenta, with the inflorescence shorter than that of S. microphylla. var. neurepia. Cultivars and hybrids Some cultivars are hybrids with Salvia greggii (known as Salvia × jamensis) and other Salvia species; collectively they may be called \\"Mexican salvias\\". Technically they are evergreen shrubs or sub-shrubs, though they are not reliably hardy and are also short-lived. However, they are easy to propagate from cuttings.

On the same day, a half marathon is also held, and some years also feature a 5K run. History The first race was held on March 25, 2007 under the original sponsor-branded name ING Georgia Marathon. The race was acquired by US Road Sports in 2008. In September 2010, it was announced that Publix would be the new title sponsor for the race. In January 2014, Life Time Fitness acquired the race and operated the race in 2014 and 2015. On December 15, 2015, the race was acquired by Atlanta Track Club, who had previously operated the Atlanta Marathon until its final running in 2013. They have operated the race since 2016. For 2019, the race has been renamed the Publix Atlanta Marathon and the course has been changed. On February 29, 2020, a day before the Atlanta Marathon, the Atlanta Track Club hosted the U.S. Olympic marathon trials for the 2020 Summer Olympics. The course was different from the Atlanta Marathon—it looped three times so more spectators would line the course. The men's marathon trials saw Galen Rupp win in a time of 2:09:20, followed by Jacob Riley and 43-year-old Abdi Abdirahman. The woman's race featured the largest number of competitors ever in the US Olympic Trials Marathon: 450 women qualified for the race. After two hours of racing, the pack was led by Aliphine Tuliamuk, who pulled away to win with a time of 2:27:23. Just over her shoulder was first-time marathoner Molly Seidel. No other woman has qualified for the U.S. Olympic Team with the trials as her first marathon. Sally Kipyego finished third, edging out Des Linden and Laura Thweatt to make the team. Course 2019 course map From 2007 to 2018, when the race was known as the Georgia Marathon, the marathon course would start and end in Atlanta but also go into the city of Decatur. When it was renamed the Atlanta Marathon for 2019, the course was redrawn to stay within Atlanta. The 2019 course starts at ends at Centennial Olympic Park and, over of city roads, includes many landmarks, such as Georgia State University, Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, Edgewood Avenue, Inman Park, Little Five Points, Virginia–Highland, Piedmont Park, Georgia Institute of Technology, Mercedes- Benz Stadium, Morris Brown College, Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, 1996 Olympic rings, Georgia State Stadium, Grant Park and Zoo Atlanta, Cheney Stadium, Georgia State Capitol, and Oakland Cemetery. Invesco QQQ Half Marathon Atlanta Marathon Before Atlanta Track Club acquired the race and renamed it to Atlanta Marathon, it had operated its own race under the Atlanta Marathon name between 1963 and 2009, and continues as the Invesco QQQ Half Marathon and 5k, with only a Half Marathon and 5k race. The first running of what is now the Invesco QQQ Half Marathon was in 1963 at the North Fulton Golf Course, making it the oldest in the Southeast. The following year, the Atlanta Track Club was formed, and has run the event every year since. In 1966, Tim Singleton became director, and later founded the Peachtree Road Race. Fred Lebow ran in the marathon in the late 1960s, and later founded the New York City Marathon in 1970. Since 1981, this event has been held on Thanksgiving and was believed to be the longest of several turkey trots held on Thanksgiving across the country. In 2010, the full marathon only was removed with a new race date in October and with a new loop course, while the half marathon and accompanying 5km races continue to be held on the date. The Invesco QQQ Half Marathon and 5k continues as the largest half marathon on the holiday in the country. The Atlanta Track Club initially cancelled the Atlanta Half Marathon in April as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Peachtree Road Race was to have taken the Invesco QQQ Half Marathon date. However, by August, the Peachtree was also cancelled. =Course= From 1964 until 1980, the race had its beginning, middle, and end at The Westminster Schools campus, twice running a loop up Nancy Creek Road. Originally run on the weekend before Christmas, it was changed in the mid-1970s to be after the holiday. This was done in conjunction with the Peach Bowl, a bowl game held every year around New Year's Day, and it was renamed the Peach Bowl Marathon. In 1981, the race was moved to downtown Atlanta, and the date changed to Thanksgiving in late November. This move doubled participation in the race, renamed back as the Atlanta Marathon. In 1981 and 1982, it ended in Decatur. From 1983 to 1991, the marathon began in the suburban metro Atlanta town of Lithonia and going east through Stone Mountain, with the half-marathon beginning at the halfway point in Clarkston, and both ending in Atlanta's Piedmont Park after traversing Decatur, and the Atlanta neighborhoods of Inman Park and Virginia–Highland. This route was along the CSX railroad tracks, thus it was much less hilly than previous routes. On one occasion, the race was held for a train; on another, the train was held for the race. From 1992 to 1996, it began and ended near Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, running north on Piedmont Road (Georgia 237) to Peachtree Street, where it headed north and then back south. The start of the half-marathon was near the Chamblee MARTA station. From 1997 to 2009, about 90% was run along the same course used for the 1996 Summer Olympics, ending near Georgia State Stadium (built as Centennial Olympic Stadium in the A-FC stadium parking lot). The final loop course went through many major sites within Atlanta, including the Olympic rings. Since then, the half marathon course for which is the continuation of the original Atlanta Marathon starts on Capitol Avenue, with a turn to Decatur Street, Marietta Street, through Centennial Olympic Park, Atlantic Station, Piedmont Park, where the runners run the final kilometer of the Peachtree in the other direction, before jumping to Courtland, Street, Irwin Street, then returning to Decatur Street before a dash to Capitol Avenue and finishing inside Georgia State Stadium. PNC 10 Miler In 2011, a Atlanta Marathon was held in Atlantic Station with a marathon relay race part of the event. In 2013, a new 10-mile (16.09 km) race replaced the relay. On May 1, 2014, it was announced that the Atlanta Marathon would be dropped in favour of the ten-mile race and the five-kilometer race. The 10 Miler will still be held in 2020, however. It will be conducted at Michelin Raceway, 50 miles (80 kilometres) from Atlantic Station, as a four lap race, with the shorter race being cut to 2.54 miles for logistical reasons of conducting the event on a closed circuit. =Course= From 20th Street, the course proceeds to 16th Street, then to Northside Drive where it becomes Tech Parkway, then Luckie Street, followed to Baker Street. The course goes through the Georgia State Capitol, then Grant Park, then proceeds to Highland Avenue. The course follows through Virginia Avenue, then PIedmont Park, before heading through the Briarcliff area, then running down Lavista Road, Lindbergh Drive, and Peachtree Road before turning back to Atlantic Station for the finish. When the 10 Miler was added in 2013, the race started at Piedmont Park (16-mile point of the marathon course) and continued to the finish. In 2018, the course was changed drastically. The start and finish are both locate in Atlantic Station, the course started on State Street, then proceeded to 18th Street and Peachtree Road, running north (instead of south), with major turns at Peachtree Hills, Lindbergh Drive, Piedmont Avenue, the Botanical Gardens, 12th Street, Juniper Street, Sixth Street, and going on West Peachtree Street (in the opposite direction of the Peachtree Road Race), before returning to 17th Street, State Street, and to Atlantic Station. The 2020 10 Miler will take a drastic change. Because of COVID-19 restrictions, the event will be held at Michelin Raceway and be a simple four-lap race on the motor racing circuit.

The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition) pg 170-172 Dorling Kindersley 2005 While large Champagne houses such as Mumm, Moët et Chandon and Veuve Clicquot may use grapes from as many as 80 different vineyards in the Champagne region to create a consistent house style, Grower Champagnes tend to be more terroir-focused, sourced from a single vineyard or closely located vineyards around a village, and made with grapes which vary with each vintage.S. Pitcher, Grower-made Champagnes are an elegant alternative to big-house bubblies San Francisco Chronicle, December 16, 2004 Today there are over 19,000 independent growers in the Champagne region, accounting for nearly 88% of vineyard land in the region; around 5,000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes. Of the Champagne imported into the US in 2014, only 5% was Grower Champagne.Getting into Grower Champagne Wine Folly, December 31, 2014 Wine styles Grower Champagnes have been described as \\"artisanal winemaking\\" with terroir being at the forefront for each wine,A. Cortese, Champagne Beyond the Big Names New York Times, December 23, 2007 rather than an emphasis on a consistent \\"house style\\" that can be made year after year.P. Gregutt \\"Bottling Their Own\\" Seattle Times, December 23rd 2007 While large Champagne houses, such as Moët et Chandon may source grapes from the entire Champagne region, the vineyards owned by a Grower Champagne maker are generally clustered around a single village. Some growers will craft their wine to reflect the terroir of that village, especially if they own vineyards in one of Champagne's Grand crus. Grower Champagnes are often released younger than their large house counterparts due, in part, to the greater financial resources that would be needed for long term aging and storage. Many also show a lower dosage, and occasionally no dosage at all, than most negociant manipulant bottlings.

Recent vintages The 2011 vintage saw difficult conditions which created uneven wines. The 2009 vintage was warm enough to ripen the fruit, resulting full, fruity Champagnes. 2008 was an outstanding vintage, showing both high ripeness and high acidity. Sales market The popularity of Grower Champagne is a relatively recent phenomenon.J. Bonne \\"The Chronicle Wine Selections: Grower Champagne\\" San Francisco Chronicle, December 12, 2008 Since the 18th century, Champagne houses have dominated the business dynamic in the region. These private houses or negociants would buy grapes from the owners of several vineyards to blend and make Champagne.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 330-341 Simon and Schuster 1989 As of 2003, there were over 3,700 brands of Grower Champagnes available for purchase within France but only around 130 brands in the United States. As of 2008, these wines accounted for less than 3% of Champagne market, with that market growing as the wines continue to increase in popularity. Distributors and wine retailers tend to tout the comparative value and lower cost of Grower Champagnes versus the wines of larger Champagne houses, due to the larger Champagne houses' costs of mass market advertising. The smaller Growers leave it up to the importer and wine retailer to market their wines. Criticism A common criticism of Grower Champagnes is the potential for variable quality, especially from vintage to vintage. While the larger Champagne houses and negociants have the flexibility to buy grapes from all over the Champagne region, Grower Champagne makers are limited to only their vineyard holdings. Conversely, advocates of Grower Champagnes say that the blending of many terroirs by the larger houses makes those wines \\"underflavored\\" and non-distinctive. Vineyard lands There are over 19,000 independent growers in the Champagne region, accounting for nearly 88% of all vineyard land in the region. Around 5000 of these growers produce wine from their own grapes. The larger Champagne houses have holdings in only 12% of the region's vineyards, making it a necessity for them to buy grapes from independent growers. Under current Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations, there are strict limitations on planting. Some growers are seeing an economic advantage in making wine from their own grapes, especially if they have land in one of Champagne's Grand cru villages, rather than selling them to the larger houses where they become part of a generic blend. Identifying Champagnes A Grand Cru grower Champagne with the \\"RM\\" visible on the lower right corner. Champagnes can be identified by the initials that appear before a number on the wine label. The initials most commonly associated with Grower Champagnes is RM (meaning Récoltant-Manipulant) but there are other initials that may appear on the label. Other initials: *The initials NM (meaning Négociant-Manipulant) appear on the labels of large Champagne houses that source the majority of their grapes rather than growing them. *CM (meaning Coopérative-Manipulant) is a co-operative of growers who blend the product of their collective vineyards to sell under one or more brands. In this situation the individual grower may have some involvement in the winemaking process. *RC (meaning Récoltant-Coopérateur) is a wine sourced from a single grower but made entirely for him by a co-operative winemaking facility. While the wine is sold under the grower's own brand, he will often have had very little if any involvement in the winemaking process. *SR (meaning Société de Récoltants) is a registered firm set up by two or more growers who share the same winery which they use to make wine to sell under their own label. This designation differs from a CM in that the growers almost always have significant involvement in the winemaking process.

It overlooks the Ohio River. The land comprising the Abbott–Holloway Farm was first owned by Jonathan Clark, one of the early founders of Bethlehem in 1812. The primary building on the lot is believed to have been built in 1830 by Asa Abbott; records destroyed by the Ohio River flood of 1937 makes the exact date unknowable. When first built it was used as a store and post office, as Abbott was the postmaster for the town. Abbott is also believed to be the builder of the farm that also still stands. Due to fires and tornados, these buildings are among the few buildings constructed before 1840 still standing in Bethlehem; only two other houses still stand from the time.Thayer pp.8.1,2 After Abbott died in 1873, control of the town went to his widowed daughter Athenatia (Abbott) Ross. With her 1885 marriage to Missouri man Fleming Holloway, they and his children moved to the farm. During their time of ownership several more barns were placed on the property, but most of those structures were destroyed in a tornado during the 20th century. Upon Athenatia's 1899 death, Fleming gave up the house to his son Barnes Holloway, and moved to a smaller house on the property. In 1939 the farm was sold to Ira Church. Its modern owners acquired it in 1988 and turned it into a bed and breakfast.Thayer pp.8.2 The structures of the property include a main house, two sheds, and a privy. The main house is Federal two- story double-pile brick house with a one-story extension. It features a central passage, twin end chimneys, and side gable roof.

ETAN was founded in 1991 to support the right to self-determination of Timor- Leste. In 2001, that goal was significantly realized when the people of East Timor voted for independence. Since then ETAN has focused on building on its success in support of justice and self-determination in Timor-Leste and the surrounding region.  Profile  An ETAN 'die-in' reenacting, and in protest of, the Santa Cruz Dili massacre The human rights organization ETAN has a 20-year record of successful advocacy for the people of Timor-Leste and Indonesia. From the ETAN website: \\"The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN) was founded in November 1991 to support genuine self-determination and human rights for the people of East Timor in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1960 United Nations General Assembly Resolution on Decolonization, and Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on East Timor.\\" = History of Timor = Colonial Timor  A small country in Southeast Asia, comprising the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, the country of Timor has a history marked not only by the colonization common to Southeast Asia, but repeated violence against democratic and independence movements. Trade with Portugal began in the early 16th century. Timor's colonial history lasted over 400 years, from the Portuguese colonization of the mid-16th century, to 1975 - Imperial Japan having briefly occupied East Timor from 1942 to 1945. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975.  Indonesian invasion and occupation  Nine days after the 1975 declaration of independence, East Timor was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces and incorporated into Indonesia. The subsequent occupation (1974–1999) saw an estimated 102,800 conflict-related deaths (approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness). On 30 August 1999, in a UN- sponsored referendum, East Timor voted, by an overwhelming majority, for independence from Indonesia. Again, immediately following a vote for independence, violence was used to quash the democratic process of independence. Militias organised and supported by the Indonesian military commenced a scorched-earth campaign, killing approximately 1,400 Timorese and displacing 300,000 people to West Timor, and destroying the country's infrastructure. The International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to the country and brought the violence to an end. The United Nations took over administration for a transition period, establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate events of the occupation period.Chega!\\"even in the face of strong international demands to bring those who had killed unarmed demonstrators to account, the institutional practices of ABRI/TNI provided the majority of perpetrators who were most responsible with effective impunity.\\" Final Report of the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor (CAVR), on the Santa Cruz aftermath East Timor was internationally recognised as an independent state in 2002. Whereas Indonesia invaded East Timor by force, another form of occupation was bequeathed to Indonesia by the borders established by occupying imperial forces when they left Papua New Guinea. It remains split into the western provinces, Papua and West Papua, occupied by Indonesia and recognized by the world community as part of Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea 'proper'. Timor thus has resistance to Indonesian occupation in common with New Guinea.  Dili Massacre  A crowd of several thousand on its way from a memorial service to a nearby graveyard was attacked by 200 soldiers, killing over 250 funeral goers, in what was later called the Dili Massacre, or Santa Cruz massacre, on 12 November 1991. Although it was only one of many incidents of violence committed by the Indonesian military, and one of four mass killings - the other three being at Quelicai, Lacluta, and Kraras - its scale, timing, and press coverage made it a rallying cry for the independence movement and created supporters abroad.Santa Cruz Massacre Report, with video footage, of the cemetery shootings that left over 250 dead. It politicized many, and galvanized pro-independence East Timorese. A burgeoning East Timor solidarity movement grew in Portugal, Australia, and the United States. US ties with Indonesia were cut in 1991 and further in 1999, and not restored until 2005. = Formation of ETAN = \\"ETAN was founded following the November 12 Santa Cruz massacre of more than 270 peaceful protestors in a cemetery in Dili, Timor-Leste. The few western reporters present exposed the brutality of the occupying Indonesian military. ETAN was founded to support Timor-Leste’s right to self-determination and to end U.S. military and political support for the illegal occupation.\\" - ETAN website Demonstrations are a worldwide response, of which ETAN is a part, to the invasion and occupation of East Timor by Indonesia  Activism work  ETAN has co-produced the West Papua Report with the West Papua Advocacy Team since November 2007.West Papua Report In spring of 2007, East Timor held its first national elections since independence; civic groups in East Timor, seeking help in monitoring the election process, requested aid from ETAN, which formed the Solidarity Observer Mission for East Timor Observer Project in response. = Political positions = ETAN has actively supported independence from Indonesia, for the western provinces of New Guinea, since 2007. The 2005 bilateral Indonesia – Timor Leste Commission of Truth and Friendship, sponsored by the UN, in 2008 released its findings on what it called Indonesia's \\"organized campaign of violence\\" and \\"gross human rights violations in the form of crimes against humanity.\\"Indonesia regrets 1999 violence in Timor Firdia Lisnawati, Associated Press. Seattle Times, July 15, 2008 \\"Impunity continues for Indonesian perpetrators of the countless crimes against humanity in East Timor\\" - John Miller, ETAN ETAN welcomed Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's acknowledgement of the facts uncovered by the commission, but pointed out that there have been no repercussions for any Indonesian officials to redress what the commission called \\"institutional responsibility\\". ETAN opposed president-elect Obama's proposed appointment of Admiral Dennis C. Blair for Director of National Intelligence, saying \\"His actions demonstrate the failure of engagement to temper the Indonesian military’s behavior and his actions helped to reinforce impunity for senior Indonesian officials that continues to this day\\" Blair met with General Wiranto in Jakarta in April 1999, less than a week after displaced people taking refuge in a church were killed with machetes by militia members backed by the Indonesian military. ETAN addresses a wide range of concerns, including US policy in the Southeast Asia / Oceania region, oil and gas exploitation, reparations and accountability for past and present human rights violations. It supports the rights of the West Papuan people and the independence of West Papua from Indonesia. ETAN is opposed to the oil and gas deal: Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS), in the Greater Sunrise area. US national coordinator for ETAN John Miller wrote the Australian government, saying \\"Australia has put its own and some oil companies’ short-term financial interests over fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law, economic justice, and respect for national sovereignty.\\", although he also extended an olive branch by saying \\"It is true that under CMATS, Timor-Leste will receive a greater share of its resources than...(under)...the International Unitization Agreement.\\" ETAN eschews slogans. Its original mission was achieved in 2001, and much remains to be achieved in its current scope; its homepage is dedicated to the most recent issues affecting the southeast Asian area or the occasional endorsement from political leaders. = Order of Timor = In May 2012, the 10th anniversary of Timor-Leste's independence, ETAN was awarded the government of Timor-Leste highest honor, the Order of Timor-Leste (Ordem de Timor-Leste), for its work in support of the liberation of the country.ETAN Receives Highest Honor from Timor-Leste = Campaigning = ETAN is a non-profit organization which receives donations from the public. Based in the United States, its supporters campaign worldwide. :Between 1991 and 1995 the East Timor Action Network expanded from a tiny handful of people dispersed around the country to a dozen local chapters, doubling again in size over the next four years to include more than 10,000 supporters and a core of several dozen committed activists. In addition to establishing credibility in the progressive and human rights community, ETAN established a reputation as a reliable source of information for journalists, scholars, policymakers, and NGO activists. - Solidarity in an Age of Globalization: The Transnational Movement for East Timor and U.S. Foreign Policy, by Brad Simpson.

Murray's troops successfully repelled a series of French attacks on their hilltop position, causing Suchet to retreat. The action took place during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Castalla is located 35 kilometers north-northwest of Alicante, Spain. General Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington wanted to prevent Suchet from reinforcing the other French armies in Spain. He ordered, Murray, whose army had been built up to over 18,000 Allied troops, to accomplish this purpose. Murray's maneuvers were ineffective and prompted Suchet to lash out at his force. The French marshal fell upon a nearby Spanish force, beating it with heavy losses. Suchet then focused on crushing Murray. One of the British brigadiers, Frederick Adam conducted a rear guard action on 12 April, allowing Murray to draw up his army in a formidable defensive position near Castalla. On the 13th, Suchet's frontal attacks were repulsed with heavy losses by British troops under Adam and John Mackenzie and by Spanish troops led by Samuel Ford Whittingham. The French withdrew and Murray did not follow up his victory. Background Alone among Napoleon's marshals, Suchet won his baton by his victories in Spain.Ojala-Chandler (1987), 497 However, he avoided cooperating with his fellow French commanders and acted as though the provinces of Aragon and Valencia were his private kingdom. Even so, General Arthur Wellesley, Marquess Wellington knew that if Suchet's forces intervened in the battles in central and northern Spain, things might go badly for the British army. So Wellington requested that amphibious operations be directed against the east coast of Spain in order to keep Suchet's men occupied.Glover (2001), 270 Since the summer of 1812, an 8,000-strong Anglo- Sicilian force, joined by about 6,000 Spanish troops from Menorca, occupied the port of Alicante on the east coast of Spain.Glover (2001), 269 The army frequently changed generals but did nothing to contribute to the Anglo-Allied war effort. In February 1813, Murray was appointed to command the reinforced 18,000-man force. Prelude In early April, after making some indecisive maneuvers, Murray posted his small army at Villena, northwest of Alicante. Meanwhile, Suchet decided to surprise the British general and his Spanish allies. The French marshal split his force into two columns, sending one column under General of Division Jean Isidore Harispe to attack a Spanish force at Yecla. A second column under Suchet's personal command marched against Murray at Villena.Riley (2000), 339 On 11 April 1813, Harispe fell upon General Mijares and his 3,000 Murcians at Yecla. In a surprise attack led by the 4th Hussar and 24th Dragoon Regiments, the Spanish troops were routed, losing 400 killed and 1,000 prisoners. Two infantry battalions were virtually annihilated. The French admitted losses of 18 killed and 61 wounded.Smith (1998), 413 Murray heard about the disaster by noon that day. He immediately beat a retreat toward Alicante, dropping off a 2,200-man all-arms brigade under Colonel Frederick Adam at the pass of Biar to cover his withdrawal. On the morning of 12 April, Suchet captured a Spanish battalion at Villena and set out in pursuit of Murray. At Biar, the French came up with Adam's rearguard but were unable to overrun the well-handled force, which consisted of British, King's German Legion, Italian and Spanish elements. In a brilliant five-hour action, Adam successfully fended off his French pursuers, allowing Murray to concentrate his army at Castalla. In one incident, Suchet's cavalry raced after their enemies after flushing the Allied soldiers from Biar. But this attempt to turn a retreat into a rout failed when the French troopers charged into a neatly executed ambush by three companies of the 2/27th Foot. During the action, the French suffered about 300 casualties and Adam lost 260 killed and wounded plus 41 missing. The British colonel was forced to abandon two of his four cannons.Smith (1998), 414 Battle Frederick Adam performed well while leading a brigade at Biar and Castalla. Murray's army consisted of 18,716 men organized into an advanced guard, two Anglo-Italian divisions, two Spanish divisions, cavalry, and artillery. Adam's advanced guard consisted of 1,179 men in three battalions and various detachments. Lieutenant General William Henry Clinton's 1st Division numbered 4,036 men in five battalions. General John Mackenzie's counted 4,045 soldiers in five battalions. Colonel Samuel Ford Whittingham's 1st Spanish Division had 3,901 troops in six battalions, while General Phillip Roche's 2nd Spanish Division included 4,019 men in five battalions. There were 1,036 cavalry troopers in nine squadrons and 30 guns manned by about 500 artillerists.Gates (2002), 516 The strong Castalla position consisted of a castle-topped ridge that overlooked a deep stream bed. A spur projecting forward from the ridge tended to split any attack on the position. Further, a flooded stream protected the right of the Anglo-Allied line. Murray put Whittingham's Spanish division in a fortified position on the left flank. Adam's brigade held the left-center and Mackenzie's division held the right-center. The British commander posted Clinton's division on the right flank. Part of General Roche's division was placed in front of Clinton, supporting a cavalry screen. The remainder of Roche's men and the rest of the cavalry were positioned behind Castalla castle in reserve. Suchet had one cavalry and three infantry divisions available. General of Division André Joseph Boussart commanded 1,424 horsemen in eight squadrons. In the absence of General of Division Louis Francois Felix Musnier, General of Brigade Louis Benoit Robert led the 1st Division's 5,084 men in eight battalions. Harispe's 2nd Division counted 4,052 troops in six battalions, while General of Division Pierre-Joseph Habert's 3rd Division included 2,722 soldiers in four battalions. The French had 282 gunners manning 24 artillery pieces.Gates (2002), 516-517 Suchet planned to send Robert and Habert with their divisions at the center of Murray's line. Meanwhile, five voltigeur (light) companies would threaten the extreme Anglo-Allied left flank and Boussart's cavalry would envelop the enemy right flank. Harispe's division was kept in reserve. The French expected that a hard blow would send the Spanish and Italian infantry fleeing. Before the action commenced, Murray ordered Whittingham to shift his division west in order to overlap the French right flank. Accordingly, Whittingham began to carry out his instructions by putting his troops in motion and opening up a gap in the center.Gates (2002), 399 At noon on 13 April, the French troops surged forward. Robert's attack was carried out in five columns. On his own initiative, Whittingham ignored his orders and moved his division back to its original position. He detached one battalion to deal with the voltigeurs. Robert's three right-hand columns, together with the skirmishers, were repulsed by Whittingham's steady Spaniards. The two left-most columns came up against Adam and were likewise hurled back. In a short, close-range musketry duel, Adam's 2/27th Foot, deployed in line, inflicted 369 casualties on the 121st Line's attack column. Habert's advance was blocked by Mackenzie and Boussart's cavalrymen were unable to cross the flooded stream. With his infantry defeated, his cavalry off to one flank and his men outnumbered, Suchet found himself in a difficult spot. Murray proved slow to take advantage of his success, however, and the French were able to retreat almost unmolested. Suchet's rearguard ably defended the pass of Biar and allowed the French to get away with little additional loss.Riley (2000), 342 Results The Anglo-Allied force lost 440 casualties. Whittingham's men suffered 233 casualties, Adam lost 70 and Mackenzie lost 47. Suchet admitted 800 casualties at Yecla, Biar and Castalla, but this is probably too low. Murray claimed to have inflicted 2,500 losses on his enemies. A more likely figure is 1,300 French casualties at Castalla. Murray failed to benefit from his victory when he continued his retreat to Alicante. The next action in the theater was the Siege of Tarragona.Smith (1998) 425 Orders of BattleAllied Order of Battle= Murray's army counted 17,080 infantry, 1,036 cavalry, and 30 guns.Riley (2000), 340 It consisted of two Anglo-Italian and two Spanish infantry divisions, plus Adam's brigade.

The Council was responsible for creating the First Republic of Armenia in May 1918, the first independent Armenian state since the Middle Ages. Composition The Council consisted of 15 members, under the chairmanship of Avetis Aharonian. Although the Armenian National Congress was dominated by the Dashnak Party, to compromise with other political groups, the Dashnaks only took six of the available seats on the council.Hovannisian p.18 The original 15 members were as follows:Hovannisian p.18, footnote *Avetis Aharonyan (Dashnak Party), chairman *Aram Manukian (Dashnak Party) *Nikol Aghbalian (Dashnak Party) *Ruben Ter-Minasian (Dashnak Party) *Khachatur Karjikian (Dashnak Party) *Artashes Babalian (Dashnak Party) *Samson Harutiunian (Populist Party) *Mikayel Papadjanian (Populist Party) *Misha (Mikayel) Gharabekian (Social Democrat Party) *Ghazar Ter-Ghazarian (Social Democrat Party) *Haik Ter-Ohanian (Social Revolutionary Party) *Anushavan Stamboltsian (Social Revolutionary Party) *Stepan Mamikonian (Nonpartisan) *Tigran Bekzadian (Nonpartisan) *Petros Zakarian (Nonpartisan) Armenian independence In May 1918, the Transcaucasian Federative Republic disintegrated. It had governed the peoples of former Russian-ruled Transcaucasia, including the Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis. On 26 May, the Georgian National Council proclaimed the independence of Georgia and the Muslim National Council in Tbilisi followed by proclaiming the independence of Azerbaijan on 28 May. Since Armenians were at war with Turkey, the Armenian National Council was reluctant to proclaim Armenian independence, but decided it had no other option given the dissolution of the Trancaucasian Federative Republic, and the decision was announced on 30 May. This led to the creation of the Democratic Republic of Armenia.Hovannisian pp.30-33 Peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire The National Council then sent representatives to Batumi to negotiate a peace settlement with the Ottoman Empire, which was fighting the Armenians in the area near Yerevan. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship was signed on 4 June 1918. The treaty meant accepting territorial losses, especially in the provinces of Kars and Yerevan; a reduction of the Armenian Army; liberties for Muslims in the new state; and the right of the Ottoman Army to cross Armenian territory.Hovannisian, pp.33-38 Formation of a cabinet On 9 June, the Armenian National Council asked the Dashnak politician Hovhannes Kachaznuni to form a government. The Dashnaks wanted it to be a coalition with other parties, feeling they were too inexperienced to rule alone. However, no other party enjoyed anything like the same degree of popular support. The Populists, Socialist Revolutionaries and Social Democrats also quarrelled among themselves, making a coalition impossible, so on 30 June Kachaznuni was forced to nominate a cabinet composed solely of Dashnaks plus one non-partisan minister.Hovannisian, pp.39-41 Move to Yerevan On 17 July, the Armenian National Council moved from Tbilisi to Yerevan. This was a controversial action as almost one million Russian Armenians did not live in Armenia proper but in Georgia, Azerbaijan and the North Caucasus. However, relations between the Council and the new Democratic Republic of Georgia had deteriorated to such a point that the Council no longer felt able to remain in Tbilisi. Georgian officials snubbed the Armenian politicians as they left. The Armenian National Council and the Cabinet travelled to Yerevan via Azerbaijan, to avoid the Ottoman army. In contrast to the Georgian response, Azerbaijani officials gave the Armenians a warm welcome.Hovannisian pp.41-42 The Council becomes the Khorhurd Elections were impossible given the situation in Yerevan, so the Dashnaks, Populists, Socialist Revolutionaries and Social Democrats decided to transform the Armenian National Council into a legislature (\\"Khorhurd\\") for the new state by tripling its membership. As well as members of the four parties, it also included non-partisan Armenian politicians and representatives of minorities in the republic: six Muslims, one Yezidi and one Russian. The Khorhurd first met on 1 August 1918.Hovannisian, p.42 ReferencesSources *Richard G.

Ms. Bennett first visited the school site at Ngok Yue Shan in late 1965. As the government first requested an establishment of 24 classes in the school, Ms. Bennett then planned to set up four different subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce and Technical) to satisfy the government. Ms. Bennett retired in 1983.  The school name  The name originally proposed for the school was \\"St. Anne's\\", St Anne being the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary. But the Chinese members of the school organizing committee thought that the name is not good when translated into Chinese. After a long search, Ms, Bennett proposed the name \\"St. Catharine's\\", after Catherine of Alexandria, the patroness of young women, wheelwrights, attorneys, and scholars. She was considered to be a particularly appropriate model for a school which was to combine academic and technical education. St Catherine's feast day, 25 November, was considered a suitable day for school celebration.Joyce M.

Judith Simmer-Brown writes that \\"Vajravārāhī's iconography is very similar to that of Vajrayoginī, but she often has more prominent fangs and a more wrathful expression, and she prominently displays a sow's head above her right ear.\\" Although there are practices of Vajravārāhī in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, she is particularly associated with the Kagyu school and is one of the main yidam practices of that school. Her tulkus, the Samding Dorje Phagmo, are associated with the Bodongpa, a little-known school of Tibetan Buddhism. Iconography Vajravārāhī is one of the most popular female Tantric deities in all traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. Although there are several forms, the basic iconography is that she has one face, (usually) two hands and two legs, is usually red in colour, and standing in a dancing posture on a human corpse. The distinguishing iconographic attribute is a sow head (varahi) placed either on the right side of her head or on the top of her head. Because of this sow's head, sometimes she is called the 'two-faced' Vajrayogini (shal nyi ma). Incarnation lineages Vajravarahi mandala =Samding Dorje Phagmo= One tulku lineage associated with Vajravarahi is that of Samding Dorje Phagmo, who first manifested at Samding Monastery in 1717 in order to tame Yamdrok Lake, a sacred lake as well as a dangerous flashpoint for massive flooding events in Tibet. However, her effects were said to be more practical: as abbess of Samding, it is said that she stopped the invasion of the Dzungars, who were described as terrified of her great siddhi powers.

He worked primarily in economic botany but published extensively on plant biology, ethno-botany, insect-plant interactions and described several species. He published a two volume compilation on the plants of economic importance in the Malay Peninsula, collating local names and knowledge. He also wrote a detailed history of botany in India. The plant genera Burkillia and Burkillianthus were named in his honour. Life and career Burkill was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, he studied at Repton School and received a B.A. with Honours in Natural Science from Caius College, Cambridge winning the Frank Smart Prize. He then joined the University Herbarium at Cambridge as Curator from 1891 to 1896 during which time he obtained a master's degree. In 1897 he joined the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as a Herbarium assistant and became a principal assistant in 1899. In 1901 he moved to India as an Assistant Reporter on Economic Products to the Government of India. He worked at the Indian Museum in Calcutta under Sir George Watt who was the Reporter. In 1911-12 he joined as botanist on the Abor Expedition. In 1912 he succeeded H. N. Ridley as Director of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. He continued the work of his predecessor on the para-rubber and other aspects of economic botany but also reorganized the herbarium, collected specimens from across the region and worked intensively on vernacular names and local knowledge on medicinal plants. In 1935 he published his two-volume Dictionary of economic products of Malay Peninsula, ten years after his retirement which has been reprinted many times. Burkill also collected and compiled information on the collectors of specimens in the region. Burkill also worked in collaboration with the forestry department, conducting research on dipterocarps. Burkill married his cousin Ethel Maud Morrison in 1910. Their son, Humphrey Morrison Burkill, was also a distinguished botanist and also served as Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (1957-1969). Botanical publications Burkill conducted research on insect pollination and floral biology over the course of many years. He published a series of eight articles in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal from 1906 to 1916. He also encouraged other researchers in the region to study pollination including amateur botanists like Maude Lina West Cleghorn. Burkill applied evolutionary ideas to suggest values of adaptations. In his 1908 study of flowers along a ridge in the Sikkim Himalayas, he suggested that the preponderance of pendulous flowers in the region were an adaptation to protect the nectar and pollen from rain and in his 1952 Hooker lecture he suggested that yams had evolved underground storages to protect themselves from pigs and humans.   * Burkill also wrote a seven part series on the history of botany in India, published initially in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society and later as a separate book. This work covered the range of botanical workers in India and is an important source on the topic although there were some minor errors such as a mention of \\"Dapoli\\" in place of \\"Dapuri\\". Burkill similarly wrote a study on the history of the Singapore botanic garden.   * Awards and Distinctions * Honorary Fellow of the Association for Tropical Biology (and Conservation) 1963. * Linnean Medal in 1952.\\"Recipients of the Linnean Medal\\" (PDF).

Etymology The root of the name is the old Slavic word for fur, кърьзно, which can be transliterated as \\"kyrizno\\" or \\"kurizno\\" (\\"ъ\\" is the Slavic letter designating an ultra-short vowel, as for instance the \\"y\\" in \\"Katyusha\\"). The Polish word for furrier is Kuśnierz, also used as a surname, with similar words and names found in Serbian and Croatian. Through the Slavic fur merchants, the word was also adopted into Germanic languages and evolved for instance into the modern German and Swedish words for furrier, Kürschner and körsnär respectively. Yiddish is a language lexically based to a large degree on German, and therefore a Yiddish-speaking Jew living in Ukraine or Poland could relate to the local word for furrier both through the local Slavic language, as through his mother tongue. Variations There are many variations of the Ukrainian name Kushnir from all over Central Europe. In the west the name starts in Germany as Kuschner and variations of it run through the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary to Ukraine in the east and others.

Very often, those terms are confined to describe Hong Kong permanent residents who are culturally associated with Hong Kong, especially through descent, birth or growth in Hong Kong or other types of deep affiliations with Hong Kong, regardless of ethnicity or nationality. In legal terms, they are usually regarded as persons who are Permanent Residents () of Hong Kong and, depending on their nationality, are eligible for a Hong Kong SAR passport. The word Hongkongers was officially included in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2014. The majority of Hongkongers are of Cantonese Han Chinese descent and most of them trace their ancestral roots to the province of Guangdong. However, the city also holds other Han Chinese subgroups including Hoklo, Taiwanese, and Hakka. Meanwhile, non-Chinese Hongkongers such as Indonesians, Filipinos, South Asians, Vietnamese, Japanese, Koreans, and British also make up 6% of the identity population. Mainland China holds the largest number of Hong Kong expatriates. However, in the years leading up to the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, many Hongkongers emigrated and settled in other parts of the world. The largest Hong Kong diaspora are found in English-speaking countries. A second wave of mass emigration emerged during the 2010s as a result of the 2014 protests and the ongoing political crisis in Hong Kong. Cultural identity Hong Kong's cultural identity emerged prior to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. As a result, several major distinctions exist between Hongkongers and other residents from Mainland China; including in areas of language, judicial system, street naming system, culture, customs area, international border control, system of governance, direction of driving, social attitudes and values and legal currency. From 1841 to 30 June 1997, Hong Kong was formally a British Dependent Territory. English was introduced as an official language of Hong Kong during British-rule, alongside the indigenous Chinese language, notably Cantonese. While it was an overseas territory, Hong Kong participated in a variety of organisations from the Commonwealth Family network. Hong Kong ended its participation with most Commonwealth Family organisations after the colonization ended in 1997; although still participates in the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Commonwealth Lawyers Association. A poll from 2014 found that approximately 38 per cent of Hong Konger residents identified solely as Hong Kong citizens, 25 per cent identified as Chinese Hong Kong citizens, 18% as Hong Kong Chinese citizens, and 17 per cent as Chinese citizens.Hong Kong's Enduring Identity Crisis Veg, Sebastian, The Atlantic, 16 October 2013. The identity crisis is further heightened by demographic changes, in which Mainland China immigrants made up of a considerable portion of the migrant population post-1997. Some Hong Kong independence supporters reject the term \\"Hongkongers\\" as a subordinate of the Greater Chinese ethnic group, and attempt to define the concept of \\"Hong Kong nation\\" which is completely separate from Chinese nationality. Some of the major advocates are Hong Kong National Party and Hong Kong Independence Party. Terminology The terms Hongkonger, and Hong Kongese are used to denote a permanent resident of Hong Kong. Formally speaking, Hong Kong does not confer its own citizenship, although the term Hong Kong citizen is used colloquially to refer to permanent residents. The following aforementioned terms all translate to the same Cantonese term, Hèung Góng Yàhn (). The direct translation of this is \\"Hong Kong person\\"; however, the term Hongkonger is also frequently used. 香港人 may also be translated as \\"Hongkongan\\".Luk, Bernard H. K. \\"The Chinese Communities of Toronto: Their Languages and Mass Media.\\" In: The Chinese in Ontario. Polyphony: The Bulletin of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario. Volume 15, 2000. Start p. 46. CITED: 56 (Archive). In March 2014, \\"Hongkonger\\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary. According to the Dictionary, the term \\"Hongkonger\\" appeared in an 1870 edition of US newspaper The Daily Independent. The term 'Hong Kong Chinese' was used during the British colonial era, when the British residing in Hong Kong made up a greater percentage of the population. It was common at that time to refer to an individual as 'Hong Kong Chinese' to differentiate them from a Hong Kong Briton. Legal definition and right of abode The Hong Kong Basic Law gives a precise legal definition of a Hong Kong resident. Under Article 24 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong residents can be further classified as permanent or non-permanent residents. Non-permanent residents are those who have the right to hold a Hong Kong Identity Card, but have no right of abode in Hong Kong. Permanent residents are those who have the right to hold a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card as well as the right of abode. The Basic Law allows residents to acquire right of abode by birth in Hong Kong, or in some other ways. For example, residents of China may settle in Hong Kong for family reunification purposes if they obtain a One-way Permit (for which there may be a waiting time of several years). Unlike many countries, Hong Kong does not require applicants for naturalisation to take a citizenship or language test to become a permanent resident.; quote: \\"However, it has to be pointed out that the knowledge of the Chinese language is only one of the factors to be considered. This does not imply that applicants who do not know Chinese will be refused, nor will those who know Chinese necessarily be eligible for naturalisation as Chinese nationals. ... At this stage, we have no plan to institute examinations similar to those used by some foreign countries in handling naturalisation applications.\\" However, Hong Kong migrants and residents are assumed to understand their obligation under Article 24 of the Hong Kong Basic Law to abide by the laws of Hong Kong. Ethnicity and background According to Hong Kong's 2016 census, 92% of its population is ethnically Chinese, with 32.1% having been born in Mainland China, Taiwan or Macau. Historically, many Chinese people have migrated from areas such as Canton to Hong Kong, for example in the 1850s–60s as a result of the Taiping RebellionJohn Thomson 1837–1921,Chap on Hong Kong , Illustrations of China and Its People (London,1873–1874)Info Gov HK. \\"Hong Kong Gov Info.\\" History of Hong Kong. Retrieved on 16 February 2007. and in the 1940s prior to the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Thus, immigrants from Guangdong and their descendants have long constituted the majority of the ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong, which accounts for the city's broad Cantonese culture. The Cantonese language, a form of Yue Chinese, is the primary language of Hong Kong and that used in the media and education. For that reason, while there are groups with ancestral roots in more distant parts of China such as Shanghai and Shandong, as well as members of other Han Chinese subgroups such as Hakka, Hokkien, and Teochew, residents who are Hong Kong-born and/or raised often assimilate into the mainstream Cantonese identity of Hong Kong and typically adopt Cantonese as their first language. In addition to the Han Chinese majority, Hong Kong's minority population also comprises many other different ethnic and national groups, with the largest non-Chinese groups being Filipinos (1.9%) and Indonesians (also 1.9%). There are long-established South Asian communities, which comprise both descendants of 19th and early 20th-century migrants as well as more recent short-term expatriates. South Asians include Indian, Pakistani, and Nepalese, who respectively made up 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.2% of Hong Kong's population in 2011. Smaller groups include Americans, Britons, Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, Japanese, Koreans, Russians, Vietnamese and Thais. In 2011, 0.8% of Hong Kong's population were European, many (53.5%) of whom resided on Hong Kong Island, where they constitute 2.3% of the population.  2020 Nobel Peace Prize nomination  On 15 October 2019, Norwegian lawmaker Guri Melby announced that she nominated the people of Hong Kong \\"who risk their lives and security every day to stand up for freedom of speech and basic democracy\\" for the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020. Several months later, on 8 February 2020, eight U.S. lawmakers nominated the pro-democracy movement of Hong Kong to receive the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their efforts to protect Hong Kong’s autonomy, human rights, and the rule of law as guaranteed in the Sino-British Declaration and Hong Kong’s Basic Law. However, on 27 August 2020, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi cautioned against awarding the prize to Hong Kong protesters.

Sammy released a follow up to Rolan's Curse for the Game Boy in 1992, entitled Rolan's Curse II. Story Once the people of Rolan were terrorized by the evil ruler King Barius before he was imprisoned in a castle deep within the forest. When the king many years later was released he immediately unleashed legions of regenerating monsters on the citizens of the land. Now a hero (or two if you play it in multiplayer) is needed to defeat him and his minions. Summary Players have to defeat monsters inside the dangerous forests of the game. The game is shown in an overhead perspective. Like Nintendo's Zelda adventure series, the player goes from screen to screen and defeats enemies with a sword while finding items from monsters and treasure chests. The player is allowed two items at a time: one weapon and one sub-item; picking up a different weapon or sub will switch out the current one. In the beginning, the player starts with a sword but can find a fire wand that deals ranged attacks at the sacrifice of attack power. Other items include a hammer for breaking down barriers and a potion for restoring all health. The player can also pick up another of the currently equipped weapon to gain a temporary boost to attack power, or an armor jacket to raise defense temporarily. These temporary boosts return to normal after a level is beaten. More permanent power-ups come in the form of strength gloves and heart containers, which upgrade attack and defense respectively. This video game can also be played with another player if the two individuals link their Game Boys together while the game is inserted. =Controls= Rolan's Curse uses the Game Boy's directional pad for cardinal movement, while the \\"B\\" and \\"A\\" buttons are used to activate the first and second item slots respectively. The \\"START\\" button calls up the stats menu where the player can see how strong they are; as well as the password required to continue the game upon power-off. The crystal bracelet can be charged by holding down the \\"A\\" button and releasing for a similar attack to the wand's. The \\"SELECT\\" button is unused. =Graphics= The game's visuals are built with graphic tiles, extending the play field beyond the current view. When the player walks to the edge of the screen, the view adjusts to next set of tiles that represent a new area. Because of the sprite limitations of the hardware, Rolan's Curse's artists opted for a Japanese super deformed (SD) approach to the style. =Enemies= There are 19 different kinds of enemies in the game; not including bosses. They include zombies, skeletons, knights, wizards, bats, and spiders.Enemy sprites of Rolan's Curse =Save system= The Rolan's Curse cartridge has no internal save battery. The game relies on a password system that can be viewed from the menu and executed when the player picks \\"CONTINUE\\" from the title screen. The game updates the current password every time a new item is in inventory, a new upgrade has been found, and when the next level's map is reached. Reception Nintendo Power gave Rolan's Curse a 78/100 score.Rolan's Curse NP synopsis(Nintendo Power) While many players found the game to be fun, likening it to the Zelda series, a common complaint is the quest's brevity.

Background and development of events In 1810, the May Revolution had forced the Spanish to abandon Buenos Aires, but they held on to the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay), as Spain moved the headquarters of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata to Montevideo. At the beginning of April 1811, the revolutionary José Gervasio Artigas returned to the Banda Oriental with approximately 180 men provided by the Government of Buenos Aires. On April 11, he issued the Mercedes Proclamation, assuming control of the revolution. The Governor of Montevideo, Francisco Javier de Elío, appointed frigate-captain at the head of the forces loyal to Spain. Posadas installed his headquarters at San Isidro Labrador de Las Piedras near Montevideo, to provoke a decisive battle against the revolutionaries. Meanwhile, José Artigas was camped near Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe with an army of a thousand men. The army of Posadas counted 1230 men, of which some 200 would defect to Artigas in the midst of battle. The battle was fought on May 18 at Las Piedras and resulted in a total victory for the revolutionaries. José Posadas capitulated. It was at this occasion that Artigas pronounced his famous sentence \\"Curad a los heridos, clemencia para los vencidos\\" (Cure the injured, mercy to the vanquished), an unusual decision in those times, referring to the Spanish wounded and prisoners. One of the casualties on the revolutionary side was Manuel Artigas, nephew of José Artigas. Both armies fought in the name of King Ferdinand VII of Spain. The Battle of Las Piedras by Diógenes Hequet  Importance of the battle  Some historians consider the victory in the Battle of Las Piedras as crucial for the survival of the revolution in Uruguay and Argentina, after the defeats of General Manuel Belgrano in Paraguay and Paraná. After the battle, the Royalists only remained in control of Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo, which was finally taken by Carlos María de Alvear on June 20, 1814. The day of the battle, May 18, is now an official holiday in Uruguay.

In 1849 Thomas McKay, who would become first mayor of Prince Albert and a prominent territorial politician, was born at Fort Pelly. The second fort Fort Pelly was moved to in 1856. This move, to approximately one quarter mile southeast of the original position, was due to problems with occasional flooding at the old location. The old fort was however still used in some capacity until at least 1859. On July 15, 1870, the Hudson's Bay Company surrendered its lands to Canada, while retaining its posts and some land immediately surrounding them. The fort was now located on block 17 of the Fort Pelly Reserve. Around 1871 Fort Ellice succeeded Fort Pelly as district headquarters. In 1909 the Canadian Northern Railway was built 6 miles north of Fort Pelly, and trade at the fort all but ceased, and it was abandoned in June, 1912. Current status During the summers of 1971 and 1972, the former fort sites were excavated by the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History, at which time all known buildings were located, and 7,000 objects were recovered. The first Fort Pelly site was designated a Historic Site by the Province of Saskatchewan in 1986 and is operated by the Saskatchewan Parks Service. The site of the second fort was purchased by the Fort Pelly Historical Society and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1953.

It was located on the Sacramento River east-southeast of Knights Landing, at an elevation of 26 feet (8 m). History The area was settled by Jonas Spect on March 22, 1849, one half of a mile below the merging of the Feather River into the Sacramento River. Lt. George H. Derby wrote about the town on his report to the Secretary of War in 1849 and stated, \\"The Town of Vernon is situated at the junction of the Feather and Sacramento Rivers, and that of Fremont immediately opposite. Each contains some twenty houses and one or two hundred inhabitants.\\" Spect chose to settle at this site because of the potential business benefits of being upriver. Mexican law entitled people to a three league town if they would start a ferry service, which Spect then began. He hired John I. McCaughn to survey his three league town soon after he started his ferry business. The town was named after John C. Frémont, who had risen to public notoriety only three years beforehand. During the Municipal Election of October 1, 1849, there were around 300 voters in the area. On April 5, 1850, the town received its first post office, the Fremont Post Office, and the title of county seat. Severe floods during the previous winters foreshadowed the fall of the city. These floods allowed for travel upriver and led to the founding of Marysville, closer to the mines. A legal battle for land rights between Spect and James Madison Harbin didn't help assuage fears of the townspeople. In 1851 the town of Fremonts Landing was disbanded; people moved out and took the town's buildings with them. Washington became the county seat on June 30, 1851. Very few citizens stayed in the area, with only three voters in the September 1855 general election. The post office was also closed, then opened again in the same year. The post office closed its doors permanently in November 1864. In 1870 the town had one house left.

The episode was directed by Matt Shakman.Ugly Betty Playbill.comDecember 19, 2008 Plot The day begins with Betty helping Hilda, Justin and Ignacio decorating the Suarez home as they celebrate the relaunch of \\"Hilda's Beautilities.\\" Betty agreed to help out Hilda with filling out gift baskets and other goodies, believing it would not interfere with her work and her studies at YETI. At work Daniel and Wilhelmina addressed the \\"MODE\\" staff that they landed Keira Knightley for an April shoot and just ordered a Halston dress for her to wear on the cover. The two also warned that this info must not be leaked out to the competition. In addition Betty is tasked by Daniel to pick up the dress. But it looks like Betty might have spoken too soon as she tried to juggle work and family without much success as she struggles to impress her idol, Jodie Papadakis (Bernadette Peters), the editor running YETI, this after Jodie asked Betty where she was when Betty was supposed to be at a gathering the evening before. And when Betty told her she was helping her sister, Jodie didn't like that answer. Jodie then gave the students their assignment, which was to gather 40 contacts through social networking (no family members), and warned them if they don't complete this, then don't bother returning to YETI. So with help from Marc and Amanda, albeit reluctant, Betty does gets some good tips, even after Marc and Amanda abandon her at a local bar, where she succeeds, despite passing on helping Hilda again that same evening, leaving Hilda disappointed. Things go from bad to worse when she encounters Teri O'Shaughnessy (guest star Nikki Blonsky), an assistant at ELLE magazine, just as the long-running Mode/ELLE rivalry heats up. As Betty and Teri exchange cards, the two made small talk about each other, but when Betty went to the bathroom Teri eyes her Blackberry that was left on the table and managed to scoop enough info for ELLE. Thanks to Teri, not only does she gets Knightley for ELLE, but also steals the dress for their party by using Betty's name. This makes Wilhelmina furious and Daniel somewhat upset, so they call out their rivals at ELLE over their sabotaging tactics. Luckily, Betty recalled who Teri said was catering the ELLE party that evening, and got the caterer to sneak her and Marc in to steal back the dress, just in time to escape the clutches of Teri after she spots the two. Arriving with the adorned dress at Wilhelmina's party, Betty gets invited in and has the opportunity to rub elbows with the fashion elite. When Jodie spots Betty (as she was looking at her cellphone message from Hilda), Jodie told her that she was surprised to see Betty at an event like this and told that didn't have to worry about being kicked out of YETI. Unfortunately, after Jodie left, Betty learned that Hilda left several more messages on her phone and when she answered it, she raced over to the hospital, where Hilda told Betty that Ignacio had a heart attack. Meanwhile, Daniel and Wilhelmina's feelings over Molly and Connor respectively continues to take center stage, with Wili showing Daniel the security footage of his almost-kiss with Molly and encourages him to follow his heart, which Wilhelmina uses as a ploy so she can pick up the pieces of Connor's. At first, it doesn't seem like the plan will work since Molly (who told Daniel that she and Connor had been engaged for four years) reacts to Daniel's revelation of his feelings by leaving Wilhelmina's party upset. But she later shows up on Daniel's steps, saying she's dumped Connor. She and Daniel consummate that almost-kiss from long ago. Likewise with Connor after he looked very susceptible and admiring of Wilhelmina at the party, then makes a huge surprise by going to her home later and kissing her.

In this universe, Larcen Tyler found out earlier that the package he was to send to the hospital by Mr. Tagilani was a bomb. He disposed of the bomb, resulting in it not killing the police chief of Chicago, people in the hospital and Larcen himself.

While in hiding, the police order Larcen to become a police informant and ask for Larcen to clean up the streets of Chicago in exchange for information about Tagliani's current whereabouts. Reception Tommy Glide of GamePro gave the game a mostly negative review, remarking that \\"the slow pace, small sprites, and awkward controls keep your quest dull and frustrating.\\" He also criticized the enemies' lack of aggressiveness.

Design Designed to traverse difficult terrain, the Bronco has a ground pressure of 60 kPa and is fitted with heavy-duty seamless rubber tracks and a running gear system for soft ground conditions and directional stability. Swimming operations require minimal preparation and it can achieve a swimming speed of 5 km/h. The Bronco's four-sprocket drive, fully articulated steering with optional differential lock provides for small turning radius manoeuvres and improved performance. The Bronco has a load carrying capacity of up to 5 tonnes and is capable of a top speed of on the road and at least on cross- country terrain.

Warthog's repair and recovery variant is fitted with a crane and winch, and has the capability to tow another 18-tonne Warthog vehicle back from the front line. Once delivered to the UK, contractor Thales fitted the vehicles according to MoD specifications with communications systems, specialist counter-measure equipment and extra protective armour at their facility in the former MoD depot at Llangennech near Llanelli, South Wales.

Operating on a 4 men crew, the MTC's primary weapon is the ST Kinetics 120mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS), the world's first recoiled mortar to incorporate a blast diffuser,\\"Lethality on the Modern Battlefield\\" , RUSI Defence Systems, 2004 greatly reducing the blast overpressure effect generated by mortars, thus allowing longer periods of firing without injuring the crew. The MTC has a built-in Automatic Fire Control System (AFCS) comprising a Fire Control Unit and an Inertial Navigation System, allowing it to conduct immediate deployment without conventional surveying methods. A hydro-pneumatic Recoil System reduces the overall recoil force, thus allowing minimal reinforcement of the original hull structure, and post-firing stabilising time. This increases the rate of firing with improved accuracy. The AFCS is also equipped with a Mortar Platoon Management System (MPMS), which enables it to be networked via the Battlefield Management System (BMS).

It is housed in the Pinacoteca di Brera of Milan, where it was deposited by Napoleon. The work, of a type known as a sacra conversazione, was commissioned by Federico III da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, to celebrate the birth of Federico's son, Guidobaldo. According to other sources, it would celebrate his conquest of several castles in the Maremma. Dating The painting was executed between 1472 and 1474; the terminus ante quem is established by the absence from Federico's figure of the insignia of the Order of the Garter, which he received in the later year. When it was rediscovered at the Brera at the end of the 19th century, the painting was so disfigured by darkened varnish it was attributed to Fra Carnevale (Bartolomeo di Giovanni Corradini), as Piero's use of oil technique was not yet known.Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, 2002. Piero della Francesca, p.266. Some sources suggest that the work was commissioned to celebrate the birth of Federico's son, Guidobaldo, who was born in 1472. According to this hypothesis, the Child could represent Guidobaldo, while the Virgin may have the appearance of Battista Sforza, Federico's wife, who died in the same year and was buried at San Bernardino. Description The work represents a sacred conversation, with the Virgin enthroned and the sleeping Child in the middle, surrounded by a host of angels and saints. On the right low corner, kneeling and wearing his armor, the patron of arts, duke and condottiero Federico da Montefeltro. Federico's choice of wearing armor had not been observed in other donor paintings of the past century. The donning of armor here signifies his military prowess and devotion to protect his faith, a new concept for presenting in armor when in a holy presence. The background consists of the apse of a church in Renaissance classical style, which is rendered in such meticulous perspective that the feigned depth of the coffer-vaulted apse at the rear can be calculated.E.g. by Lavin 2002:270f. At the center, hanging by a thread from the apse shell is an egg, emblem alike of Mary's fecundity and the promise of regeneration and immortality.Noted, e.g. by Lavin 2002:271f. The Child wears a necklace of deep red coral beads, a color which alludes to blood, a symbol of life and death, but also to the redemption brought by Christ. Coral was also used for teething, and often worn by babies. The saints at the left of the Madonna are generally identified as John the Baptist, Bernardino of Siena (dedicatee of the painting's original location) and Jerome; on the right would be Francis, Peter Martyr and Andrew.Lavin 2002 suggests John the Evangelist. In the last figure, the Italian historian Ricci has identified a portrait of Luca Pacioli, a mathematician born in Sansepolcro like Piero della Francesca. The presence of John the Baptist would be explained as he was the patron saint of Federico's wife, while St. Jerome was the protector of Humanists. Francis, finally, would be present as the painting was originally thought for the Franciscan church of San Donato degli Osservanti, where Federico was later buried. Modern cleaning has revealed the great detail in characters' clothes, the angels' jewels, Federico's reflective armor and the oriental carpet beneath the feet of the Virgin, reflecting the influence of Early Netherlandish painting. The apse ends with a shell semi- dome from which an ostrich egg is hanging. The shell was a symbol of the new Venus, Mary (in fact it is perpendicular to her head) and of eternal beauty. According to another hypothesis, the egg would be a pearl, and the shell would refer to the miracle of the virginal conception (the shell generates the pearl without any male intervention). The egg is generally considered a symbol of the Creation and, in particular, to Guidobaldo's birth; the ostrich was also one of the heraldic symbols of the Montefeltro family. According to Italian art historian Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti, the work has been cut down on both sides,Lavin 2002 reports the loss at the right side and loss of floor at the base. as shown by the portions of entablatures barely visible in the upper corners.

In 1558 the manor at Bodbrane was held by John Arundel. However, in 1814, it was recorded that: :The manor of Bodbrane, which belonged to the Arundells of Lanherne, is now the property, by a late purchase, of Mr. Joseph Grigg. =John Grigg= In 1854, John Grigg became a notable émigré from Bodbrane. According to the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography: :His father died when John was about 16 or 17, and on inheriting the property, Bodbrane, he became responsible for providing for his stepmother and siblings. He had met and fallen in love with Martha Maria Vercoe; when she emigrated to New Zealand with her family, John Grigg decided to follow. After two years of negotiations he sold Bodbrane, and left for Australia on the Blackwall in 1854, arriving in New Zealand before the end of the year. Grigg began farming in New Zealand at Longbeach (south of Christchurch) and his family farm the same estate to this day. In 1882, Longbeach farm supplied some of the first shipment of frozen meat to England.

When Taiping's Western Army was defeated at Wuhan, they lost their connection with their capital of Nanjing. Former Western Army Commander Chen Yucheng then decided to resupply at Guanzhong. Some of their soldiers were troops who once fought for the Nian Rebellion, so Yucheng decided not to provide them with supplies, as he was uncertain of their loyalty.  Background  On August 22 the Xianfeng Emperor of the Qing Dynasty died at age 30. Gen. Guan Wen ordered the stationary Green Standard Army, consisting of 500,000 men, to move to Eastern Henan to guard the capital at Beijing. However, the campaign began to look like an ambush to Chen. His uncle Chen Decai did not obey Chen's orders. In November Chen Decai directed an offensive in southern and western Henan that he easily won. The attack created a long front for the Taiping Western Army. At the time Chen Yucheng commanded only the remaining 50,000 of the Taiping Western Army and guarded its tail, but was surrounded by the 150,000-strong Qing army in Hefei. When Chen Decai discovered it had been a trick he went back to save Chen Yucheng, but was too late. Chen Yucheng and his entire force were destroyed in May 1862.  Battle of Anqing  The Battle of Anqing was intense and ended on September 5. Its loss cost the Western Army 90,000 men and severely affected their morale. Chen Yucheng believed that they could recover Anqing in a short time, but his generals disagreed. = Death of Hu Linyi= News of the death of the Xianfeng Emperor encouraged the Governor of Hubei, Hu Linyi, to attempt the recovery of Anqing for Qing. However, he died on September 30. This was good news for Chen Yucheng, because Hu Linyi was the most formidable of his enemies. = Fatigue = An important factor in the actions of the Western Army was their own fatigue after so many years of fighting. A series of defeats damaged troop morale, and so an escape from the fighting was desired. However, the supply of soldiers and food could have just been an excuse by Chen Yucheng.  Taiping's third and last western offensive  The Taiping army had been raised three times in large-scale western offensives. The first was in Hunan and Hubei in 1853, led by Qin Rigang, Shi Dakai and Lai Hanying, with an army of over 300,000. The second offensive took place in Wuhan in 1855, led by Wei Jun, Chen Yucheng and Yang Fuqing; this offensive was the largest, with over 700,000 troops. The final was the Battle of Guanzhong in 1861.

He enlisted in Reichswehr (German Army) in 1929 and was then transferred into the SS-VT in 1935. His SS service number was 257,323 and his NSDAP number was 147,126. In September 1935 he joined the SS Pioneer Battalion. By October 1939 Seela had been given command of a company in the pioneer battalion of the SS Division Totenkopf. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd class, in May 1940 and the Iron Cross, 1st class, in June 1940. He took part in the invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa) and was awarded the German Cross in Gold in December 1941. Seela was awarded the Knight's Cross in May 1942, while he was a Hauptsturmführer (captain) and in command of 3rd Company, SS Pioneer Battalion Totenkopf. Despite severe losses and meager supplies, his unit occupied the Russian village of Korowitsch (east of Staraya Russa) in the Demyansk Pocket for one month. Seela and his men prevented the village from being recaptured, denying the Soviet Army access to the crucial bridge over the Lovat River. In July 1942, Seela was given command of the 3rd SS Pioneer Battalion Totenkopf until April 1944 when he was appointed commander of the II SS Panzer Corps Pioneers.

Following the election, BdL joined the Czechoslovak government. Spina became a national minister. After having entered the government the party began cooperation with the Czechoslovak agrarians. In the 1929 election, the BdL parliamentary presence was halved. The party got 12 seats, having got 4% of the national vote. After the DNP and DNSAP had been banned in October 1933, the political atmosphere in Sudetenland changed. The BdL came under pressure from rightwing radicals in Landjugend, and formed a movement called Landstand led by Gustav Hacker (the leader of Landjugend). Landstand was formed with the intention of enabling cooperation with the Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront (SHF). Through the creation of Landstand, it is possible that BdL sought to pre-empt competition from SHF in the Sudetenland countryside. BdL hoped to achieve a division of labour between Landstand and SHF, thinking that SHF would mobilize urban populace and BdL/Landstand would retain their dominance over rural German politics. These overtures to the SHF caused rifts in the Czechoslovak government. The DSAP (German Social Democrats), who were also in the government, were particularly worried and called upon BdL to differentiate themselves from 'the fascists'. In the end, BdL was side-lined as the Czechoslovak agrarians began to cooperate directly with SHF. Landstand became a short-lived movement.Capoccia, Giovanni. Defending Democracy: Reactions to Extremism in Interwar Europe. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005. pp. 83-85 In the 1935 election, BdL gathered 1.7% of the national vote. The party got five parliamentary seats. The party suffered badly from the competition from the Sudeten German Party (SdP), the new incarnation of SHF. After the election, BdL began to reorient itself towards cooperation with democratic forces, declaring their support to Edvard Beneš as president just before the election. But the party suffered continuously from defections from its ranks.Capoccia, Giovanni. Defending Democracy: Reactions to Extremism in Interwar Europe. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005. pp. 86-88 In the new scenario, BdL was divided into two fractions. One led by Hackner, who had become chairman of the party, and another led by Spina. After the Anschluß of Austria, Hacker called on all BdL members to join SdP. The situation in BdL became more and more chaotic. On March 22, 1938, Hacker proclaimed himself as the 'plenipotentiary' of BdL, and went on to declare the party to merged into SdP.

She was later renamed Wildwood (PC-1181) but never saw active service under that name. Career PC-1181 was laid down on 5 October 1942 at Gibbs Gas Engine Co. in Jacksonville, Florida and launched on 15 April 1943. She was commissioned as USS PC-1181 on 17 September 1943 at Charleston Navy Yard in Charleston, South Carolina. She was decommissioned on 18 August 1946 and given the name Wildwood on 15 February 1956. She was never recommissioned and therefore did not have the USS prefix to her name while she was named Wildwood. She was struck from the Navy Register on 1 April 1956 and sold for scrap. USS PC-1181 was fitted out at the Charleston Navy Yard and then reported for shakedown training out of Miami, Florida and later sonar and antisubmarine warfare training at the Fleet Sonar School at Key West. With her training complete, USS PC-1181 set out from Key West to escort Convoy KN-275 to New York City on 6 November 1943. The convoy successfully arrived on 11 November, Armistice Day. USS PC-1181 moored in between USS PC-1208 (left) and USS PC-1182 (right) in the Panama Canal. The following week on 19 November, PC-1181 was charged with escorting Convoy NG-399 to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. One day out she suffered an oil leak and was put into Norfolk, Virginia to undergo repairs. The convoy proceeded without her. Two days later, with repairs completed, USS PC-1181 resumed course and rejoined the convoy before it reached Guantanamo Bay on 27 November. On 30 November PC-1181 set sail for New York with Convoy GN-99, reaching her destination on 6 December. She quickly set out to sea again, escorting Convoy NG-404 to Guantanamo Bay. She was tasked with breaking away from the convoy to escort a lagging merchant who had fallen behind from the rest of the convoy. PC-1181 didn't reach her destination until 20 December. PC-1181 set sail for New York once again on Christmas Day and arrived on New Year's Day, 1944. On 6 January, she set out with Convoy NG-409 to Guantanamo Bay, but once again broke away to stand by a disabled merchant ship, SS Beta which had developed engine problems. After the merchant ship repaired her engines, both ships set course to rejoin the convoy. At 2132 hours on 12 January, PC-1181's sonar operators picked up a contact and began search operations. However, another submarine chaser, PC-618 picked up an even stronger contact and PC-1181 was called off her search to assist PC-618 in her search. The search returned no results and both ships broke off the search to return to the convoy, completing the voyage on 15 January. PC-1181 continued escorting convoys between New York City and Guantanamo Bay. Her area of operation expanded to include convoys from Guantanamo Bay to the Panama Canal in May 1944. As the war in the Atlantic and Europe drew to a close in the spring of 1945, the convoy system was disbanded as the need for military escorts became obsolete. USS PC-1181 pumping out bilge water. With the convoy system no longer needed, PC-1181 was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 3, serving as a target vessel during training missions for submarines operating in the Gulf of Mexico out of Panama. She continued operating in the gulf until the war with Japan ended in August 1945. With the war over, PC-1181 was reassigned to the defense forces of the Panama Canal. She conducted patrols and training operations out of Panama until June 1946. She was ordered back to Key West, arriving there on 13 July. She was later decommissioned there on 18 August 1946. As a decommissioned ship, PC-1181 served as a training ship for the Naval Reserve units in Key West and St. Petersburg, Florida, until 1950 when she was placed in reserve at Brownsville, Texas. Later, she was shifted to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet's berthing area at Norfolk, Virginia and was named Wildwood on 15 February 1956. She was never commissioned as Wildwood. She was struck from the Navy Register on 1 April 1959 and sold for scrap.

Coverage area WRGC's coverage area includes Baldwin and Putnam Counties as well as portions of Hancock, Jasper, Jones, Morgan, and Wilkinson Counties. The station is also simulcast on Milledgeville’s Governmental/Educational access channel, MBC-TV4 on Charter Communications. History The genesis of the station began when the FCC opened a filing window for new Non-Commercial Educational FM stations. The college's then-Director of Communications, Bryan Jackson, himself a former owner of a broadcast station, realized that a frequency might be available in the Milledgeville area because of its rural location. A frequency search was conducted and an opening was found on 88.3 MHz using a directional antenna. He then filed an application with the FCC and was awarded a construction permit for the station for WRGC in late November 2008. To acquire construction funds for the station, Jackson then filed an application for a federal grant, which was approved a few months later. The station is 4.8 kW effective radiated power, at 117m HAAT, approximately equivalent to the maximum class A facility as defined by the FCC. In 2010, Georgia College received a matching grant for equipment and the university remodeled a facility on its West Campus to house the radio station. The radio station began broadcasting on March 31, 2011.

Description  A Type 96 on display at JGSDF Camp Matsudo The driver sits on the right side of the vehicle with the engine to his left. His position is fitted with three periscopes, the center of which can be replaced by a passive night vision periscope. For service in Iraq it appears that his position was fitted with an assembly of three windows to enable him to drive with his head out of the vehicle for greater situational awareness while still protected from small-arms fire. Behind him is the commander/gunner in a cupola that traverses 360° that can carry either a 40 mm grenade launcher (Type A) or a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2HB machine gun (Type B). The passenger compartment has space for 8 infantrymen who can use 2 firing ports on each side. As of 2001 Japan reported to the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs that 72 Type 96s were in service, with an additional 22 procured that year. 365 vehicles had been produced as of 2014. Replacement On 10 January 2017, a new 8×8 APC prototype called the Wheeled Armoured Vehicle (Improved) was handed off to the Japanese Armed Forces to replace the 365 Type 96 vehicles in service. Developed by the Japanese Defense Ministry in collaboration with Komatsu Limited, this next generation wheeled vehicle was designed to offer more protection against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) with a similar layout to the Patria AMV and Stryker providing the Japanese Army with a family of different vehicles on a common chassis. The new vehicle proposed is longer, higher and heavier than the Type 96. The Wheeled Armoured Vehicle (Improved) prototype is 8.4 m (27 ft) long, 2.5 m (8 ft) wide, and 2.9 m (9 ft) high, weighing 20 tons and carries two crew and nine troops with a new more powerful 500 hp diesel engine and strengthened suspension to run at 100 km/h. The vehicle will equip JGSDF combat and combat-support units for peacekeeping operations as well as “counter island invasion” scenarios. Trials of the prototype were intended to continue until 2019. This has since been delayed due to issues with the armor quality of the prototypes, however trials were resumed again in May 2019.Japan Unveils Armored Vehicle Prototype for 'Counter Island Invasion' - Defensenews.comJapanese Ministry of Defense unveils new 8x8 APC armoured vehicle personnel carrier - Armyrecognition.com, 16 January 2017https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/landwarfareintl/dsa-2018-development- delays-japanese-8x8-apc/ Operators *: 365 (2014)  See also  * Type 16 maneuver combat vehicle – another new 8x8 wheeled vehicle, similar in weight and length.

However, President Truman gave him a second recess appointment on December 20, 1947.No additional nomination made following recess appointment of December 20, 1947; nomination of November 24, 1947, held over to following session of Congress pursuant to suspension of Rule XXXVIII, paragraph 6, of the Standing Rules of the Senate. The Senate still did not confirm his nomination, so his service terminated on June 22, 1948. The same day, President Truman gave him yet a third recess appointment, and Truman renominated him on January 13, 1949. The Senate finally confirmed Harper on January 31, 1949, and he received his commission on February 2, 1949. He served as Chief Judge of the Eastern District from 1959 to 1971, and he was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1965 to 1971. On January 5, 1971, Judge Harper assumed senior status. He was a member of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation from 1977 to 1983. Harper died February 13, 1994, in Chesterfield, Missouri. =Note=Bibliography * Missouri Historical Society St. Louis, Missouri, Roy W.

The area is situated in the urban zone of the coastal town of Urla near İzmir. In pre-classical antiquity and during the Hellenistic and Roman eras, it was a Greek town called Larisa. The harbor settlement was inhabited starting from 6000 years ago and was equipped with a fortification wall partially submerged in the sea. The settlement changed significantly over time, and is one of the oldest known artificial harbors in the Aegean Sea. The underwater find includes vessels and urns that are believed to have arrived at the port from Greece and maybe Cyprus via the Black Sea.Ancient town beneath the sea July 17, 2009 Worldfocus The archaeological site was discovered by Ekrem Akurgal in 1950, and its exploration has been pursued on land and underwater since 1979 by an international team and many of the artifacts discovered are currently on display in İzmir Archaeology Museum. It is very close but separate from the site of Klazomenai, inhabited as of the Iron Age and which itself had changed location several times during its history in the same area between the mainland and Karantina Island across its coastline. Israeli archaeologists and divers including students from Haifa University have helped investigate. Cultural layers Three important cultural layers apart from those of the classical period have been encountered at Limantepe up to the present, as well as evidence for the presence of Chalcolithic remains. The lowest layer belongs to the Early Bronze Age and dates from the 3rd millennium B.C. onwards. Three phases of this layer have been excavated so far and the number of phases is expected to increase as the excavations proceed. =Early Bronze Anatolian Trade Network= The ancient settlement of Kastri on Syros island belongs to the Kastri culture from the early Bronze Age in Greece, dating to the period ca. 2500–2200 BC. This Kastri settlement, belonging to this period, shows numerous cultural connection with Limantepe. This was an intermediary in the trade that went from Limantepe towards the Cyclades.Vasif Sahoglu (2005), THE ANATOLIAN TRADE NETWORK AND THE IZMIR REGION DURING THE EARLY BRONZE AGE. Oxford Journal of Archaeology 24(4):339-361, p.352 Kastri has a similar fortification system with horseshoe-shaped bastions as Limantepe. The pottery assemblage from Kastri is also very similar to that found in Limantepe and elsewhere in Anatolia at the time. The depas vessels, the bell-shaped cups, and incised pyxides \\"are entirely Anatolian in character\\". The tin bronzes are also quite similar.Vasif Sahoglu (2005), THE ANATOLIAN TRADE NETWORK AND THE IZMIR REGION DURING THE EARLY BRONZE AGE. Oxford Journal of Archaeology 24(4):339-361, p.352 This trade network went through the whole of Anatolia, as well as Thrace, and towards the Mesopotamia. Evidence from this early period in Limantepe also indicates cultural ties with the nearby prehistoric sites of Tepekule, Bayraklı within the city of İzmir (which was later to form the core of \\"Old Smyrna\\") and with Panaztepe site at the mouth of the River Gediz (later Hermus during the Classical Age). Also there are clear connections with Cyprus. =Middle Bronze Age= Some of these cultural ties continued also in the Middle Bronze Age. The second cultural layer of Limantepe consists of five phases that belong to the Middle Bronze Age and which dates from the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C. onwards. The third layer belongs to the Late Bronze Age and covers the time period from the 14th to the 13th century B.C., roughly contemporary with the Trojan War. Some of the artifacts discovered from this period reflect a cultural proximity with the Mycenean culture. Consequently, along with remains from the Classical Age in Klazomenai, Limantepe reflects a history of 4000 years. It is argued that this could make Limantepe the oldest, as well as the longest inhabited center of the Aegean coast of Anatolia. One of the most important finds at the site was made in 2007 when a wooden merchant ship anchor dating from the 7th century B.C. and which is likely to be the oldest ever found, was discovered wedged in the sea ground during the underwater explorations of Limantepe.

Originally, the term sodomy, which is derived from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Book of Genesis, was commonly restricted to anal sex. Sodomy laws in many countries criminalized the behavior. (Or ) In the Western world, many of these laws have been overturned or are not routinely enforced. Terminology The term is derived from the Ecclesiastical Latin or \\"sin of Sodom\\", which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek word (Sódoma).myetymology.com , Sodomy Genesis (chapters 18–20) tells how God wished to destroy the \\"sinful\\" cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Two angels are invited by Lot to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may \\"know\\" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the \\"messengers\\" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to \\"do worse\\" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, \\"so that they wearied themselves to find the door\\" (Genesis 19:4-11, KJV). In current usage, the term is particularly used in law. Laws prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.sodomy laws These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation. Many cognates in other languages, such as French (verb ), Spanish (verb ), and Portuguese (verb ), are used exclusively for penetrative anal sex, at least since the early nineteenth century. In those languages, the term is also often current vernacular (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word sex is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social taboo—human sexuality and the anus—without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use. In modern German, the word has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to bestiality.See Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935. The same goes for the Polish . The Norwegian word carries both senses. In Danish, is rendered as \\"unnatural carnal knowledge with someone of the same sex or (now) with animals\\".\\"Sodomi\\" (Ordbog over det danske Sprog) In Arabic and Persian, the word for sodomy, (Arabic pronunciation: ; Persian pronunciation ), is derived from the same source as in Western culture, with much the same connotations as English (referring to most sexual acts prohibited by the Qur'an). Its direct reference is to Lot (لوط Lūṭ in Arabic) and a more literal interpretation of the word is \\"the practice of Lot\\", but more accurately it means \\"the practice of Lot's people\\" (the Sodomites) rather than Lot himself. The word sod, a noun or verb (to \\"sod off\\") used as an insult, is derived from sodomite.Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. Main Entry: sod [3,noun]. \\"Etymology: short for sodomite. Date: 1818.\\"sod2 Compact Oxford English Dictionary, \\"ORIGIN abbreviation of SODOMITE.\\" June 23, 2005. It is a general-purpose insult term for anyone the speaker dislikes without specific reference to their sexual behaviour. Sod is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and is considered mildly offensive. (The word 'sod' also has a meaning of \\"(clump of) earth\\" with an unrelated etymology, in which sense it is rare but not offensive.) While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that \\"an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways.\\"Ian McCormick, Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11. =Buggery= The modern English word \\"bugger\\" is derived from the French term ', that evolved from the Latin Bulgarus or \\"Bulgarian\\". The Catholic Church used the word to describe members of a religious sect known as the Bogomils, who originated in medieval Bulgaria in the 10th Century and spread throughout Western Europe by the 15th century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered heretical. The first use of the word \\"buggery\\" appears in Middle English in 1330 where it is associated with \\"abominable heresy\\"; though the sexual sense of \\"bugger\\" is not recorded until 1555. The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology quotes a similar form: \\"bowgard\\" (and \\"bouguer\\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \\"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian\\". Webster's Third New International Dictionary gives the only meaning of the word \\"bugger\\" as a sodomite, \\"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\\". Bugger is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation, while \\"buggery\\" is synonymous with the act of sodomy. History The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, John Martin, 1852 =Hebrew Bible= In the Hebrew Bible, Sodom was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction—and of Abraham's failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction—appears in Genesis 18–19. The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape Lot's male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.Boswell, pp. 92–98 In Judges 19–21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman. Neither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, Genesis 18:17. Many times in the Pentateuch and Prophets, writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in Deuteronomy 29; Isaiah 1, 3, and 13; Jeremiah 49 and 50; Lamentations 4; Amos 4.11; and Zephaniah 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom, but do not specify any particular sin. Specific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are adultery and lying (). In Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the kingdom of Judah. \\"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.\\" (v. 47, NASB) \\"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49–50, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word \\"thus\\" is the conjunction \\"ו\\" which is usually translated \\"and\\", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.) There is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and \\"abomination\\" is used to describe many sins. The Authorized King James Version translates as: \\"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel,\\" but the word corresponding to \\"sodomite\\" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh (Hebrew:קדש), does not refer to Sodom, and has been translated in the New International Version as \\"shrine prostitute\\"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version. =Roman Empire period=New Testament The New Testament, like the Old Testament, references Sodom as a place of God's anger against sin, but the Epistle of Jude provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed. The Greek word in the New Testament from which the phrase is translated \\"giving themselves over to fornication,\\" is \\"ekporneuō\\" (\\"ek\\" and \\"porneuō\\"). As one word, it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the Septuagint to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the NIV render it as \\"sexual immorality.\\" The Greek words for \\"strange flesh\\" are \\"heteros,\\" which almost always basically denotes \\"another/other,\\" and \\"sarx,\\" a common word for \\"flesh,\\" and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance. In the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of impenitence (), careless living (), fornication ( KJV), and an overall \\"filthy\\" lifestyle (), which word (\\"aselgeiais\\") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as lasciviousness (; ; ; ; ) or wantonness (; ). Epistle of Jude The Epistle of Jude in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: \\"just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire\\". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered \\"sexual immorality and unnatural desire\\" is translated \\"strange flesh\\" or \\"false flesh\\", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to. One theory is that it is just a reference to the \\"strange flesh\\" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.Boswell, p. 97 Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,Albert Barnes' Notes on the BibleVincent's Word Studies \\"out of the order of nature.\\"Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown \\"Strange\\" is understood to mean \\"outside the moral law\\",Word pictures in the New Testament, Archibald Thomas Robertson (; ) while it is doubted that either Lot or the men of Sodom understood that the strangers were angels at the time.Gill, Gn. 19 Philo The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, Philo (20 BCE – 50 CE), described the inhabitants of Sodom in an extra biblical account: \\"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only did they go mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them\\" (133-35; ET Jonge 422-23).The works of Philo a contemporary of Josephius Page 528 Josephus The Jewish historian Josephus used the term \\"Sodomites\\" in summarizing the Genesis narrative: \\"About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards God, in so much that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices\\" \\"Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither thus were they made ashamed.\\" (Antiquities 1.11.1,3 — circa AD 96). His assessment goes beyond the Biblical data, though it is seen by conservatives as defining what manner of fornication (Jude 1:7) Sodom was given to. =Medieval Christendom= Dante and Virgil interview the sodomites, from 's commentary on the Commedia, c. 1345 The primarily sexual meaning of the word sodomia for Christians did not evolve before the 6th century AD. Roman Emperor Justinian I, in his novels no. 77 (dating 538) and no. 141 (dating 559) amended to his Corpus iuris civilis, and declared that Sodom's sin had been specifically same-sex activities and desire for them. He also linked \\"famines, earthquakes, and pestilences\\" upon cities as being due to \\"such crimes,\\"trans. in Derrick Sherwin Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, (London: Longmans, Green, 1955), 73-74 during a time of recent earthquakes and other disasters (see Extreme weather events of 535–536). While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm,For the legal and cultural background in Republican and Imperial Rome prior to Christian rule, see Sexuality in ancient Rome and Lex Scantinia. in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior. Christians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations. St. John Chrysostom in the 4th century regarded such relations as worse than murder in his fourth homily on , while Paul the Apostle in the Epistle to the Romans referred to same-sex relations as \\"shameful lust\\" and which acts were contrary to nature, with men suffering a \\"due penalty\\" in their bodies. Just like the Jews, early Christians prior to Justinian I are not known to have used the word sodomia for the carnal sin they abhorred, though Philo of Alexandria (20 BC - 50 AD)Jewish philosopher, Writing on the life of Abraham and Methodius of Olympus (AD 260-312)Commentary on the sin of Sodom attributed homosexual relations to Sodom, as may have Josephus, (AD 37 – c. 100)Antiquities 1.11.133-34; ET Jonge 422-23; The Sodom tradition in Romans Biblical Theology Bulletin, Spring, 2004 by Philip F. Esler Augustine of Hippo, (AD 354-430)Confessions. Commenting on the story of Sodom from Genesis 19 and certain pseudepigraphacal texts.Book of the Secrets of Enoch (Slavonic Apocalypse of) 10:4; in J recension Ch. I.118 (late 1st century AD) Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom may have been forgotten today (as some hold it had been, along with his law novelizations regarding homosexual behavior immediately after his death) had it not been made use of in fake Charlemagnian capitularies, fabricated by a Frankish monk using the pseudonym Benedictus Levita (\\"Benedict the Levite\\") around 850 AD, as part of the Pseudo-Isidore. Benedict's three capitularies, particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom, were: *XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis. (\\"No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs\\") *CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur. (\\"No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them\\") *CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum. (\\"No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds\\") Burning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior, particularly common in Germanic protohistory (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called nith, rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as nithings). Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks. Benedictus broadened the meaning for sodomy to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed counter nature (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these, he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality. Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, Ghent 1578 Benedictus’ rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments, such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition, and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedictus’ demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives. This came about with the Medieval Inquisition in 1184. The sects of Cathars and Waldensians were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism, but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the Trial of the Knights Templar. Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, Jacques de Molay.G. Legman \\"The Guilt of the Templars\\" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11. It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern witch hunts that were also largely connoted with sodomy. Persecution of Cathars and the Bogomiles sect in Bulgaria led to the use of a term closely related to sodomy: buggery derives from French bouggerie, meaning \\"of Bulgaria.\\"Oxford English Dictionary The association of sodomy with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials. See The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages (2010), 809 for some important points: by 'sodomy' was understood all homosexual activity and not only anal intercourse; by the later Middle Ages, civil courts were as much involved as ecclesiastical ones; though accusations became frequent, the number of condemned remained low, and the number of executed very low. The Book of Wisdom, which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality: :\\"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers.\\" :\\"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.\\" (KJV, Wisdom 19:13-14) =Sodomy laws in 18th-century Europe= A wanted poster, published in the city of Amsterdam in 1730, accusing ten men of \\"the abominable crime of sodomy\\" () An examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the Old Bailey in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of \\"assault with sodomitical intent,\\" which was not a capital offence.Crimes tried at the Old Bailey , Proceedings of the Old Bailey online Sodomy crimes in England could mean \\"sexually assaulting a young child,\\" and could result in a sentence of death recorded, i.e., not an actual death sentence at all. In 18th century France, sodomy was still theoretically a capital crime, and there are a handful of cases where sodomites were executed. However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the hospital) associated with moral crimes (such as prostitution). Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize \\"this vice.\\" Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point, even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security—specific police agents, for instance, watched the Tuileries, even then a known “cruising area.” But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated); the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet. In 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the Netherlands; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing. At least 60 men were sentenced to death.Rictor Norton, The Dutch Purge of Homosexuals 1730 The last two Englishmen that were hanged for sodomy were executed in 1835. James Pratt and John Smith died in front of Newgate Prison in London on 27 November 1835 or 8 April 1835. They had been prosecuted under the Offences against the Person Act 1828, which had replaced the 1533 Buggery Act. Modern sodomy laws Laws criminalizing sodomy rarely spell out precise sexual acts, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be unnatural or immoral. Sodomy typically includes anal sex, oral sex, and bestiality. In practice, sodomy laws have rarely been enforced against heterosexual couples, and have mostly been used to target homosexuals. (Or ) As of June 2019, 69 countries as well as five sub-national jurisdictions have laws criminalizing homosexuality. In 2006 that number was 92.https://76crimes.com/76-countries- where-homosexuality-is-illegal/ Among these 69 countries, 44 of them criminalize not only male homosexuality but also female homosexuality. In 11 of them, homosexuality is punished with the death penalty.[https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2019.pdf; updates from LGBT rights by country or territory. ReligionsJudaism= > Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, > and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she > strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and > committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good. > :— KJV, ). Classical Jewish texts are seen by many as not stressing the homosexual aspect of the attitude of the inhabitants of Sodom as much as their cruelty and lack of hospitality to the \\"stranger.\\" The 13th-century Jewish scholar, Nachmanides, wrote: “According to our sages, they were notorious for every evil, but their fate was sealed for their persistence in not supporting the poor and the needy.” His contemporary, Rabbenu Yonah, expresses the same view: “Scripture attributes their annihilation to their failure to practice tzedakah [charity or justice].” Prohibitions on same-sex activities among men (#157) and bestiality (#155–156) are among the 613 commandments as listed by Maimonides in the 12th century; however, their source in Leviticus 18 does not contain the word sodomy. The idea that homosexual intercourse was involved as at least a part of the evil of Sodom arises from the story in Genesis 19 (NIV): =Christianity= The traditional interpretation sees the primary sin of Sodom as being homoerotic sexual acts,Robert A. J. Gagnon, The Bible and Homosexual Practice, pp. 73–74Gagnon, Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice, pp. 46–50 connecting the Sodom narrative with Leviticus 18, which lists various sexual crimes, which, according to verses 27 and 28, would result in the land being \\"defiled\\": Some scholars, such as Per- Axel Sverker, align this passage with the traditional interpretation, claiming that the word abomination refers to sexual misconduct, and that while homoerotic acts were not the only reason Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned, it was a significant part of the picture. Others, the earliest of whom was Derrick Sherwin Bailey, claim that this passage contradicts the traditional interpretation altogether. In their view, the sins of Sodom were related more to violation of hospitality laws than sexual sins.Derrick Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition (Hamden: Conn.: Archon, 1975 reprint from 1955), 4-5 This also coincides with traditional Jewish interpretations of these texts as well. The primary word in contention is the Hebrew word yâda, used for know in the Old Testament. Biblical scholars disagree on what \\"know\\" in this instance refers to, but most of conservative Christianity interprets it to mean \\"sexual intercourse,\\"Greg Bahnsen, Homosexuality: A Biblical View (Phillipsburg: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing, 1978), p. 32.A Reformed Response to Daniel Helminiak's Gay Theology, by Derrick K. Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges while the opposing position interprets it to mean \\"interrogate.\\"John J. McNeil, The Church and the Homosexual, p. 50 Lot's offering of his two virgins has been interpreted to mean that Lot is offering a compromise to assure the crowd that the two men have no untoward intentions in town, or that he is offering his virgins as a substitute for the men to \\"know\\" by sexual intercourse. Those who oppose the interpretation of sexual intent toward Lot's guests point out that there are over 930 occurrences of the Hebrew word (yâda‛) for \\"know\\" in the Old Testament, and its use to denote sexual intercourse only occurs about a dozen times, and in the Septuagint it is not rendered sexually. Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of yâda‛ denoting sex is in Genesis,Homosexuality and the Old Testament, P. Michael Ukleja (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8, sex the obvious meaning. Its use in the parallel story in Judges 19 is also invoked in support of this meaning,Sodom: Inhospitality or Homosexuality?, by Dave Miller, Ph.D., Apologetics PressDr. James B. DeYoung, Homosexuality, pp. 118–122 with it otherwise providing the only instance of \\"knowing\\" someone by violence. =Islam= While the Quran clearly disapproves of the sexual practices of the \\"people of Lot\\" (\\"What, of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you?\\"Sura 26:165–167, quoted in Wafer, p. 88), only one passage has occasionally been interpreted as taking a particular legal position towards such activities: Most exegetes hold that these verses refer to illicit heterosexual relationships, although a minority view attributed to the Mu'tazilite scholar, Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, interpreted them as referring to homosexual relations. This view was widely rejected by medieval scholars, but has found some acceptance in modern times. Hadith (reports of Muhammad's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with different writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways.Wafer, p. 89 Shariah (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars.Jivraj & de Jong, p. 2 In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and an increasing number of Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance. For sodomy within marriage, the majority of Shiite interpreters hold that: ⑴ anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not haram (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and ⑵, if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain. Despite the formal disapproval of religious authority, gender segregation in Muslim societies and the strong emphasis on virility leads some adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves.Schmitt & Sofer, p. 36 Not all sodomy is homosexual—for some young men, heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes report demand for anal penetration from their male clients.Dialmy, pp. 32 and 35, footnote 34 See also *Homosexuality and Christianity *Prison rape *Religion and sexuality *The Bible and homosexuality NotesReferences ;Citations ;Bibliography *Boswell, John, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality (University Of Chicago Press; 8th Edition. edition, 2005). *Crompton, Louis, Homosexuality and Civilization (Belknap Press, 2003) * *Davenport-Hines, Richard, Sex, Death and Punishment: Attitudes to sex and sexuality in Britain since the Renaissance (William Collins and Sons Ltd, 1990) *Hays, Richard B.

It serves as the headquarters of the Morris County Historical Society, which operates Acorn Hall as a historic house museum. Named for the two-centuries-old oak tree formerly standing on its property, Acorn Hall was built in 1853 by the Schermerhorn family as a simple four-room over four-room farmhouse. Following the death of Mrs. Schermerhorn in 1854, Dr. Schermerhorn put the house and its contents up for sale. It was purchased in 1857 by the Augustus Crane family of New York. The Cranes in 1860 had the house enlarged and remodeled in the then-fashionable Italianate Villa style. After being passed down through several generations, the house was given to the Historical Society in 1971 by Mary Crane Hone. Historians have recognized Acorn Hall for its authentic mid-Victorian era furnishings, primarily pieces from the Schermerhorn and Crane-Hone families, supplemented with significant objects from other prominent Morris County families of the 19th century. Carpeting, wall coverings, and decorative paint techniques remain as they were in the nineteenth century. Acorn Hall also offers an exhibit gallery with changing exhibits highlighting various aspects of Morris County history and Victorian culture. In addition to the National Register of Historic Places, Acorn Hall is on the New Jersey State Register, and is part of the NJ Women's History Trail, in recognition of the importance of the Crane and Hone women in both preservation and the women's suffrage movement. The grounds are also connected to the Morris County Park Commission's Patriot's Path system of trails.

Some languages make a distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions; thus they may have three-form or four-form systems instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including Early Middle English but Modern English has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in many facets of communication, such as: eye blink communication, head movements, Morse Code, and sign language. Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems. Some languages do not answer yesses with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'. Welsh, Finnish and Chinese are among the languages that typically employ an echo response (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though such languages can also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'. Echo responses avoid the issue of what an unadorned yes means in response to a negative question. While a yes response to the question \\"You don't like strawberries?\\" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ' (I like) has no ambiguity. The words yes and no are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional parts of speech. Although sometimes classified as interjections, they do not qualify as such, and they are not adverbs. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, sentence words, word sentences, or pro-sentences, although that category contains more than yes and no and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words. Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as minor sentences.  Classification of English grammar  Although sometimes classified as interjections, these words do not express emotion or act as calls for attention; they are not adverbs because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences. This is the position of Otto Jespersen, who states that \\"'Yes' and 'No' ... are to all intents and purposes sentences just as much as the most delicately balanced sentences ever uttered by Demosthenes or penned by Samuel Johnson.\\" Georg von der Gabelentz, Henry Sweet, and Philipp Wegener have all written on the subject of sentence words. Both Sweet and Wegener include yes and no in this category, with Sweet treating them separately from both imperatives and interjections, although Gabelentz does not. Watts classifies yes and no as grammatical particles, in particular response particles. He also notes their relationship to the interjections oh and ah, which is that the interjections can precede yes and no but not follow them. Oh as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms oh yes and oh no merely acts as an intensifier; but ah in the combined forms ah yes and ah no retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms *yes oh, *yes ah, *no oh, and *no ah are grammatically ill-formed. Aijmer similarly categorizes the yes and no as response signals or reaction signals. Ameka classifies these two words in different ways according to context. When used as back-channel items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a yes–no question, he classifies them as formulaic words. The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does. The yes or no in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas yes or no used as a back-channel item is a feedback usage, an utterance that is said to oneself. However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses. Bloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as special completive interjections. They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as minor sentences. Sweet classifies the words in several ways. They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence. They are also sentence words, when standing alone. They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the not in a negated echo response. For example, a \\"No.\\" in response to the question \\"Is he here?\\" is equivalent to the echo response \\"He is not here.\\" Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple yes in the latter situation, although the sentence-word \\"Certainly.\\" provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response \\"He is certainly here.\\" Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way. Unlike yes, no can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g. no greater, no sooner, but not no soon or no soonest), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g. \\"He is no fool.\\" and Dyer's \\"No clouds, no vapours intervene.\\"). Grammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words. Tesnière classifies the French oui and non as phrasillons logiques (along with voici). Fonagy observes that such a classification may be partly justified for the former two, but suggests that pragmatic holophrases is more appropriate.  The Early English four-form system  While Modern English has a two-form system of yes and no for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a four-form system, comprising the words yea, nay, yes, and no. Yes contradicts a negatively formulated question, No affirms it; Yea affirms a positively formulated question, Nay contradicts it. :Will they not go? — Yes, they will. :Will they not go? — No, they will not. :Will they go? — Yea, they will. :Will they go? — Nay, they will not. This is illustrated by the following passage from Much Ado about Nothing: (editorial footnotes) Benedick's answer of yea is a correct application of the rule, but as observed by W. A. Wright \\"Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent.\\" Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been yes: This subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir Thomas More in his critique of William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars: In fact, More's exemplification of the rule actually contradicts his statement of what the rule is. This went unnoticed by scholars such as Horne Tooke, Robert Gordon Latham, and Trench, and was first pointed out by George Perkins Marsh in his Century Dictionary, where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, \\"No aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.\\", to read nay. That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was \\"too subtle a distinction for practice\\". Marsh found no evidence of a four-form system in Mœso-Gothic, although he reported finding \\"traces\\" in Old English. He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels, *positively phrased questions are answered positively with gea (John 21:15,16, King James Version: \\"Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?

I tell you, Nay; but rather division\\"; 13:4,5, KJ: \\"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\\"), nese (John 21:5 \\"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.\\"; Matthew 13:28,29, KJ: \\"The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\\"), and nic meaning \\"not I\\" (John 18:17, KJ: \\"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.\\"); *while negatively phrased questions are answered positively with gyse (Matthew 17:25, KJ: \\"they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? He saith, Yes.\\") *and negatively for example with nâ, meaning \\"no one\\" (John 8:10,11, \\"he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord.\\"). Marsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a \\"needless subtlety\\". Tooke called it a \\"ridiculous distinction\\", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More. Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of John Wycliffe, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, John Skelton, and Robert of Gloucester, and Piers Plowman and Le Morte d'Arthur) that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale. But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.  Three-form systems  Several languages have a three-form system, with two affirmative words and one negative. In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the unmarked affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the marked affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative. For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to \\"Snakker du norsk?\\" (\\"Do you speak Norwegian?\\") is \\"Ja\\", and the affirmative answer to \\"Snakker du ikke norsk?\\" (\\"Do you not speak Norwegian?\\") is \\"Jo\\", while the negative answer to both questions is \\"Nei\\". Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese, Hungarian, German, Dutch, French and Malayalam all have three-form systems. Swedish and Danish have ja, jo, and nej. Norwegian has ja, jo/jau, and nei. Icelandic has já, jú and nei. Faroese has ja, jú and nei. Hungarian has igen, de, and nem. German has ja, doch, and nein. Dutch has ja, jawel, and nee. French has oui, si, and non. Malayalam has അതേ, ഉവ്വ് and ഇല്ല. Though, technically Malayalam is a multi-form system of Yes and No as can be seen from below, the former are the formal words for Yes and No. Swedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms javisst and jovisst, analogous to ja and jo, to indicate a strong affirmative response. Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms joho and nehej, which both indicate stronger response than jo or nej. Jo can also be used as an emphatic contradiction of a negative statement. And Malayalam has the additional forms അതേല്ലോ, ഉവ്വല്ലോ and ഇല്ലല്ലോ which act like question words, question tags or to strengthen the affirmative or negative response, indicating stronger meaning than അതേ, ഉവ്വ് and ഇല്ല. The words അല്ലേ, ആണല്ലോ, അല്ലല്ലോ, വേണല്ലോ, വേണ്ടല്ലോ, ഉണ്ടല്ലോ and ഇല്ലേ work in the same ways. These words also sound more polite as they don't sound like curt when saying \\"No!\\" or \\"Yes!\\". ഉണ്ട means \\"it is there\\" and the word behaves as an affirmative response like അതേ. The usage of ഏയ് to simply mean \\"No\\" or \\"No way!\\", is informal and may be casual or sarcastic, while അല്ല is the more formal way of saying \\"false\\", \\"incorrect\\" or that \\"it is not\\" and is a negative response for questions. The word അല്ലല്ല has a stronger meaning than അല്ല. ശരി is used to mean \\"OK\\" or \\"correct\\", with the opposite ശരിയല്ല meaning \\"not OK\\" or \\"not correct\\". It is used to answer affirmatively to questions to confirm any action by the asker, but to answer negatively one says വേണ്ടാ. വേണം and വേണ്ട both mean to \\"want\\" and to \\"not want\\".  Other languages with four-form systems  Like Early Modern English, the Romanian language has a four-form system. The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are da and nu, respectively. But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with ba (i.e. ba da and ba nu). nu is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb. Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question \\"N-ai plătit?\\" (\\"Didn't you pay?\\") is \\"Ba da.\\" (\\"Yes.\\"—i.e. \\"I did pay.\\"), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning \\"Se poate să ...?\\" (\\"Is it possible to ...?\\") is \\"Nu, nu se poate.\\" (\\"No, it is not possible.\\"—note the use of nu for both no and negation of the verb.)  Related words in other languages and translation problems  Bloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have special completive interjections. = Finnish = Finnish does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question, negating it if the answer is the negative. (This is an echo response.) The answer to \\"Tuletteko kaupungista?\\" (\\"Are you coming from town?\\") is the verb form itself, \\"Tulemme.\\" (\\"We are coming.\\") However, in spoken Finnish simple \\"Yes\\" answer is far more common, \\"Joo.\\" Negative questions are answered similarly. Negative answers are just the negated verb form. The answer to \\"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\\" (\\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\\") is \\"En tunne\\" (\\"I don't know.\\") or simply \\"En.\\" (\\"I don't.\\"). However, Finnish also has particle words for \\"yes\\": \\"Kyllä\\" (formal) and \\"joo\\" (colloquial). A yes-no question can be answered \\"yes\\" with either \\"kyllä\\" or \\"joo\\", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb. \\"Ei\\", however, is always conjugated and means \\"no\\". =Estonian= Estonian has a structure similar to Finnish, with both repetitions and interjections. \\"Jah\\" means \\"yes\\". Unlike Finnish, the negation particle is always \\"ei\\", regardless of person and plurality. \\"Ei ole\\" (\\"am/are/is not\\") can be replaced by \\"pole\\" (a contraction of the ancient expression \\"ep ole\\", meaning the same). The word \\"küll\\", cognate to Finnish \\"kyllä\\", can be used to reply positively to a negative question: \\"Kas sa ei räägi soome keelt?\\" \\"Räägin küll!\\" (\\"You don't speak Finnish?\\" \\"Yes, I do!\\") It can also be used to approve a positive statement: \\"Sa tulidki kaasa!\\" \\"Tulin küll.\\" (\\"You (unexpectedly) came along!\\" \\"Yes I did.\\") = Latvian = Up until the 16th century Latvian also didn't have a word for \\"yes\\" and the common way of responding affirmatively to a question was by repeating the question's verb, just as in Finnish. The modern day \\"jā\\" was borrowed from Middle High German \\"ja\\" and first appeared in 16th- century religious texts, especially catechisms, in answers to questions about faith. At that time such works were usually translated from German by non- Latvians that had learned Latvian as a foreign language. By the 17th century \\"jā\\" was being used by some Latvian speakers that lived near the cities, and more frequently when speaking to non-Latvians, but they would revert to agreeing by repeating the question verb when talking among themselves. By the 18th century the use of \\"jā\\" was still of low frequency, and in Northern Vidzeme the word was almost non-existent till the 18th and early 19th century. Only in the mid-19th century did \\"jā\\" really become usual everywhere. = Welsh = It is often said falsely that Welsh has no words at all for yes and no. It has ie and nage. However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the many ways in Welsh of saying yes or no. As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to \\"'\\" (\\"Is Ffred coming?\\") are either \\"'\\" (\\"He is (coming).\\") or \\"'\\" (\\"He is not (coming)\\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with nag. For more information on yes and no answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in further reading. = Galician and Portuguese = These languages have words for yes and no, namely si and non in Galician and sim and não in Portuguese. However, answering a question with them is considered less idiomatic than answering with the verb in the proper conjugation. = Goidelic languages = The Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) do not have words for \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" at all. Instead, an echo response of the main verb used to ask the question is used. Sometimes, one of the words meaning \\"to be\\" (Irish ' or ', see Irish syntax § The forms meaning \\"to be\\"; Scottish Gaelic ' or ' see Scottish Gaelic grammar § verbs; Manx ' or ') is used. For example, the Irish question \\"'\\" (\\"Is he coming?\\") may be answered \\"\\" (\\"Is\\") or \\"\\" (\\"Is not\\"). More frequently, another verb will be used. For example, to respond to \\"'\\" (\\"Did he hear?\\"), \\"'\\" (\\"Heard\\") or \\"'\\" (\\"Did not hear\\") are used. Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g. \\"Did you hear?\\" Answer \\"I heard/I did\\". = Latin = Latin has no single words for yes and no. Their functions as word sentence responses to yes-no questions are taken up by sentence adverbs, single adverbs that are sentence modifiers and also used as word sentences. There are several such adverbs classed as truth- value adverbs—including certe, fortasse, nimirum, plane, vero, etiam, sane, minime, and videlicet. They express the speaker's/writer's feelings about the truth value of a proposition. They, in conjunction with the negator non, are used as responses to yes-no questions. For example: Latin also employs echo responses. = Chinese = Speakers of Chinese use echo responses as well. In all Sinitic/Chinese languages, yes-no questions are often posed in A-not-A form, and the replies to such questions are echo answers that echo either A or not A. In Mandarin Chinese, the closest equivalents to yes and no are to state \\"\\" (; ) and \\"\\" (; ). (In Cantonese, the preceding are 係 hai6 and 唔係 m4 hai6, respectively. One can also answer 冇錯 mou5 co3 [] for the affirmative, though there is no corresponding negative to this.) The phrase () may also be used for the interjection \\"no\\". = Japanese = Japanese also lacks words for yes and no. The words \\"\\" (hai) and \\"\\" (iie) are mistaken by English speakers for equivalents to yes and no, but they actually signify agreement or disagreement with the proposition put by the question: \\"That's right.\\" or \\"That's not right.\\" For example: if asked, , answering with the affirmative \\"はい\\" would mean \\"Right, I am not going\\"; whereas in English, answering \\"yes\\" would be to contradict the negative question. Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese. = Spanish = In Spanish, the words (yes) and (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative can replace the verb after a negation ( = I don't own a car, but he does) or intensify it (I don't believe he owns a car. / He does own one! = ). The word is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it ( = I don't own a car). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation ( = I own no car). = Complications = These differences between languages make translation difficult. No two languages are isomorphic, even at the elementary level of words for yes and no. Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter. But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three. There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German ja ja ja). Furthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions. The German ja has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage (yes, yeah, and no when used as an answer; well, all right, so, and now, when used for segmentation; oh, ah, uh, and eh when used an interjection; and do you, will you, and their various inflections when used as a marker for tag questions) for example. Moreover, both ja and doch are frequently used as additional particles for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists. Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as ja and doch from a text. Translation from languages that have word systems to those that do not, such as Latin, is similarly problematic. As Calvert says, \\"Saying yes or no takes a little thought in Latin\\".  Colloquial forms Nonverbal= Linguist James R. Hurford notes that in many English dialects \\"there are colloquial equivalents of Yes and No made with nasal sounds interrupted by a voiceless, breathy h-like interval (for Yes) or by a glottal stop (for No)\\" and that these interjections are transcribed into writing as ' or '. These forms are particularly useful for speakers who are at a given time unable to articulate the actual words yes and no. The use of short vocalizations like uh-huh, mm-hmm, and yeah are examples of nonverbal communication, and in particular the practice of backchanneling.Daniel Chandler & Rod Munday, back-channel, A Dictionary of Media and Communication (1st ed.: Oxford University Press, 2016). Art historian Robert Farris Thompson has posited that mm-hmm may be a loanword from a West African language that entered the English vernacular from the speech of enslaved Africans; linguist Lev Michael, however, says that this proposed origin is implausible, and linguist Roslyn Burns states that the origin of the term is difficult to confirm. =Aye and variants= The word aye (), as a synonym for yes in response to a question, dates to the 1570s and, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary, is of unknown origin; it may derive as a variation of the word I (in the context of \\"I assent\\"); as an alteration of the Middle English yai (\\"yes\\"), or from the adverb aye (meaning always \\"always, ever\\"), which derives from the Old Norse ei.aye (interj.), Online Etymology Dictionary (accessed January 30, 2019). Use of aye is an archaism in most of the English-speaking world but remains in use in Scottish and Northern English usage.\\"Yes (adverb)\\" in Oxford Thesaurus of English (3d ed.: Oxford University Press, 2009 (ed. Maurice Waite), p. 986. In December 1993, a witness in a Scottish court who had answered \\"aye\\" to confirm he was the person summoned was told by a sheriff judge that he must answer either yes or no. When his name was read again and he was asked to confirm it, he answered \\"aye\\" again, and was imprisoned for 90 minutes for contempt of court. On his release he said, \\"I genuinely thought I was answering him.\\" \\"Aye\\" is also a common word in parliamentary procedure, where the phrase \\"the ayes have it\\" means that a motion has passed. In the House of Commons of the British Parliament, MPs vote orally by saying \\"aye\\" or \\"no\\" to indicate they approve or disapprove of the measure or piece of legislation. (In the House of Lords, by contrast, members say \\"content\\" or \\"not content\\" when voting). The term has also historically used in nautical usage, often phrased as \\"aye, aye, sir\\" duplicating the word \\"aye\\". Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926) explained that the nautical phrase was at that time usually written ay, ay, sir. The informal, affirmative phrase why-aye (also rendered whey-aye or way- eye) is used in dialect of North East England,Perspectives on Northern Englishes (eds. Sylvie Hancil & Joan C. Beal: Walter de Gruyter: 2017), table 4.2: \\"North-east features represented in the LL Corpus.\\"Emilia Di Martino, Celebrity Accents and Public Identity Construction: Analyzing Geordie Stylizations (Routledge, 2019). including in Geordie speech. =Other= Other variants of \\"yes\\" include acha in informal Indian English and righto or righty-ho in informal British English.

Wright, FSA (Born: 16 June, 1948) was formerly curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum and later at Imperial College in London, England. He is known by his analysis of the original fragments of the Antikythera mechanism and by the reconstruction of this Ancient Greek brass mechanism. Overview Michael Wright studied physics at the University of Oxford and history of technology at the University of London. He was a schoolmaster until 1971 when he joined the Science Museum in London, working there until 2004. For most of his career, Wright was the curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum. He then became an honorary research associate at the Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine at Imperial College London. He is also a fellow at the Society of Antiquaries of London. Antikythera mechanism Michael Wright made a study of the original fragments of the Antikythera mechanism, an Ancient Greek brass mechanism, together with Allan George Bromley. They used a technique called linear X-ray tomography which was suggested by retired consultant radiologist, Alan Partridge. For this, Wright designed and made an apparatus for linear tomography, allowing the generation of sectional 2D radiographicimages. Early results of this survey were presented in 1997, which showed that Price's reconstruction was fundamentally flawed. Further study of the new imagery allowed Wright to advance a number of proposals. Firstly he developed the idea, suggested by Price in \\"Gears from the Greeks\\", that the mechanism could have served as a planetarium. Wright's planetarium not only modelled the motion of the Sun and Moon, but also the Inferior Planets (Mercury and Venus), and the Superior Planets (Mars, Jupiter and Saturn). ed. S.A. Paipetis, Peri Technon, Patras 2003. University of Patras 2003. Wright proposed that the Sun and Moon could have moved in accordance with the theories of Hipparchus and the five known planets moved according to the simple epicyclic theory suggested by the theorem of Apollonius. In order to prove that this was possible using the level of technology apparent in the mechanism, Wright produced a working model of such a planetarium. Wright also increased upon Price's gear count of 27 to 31 including 1 in Fragment C that was eventually identified as part of a Moon phase display. He suggested that this is a mechanism that shows the phase of the Moon by means of a rotating semi-silvered ball, realized by the differential rotation of the sidereal cycle of the Moon and the Sun's yearly cycle. This precedes previously known mechanisms of this sort by a millennium and a half. More accurate tooth counts were also obtained, allowing a new gearing scheme to be advanced. This more accurate information allowed Wright to confirm Price's perceptive suggestion that the upper back dial displays the Metonic cycle with 235 lunar months divisions over a five-turn scale. In addition to this Wright proposed the remarkable idea that the main back dials are in the form of spirals, with the upper back dial out as a five-turn spiral containing 47 divisions in each turn. It therefore presented a visual display of the 235 months of the Metonic cycle (19 years ≈ 235 Synodic Months). Wright also observed that fragmentary inscriptions suggested that the pointer on the subsidiary dial showed a count of four cycles of the 19-year period, equal to the 76-year Callippic cycle. Based on more tentative observations, Wright also came to the conclusion that the lower back dial counted Draconic Months and could perhaps have been used for eclipse prediction. in preparation () All these findings have been incorporated into Wright's working model, demonstrating that a single mechanism with all these functions could be built, and would work. Despite the improved imagery provided by the linear tomography, Wright could not reconcile all the known gears into a single coherent mechanism, and this led him to advance the theory that the mechanism had been altered, with some astronomical functions removed and others added. Finally, as an outcome of his research, Wright, M T., \\"Il meccanismo di Anticitera: l'antica tradizione dei meccanismi ad ingranaggio\\" (The Antikythera Mechanism: evidence for an ancient tradition of the making of geared instruments), in: E. Lo Sardo (ed.), Eureka! Il genio degli antichi, Naples, July 2005 – January 2006, Electa Napoli 2005, pp. 241 – 244. {Cite journal  author = Wright, M T.  year = 2003  title = Epicyclic Gearing and the Antikythera Mechanism, part 1  journal = Antiquarian Horology  volume = 27 (March 2003)  issue = 3  pages = 270–279 }} Wright also conclusively demonstrated that Price's suggestion of the existence of a differential gearing arrangement was incorrect. In 2006, Wright completed what he believed to be an almost exact replica of the mechanism.Ancient Greek calculating device continues to reveal secrets Physorg.com, 4 April 2011 by Bob Yirka With that came a paper dated 2007 entitled \\"The Antikythera mechanism reconsidered\\", recapitulating most of the points made above. In a footnote to that paper dated 29 November 2006, Wright acknowledges details explained by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Program since his publication: > Note added 29 November 2006: This paper was submitted on 2 September 2006 > and accepted for publication on 26 October 2006.

It is a two-story Flemish bond brick church built in 1822, and covered with white stucco because of deteriorated masonry. The church was built as an addition to the adjacent meeting house and parsonage built in 1797. This building and the church's cemetery having uniform flat gravestones (called God's Acre by the Moravians) represents Maryland's only remaining 18th century Moravian settlement. History The Moravian Church originated in Bohemia and Moravia in the 1400s, with the first Moravians settling in North America in the 1700s. The first Moravian settlements were in Pennsylvania, but Moravians began to move south to Maryland, Virginia, and Salem, North Carolina. The Moravians who settled in Maryland were one of the groups to move south during the mid-1700s, travelling from Pennsylvania to Maryland via an Indian road. The Graceham congregation was formally organized by Bishop Matthaeus Gottfried Hehl on October 8, 1758 as \\"Manakosy\\" (Monocacy) Moravian Church. Their first place of worship, a Gemeinhaus (English: \\"congregation house\\"), had been constructed in 1749. A second church edifice was dedicated on October 16, 1773, before being replaced by the current edifice that was dedicated on October 27, 1822.Provincial Elders Conference of the Moravian Church in North America, Congregations Book [MSS.], vol. 1, p. 31, preserved at the Moravian Archives, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The official name change of the village took place in 1785, following the recommendation of Johannes von Watteville, who wrote (transl.), \\"May this village be a hamlet, or little town of the Lord's, in which grace abides, with simplicity and a childlike spirit,\\" hence the name Graceham.

She was buried alive and murdered in Trinidad by activist Michael X and members of his Black Power group. Life She was born in London to Leonard and Ann Plugge. Gale had two brothers, Leonard Frank (born 1937), and Greville, her twin. She attended school at the Lycée Français in London. Later she started modelling, and worked as a DJ for a French radio show. She married film director Jonathan Benson at the age of 20, but the marriage had difficulties and she moved away to Argentina when she was 22, in 1967. Returning to the United Kingdom she started a relationship with Black Power activist Hakim Jamal, an associate of Michael X. Jamal was an American from Boston whose previous name was Allen Donaldson. She changed her name to \\"Hale Kimga\\", an anagram of her first name and Hakim. Benson and Jamal moved to Guyana in 1971, before moving later that year to the commune of Michael X in Trinidad, who had fled the UK while bailed on charges of extortion and robbery. Murder On the morning of 2 January 1972, a group of men including Michael X took Benson out for a walk outside the commune. Arriving at a hole in the ground, they started digging until it was about four feet deep. One of the men turned to Benson and asked, \\"What do you think this is for?\\" She shrugged, and the man replied, \\"This is a fresh hole for decomposed bodies\\". They pushed her in, two of the men attacking her with a cutlass, badly wounding Benson in the chest and throat. She was buried alive, some of the men jumping on the soil to keep her down until she succumbed. The postmortem later found inhaled dirt in her lungs. It was alleged that Michael X had ordered her death because she was causing \\"mental strain\\" to Jamal. Her badly decomposed body was found seven weeks later, and eventually two of the men were convicted of her murder, after one of the group turned witness for the prosecution. Stanley Abbott and Edward Chadee were sentenced to death, but one was commuted to life imprisonment. Another of the group drowned at sea, and barber Joseph Skerritt was murdered. Michael X was charged with Benson's murder but never tried; he was sentenced to death for the murder of Skerritt on 21 August 1972, and hanged in Port of Spain's Royal Gaol in May 1975. Her lover Hakim Jamal was murdered in the United States in 1973, just over a year after Benson. Cultural references The movie The Bank Job (2008) portrays Michael X as having been in possession of indecent photographs of Princess Margaret stored in a bank vault, and using them to blackmail the British establishment. Hattie Morahan plays Benson, whom the movie portrays as a spy whose role is to find any additional photos or negatives Michael X may have. Her brother Frank, however, said the idea Benson was a spy in real life was \\"ludicrous\\".

The existing data are contradictory. According to 2009 Census there are 451 Greeks. According to the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are 150 families of Greek origin (650-700 people). However, the data of the General Secretariat For Greeks Abroad give an even lower number (50 people). HistoryInitial settlement= According to an official census of 1920, the Greeks of Kyrgyzstan numbered only 344. Since 1939 and during World War II Greeks living in the Soviet Union--most of them were merchants, but there were also some farmers--suffered deportations, mainly to the steppes of Central Asia, particularly to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Siberia. For a considerable time after the end of the war, these deported Greeks remained unrehabilitated, and were not allowed to return to their pre-deportation areas of settlement. Thus some of them chose to leave Siberia to settle in Kazakhstan and (to a lesser extent) in Kyrgyzstan. * Hess (2008), 1521-1522 * Most of these Greeks were finally concentrated in the Osh province, and the town of Nookat in particular. During a second wave of deportations (1944-1949) initiated by the Stalinist regime, more than 31,000 families (Pontian Greeks and Greeks from Crimea) were sent to Bishkek; only 5,000 found a shelter living in squalid conditions. This time, the deported Greeks finally settled in the Talas Province. =Migration to Greece= In early 1990s, the Greek community of Kyrgyzstan was still vibrant, and numbered 3,000 members in all. Nevertheless, from 1985 onward, their number has been decreasing, due to outmigration by Greeks in search of work. According to the statistics, during the 1990s 860 members of the Greek community of Kyrgyzstan (0.57% if the total number of Greek immigrants from the former Soviet Union) settled in Greece. Organization The community is represented by the Filia (Friendship) Association of Ethnic Greeks, headed by chairwoman Olga Kupriyanova. According to her, the association has 300 members. They operate a Greek school with a Greek teacher whose salary is covered by the Greek government, Secretariat of Greeks Abroad. The University of Bishkek opened a Greek language department in 2003.

T. Hodgkinson, Memories of Organs, Organ Builders and Organists of Nottingham. Family He was born in London on 8 September 1835, the son of Samuel Lloyd a shoemaker. He was baptised on 18 March 1838 in St Pancras New Church. In 1851, aged 15, he was described as \\"apprentice organ builder\\". He married Mary Ann Dennison (b ca. 1841 in Nottingham) in 1864. Background Charles Lloyd had previously worked for Samuel Groves of London. Lloyd set up in business first with Lorenzo Valentine and shortly afterwards with Alfred Dudgeon. Their workshop was at 52A Union Road, near the centre of Nottingham. The company Valentine and Dudgeon was started in 1859. They were soon at work installing organs in places of worship in and around the Nottingham area. Lloyd was commissioned by Sydney Pierrepont, 3rd Earl Manvers of Holme Pierrepont, to construct and exhibit a two manual and pedal organ at the Birmingham Trades Exhibition in 1865. It won Lloyd a gold medal award for its workmanship and tone. After the exhibition, the organ was moved back to Nottingham and installed in St. Edmund's Church, Holme Pierrepont. Charles Lloyd & Co. Lloyd & Dudgeon were partners until the death of Albert Dudgeon on 6 February 1874. The company name was then changed to Charles Lloyd & Co., Church Organ Builders, Nottingham. When the Great Central Railway was brought to Nottingham in 1896, land occupied by the Lloyd business had to be cleared to make way for the Victoria Station. Lloyd moved to 79 Brighton Street, St Ann’s. In 1909, his son, Charles Frederick Lloyd took over the business and it continued until 1928 with no change to the name. The company was then acquired by Roger Yates. =Company names and addresses= *Lloyd and Valentine 1859 - 1860, Bilbie Street, Nottingham *Lloyd and Valentine 1861, 19 William Street, and 6 Sherwood Street, Nottingham *Lloyd and Dudgeon 1862 - 1876, 52A Union Road, Nottingham *Charles Lloyd & Co. 1876 - 1896, 52A Union Road, Nottingham *Charles Lloyd & Co. 1896 - 1928, 79 Brighton Street, St Ann’s, Nottingham Apprentices The first was Ernest Wragg of Carlton who, after his period of training, set up as an organ builder himself in 1894 on Carlton Road, Thorneywood, as E.

Plot Head of her family, Bee Jan (Safia Khairi) has her own strict set of rules and cultural values, which she enforces in her home with zeal and zest. The all-mighty but too traditional mother has two sons, Aamir (Javed Sheikh), who is married to Abginey (Faryal Gohar); and Aasim (Humayun Saeed), who is unmarried. Aamir and Abginey are childless, despite eight years of happy marriage. Seeing how Abginey can not bear a child, Bee Jan decides to marry her elder son off to a younger, prettier girl. A submissive son with an almost scary mother, Aamir can not stand up and fight for Abginey. The result is his marriage to Maha (Mahnoor Baloch). Maha is a rude, unorthodox girl, who lives life the way she wants, and clearly refuses to follow Bee Jan's rules. Bee Jan is angry but, when Maha becomes pregnant, all of her fury vanishes. Abginey is still childless, and her position in the house continues to deteriorate as Maha treats her like filth. It is during these circumstances that Abginey's London-residing family - her parents (Badar Khalil and Shehryar Zaidi) and her younger sister, Zarmeeney (Aaminah Haq) - pay a surprise visit to Abginey. They are shocked to learn of Aamir's second marriage, which Abginey had not told them of. They try hard to take Abginey back to London with them, but she refuses outright. Maha, meanwhile, wants Aamir's younger brother, Asim, to marry her cousin, Iraj. Defying Bee Jan and Aamir, Asim declares his love for Zarmeeney. Bee Jan is afraid that Zarmeeney might, like sister Abginey, be infertile, but Asim refuses to listen. They marry and, despite a lot of problems, come together as a happy couple in the end. A subplot also reveals how Maha had been married previously, and has a son from that marriage.

He won in 1876 riding Briseis at the recorded age of thirteen (he was actually eleven, eight days short of his twelfth birthday). His record is unlikely to be beaten as he rode in the Melbourne Cup when he was under the stated minimum age of thirteen. He secured the mount for the three-year-old Briseis after the regular stable jockey could not make the featherweight of 6 stone and 4 pounds (39 kilos). Before 75,000 at Flemington Briseis, with St Albans in the saddle, comfortably won by one length in the biggest field of all time. \\"At 4 o'clock the starter released the 33 runners and they swept down the long Flemington straight in a thundering rush. Briseis, ridden by what one writer termed a mere child, (in the Cup) captured a rare double, the Victoria Race Club Derby and the Melbourne Cup. Shouts and hurrahs were heard, hats were thrown in the air and one excited individual fell on his back in the attempt to do a somersault. The boy who rode the winner was carried around the pack and is the hero of the day,\\" reported the Australasian Sketcher in 1876. Both Peter St Albans and Briseis have now become racing legends, and Briseis is regarded as one of the greatest mares foaled in Australia. Background Prior to winning the 1876 Melbourne Cup, St Albans had an earlier important victory aboard Briseis when the 11-year-old rode her to win the 1876 Doncaster when the then two-year-old filly was only allowed to carry an even smaller weight of 5 stone 7 pounds (34 kilos). Before going to Sydney as a strapper with Briseis, St Albans had won his first race, a maiden plate at Geelong, and on Briseis, but due to his inexperience he wasn't booked to ride the filly in the Doncaster at Randwick. However, as her jockey Tom Hales was over the weight that she was allowed to carry, he recommended the young strapper - St Albans - as showing great ability as a horseman, and having a special bond with the filly. Many ardent racegoers questioned the running of Briseis as a two-year-old in the demanding Doncaster, particularly with an 11-year-old in the saddle. However, they made a great team. Altogether they won three Sydney races at Randwick that autumn. By the age of seventeen Peter St Albans had also added the Sires' Produce Stakes and the Geelong Cup to his winnings. St. Albans, however, only had a limited career in the saddle. Following a fall in Sydney he became a horse trainer at 19 under the name of Peter Bowden. He went on to become a successful trainer and trained Forest King who was runner-up in the 1891 Caulfield Cup. He died in 1898 at the age of 35, and it is said that he had one of the biggest funerals ever seen at Geelong. The Geelong Racing Club each year award the Peter St Albans Trophy to the champion jockey at Geelong (most wins at that circuit). Peter St Albans had been born in Geelong on 15 November 1864 as Michael Bowden, named after his father, but he soon became known as Peter. He then, for in his racing career, took as a surname the name of the stud where he had been born, and where he worked. It has been said, and has become racing legend, that Peter St Albans was Aboriginal, and the first Aboriginal jockey to win the Melbourne Cup. The legend arose as, not yet being 13 years old St. Albans was too young to ride in the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Thus, to allow him to race Briseis in the Cup, it was argued his birthdate and parents were unknown, and from this the legend of him being Aboriginal grew. That he changed his surname is supposed to be the proof that his mother was Aboriginal; and that the owner of the stud James Wilson was devoted to St Albans is supposed to be the proof that either he or his son is St Albans' father. The tale also contends St Albans was left as a baby on the doorstep of one of the stud grooms, Michael Bowden, and raised by him and his wife. This is all strongly denied by his family and his descendants, who say that Michael Bowden and his wife were Peter's true parents. They even hold a copy of Peter's birth certificate. A colour painting by Frederick Woodhouse featuring St Albans, youthful, and very white, standing alongside Briseis with stable jockey Tom Hales in the saddle also confirms the family's story; as does a wood engraving of Briseis with St Albans in the saddle held by the State Library of Victoria.Briseis, the triple winner of The Derby, The Melbourne Cup, and The Oaks Death He died at the home for his father in law, Mr William Ryan at Geelong on 23 July 1898.

Early life and career Ali Moeen was born 20 November 1968 in Lahore. He completed his masters degree in English literature and political science from Government College University, Lahore. On 2 December 2008, Ali Moeen was awarded the Best Drama Writer of Pakistan in the Hum TV's HUM Tele Film Festival 2008 for the telefilm Aik Aadh Hafta. \\"Yeh Hum Naheen\\" (Urdu ﻳﻪ ﮨﻢ ﻧﹷﮭﹻﮟ,) – \\"This Is Not Us!\\" Ali Moeen wrote the lyrics for \\"Yeh Hum Naheen\\", a peace song sung by Pakistan's leading artists as part of an international campaign against terrorism. The song and message behind it have been covered by international media. The campaign was the brainchild of Waseem Mahmood, author and media consultant, who took inspiration for the project from his children, who were tired of the way a minority of misguided young people were putting forward a message of radicalisation and terrorism which was at odds with what the majority of Muslims believe. The central message of the song is that of reconciliation, peace and truth, and is intended as the voice of the silent majority of Pakistanis who are saddened and shocked at the high-jacking of Islam by terrorists, and want to stand up and shout \\"This is Not Us\\". \\"Yeh Hum Naheen\\" was written in Urdu by a Pakistani artist Ali Moeen in words that are simple and meant to reach a wide-ranging audience. The music was composed by Shuja Haider. \\"Yeh Hum Naheen\\" not only topped MTV Asia and Pakistani charts but also made its presence felt on the British charts.

In July 1975, the Statistics and Informatics Division was created under the Planning Ministry (Bangladesh) and tasked to oversee the BBS. Between 2002 and 2012, the division remained abolished but was later reinstated. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics is headquartered in Dhaka.

Formed in 1887 the club is one of the oldest clubs the country. The club colours are green and black. In June 2013 Birr rugby club won 5000 euro from Ulster bank rugby force. The Birr Under 13 team won the midlands league in the 2011-2012 season. HistoryThe early years= Birr RFC was first founded in 1887, the local newspaper reports on a rugby match in Chesterfield School (on the Banagher Road) between a Birr XV and a team from Galway Grammar School. The club grew, disbanded and reformed in its early years, mainly as a result of both world wars. The club purchased our Moorpark Grounds, consisting of 4.5 acres in the centre of Birr Town in 1963 after reforming and proceeded to win the Midland League in 1963-64 and has been in continuous existence since then. =1970s-1980s= The 1970s provided a significant chapter to rugby in Birr. During this era Birr became one of the pioneers of youth rugby in the province. A thriving underage rugby culture evolved in Birr RFRC under the guidance of a continuous stream of volunteer coaches and mentors over the intervening years and the club purchased a further 7.5 acres of land in 1975 approx 4 km south of Birr off the N52 road in Ballyeigan. Leinster Provincial honors followed at Under 15 level in 1976-77 and at Under 17 level in ‘77-78. For many years Dooley's Hotel provided facilities for Birr RFC. In the early ‘70s the County Arms Hotel provided facilities until 1983 after a merger with the Ormond Lawn Tennis Club. A new clubhouse with meeting, changing and entertaining facilities was built, at a cost of over £150,000 with significant local fundraising, bank loans and the assistance of a Department of Education Sports Capital Grant and a Department of Labour Youth Employment Grant. Following the demise of The Ormond Lawn Tennis Club the club reverted to the Birr Rugby Club. =The club in the nineties= In 1996/97 Birr 1st XV team gained promotion from Division 4. Birr 2nd.XV won their section also in Division 4. In 1997/98, Birr maintained Division 3 status, narrowly failing to gain promotion to Division 2. Having secured a bye in the first round of the Smithwicks Provincial Towns Cup, Birr accounted for New Ross, and Mullingar to be beaten in the semi-final by Naas, the eventual winners of the Cup. In 1998/99, Birr for the 2nd time in its history reached the semi-finals of the Provincial Town's Cup. Again, the club was beaten, this time by Naas to a scoreline of 15 - 3. Birr's youths section embarked on their very first international tour when 39 players and eleven accompanying coaches/adults were hosted by Ellon RFC, near Aberdeen, in Scotland. The travelling party won the locally arranged tournament at both under 10's and under 12's. Losing many of its players to retirement, the 1999/2000 season was very disappointing for the club as it was demoted to Division 4 of the Leinster League. The disappointment of the season was lifted when the club embarked on a very ambitious and successful tour to Argentina. The youth section hosted Ellon RFC at mini level. Ellon RFC won the specially commissioned CARA Cup and both club twinned at Youth level. =The new millennium= In 2000, following negotiations with the then Birr Town Council, and including an exchange of freehold and leasehold properties, Birr RFC acquired a long term lease on Council lands at Riverside. This site contains 2 full-size rugby pitches in the centre of Birr town. Fortunes again changed as the 2000/2001 season again saw the club gaining promotion by winning Division 4. Due to the Foot & Mouth epidemic in both the UK and Ireland travel restrictions forced the cancellation of many tours including the return tour to Scotland by the mini section. =2010 - 2020's= Birr 1st XV won the Provincial Towns (J2) Plate in the 2011-12 & 2018-19 seasons. The 2015-16 season saw the 1st introduction of Women's Rugby in Birr at Under 15 and Under 18 level. The club has had notable success at underage level with a number of youth players representing Ireland at youth level from U18, U19 and U20's such as Peter Dooley, Shane Delahunt, Michael Milne and Jack Regan. Peter Dooley represented Ireland at youth level including the 2014 U-20 World Cup and Six Nations, and has progressed from the Leinster academy to being a full member of the first team squad. Shane Delahunt represented Ireland at youth level in the same years as Dooley and was also part of the Ireland squad for the 2014 Six Nations Under 20s Championship. Originally starting in the sub academy in Leinster he eventually switched to Connacht and went on to become a full member of the first team squad. Both Peter and Shane played against each other in the 2015-16 Pro 12 final. Jack Regan played for Ireland U-19s, Leinster U-20s and Leinster 'A', as well as for UCD in the top flight of the Ulster Bank League before switching to the Ulster academy. Chris Maloney represented the Leinster U-18 Clubs and went on to play for Ireland Youths and Aaron Browne represented Ireland at U-19 level.
