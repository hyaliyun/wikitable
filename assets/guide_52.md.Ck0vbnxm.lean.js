Chaudhry (born November 17, 1965) is an American physician and medical educator who is president and chief executive officer of the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) of the United States, a national non-profit organization founded in 1912 that represents the 70 state medical boards of the United States and its territories and which co-sponsors the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). From 2007 to 2009, he served as Commissioner of Health Services for Suffolk County, New York, the state's most populous county outside New York City.Minutes of the Meeting of the Suffolk County Legislature's General Meeting, held in Riverhead, New York. March 20, 2007 In 2016, he was listed by Modern Healthcare magazine as one of the 50 Most Influential Physician Executives and Leaders. Chaudhry is co- author of Medical Licensing and Discipline in America, published by Lexington Books in 2012, and principal author of Fundamentals of Clinical Medicine, 4th edition, a textbook for medical students and physicians in training that was published by Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins in 2004. A Clinical Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and Clinical Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at Stony Brook University School of Medicine in New York, he is the recipient of a Laureate Award from the American College of Physicians and has been inducted into the American Osteopathic Association's Mentor Hall of Fame. In 2014, he was appointed Chair-Elect of the International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities by its Members General Assembly during a biennial meeting in London.  Advocacy of \\"Interstate Medical License Compact\\"  On October 10, 2013, the Federation of State Medical Boards issued a press release announcing \\"substantial progress\\" in the development of an interstate medical license compact to facilitate the ability of physicians to practice medicine across state borders. \\"As our health care system continues to change,\\" said Chaudhry, \\"the need for increased license portability has become more pressing.\\" The proposed compact is expected to maintain state authority and control, establish high standards for physician eligibility, and ensure a well- coordinated and fairly-applied system of oversight and discipline. Chaudhry served as the facilitator of a meeting of representatives of state medical boards in January 2013 in Dallas, Texas, that formally led to the proposal for an interstate compact. On March 13, Chaudhry and Lance Talmage, M.D., then chair of the FSMB board of directors, received a bipartisan letter of support signed by U.S. Senator John Thune of South Dakota and seven other U.S. Senators (Thomas Carper, Roger Wicker, James Inhofe, John Barrasso, Mike Enzi, Tim Johnson, and Lamar Alexander) applauding \\"the efforts of the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) on the work you are doing in examining solutions that would allow for more efficient sharing of medical licensure information that is necessary for the advancement of telehealth technology.\\" The letter expressed the hope that the FSMB can leverage resources \\"to develop a proposal that satisfies the myriad of complex issues associated with licensure portability.\\" In an article in the New York Times on June 30, 2014, Chaudhry said, ‚ÄúThe proposed compact would create a new pathway to speed the licensing of doctors seeking to practice medicine in multiple states,‚Äù adding that \\"it would allow doctors to see more patients than ever before, if they want to.‚Äù =Controversy during FSMB tenure= In Dec 2018, Chaudhry wrote in opposition of changes to the USMLE Step 1 in from Improving Residency Selection Requires Close Study and Better Understanding of Stakeholder Needs: \\"If students reduce time and effort devoted to preparing for Step 1, they may indeed devote attention to other activities that will prepare them to be good physicians. This would arguably be an ideal outcome of such a change. However, if students were to devote more time to activities that make them less prepared to provide quality care, such as binge-watching the most recent Netflix series or compulsively updating their Instagram account, this could negatively impact residency performance and ultimately patient safety. We know that assessment drives learning, so another concern resulting from a shift to pass/fail scoring may be a less knowledgeable physician population.\\" https://in- housestaff.org/dear-nbme-and-fsmb-i-watch-hgtv-more-than-netflix-a-response- to-the-invited-commentary-on-usmle-step-1-1274 https://opmed.doximity.com/articles/step-1-vs-netflix-and- instagram?_csrf_attempted=yes He issued an apology days later. In February 2020, the USMLE announced that they would move Step 1 to pass/fail in 2022.  Advocacy of \\"Maintenance of Licensure\\" (MOL)  In 2010, the House of Delegates of the Federation of State Medical Boards approved a policy framework for \\"Maintenance of Licensure\\" (MOL) that recommends that all U.S. physicians, as a condition of licensure renewal, \\"should provide evidence of participation in a program of professional development and lifelong learning.\\" The MOL framework proposes three components: reflective self-assessment, assessment of knowledge and skills, and performance in practice. Chaudhry chairs a CEO Advisory Council that advises the FSMB's board of directors and works with an FSMB MOL Implementation Group, which has recommended that physicians actively engaged in the Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program of the American Board of Medical Specialties, or the Osteopathic Continuous Certification (OCC) program of the American Osteopathic Association, should be recognized as \\"substantially in compliance\\" with any MOL program that is adopted by a state. For those physicians not board-certified in a specialty of medicine or surgery, or for those not engaged in MOC or OCC, the program envisions states allowing multiple options by which each of the components of MOL can be achieved for licensure renewal. On August 5, 2010, Chaudhry joined David Blumenthal, M.D., President Barack Obama's National Coordinator for Health Information Technology at the time, and Marilyn Tavenner, then Principal Deputy Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., where Chaudhry noted that \\"health information technology, generally, and electronic health records, in particular, could be of value as doctors fulfill (their) professional obligation and demonstrate ongoing clinical competence through MOL.\\"  Medical regulation  State medical and osteopathic boards in the United States took 5,721 disciplinary actions against physicians in 2009, an increase of 342 actions over 2008, according to a report by the Federation of State Medical Boards. Writing in the introduction to the report, Chaudhry cautioned against using those numbers to compare or rank states. \\"Changes in a board's funding, staffing levels, changes in state law and many other factors,\\" he said, \\"can impact the number of actions taken by a board.\\" In an interview with the New York Times about telemedicine and virtual medicine, Chaudhry noted that the Federation of State Medical Boards' guidelines define a patient-doctor relationship as \\"clearly established and begun when a physician agrees to undertake diagnosis and treatment of the patient, and the patient agrees.\\" He stressed the importance of ensuring that patients receive the same standard of care online as in person. \\"It should be the same exact standard as if the patient was in your examining room,\\" he cautioned. \\"You can't cut corners.\\" From 2009 Chaudhry has served as secretary of the management committee for the International Association of Medical Regulatory Authorities. In 2010, and again in 2012 and 2014, he was elected representative of the United States to IAMRA's General Assembly.Chaudhry HJ. Charting Dynamism in Medical Education, Licensure and Regulation. Journal of Medical Licensure and Discipline. 95(3):5-8. 2009.  Health Commissioner  As Commissioner of Health Services for New York's Suffolk County from 2007 to 2009, Chaudhry supervised 1,500 employees and oversaw an annual budget of $400 million. He created a Division of Preventive Medicine within the department through a restructuring of 72 personnel that was approved by Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy and the Suffolk County Legislature and which went into effect on January 1, 2008. \\"We can't make people live forever,\\" Chaudhry said in an article in the New York Times about the new division, \\"but we can prevent premature deaths.\\" During the 2009 flu pandemic due to Influenza A virus subtype H1N1, Chaudhry was praised for taking a cautious public health approach to the new virus, recommending closure of schools when needed and setting up e-mail alerts for Suffolk County administrators.Brown J. Trying to keep life normal. Newsday. May 5, 2009. Describing his department's public health response to the 2009 flu pandemic in an Op-Ed article in Newsday, Chaudhry noted the advantages of advanced technology (e.g., BlackBerry, Twitter) in tracking the virus and keeping in close communication with local, state and federal health officials.Chaudhry HJ.

Suffolk County became the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the sale of baby bottles containing the chemical Bisphenol A, in a measure that Chaudhry said would be enforced with the assistance of consumer complaints.Epstein RJ. Levy signs Suffolk ban on BPA baby bottles. Newsday. April 2, 2009. Justifying Suffolk County's actions against Bisphenol A, Chaudhry said, \\"There was enough evidence to warrant some type of intervention before that final study is done that shows this to be harmful.\\" The County's lawmakers also voted to support a proposal (the first in the nation) to ban the indoor use of electronic cigarettes in public buildings, a move Chaudhry supported.Epstein RJ. Suffolk lawmakers vote to ban e-cigs in public spaces. Newsday. August 19, 2009.

They are also known as the intestinal flukes. Only one species is recognised: Fasciolopsis buski. It is a notable parasite of medical importance in humans and veterinary importance in pigs. It is prevalent in Southern and Eastern Asia. The term for infestation with Fasciolopsis is fasciolopsiasis. Fasciolopsis buski General anatomy Fasciolopsis buski is commonly called the giant intestinal fluke, because it is an exceptionally large parasitic fluke, and the largest known to parasitise humans. Its size is variable and a mature specimen might be as little as 2 cm long, but the body may grow to a length of 7.5 cm and a width of 2.5 cm. It is a common parasite of humans and pigs and is most prevalent in Southern and Southeastern Asia. It is a member of the family Fasciolidae in the order Plagiorchiida. The Echinostomida are members of the class Trematoda, the flukes. The fluke differs from most species that parasitise large mammals, in that they inhabit the gut rather than the liver as Fasciola species do. Fasciolopsis buski generally occupies the upper region of the small intestine, but in heavy infestations can also be found in the stomach and lower regions of the intestine. Fasciolopsis buski is the cause of the pathological condition fasciolopsiasis.Roberts LS, Janovy, J, Jr. (2009). \\"Foundations of Parasitology.\\" McGraw Hill, New York, USA, pp. 272‚Äì273. In London, George Busk first described Fasciolopsis buski in 1843 after finding it in the duodenum of a sailor. After years of careful study and self experimentation, in 1925, Claude Heman Barlow determined its life cycle in humans.Dr. Claude Heman Barlow. Barlowgenealogy.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-18. =Morphology= Fasciolopsis buski is a large, dorsoventrally flattened fluke characterized by a blunt anterior end, undulating, unbranched ceca (sac-like cavities with single openings), tandem dendritic testes, branched ovaries, and ventral suckers to attach itself to the host. The acetabulum is larger than the oral sucker. The fluke has extensive vitelline follicles. It can be distinguished from other fasciolids by a lack of cephalic cone or \\"shoulders\\" and the unbranched ceca. =Life cycle= left Adults produce over 25,000 eggs every day; these take up to seven weeks to mature and hatch at 27‚Äì32 ¬∞C. Immature, unembryonated eggs are discharged into the intestine and stool. In two weeks, eggs become embryonated in water, and after about seven weeks, eggs release tiny parasitic organisms called miracidia, which invade a suitable snail intermediate host. Several species of genera Segmentina and Hippeutis serve as intermediate hosts. In the snail the parasite undergoes several developmental stages (sporocysts, rediae, and cercariae). The cercariae are released from the snail and encyst as metacercariae on aquatic plants such as water chestnut, water caltrop, lotus, bamboo, and other edible plants. The mammalian final host becomes infected by ingesting metacercariae on the aquatic plants. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum in about three months and attach to the intestinal wall. There they develop into adult flukes (20 to 75 mm by 8 to 20 mm) in approximately three months, remaining attached to the intestinal wall of the mammalian hosts (humans and pigs). The adults have a life span of about one year.

It is 320 metres long, 80 metres wide and 40 metres high. It is linked to the neighboring Messe Berlin fairgrounds; often joining in trade shows and exhibitions. As perhaps Europe's biggest such centre, it was instrumental to Berlin being one of the top congress cities in the world. It is serviced by S-Bahn station Berlin Messe Nord/ICC. By its own reckoning, ICC Berlin is a landmark of post-war German architecture and has served as an inspiration for similar facilities around the globe.

Prior to being elected to the Alachua County Commission, Chestnut served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2012, representing the 96th District. Early life Charles S. Chestnut IV was born in Gainesville, Florida to Charles S. Chestnut III and is the step-son of Cynthia M. Chestnut. Chestnut attended Bethune-Cookman College, receiving a degree in business administration, and then Miami-Dade Community College, graduating with a degree in mortuary science. He returned to Gainesville and started working for his family's business, Chestnut Funeral Home. Gainesville City Commission In 2000, Chestnut ran for a seat on the Gainesville City Commission from District 1, and faced Scherwin Henry, Jason Talley, Joel Buchanan, and Davin Woody. Chestnut placed first in the primary election, winning 41% of the vote, but because he did not receive a majority, he ran in a runoff election with the second-place finisher, Henry, who received 23%. Chestnut ended up defeating Henry by a wide margin, winning 57% of the vote. Chestnut was re-elected to a second term without opposition in 2003 and declined to run for a third term in 2006. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Edward L. Jennings opted to unsuccessfully run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, Chestnut ran to succeed him in the 23rd District, which stretched from Gainesville to Ocala in eastern Alachua County and northwestern Marion County. He faced Alachua Vice Mayor Bonnie Burgess in the Democratic primary, and advocated for giving small businesses tax incentives to create jobs, developing wellness initiatives to cut health care costs, increasing teacher pay, providing affordable housing, and reforming the state's standardized testing system, arguing, \\"We need to bring excitement back to education, rather than just teaching our kids to a test.\\" He ended up defeating Burgess in a landslide, winning 62% of the vote and moving on to the general election, where he faced Cain Davis, the Republican nominee and the public housing administrator for the Gainesville Housing Authority. During the campaign, Chestnut ran on fighting South Florida for water resources, declaring, \\"I'm not in favor of sharing our water with South Florida. They should learn to conserve as we do here in this region.\\" Chestnut dispatched Davis easily, winning his first term in the legislature 64% of the vote to his 36%. Running for re-election in 2008, he was opposed by nonprofit director and Republican nominee Bernie DeCastro, who ran Time for Freedom Ministries. Anticipating budget cuts in the upcoming year following the financial meltdown, Chestnut argued that education and social services could not withstand additional cuts, saying, \\"We've cut to the bare bone now. So we're talking about cutting to the bone marrow.\\" With the economic decline, he asserted that colleges and universities should make it easier for people to attend, which could have meant making Bright Futures need-based, not merit- based. Helped in part by Barack Obama's coattails in the state in the 2008 presidential election, Chestnut crushed DeCastro to win a second term, winning 70% of the vote. In 2010, Chestnut was re-elected unopposed to his third and, ultimately, final term in the state legislature. Alachua County Commission In 2012, rather than seek re-election to the legislature, Chestnut instead opted to run for a seat on the Alachua County Commission from the 5th District. When the previous 5th District Commissioner, Rodney Long, resigned in 2011, Governor Rick Scott appointed Winston Bradley to succeed him, but Bradley did not seek re-election the following year. Chestnut won the Democratic primary uncontested, and advanced to the general election, where he faced business consultant Dean Cheshire, the Republican nominee, and Siva Prasad, an independent candidate. He campaigned on reforming the permitting process to create jobs, reinvesting in the Community Agency Partnership Program, protecting the environment through the Alachua County Forever program, and hiring a new city manager. Ultimately, the contest was not particularly close, with Chestnut winning by a wide margin, receiving 54% of the vote to Cheshire's 43% and Prasad's 3%.

In 2017, 52,874 models were made. The automotive industry in Pakistan is the one of the fastest-growing industries of the country, accounting for 4% of Pakistan's GDP and employing a workforce of over 1.8 million people. Currently, there are 3,200 automotive manufacturing plants in the country, with an investment of producing 1.8 million motorcycles and 200,000 vehicles annually. Its contribution to the national exchequer is nearly . The sector, as a whole, provides employment to 3.5 million people and plays a pivotal role in promoting the growth of the vendor industry. Pakistan's auto market is considered among the smallest, but fastest-growing in Asia. Over 180,000 cars were sold in the fiscal year 2014‚Äì15, rising to 206,777 units fiscal year 2015‚Äì16. At present, the auto market is dominated by Honda, Toyota and Suzuki. However, on 19 March 2016, Pakistan passed the \\"Auto Policy 2016-21\\", which offers tax incentives to new automakers to establish manufacturing plants in the country. In response, Renault, Nissan, Proton Holdings, Kia, SsangYong, Volkswagen,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1325911/volkswagen-set-launch-two-new- vehicles-pakistan/ FAW and Hyundai have expressed interest in entering the Pakistani market. NLC signed an agreement with Mercedes Benz for the manufacturing of Mercedes Actros trucks in Pakistan. Pakistan has not enforced any automotive safety standards or model upgrade policies. A few old models of vehicles including the Bolan and Ravi continue to be sold by Suzuki. HistoryEarly years (1950‚Äì1969)= Pakistan produced its first vehicle in 1953 at the National Motors plant in Karachi, according to the Ministry of Industries & Production. The plant was opened in conjunction with General Motors who arranged the facilities for the production of Vauxhall cars and Bedford trucks. Subsequently, buses, light trucks and cars would be assembled at the same plant. In the same year, Ford trucks partnered with Ali Automobiles where they introduced Ford Anglia, Ford pickups and the Ford Kombi. Exide Pakistan also began production of car batteries in 1953. Haroon Industries partnered with Dodge Motors in 1956. In 1961, Allwin Engineering introduced precision auto parts to the Pakistani auto market. In 1962, Lambretta partnered with Wazir Ali Engineering to begin production of the Lambretta TV200 scooter while Kandawala Industries introduced the CJ 5, CJ 6, CJ 7 series Jeep. In 1963, General Tyre Pakistan began production in Karachi while Hye Sons began production of Mack Trucks. In 1964, Rana Tractors began producing Massey Ferguson Tractors while the famous Vespa scooter and rickshaw were introduced by Raja Auto Cars. In 1965, Jaffer Industries and Mannoo Motors began operations. =Nationalisation (1970‚Äì1989)= The 1970s saw nationalization of many companies. In 1972, the Pakistan Automobile Corporation (PACO) was formed. Many companies were bought out or merged into others. Wazir Ali Engineering was renamed to Sindh Engineering, Ali Autos to Awami Autos, Haroon Industries to Republic Motors, Ghandara Motors to National Motors, Hye Sons to Mack Trucks, Kandawala Industries to Naya Daur Motors, Jaffer Industries to Trailer Development Corporation and Rana Tractors to Millat Tractors. Dawood Yamaha introduced Yamaha motorcycles in 1974 and in the same year Beta Engineering started producing diesel engines. In 1976, Suzuki Motor Cycles launched by Sindh Engineering. Saif Nadeem Kawasaki launched Kawasaki motorcycles in 1977 while Suzuki Jeep was manufactured by Naya Daur Motors. In 1980, Awami Motors began manufactured Suzuki pickups while Sindh Engineering began producing Mazda Trucks. In 1981, Agriauto Industries introduced production of local auto parts while in 1982, Pak Suzuki began production of vehicles. In 1983, the Vendor Development & Technical Cell or VDTC was formed along with Al-Ghazi Tractors which was introduced by Fiat. In 1986, Hinopak Motors began as a joint venture between PACO, Al-Futtaim Group, Hino Motors & TTC. In 1987, Ghandhara Nissan began production of Nissan Diesel Trucks. In 1989, Pakistan Association of Auto Parts & Accessories Manufacturers began operation. =Deregulation (1990‚Äì2009)= The industry was highly regulated until the early 1990s. Following deregulation, the decade witnessed a huge boom in auto production, as nationalization was abandoned in favor of privatization. Japan acquired the 40% shares of Pak Suzuki in 1991. In 1993, the Indus Motors Company began production of Toyota Corollas. In 1994, the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association formed, and Honda Atlas introduced manufacturing of the Honda Civic. In 1995, the Engineering Development Board inaugurated the PAP show. From 2001 to 2007, small assemblers and many bike importers started assembling replicas of the Honda CD70 with Chinese collaboration and established there Association with Founder Chairman of Mr. Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, Association of Pakistan Motorcycle Assemblers APMA in 2002, after 2003 annual production of motorcycles kept increasing, with auto sales making records year after year, reaching a peak of 195,688 sales in 2007, during this period Afzal Motors began local assembly of Daewoo buses and trucks under license from Daewoo Bus, South Korea and Tata Daewoo, thanks to rising car financing up to 70‚Äì80% by banks and low interest rates coupled with rising rural purchases. From 2007 to 2009, the auto sector witnessed reduce sales amid high interest rates and yen appreciation against the rupee. In 2007, the automotive industry made up 2.8% of Pakistan's GDP and contributed 16% to the manufacturing sector. The 2000s also saw the introduction of dual fuel options to run both on petrol and CNG, which is more affordable and cheaper than petrol in the country. =Rapid growth (2010‚Äìpresent)= In 2010 the sales rebounded and began increasing again. The auto industry predicted a growing demand in Pakistan and invested over during this decade. Motorcycle production hit a record level in 2016‚Äì17, with 2.5 million units made. In 2015, the Auto Policy 2016-21 was introduced, to help lure new automakers, which has traditionally been dominated by Honda, Toyota and Suzuki. The auto industry remains the second-largest payer of indirect taxes after the petroleum industry in Pakistan. At present, there are 10 cars for every 1,000 people in Pakistan. This is one of the lowest ratios among emerging economies, which itself speaks of high potential of growth. Rising per capita income with changing demographic distribution and an anticipated influx of 30 to 40 million young people in the economically active workforce in the next decade will provide a stimulus to the industry to expand and grow.

Motorsports Silverio rose to prominence in 1972, when he captured a rare double feat, winning the International Greenhills Grand Prix and, two months later, the Royal Rally of Champions. Career Toyota (1973-1979) Silverio became involved in basketball when he formed the Toyota Athletic Club (Komatsu Komets/Toyota Comets) in 1973 which participated in the MICAA. From being its team manager, he became its head coach in 1974 after coach Nilo Verona left the team. In the PBA, he led the franchise to five championships and six runner-up finishes. In December 1979, Silverio resigned from the team after corporate management decided to reinstate players Ramon Fernandez, Ernesto Estrada and Abe King in Game 2 of the Invitational (3rd) Conference championship finals. Silverio did not field these players in during the conference, claiming the three deliberately ‚Äúdidn't play their best‚Äù in a losing finals stint against Royal Tru Orange during the previous conference (1979 Open (2nd) Conference). Toyota eventually won the title on December 15, 1979 under assistant coach Fort Acu√±a, beating arch-rival Crispa in four games.

The film is a creative collaboration based on three friends, Norman Mailer, Buzz Farbar, and Mickey Knox who were seen drinking, braying, and fighting in a run-down apartment in lower Manhattan. Pretending to be gangsters, the trio played with different props, such as pistols and machine guns. The film marks Mailer's first effort into film-making. It was filmed on a 16-millimeter camera and recorded on magnetic sound tape. Plot A trio of Mafia gangsters ‚Äì The Prince (Norman Mailer), Cameo (Buzz Farbar) and Twenty Years (Mickey Knox)‚Äîare hiding in a warehouse. They have surrounded themselves with guns and liquor, and they kill time by joking and bickering with scatological language. But as their isolation from the world progresses, their drinking and arguing intensify. They are briefly visited by a man with a barking dog‚Äîthe canine is silenced when The Prince outbarks him ‚Äî and by two women, one of whom gives The Prince a knife for committing suicide. The police arrive at the warehouse and the gangsters are taken away. Analysis Renata Adler argues that wild 90 relies heavily on \\"the assumption that lack of form liberates.\\" Adler notes that Mailer's goal in the film leans towards yielding a breakthrough into something fresh. His inclusion of the improvised conversations between him and his friends stands out as a way of Mailer wanting to create interest by doing something that he thought would be groundbreaking. Adler points out Mailer's posture and mannerism throughout the film. \\"He is constantly watching for the effect of his own words on the other two friends, and he looked more guarded than the most courtly formalist.\\" In contrast to Adler's analysis, Robert Singer's review notes that the unscripted dialogue contributes to the realism of the film. Wild 90 is a not a typical gangster film but rather a playful reassertion of gangsterism. He reveals that despite production limitations, Wild 90 should be read alongside other 1960s underground films as part of the \\"independent production tradition of the experimental American cinema.\\" Production Wild 90 was the first attempt by Norman Mailer to create a motion picture. The concept for the film came when Mailer and several actors who were appearing in an Off-Broadway adaptation of his novel The Deer Park engaged in an acting game where they pretended they were gangsters. In Manso, Buzz Farbar recounts the genesis of the film: \\"During the run of The Deer Park Norman, Mickey, and I had been hanging out at the Charles IV restaurant on Thompson and Fourth Street, and that's where the idea for the film came from ‚Äî Wild 90. We were all very funny, a lot funnier than in the movie. We'd start insulting each other, each of us coming back with more, and it was Norman who said we ought to film it, and I suggested Leacock and Pennebaker\\". The title Wild 90 is a reference to alleged Mafia slang term for being in deep trouble. Mailer spent $1,500 of his own money to finance Wild 90. D.A. Pennebaker, the documentary filmmaker, was the cinematographer and shot the film in black-and- white 16mm. The production took place over four consecutive nights and the entire film was improvised by Mailer and his cast. The resulting dialogue was unusually heavy with profanities and Mailer later claimed that Wild 90 \\"has the most repetitive, pervasive obscenity of any film ever made\\". The Puerto Rico-born boxer Jos√© Torres appeared as the man with the barking dog and Beverly Bentley (Mailer's wife) played the woman with the knife. Mailer did not allow any retakes during the shoot. Mailer wound up with 150 minutes of film, which was edited down to 90 minutes. Due to a technical glitch during the production, roughly 25 percent of the film's soundtrack came out muffled. Mailer refused to redub the problem patches on the soundtrack and later joked the film \\"sounds like everybody is talking through a jockstrap\\". Release Pennebaker tried to convince Mailer not to put Wild 90 into theatrical release because of the problematic nature of its soundtrack. Mailer disregarded that suggestion and went forward by self-distributing the film. He also promoted the film extensively, which included writing a self-congratulatory essay on the film that appeared in Esquire.  Receptions  Reviews for Wild 90 were overwhelmingly negative. Renata Adler, writing in The New York Times, opined: \\"It relies also upon the indulgence of an audience that must be among the most fond, forgiving, ultimately patronizing and destructive of our time.\\" Robert Hatch, reviewing the film for The Nation, stated that the film was \\"rambling, repetitious...incoherent and inept\\". Stanley Kauffmann, writing in The New Republic, said that \\"I cannot say that Mailer was drunk the whole time he was on camera. I can only hope he was drunk\\". Mailer responded to the bad reviews by including them in the original theatrical poster. Wild 90 was a commercial failure, but Mailer followed up the production with two additional improvised experimental films, Beyond the Law (1968) and Maidstone (1970). = Adler's response = Adler argues that wild 90 relies heavily on \\"the assumption that lack of form liberates.\\" Adler notes that Mailer's goal in the film leans towards yielding a breakthrough into something fresh.

Early life Vila was born in 1908 in a small village called Peguera in the comarca (roughly translated as \\"county\\") of Bergued√†, Catalonia. When he was very young, Vila was nearly struck by lightning, which gave him the facial scars which earned him the nickname Caraquemada. The lightning strike killed his mother, who was hiding with him from a storm. In 1932, after participating in a workers' insurrection, Vila was imprisoned in Manresa and held for a few years. In the period between his release and the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Vila moved around constantly for fear of harassment by the \\"Special Branch\\". In April 1936, while Vila was in Castell√≥ de la Plana, he was approached by two officers. Vila and his cousin Ramon Rives fired at the officers, but Rives was shot in the ensuing gun battle, as well as the two officers. One of the officers died as a result of his wounds. Vila fled the scene, and later turned himself in to the Guardia Civil, hoping for better treatment than he would receive from the \\"Special Branch\\". On 18 July 1936, after the Nationalist uprising, the prisons were opened in an effort to gain fighters to put down the uprising. Vila was released, joined the fighting, and was later made a commandant in the Carabinero Corps. Vila also held the post of Supplies Delegate at the factory he worked at in F√≠gols. Post-civil war Following the Nationalist victory over the Second Spanish Republic in 1939, Vila crossed the French border, to be interned at the concentration camp in Argel√®s-sur- Mer. However, the following year, Vila escaped, and returned to Spain. At this point, Vila formed a clandestine resistance group. Not long after, Vila returned to Vichy France to acquire supplies, and was arrested by Germans, who were by this point occupying France. Vila was imprisoned in Perpignan, but was only there a short time before the Germans sent him to work a bauxite mine. He was soon able to join the French Resistance, and put his experience with explosives to use in sabotage operations. The battalion that Vila was a member of was incorporated into the Free French 2nd Armored Division, led by General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque. Following the end of World War II, Vila primarily operated in the Catalan counties of Alt Llobregat and Baix Llobregat. As his last act of resistance before his death, Vila destroyed transmission towers on 2 August 1963 near Manresa. Death On 7 August 1963, Vila was confronted by three Guardia Civil officers near a castle in Balsareny. When hailed by the officers Vila opened fire at them; they returned fire, shooting him in the heart. No policeman was injured. The official press release announcing his death referred to Vila as a \\"bandit\\". Vila was buried in F√≠gols. On 15 July 2000, a plaque was placed at the burial site of Vila which reads ReferencesSources  * * Category:1908 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Bergued√† Category:Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo members Category:Catalan anarchists Category:Anarchist partisans Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War Category:Spanish anti-fascists Category:Catalan military personnel Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers Category:Spanish maquis ","title":"Ramon Vila Capdevila"},{"id":"20765789","text":"The Competition Model is a psycholinguistic theory of language acquisition and sentence processing, developed by Elizabeth Bates and Brian MacWhinney (1982). The claim in MacWhinney, Bates, and Kliegl (1984) is that \\"the forms of natural languages are created, governed, constrained, acquired, and used in the service of communicative functions.\\" Furthermore, the model holds that processing is based on an online competition between these communicative functions or motives. The model focuses on competition during sentence processing, crosslinguistic competition in bilingualism, and the role of competition in language acquisition. It is an emergentist theory of language acquisition and processing, serving as an alternative to strict innatist and empiricist theories. According to the Competition Model, patterns in language arise from Darwinian competition and selection on a variety of time/process scales including phylogenetic, ontogenetic, social diffusion, and synchronic scales. The Classic Competition Model The classic version of the model focused on competition during sentence processing, crosslinguistic competition in bilingualism, and the role of competition in language acquisition. =Sentence Processing= The Competition Model was initially proposed as a theory of cross-linguistic sentence processing. The model suggests that people interpret the meaning of a sentence by taking into account various linguistic cues contained in the sentence context, such as word order, morphology, and semantic characteristics (e.g., animacy), to compute a probabilistic value for each interpretation, eventually choosing the interpretation with the highest likelihood. According to the model, cue weights are learned inductively on the basis of the extent to which the cues are available and reliable guides to meanings in comprehension and to forms in production. Because different languages use different cues to signal meanings, the Competition Model maintains that cue weights will differ between languages, and users of a given language will use the cue weights associated with that language, to guide their interpretation of sentences. Thus, when people learn other languages, they must learn which cues are important in which languages, in order to successfully interpret sentences in any language. The model defines a cue as an information source present in the surface structure of utterances that allows the language user to link linguistic form with meaning or function. Cues vary in their type (morphological, syntactic, prosodic, semantic, and pragmatic), availability (how often they are present), and reliability (how often they lead to the correct interpretation). Each cue has a certain level of cue validity, the joint product of availability and reliability. Cues of the same basic type, such as case-marking, animacy, or word order may have markedly different levels of validity in different languages. For example, the cue of animacy plays a minimal role in Engish, but a major role in Italian. The model holds that cues both compete and coooperate during processing. Sometimes cues cooperate or converge by pointing to the same interpretation or production. Sometimes, cues compete by pointing to conflicting interpretations or productions. =Language Acquisition= The application of the model to child language acquisition focuses on the role that cue availability and reliability play in determining the order of acquisition of grammatical structures. The basic finding is that children first learn the most available cue(s) in their language. If the most available cue is not also the most reliable, then children slowly shift from depending on the available cue to depending on the more reliable cue. = Methods = The Competition Model posits that language emergence on the developmental or ontogenetic timescale can be examined in at least two ways. One methodology uses neural network models to simulate the acquisition of detailed grammatical structures. Competition model researchers have constructed connectionist models for the acquisition of morphology, syntax, and lexicon in several languages, including English, German, and Hungarian. In addition, the ontogenetic emergence of language has been examined from a biological viewpoint, using data on language processing from children with early focal lesions. The results of studies of these children using reaction time methodologies and neuropsychological tests indicate that, although they have completely normal functional use of language, detailed aspects of processing are slower in some cases. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology, areas of neurological activation involved in specific linguistic tasks have been pinpointed in these children. These results have allowed researchers to evaluate a series of hypotheses regarding sensitive periods for the emergence of language in the brain.  The Unified Competition Model  The classic Competition Model accounts well for many of the basic features of sentence processing and cue learning. It relies on a small set of assumptions regarding cues, validity, reliability, competition, transfer, and strength -- each of which could be investigated directly. However, the model is limited in several important ways. ¬∑ Brain Structure: The classic model makes no contact with what we now know about the organization of language in the brain. As a result, it provides only incomplete understanding of patterns of language disorder and loss. ¬∑ Critical Period: The classic model fails to come to grips with the idea that there is a biologically-determined critical period for language acquisition. ¬∑ Motivation: The classic model provides no role for social and motivational factors governing language learning, preference, code-switching, and attrition. ¬∑ Mental Models: The classic model fails to include a role for mental model construction during comprehension and formulation during production. ¬∑ Microgenesis: The classic model does not provide a microgenetic account for the course of item acquisition, fluency development, and cue strength learning. Extending the classic model to deal with these challenges involves borrowing insights from related theories. The resultant broader theory is called the Unified Competition Model or UCM, because it seeks to unify a variety of independent theoretical frameworks into a single overall model. The transition from the classic version of the model to the unified version worked to bring the model into fuller accord with the theory of emergentism, as developed in the biological (West-Eberhard, 2003), social (Kontopoulos, 1993) and physical sciences (von Bertalanffy, 1968). = Unifying the L1 and L2 Learning Models = A major challenge facing an emergentist, functionalist, non-nativist model such as the UCM involves dealing with age-related changes in the outcome of second language (L2) acquisition. It is widely accepted that children end up acquiring a second language more completely than adults. One account proposes that this \\"fundamental difference\\" (Bley-Vroman, 2009) between child and adult L2 learning arises from the expiration of a biologically-based critical period for natural language learning. In contrast, the framework of the Competition Model emphasizes that all forms of language acquisition make use of the same set of cognitive and social processes, although they differ in the relative reliance on specific processes and the extent to which these processes interact with other learning. Specifically, the UCM holds that adults are more challenged than children by a set of four risk factors that can impede L2 acquisition. # The entrenchment of first language (L1) patterns (Schmid, 2017) leads to competition with L2 patterns. The role of entrenchment and competition as shaping adult L2 performance was already a major features of the classic Competition Model (Bates & MacWhinney, 1981; McDonald, 1989). It is important to consider that entrenchment is fundamental property of neural network functioning (Zevin, 2012), rather than a species-specific genetic mechanism of the type involved in critical periods. # Adults rely heavily on transfer of patterns from L1 to L2. This leads to quick initial learning which then fails to accurately acquire L2 patterns. In addition to these negative effects of transfer, adult reliance on translation from L1 creates a parasitic relation of L2 on L1 (Kroll, Van Hell, Tokowicz, & Green, 2010). # When acquiring new words, adults tend to apply overanalysis by isolating content words in phrases without regard to inflections and function words. Children, on the other hand, are more likely to learn language by acquiring words as parts of larger chunks. # Adults may be subject to isolation from interactions with the L2 community. Adults can counterbalance these four risk factors through an emphasis on four protective or preventive factors. # Adults can learn and consolidate new forms through an emphasis on resonance ‚Äì the process of creating meaningful links between L2 forms (Schlichting & Preston, 2015). # Adults can bring themselves to think in L2 (Vygotsky, 1934). This process of internalization leads to further strengthening of links between L2 patterns, producing greater fluency. # When learning new forms and combinations, adults can emphasize chunking of large phrasal units. # Adults can avoid social isolation and maximize participation by reading L2 materials, watching L2 programs, and socializing with L2 groups (Firth & Wagner, 2007). All of these processes can impact both children and adults. What differs across age is the relative social status of the person and the degree to which they have already consolidated L1. = Three Components of Emergentism = The account given above for the effects of age on L2 learning emphasizes the role of competition as formulated in the classic version of the model. However, we know that there are variations in the learning of different types of linguistic structures. For example, although adults outperform children in terms of learning of the L2 lexicon, they encounter significantly more problems in acquiring a nativelike L2 pronunciation. To understand these differences, we need to think about language in terms of its component structural levels. Emergentist theory emphasizes three major dimensions that control physical, biological, and social processes. These are competition, structural levels, and time/process frames. The classic version of the Competition Model describes and quantifies the role of competition in language. However, in a fuller emergentist account, this analysis of competition must be supplemented through an analysis of structural levels and time/process scales. = Structural Analysis = Structural linguistic analysis (Harris, 1951) distinguishes the levels of input phonology, output phonology, lexicon, semantics, morphology, syntax, mental models, and interaction. Processing on these levels can be analyzed in terms of the related theories of statistical learning (input phonology), gating and fluency (output phonology), embodied cognition and hub-and-spoke theory (semantics), DevLex (lexicon), item-based patterns (syntax), perspective theory (mental models), and CA theory (interaction). The theories for lexicon, syntax, and mental models have been elaborated in specific ways that help unify the approach. These elaborations include specifically the theory of item-based patterns and the theory of perspective shifting.  Item-based Patterns  The theory of item-based patterns is based on ideas about positional patterns from Braine (1962, 1976) that were modified by MacWhinney to restrict early patterns to individual lexical items. The theory holds that children learn item-based patterns to combine words by focusing on individual operators, such as \\"my\\" or \\"more\\". They learn these patterns as a part of their learning about the function of these operator words. They then generalize groups of item-based patterns to abstract feature-based patterns such as the one that places adjectives before nouns in English. In this way, the theory of item-based patterns can be viewed as an early instantiation of Construction Grammar, albeit one specifically designed to account for child language learning. Sentence processing involves the repeated filling (or merge or unification) of roles specified by the item-based and feature-based patterns.  Mental Models and Perspective  The linked dependency structure provide by the operation of item-based and feature-based patterns serves as the input to mental model construction. On this level, sentences encode agency, causation, reference, and space-time through a process of perspective taking. This process allows the human mind to construct an ongoing cognitive simulation of the meaning of an utterance coded in linguistic abstractions, through the use of perceptual realities derived from one's embodied experience. The perspective taking approach views the forms of grammar as emerging from repeated acts of perspective taking and perspective switching during online language comprehension. Grammatical devices such as pronouns, case, voice, and attachment can all be seen as ways of expressing shifts in a basically ego-centered perspective. As noted by Chafe (1994) and MacWhinney (1977, 2008), perspective-taking and perspective-shifting play a central role in linking together models of the actions of agents, referents, positions in space-time, and causation (Talmy, 2000). Articulation of the links between the theory of perspective and the classic Competition Model depends on examination of online cue processing effects, as illustrated in studies such as McDonald and MacWhinney (1995) which examined how verb-based implicit causality established mental models that influence anaphoric binding. One major goal in this line of research is to better understand the brain mechanisms underlying perspective shifting during language comprehension.  Complexity  Complexity arises from the hierarchical recombination of small parts into larger structures (Simon 1962). For language, the smallest parts are the articulatory commands of output phonology, the auditory features of input phonology, and the perceptual features underlying semantics. These articulatory, auditory, and perceptual patterns combine into words that combine into phrases that combine into mental models that compose interactions and narratives. Within each of these major structural levels, we can distinguish additional substructures. Within phonology, words are structured into tone groups composed of syllables that are composed of onsets, nuclei, and codas, which control clusters of articulatory gestures. Within the lexicon, morphemes can be combined into compounds, phrases, inflected forms, and derivations. Syntactic patterns can be coded at the most elementary level in terms of item-based patterns, which are then grouped on the next level of abstraction into constructions, and eventually general syntactic patterns. Mental models are based on an interlocking system emerging from the levels of role assignment, space-time configuration, causal relations, and perspective taking. The levels distinguished by structural analysis are richly interconnected. This means that, although they are partially decomposable (Simon, 1962), they are not modular in the sense of Fodor (1983), but rather interactive in the sense of Rumelhart and McClelland (1987). In order to achieve gating and activation, processing levels must be interconnected in a way that permits smooth coordination. The UCM assumes that these interconnections rely on methods for topological, i.e. tonotopic (Wessinger, Buonocore, Kussmaul, & Mangun, 1997) or somatotopic (Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermuller, 2004), organization that are used throughout the cortex. Structural analysis has many important consequences for our understanding of relations between first and second language learning. Age-related first language entrenchment operates in very different ways in different cortical areas (Werker & Hensch, 2014). In second language production, contrasts and timing relations between the levels of conceptualization, formulation, and articulation (Levelt, 1989) produce marked effects on language performance (Skehan, 2009), although similar effects can be found also in first language acquisition (Snow, 1999). The details of this analysis can be found in MacWhinney (2017). =Time/Process Scales= The third component of emergentist analysis (after competition and structural levels) is the theory of time/process scales. Emergentist theory holds that structures emerge from the constraints arising within time/process frames. The operation of time/process frames and their constraints can be illustrated by looking at how a set of four structural levels determine the shape of proteins (Campbell, Reece, & Mitchell, 1999). During protein folding, the primary structure of the protein is constrained by the sequence of amino acids in the chain of RNA used by the ribosome as the template for protein synthesis. This sequence conveys a code shaped by evolution; but the physical shape of a specific protein is determined by processes operating after initial RNA transcription. The first partially folded structure to emerge is the secondary structure of coils and folds created by the imposition of constraints from hydrogen bonding across the amino acid chain. These forces can only impact the geometry of the protein once the primary structure emerges from the ribosome and begins to contract. After these second structures have formed, a tertiary structure arises from constraints imposed by hydrophobic reactions and disulfide bridges across the folds and coils of the secondary structures. Finally, the quaternary structure derives from the aggregation of polypeptide subunits based on the ternary structures. It is this final structure that allows each protein to serve its unique role, be it oxygen transport for hemoglobin or antigen detection for antibodies. In this partially decomposable emergent system, each level involves a configuration of components from lower levels, but the biochemical constraints operative on each level are unique to that level and only operate once that level has emerged during the process of folding. The fully emergentist version of the UCM emphasizes the ways in which language learning and processing is constrained by processes operating at divergent structural levels in divergent time/process frames (MacWhinney, 2015a). To account for patterns of disfluency, stuttering, code-switching, and conversational sequencing, we look at the constraints imposed by online lexical access, patterns of cortical activation, and social affiliation. Some of these constraints operate across a timeframe of milliseconds and others, like social affiliation, extend across decades. The UCM distinguishes five major groups of time/process frames: phylogenetic drift in the species, diachronic change through social diffusion in the language, developmental change across the lifespan, memory consolidation across days, and frames for online processing and conversation in the moment. Within each of these five major time/process frame groups there are dozens of component processes working to constrain the shape of language. The importance of timeframes is illustrated by a particularly puzzling aspect of language learning, which is the way in which young immigrant children can completely forget their first language (Ventureyra, Pallier, & Yoo, 2004). These cases of complete language attrition contrasts with the minimal level of language attrition experienced by older immigrants (MacWhinney, 2018). It is difficult to account for this in terms of entrenchment alone, because the young learners have used their L1 continually for as much as 6 years. Instead one needs to look at the role of social support for young immigrants, pressures to adopt L2, and the role of literacy in helping older learners consolidate their access to L1 forms. Understanding the interactions of these processes requires a model that can bring all of these forces and timeframes together in terms of competition, motivation, and consolidation. Elaborating these effects is now a major emphasis for ongoing UCM research.  Further Development of the Competition Model  The classic version of the Competition Model emphasized the ways in which cue reliability shaped cue strength. These effects were measured in highly structured sentence processing experiments. To address certain limitations of this research, the Unified Competition Model sought to account in greater detail for age-related facts in the comparison between child and adult second language learning. Within the classic model, the only mechanism that could account for these effects was competition between L1 and L2 patterns, as expressed through negative transfer. Although transfer plays a major role as a risk factor for difficulties in adult L2 learning, it is not the only risk factor. Looking more closely at the variety of L2 learning outcomes across structural levels and timeframes, it became evident that we needed to construct a more complex account for variable outcomes in L2 learning. This account required a deeper integration of emergentist theory into the UCM framework. The resultant account is now able to address each of the limitations of the classic model mentioned earlier. Specifically, ¬∑ by linking linguistic structures to particular brain regions, the model is increasingly grounded neurolinguistically (MacWhinney, 2019), ¬∑ by delineating a set of risk and protective factors, the model deals more accurately with age-related patterns in L2 learning, ¬∑ by providing a time/process frames account of social and motivational factors, the model accounts better for variation in L2 outcome by social groups, work environments, as well as providing accounts for patterns of code-switching and language attrition, ¬∑ by linking in the theory of perspective-switching, we have a fuller understanding of online sentence processing, and ¬∑ by developing corpus (MacWhinney, 2019) and online experimental (eCALL) methods (MacWhinney, 2017), the model now provides a fuller microgenetic account of the growth of fluency . By addressing each of these issues within the context of analyses of L2 learning, the current version of the UCM allows us to better understand not only L2 learning, but also language evolution (MacWhinney, 2005), language change, child language development (MacWhinney, 2015), language disorders (Presson & MacWhinney, 2011), and language attrition (MacWhinney, 2018).

Along with the northern terminus of Florida's Turnpike, the station gave Wildwood a reason to refer to itself as \\"The Crossroads of Florida.\\" The station was built in 1947 by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL), and is located on what is today CSX's S-Line, which runs along the west side of the building. This segment of the S-Line is officially named the Wildwood Subdivision. The station served SAL's Orange Blossom Special, Palmland, Silver Meteor, and Silver Star. It was after this location that the SAL main routes split: the main sections of Palmland, Sunland, Silver Meteor and Silver Star went to the SAL's Miami station; a southeastern branch to Miami. Secondary sections of the Silver Meteor and Silver Star went on a southwestern branch to Tampa, the SAL's Clearwater and St. Petersburg. Sections of the Palmland and Sunland went to Tampa.Official Guide of the Railways, December 1947, Tables 6, 7 It is also the western terminus of an inactive SAL spur that once ran to cities such as Leesburg and Tavares.

Franklin, 1980; p. 134.Lyman Tower Sargent, \\"Themes in Utopian Fiction in English Before Wells,\\" Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3 No. 3 (November 1976), pp. 275-82; see p. 282. The book was one element in the major wave of utopian and dystopian literature that characterized the final decades of the nineteenth century.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886‚Äì1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984.Kenneth M. Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity: America in Utopian Writings, 1888‚Äì1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976. Date The first edition of the book, published in Boston, was undated. It is generally assigned to c. 1895; a second, slightly revised edition was also undated, but likely appeared c. 1898.Everett Franklin Bleiler with Richard Bleiler, Science-Fiction: The Early Years, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1990; p. 373. Genre Writers of speculative fiction in the later 1800s (as at other times) varied in the approaches they took toward the nearer and farther future. Some novels took a short-term look ahead in time, from 25 years, as in Peck's The World a Department Store, to a century or more (Brooks's Earth Revisited, or Bellamy's Looking Backward). Others took a longer look ahead, of even thousands of years (as with Macnie's The Diothas). Howard similarly took a long though indefinite prospective view, setting his utopia at an unspecified time in the distant future. Howard's book, like other utopian works that speculate on future technologies, encompasses some elements of science fiction. In his future, space travel has been achieved, and Jupiter explored; its natives are humanoid, large, and naked. Howard's future Howard's future society is called the Bardic State. It is ruled by 26 bards called the Alphabets, half men and half women. Their leader is the Bard Regent, who appoints other officials; there is also the \\"Positive Poet,\\" the \\"true poet,\\" who is \\"the Milltillionaire.\\" (Howard never fully defines or clarifies these titles and distinctions, though the Milltillionaire is \\"a being of such colossal and illimitable wealth and power, one might say he was a very god....\\") A powerful state apparatus supplies the needs of the people, who labor in return for \\"Universal Welfare,\\" without money, crime, taxes, or personal property. Citizens have serial numbers. The people live in twenty enormous circular cities, which have radii of a hundred miles; there are triple-decker highways and monorails. The capital, \\"Bardo-Cito-Uno\\" (which was Boston), has fully a quadrillion inhabitants. The countryside beyond these megalopolises is kept verdant and park-like. College education is universal, and is followed by a three-year vacation, then graduate school. The people are vegetarians (Howard even provides an illustrative menu); they practice free love. They dress simply; since they don't carry money, their outfits have only a single pocket, for their handkerchiefs. They communicate telepathically (as, indeed, do the Jupiterians). Hypnotism has been replaced by knowledge of the \\"psycho-omni- magnetic force.\\" Electricity has largely been replaced by magnetism (in some indefinite way), though electric vehicles are used along with bicycles. The power system exploits the \\"calorico-electrico-ether.\\" Aircraft travel at 10,000 miles per hour. The weather is controlled.Neil Harris, Cultural Excursions: Marketing Appetites and Cultural Tastes in Modern America, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1990; p. 163. Mega-cities The idea of the gigantic city was in the air at the time Howard wrote. In 1894, the year before Howard issued his first edition of The Milltillionaire, King Gillette had published his first utopian work, The Human Drift.King C. Gillette, The Human Drift, Boston, New Era Publishing Co., 1894. In that book, Gillette proposed an enormous metropolis near Niagara Falls for tens of millions of residents, surrounded by a preserved natural environment. Assessment The Milltillionaire has been called \\"A very unusual work. The author succeeds, as very few others have, of conveying the notion of the immensity of the future and the mind-boggling rise in technology. Yet the book is not completely rational. It is as eccentric as can be, but very interesting ideas are buried amidst the disorganization.\\"Bleiler, p. 374.

Background  Li Shigu was born in 778, during the reign of Emperor Daizong. His father Li Na was the military governor (Jiedushi) of Pinglu Circuit who ruled the circuit de facto independently from the imperial regime. He had one younger half-brother, Li Shidao. During Li Na's term as military governor, Li Shigu served as the prefect of Qing Prefecture (ÈùíÂ∑û, in modern Weifang, Shandong), a position that Li Na himself had served while Li Shigu's grandfather Li Zhengji was military governor.Old Book of Tang, vol. 124 .  As Jiedushi  In 792, Li Na died, and the soldiers supported Li Shigu to succeed him. Later in the year, Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, then emperor, approved and made Li Shigu the new military governor. Meanwhile, Wang Wujun, the military governor of neighboring Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), taking Li Shigu lightly due to his youth, sent forces to De (Âæ∑Â∑û, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) Prefectures ‚Äî preparing to attack two forts that Li Na had built, GeduoThe character for Duo is not in Unicode. and Sancha (). Li Shigu sent the officer Zhao Gao () to defend against Wang's attack. Emperor Dezong then sent eunuchs to intervene; Wang then withdrew. Subsequently, by order of Emperor Dezong, Li Shigu tore down Sancha's walls, but thereafter often encouraged people who had offended the imperial government to join him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. Meanwhile, whenever he sent staff members out for tasks, he would detain their wives and children; if any would turn against him and submit to the imperial government, he would slaughter their families, and therefore his subjects did not dare to do so. In 800, Emperor Dezong gave him the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. In 805, after Emperor Dezong's death, the imperial messengers delivering the news did not reach the circuits quickly. Meanwhile, however, Li Yuansu () the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), had received a copy of Emperor Dezong's will. As he wanted to show that he did not consider Li Shigu an enemy, he secretly delivered the copy of the emperor's will to Li Shigu. Li Shigu, however, wanted to use this as an excuse to expand, and therefore declared that Li Yuansu had falsely spread rumors of the emperor's death, and prepared to attack Yicheng. However, Han Hong the military governor of another neighboring circuit, Xuanwu (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), sent stern words to Li Shigu and prepared to aid Li Yuansu. When Li Shigu subsequently received actual news of Emperor Dezong's death and succession by Emperor Dezong's son Emperor Shunzong, he was forced to withdraw back to his circuit. Emperor Shunzong subsequently sent messengers to mediate between the two circuits. Later in the year, Emperor Shunzong bestowed a greater honorary chancellor title, acting Shizhong (), on Li Shigu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. In 806, by which time Emperor Shunzong, seriously ill, had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Xianzong, Li Shigu was given the honorary title of Shizhong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. Meanwhile, during Li Shigu's term as military governor, he had Li Shidao serving as a local official in various locations, and at times, Li Shidao's budget was limited. Li Shigu justified this treatment by stating that he was training Li Shidao to be frugal and understanding of the people's difficulties. When Li Shigu grew ill later in 806, Li Shidao was the prefect of Mi Prefecture. Li Shigu asked his staff members Gao Mu () and Li Gongdu () whom they planned to support as leader if he died ‚Äî and when Gao and Li Gongdu did not answer quickly, Li Shigu guessed that they planned to support LI Shidao. Li Shigu tried to dissuade them ‚Äî stating that while he loved Li Shidao as his brother, Li Shidao was not capable and spent his time on painting and playing bili ‚Äî but did not give them any other person that he approved of. When Li Shigu died thereafter, Gao and Li Gongdu welcomed Li Shidao back to Pinglu's capital Yun Prefecture () and supported him to succeed Li Shigu.

Lumino Kinetic art is a subset and an art historical term in the context of the more established kinetic art, which in turn is a subset of new media art. The historian of art Frank Popper views the evolution of this type of art as evidence of \\"aesthetic preoccupations linked with technological advancement\\" and a starting-point in the context of high- technology art.Popper (1993) L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy (1895‚Äì1946), a member of the Bauhaus, and influenced by constructivism can be regarded as one of the fathers of Lumino kinetic art.

There was an early cybernetic artist, Nicolas Sch√∂ffer, who developed walls of light, prisms, and video circuits under the term in the 50s. Artist/engineer Frank Malina came up with the Lumidyne system of lighting (CITE), and his work Tableaux mobiles (moving paintings) is an example of Lumino Kinetic art of that period. Later, artist Nino Calos worked with the term Lumino-kinetic paintings. Artist Gy√∂rgy Kepes was also experimenting with lumino-kinetic works.Oxford Art Online Ellis D Fogg is also associated with the term as a \\"lumino kinetic sculptor\\". In the 1960s various exhibits involved Lumino Kinetic art, inter alia Kunst-Licht- Kunst at the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven in 1966, and Lumi√®re et mouvement at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1967. Lumino Kinetic art was also aligned with Op art in the late 1960s because the moving lights were spectacular and psychedelic. Frank Popper views it as an art historical term in the context of kinetic art; he states that \\"there is no lumino kinetic art after the early 70s; it stands as a precursor to other contemporary cybernetic, robotic, new media-based arts, and is limited to a very small number of (male) European avant-garde artists (part of the New Tendencies movement)\\".

Social work is intricately linked with the idea of charity work; but must be understood in broader terms. The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in all major world religions.  Pre-modern antecedents  Before the rise of modern states, the Christian church provided social services in (for example) the Mediterranean world. When the Roman Emperor Constantine I endorsed Christianity in the 4th century, the newly legitimised church set up or expanded burial societies, poorhouses, homes for the aged, shelter for the homeless, hospitals, and orphanages in the Roman Empire.Kalantzis (2006). The Historical Evolution of Social Medicine in Byzantium (330-1453 AD)C. Gilleard (2007) Ageing & Society ‚Äî Old age in Byzantine society (2007), 27: 623-642, Cambridge University Press. These were often funded, at least in part, from grants from the Empire. By 580 AD the church had a system for circulating consumables to the poor: associated with each parish was a diaconium or office of the deacon. Monasteries also often served as comprehensive social-service agencies, acting as hospitals, homes for the aged, orphanages, travelers' aid stations. During the Middle Ages, the Christian church had vast influence on European society and Christians regarded charity as a responsibility and a sign of one's piety. This charity came in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of social ills. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large- scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role in Europe until the Early Modern Period. Other societies had their own systems, involving roles such as those of the traditional healer (\\"witch doctor\\"). Modern development It was not until the emergence of industrialization and urbanization that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services. The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin, and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the Charity Organisation Society in the mid-19th century. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the settlement house movement. This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundational basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society.Boston:Allyn&Bacon;,2011.Print Professional social work originated in 19th century England, and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the Industrial Revolution, in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based poverty and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work. (Today, it is common for social workers to find themselves dealing with consequences arising from other social problems such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination based on age or on physical or mental disability.) =Poverty relief= The Poor Laws in the aftermath of the Black Death (pictured), when labour was in short supply, were concerned with making the able bodied work.Akron Law Review 30 (1996): 73‚Äì128(also see: Sturdy beggar) With the decline of feudalism in 16th century England, the indigent poor came to be seen as a more direct threat to the social order.http://www.socialworkdegreeguide.com/faq/what-is-the-history-of-the- social-work-profession As they were often not associated to a particular feudal manor, the government moved towards the formation of an organized poverty relief system to care for them. The origins of the English Poor Law system can be traced as far back as late medieval statutes dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudor Reformation causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death. The first complete code of poor relief was made in the Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597 and some provision for the \\"deserving poor\\" was eventually made in the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601. It created a system administered at parish level, paid for by levying local rates on rate payers. Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called 'impotent poor', was in the form of a payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in houses of correction or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes. As populations grew in Colonial America, almhouses were built to house vulnerable people with no other support, including people with a long-term illness or older people without families. The first recorded almshouse was built in 1713 near Philadelphia by William Penn, and was only open to Quakers. A second one was built nearby in 1728, this time with public money. In 1736 New York opened the Poor House of the City of New York (later renamed Bellevue Hospital) and in 1737 New Orleans opened the Saint John's Hospital to serve the poor of the city.Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A. Browne (2006). Chapter Two: The Conceptual Underpinnings of social work in health care. Handbook of Health Social Work. New Jersey:WILEY The Poor Law Amendment Act completely overhauled the existing system in Britain and established a Poor Law Commission to oversee the national operation of the system. This included the forming together of small parishes into poor law unions and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief. Although the aim of the legislation was to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the method of financing of the Poor Law system which continued to be paid for by levying a \\"poor rate\\" on the property owning middle classes. Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban all forms of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law authorities except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were to be built in every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form poor law unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act. =Private philanthropy= Social work involves ameliorating social problems such as poverty and homelessness. The 19th century saw a great leap forward in technological and scientific achievement. There was also a great migration to urban areas throughout the Western world, which led to many social problems. This galvanised the socially active, prosperous middle and upper classes to search for ways to ameliorate the physical and spiritual conditions of the poor underclasses. This was coupled with a religious revival, and many Protestant mission efforts (urban missions), attempted to resolve the problems inherent in large cities like poverty, prostitution, disease, and other afflictions. A new philosophy of \\"scientific charity\\" emerged, which stated charity should be \\"secular, rational and empirical as opposed to sectarian, sentimental, and dogmatic.\\" During this time, rescue societies were initiated to find more appropriate means of self-support for women involved in prostitution. State-built Mental asylums were built from the 1840s to assist in taking care of the mentally ill. Most historians identify the Charity Organization Society, founded by Helen Bosanquet and Octavia Hill in London in 1869, as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation. COS had its main focus on individual casework. It supported the concept of self-help and limited government intervention to deal with the effects of poverty. The organisation claimed to use \\"scientific principles to root out scroungers and target relief where it was most needed\\".Rees, Rosemary (2001). Poverty and Public Health 1815-1949. London: Heinemann. Octavia Hill pioneered many aspects of social work. Portrait by John Singer Sargent, 1898 Alsager Hay Hill was prominent from its foundation, acting as honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and as an active member of the council until 1880. Hill also worked as an almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London. He campaigned about the many flaws in the poor laws and urged for a more scientific classification of paupers. His 1867 pamphlet, on Our Unemployed, was one of the earliest attempts to highlight the problem of systemic unemployment; he suggested a national system of labour registration. In 1871, Hill pioneered a system of labour exchanges in England, establishing 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,'. There, Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited Labour News to improve communication between masters and men seeking work. Octavia Hill is regarded by many as the founder of modern social work. She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self- reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work. A Marylebone slum in the nineteenth century. She also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including Emma Cons combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.Darley, Gillian, \\"Hill, Octavia (1838‚Äì1912)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010 At first Hill believed, \\"Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers.\\"Mann, Peter H., \\"Octavia Hill: An Appraisal\\", The Town Planning Review, Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223‚Äì37 Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: \\"Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless.\\" She was an outspoken critic of the principles of \\"outdoor relief\\" or the Speenhamland system of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as \\"a profligate use of public funds.\\"Wyatt, R.J. (2000). Octavia Hill and The Crown Estate ‚Äì a Continuing Legacy?, The Crown Estate p. 3 Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up of references on prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced. =Social action= Toynbee Hall settlement house, Whitechapel was founded in 1884 as part of the Settlement movement. Pictured here in 1902. A stress on social action that developed in the 1880s, was pioneered by the Settlement house movement. This Movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Octavia Hill's work. Her colleagues Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, founded Toynbee Hall, Oxford House in 1884 in Bethnal Green as the first university-sponsored settlement. Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London. The settlement was named after Arnold Toynbee, an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the labourer. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and co-operatives. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of Whitechapel, in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods. In America, the settlement movement was established by Jane Addams, a young medical student, and Ellen Gates Starr after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded Chicago's Hull House in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children. By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.Husock, H. (1993). \\"Bringing back the settlement house\\". Public Welfare, 51(4). The house was both a community service centre and a social research program. Precursors to modern social work arose at Hull House as health professionals began to work with social determinants of poor health. Bohemian immigrant youth at the Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois. The concept of the Settlement house movement was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, social mobility was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.Alfred Marshall, \\"On Arnold Toynbee\\", ed. John K. Whitaker, Marshall Studies Bulletin 6 (1996): 45‚Äì48. The settlement movement focused on the causes of poverty through the \\"three Rs\\" - Research, Reform, and Residence. They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities. The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in slums to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were \\"...a foundation for social work practice in this country\\".Reyes, J. M. (2008). Common space, safe place: Lived experiences of former settlement house participants from the West Town and Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago Dissertation Abstract International, 69(5), 1682A. (UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database. One important participant in the scheme was the philanthropist Charles Booth who published his study Life and Labour of the People in London in 1889 while working at Toynbee Hall. The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards. =Further Development= Poverty in towns, slum dwellers in Dublin, Ireland circa 1901. By the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer Joseph Rowntree believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 1904.History of JRF on official website Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: \\"I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations.\\"JRF's Our heritage page Rowntree's son, Seebohm Rowntree, carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of York that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working-class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.Briggs, Asa, Social Thought and Social Action, page 25. The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book Poverty, A Study of Town Life and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.Rowntree, B S: \\"Poverty: A Study in Town Life\\", page 298. Macmillan and CO., 1901 Rowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \\"necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\\", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading nutritionists of the period to discover the minimum calorific intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum diet were and used this information to set his poverty line. In analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycleSearle, G R: \\"A New England?\\", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004 in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.Joseph Rowntree Foundation Centenary: Poverty The differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, Mary Richmond of the Charity Organization Society (COS) and Jane Addams of the Settlement House Movement engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, scientific method that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior. Even as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question \\"is social work a profession?\\" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. Abraham Flexner spoke on the topic \\"Is Social Work a Profession?\\" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems. This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method.  Gender perspective in the history of social work  The importance of the role of women, in particular of feminist organisations, had in the history of social work has been highlighted by several historical studies.Revue suisse de travail social, n¬∞23 (2018) Regarding the development of social service in the beginning of the 20th Century (1910-1920), women and feminists movements were crucial for the recognition of social work as a profession. On one hand, their discourse reinforced the dualist vision of social roles, considering care work was appropriate with the characteristic women were supposed to have (e.g. softness, empathy, solicitude, love, abnegation, etc.). On the other hand, they affirmed a will to change women's place in society by giving them more power and better recognition. Conversely, when feminists are absent, this has an impact on the professionalisation process, relegating women in the margins. This appears particularly in a study on professionalisation of socio-cultural community work from the 1960s in Switzerland.Togni, C. & Malatesta, D. (2019). Feminism and the professionalisation of social work : a socio-historical approach through two Swiss examples (1910-1970). Contemporanea, 22(2), 282-287. This study shows that men were hired as socio-cultural community workers to develop youth activities, especially with teenage boys, while status of women were less prestigious (assistant, social carers or child care workers) and the child care work they were attributed to viewed as not (or less) relevant for the ¬´ socio-cultural community work project ¬ª of the centres.Dallera, C., Malatesta, D. & Togni, C. (2018). L'√©mergence de l'animation socioculturelle sous le regard du genre. L'exemple des centres de loisirs lausannois 1960-1980. Revue suisse de travail social, 23, 11-27. Medical Social Work Jane Addams (1860‚Äì1935) was a founder of the U.S. Settlement House movement and is considered one of the early influences on professional social work in the United States. The first professional medical social workers in England were called hospital almoners, and were based in medical institutions. The Royal Free Hospital, London hired Mary Stewart as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered \\"deserving enough\\" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles. By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession. The first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Richard Clarke Cabot was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting. This approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice. In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work. Around this time, psychiatry and psychology began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with psychoanalytic ideas, and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character. The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers. State Welfare William Beveridge's Beveridge Report of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state. As the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that laissez-faire economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organized labour. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state. A liberal convert to greater government intervention was Thomas Hill Green, who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.Nicholson, P. P., ‚ÄúT. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation‚Äô, History of Political Thought, 6 (1985), 517‚Äì50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., The Philosophy of T. H. Green (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76‚Äì103 This strand began to coalesce into the social liberalism movement at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain. In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. In the early 1900s, the Liberals under H.H. Asquith introduced various reforms, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British welfare state.Heywood, p. 61. William Beveridge, often called the 'architect of the welfare state', was pivotal in framing the debate about social work in the context of state welfare provision. His 1942 report on Social Insurance and Allied Services, known commonly as the Beveridge Report, identified five \\"Giant Evils\\" in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease, and went on to propose widespread reform to the system of social welfare to mitigate these problems.Brian Abel‚ÄêSmith, \\"The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes.\\" International Social Security Review (1992) 45#1‚Äê2 pp 5-16. The report proved very popular with a war-weary public, and went on to form the basis to the post-war expansion of the Welfare State and the creation of the National Health Service, a free at the point of delivery healthcare provider. Today Currently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment. This is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and humanistic social work.Payne, M. (2011). Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice.

It was created in 1975 when two existing breeds, the mahogany-coloured Murciana of Murcia and the black Granadina of Granada, began to be hybridised as a result of the official recognition of a single herdbook including both breeds. It is the most important dairy goat breed of Spain, with more than 500,000 milking females. It originated in the semi arid areas in south eastern Spain, including parts of Murcia, Almer√≠a, Granada and Alicante. They were bred for two main traits, milk production and its ability to continue this production in dry and nutrient poor regions. They have been introduced into several areas in Latin America as well as northern Africa.  Characteristics  These goats are medium size for goats, around 30 to 50 kg for females and 50‚Äì60 kg for males. They are solid colored, usually black or mahogany colored. The breed association, ACRIMUR (Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Criadores de la Cabra Murciano- Granadina, or Spanish Association of Breeders of the Murcia-Granada Goat) states that they refuse to accept any goat that had white hair even in the smallest amount as M-G. The goats have erect ears and tails, with a short, coarse coat, though it is longer in males than in females. Genotyping of various goat breeds from southern Spain revealed that the Murciano-Granadina breed is significantly closer to the Murciana breed than any other, including the Granadina. These goats are very good milk producers, with a lactation period of around 210 days, often producing 500 liters of milk annually, with some individuals producing as much as twice that. Their milk has 5.6% fat, and 3.6% protein, which is better than most other goat breeds in Mediterranean Europe. In Spain this milk is primarily used for cheese production. They are also used for meat, especially due to the rapid development of their kids. The growth of Murcia-Granada kids can be improved by crossing females of this breed with a meat breed (Boer goats) These goats reproduce quickly, since they do not have a particular season for breeding, and the females can come into heat at any time of the year. Usually two kids are born per breeding, and they become sexually mature around 7 to 8 months of age.

Personal life He is the son of Andres Narvasa, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, and Janina Yuseco. He is also the brother of former MBA and PBL commissioner Ogie Narvasa. Basketball Narvasa, along with his brother, Ogie, played for the Ateneo Blue Eagles. The Narvasa brothers were also part of the Philippine national teams of 1977 and 1978. They jointly coached the Blue Eagles from the early to late 1980s. Narvasa coached the Shell and Purefoods franchises in the PBA from 1995 to 1998. He was also the president of the Basketball Coaches Association of the Philippines (BCAP). =PBA Commissioner= On May 14, 2015, Narvasa was appointed as the ninth league commissioner via a unanimous 12‚Äì0 vote by the PBA Board of Governors. He took the post vacated by Chito Salud, who would serve as the first PBA president and chief executive officer (CEO). He officially took over from Salud on August 1, in time for the Rookie Draft of the 2015‚Äì16 PBA season. On March 7, 2016, Narvasa was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the PBA, replacing officer-in-charge Robert Non, which gave Narvasa a dual role as the CEO and commissioner of the league. However, CEO position was dissolved before the start of the 2016 Governors' Cup. Notable changes and events Narvasa's first order of business as commissioner was to look into league's officiating, which has been a source of controversy in the past years. Hours before the 2015 draft, he issued an order to teams disallowing trading of players and draft picks during draft day, but would be done in the next few days after the draft. Before the start of the 2015-16 PBA season, he introduced some changes in officiating, particularly on deliberate fouls, as well as adapting the referee substitution rule and FIBA's rule of 14-second shot clock reset after offensive boards. During his tenure, the PBA broke its game attendance records for a finals game. Games five, six and seven of the 2017 Governors' Cup Finals between Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and the Meralco Bolts were all held at the Philippine Arena. On October 22, 2017, Game 5 set the all-time PBA finals attendance record of 36,445, breaking the previous record of 23,436 fans during Game 3 of the 2013 Commissioner's Cup between Alaska and Barangay Ginebra.Game 5 at PH Arena sets attendance record in PBA Finals game, Randolf Leongson, Philippine Daily Inquirer, October 22, 2017 The Game 5 record was later broken three days later on October 25 as 53,642 fans watched Game 6 of the Governors' Cup Finals.

He handed an indefinite ban on SPIN.ph beat reporter Snow Badua after the latter wrote an article and posted Twitter tweets accusing Barangay Ginebra San Miguel team governor and close friend Alfrancis Chua for having an extramarital affair with model Abby Poblador. In his letter to Badua, ‚ÄúIt has come to my attention that you had used different media platforms to malign, embarrass and mortify a person of authority of this association. Your incessant attacks on Twitter on Mr. Alfrancis Chua, team governor of Ginebra San Miguel, has caused distress, embarrassment and disharmony with his family‚Äù. His ban on Badua angered many journalists, accusing him as violating press freedom using his power as commissioner. In November 2015, when asked by reporters about Mahindra Enforcers playing-coach Manny Pacquiao's no-show during the Alaska-Mahindra overseas game in Dubai, he quoted as saying that Pacquiao was feeling under the weather, has had prior engagements, and that he is not a basketball player but a boxer, yet he still acknowledged Pacquiao's value to the league as a sports personality who can draw crowds to the game. Such comments he gave to Dubai-based Gulf News angered Mahindra team consultant Joe Lipa, who defended Pacquiao and accused Narvasa's remarks as degrading and uncalled for. Narvasa made a mandatory summon over Lipa's remarks, but Lipa did not honor it. As a consequence, he suspended Lipa from attending Mahindra games. He was also accused of power play by his predecessor, Chito Salud, when the latter announced his resignation as president and CEO and revealed the reason behind his resignation. According to sources of Spin.ph, Narvasa bypassed Salud in handing down key decisions, primarily the banning of Badua and Lipa. On December 5, 2015, Ginebra team governor Alfrancis Chua was caught vaping inside the arena on national television, which prompted the Department of Health and other anti-smoking advocates to talk to Commissioner Narvasa regarding his unhealthy and unethical actions. As a result of the incident, Narvasa only admonished Chua, but gave him a warning, after the latter apologized for his actions. On December 29, 2015, he handed down bans on both referees Edward Aquino and Rommel Gruta for the rest of the PBA Philippine Cup conference, even when the two officials admitted lapse on officiating - a non-call on a supposed five- second violation and a stepping infraction on GlobalPort guard Stanley Pringle in the final play of an 84‚Äì83 overtime win over Ginebra two days before. During Narvasa's tenure as commissioner he issued fines from violating coaches and players, from small violations such as pulling down shorts during the game to severe technical fouls, more than his predecessors.Narvasa on players, coaches fines: I just implement the rules of the PBA, Richard Dy, Fox Sports Philippines, January 25, 2017 He is also known on pointing fingers, notably at Dondon Hontiveros during a scuffle in the GlobalPort-Alaska semifinals game in the 2015-16 Philippine Cup.

Commissioner Narvasa defended the league's decision to ban boy-cut hairdos in the women's league. On October 27, 2017, Narvasa approved the trade proposal that sent Kia Picanto's first round pick (first overall) in the 2017 draft, which is used to draft Christian Standhardinger, in exchange of Ronald Tubid, Jay-R Reyes, Rashawn McCarthy and San Miguel's 2019 first round draft, with minimal revisions from the original trade proposal that originally involving Keith Agovida, Reyes, McCarthy and a San Miguel draft pick.Narvasa approves revised version of KIA-San Miguel trade for No. 1 PBA draft pick, Karlo Sacamos, spin.ph, October 27, 2017 The trade proposal already earned the ire of the fans as well as Wilfred Steven Uytengsu, team owner of the Alaska Aces,PBA: Kia plan to trade top pick would undermine draft, Alaska boss Uytengsu says, ABS-CBN News, October 25, 2017 and Dioceldo Sy, team owner of the Blackwater Elite,Kia-SMB proposed trade ‚Äògarbage,‚Äô says Blackwater owner, Josef Ramos, The Manila Times, October 22, 2017 since Kia is trading their opportunity to pick a potential starter in exchange of role players.

Former PBA chairman Robert Non in a statement criticized the move done by the seven board members for making a \\"whimsical\\" decision in ousting Narvasa and mentioned that the move was unauthorized and non-binding as per the league's by-laws. According to the PBA by-laws, a two-thirds vote (eight out of twelve) of its current membership is necessary to remove or appoint a commissioner. Non also criticized the timing of the meeting as the notice was only sent to all board representatives on Monday, October 30. According to the rules, the board representatives should have been notified seven days before the date of the meeting.SMC bloc, allies stand behind Narvasa, contest 'whimsical' ouster of commissioner, Gerry Ramos, spin.ph, November 2, 2017 Narvasa later called a press conference at the PBA office in Libis and indicated that he will not step down and \\"will fight for the Office of the Commissioner\\".Narvasa: 'I have always ensured parity in all decisions I made as commissioner', Karlo Sacamos, spin.ph, November 2, 2017 He is also requesting the seven teams that will not endorse his term renewal to explain the grounds of their \\"loss of confidence\\" to the current commissioner.

The statement also said that Narvasa is clearly aware that his term renewal is on a yearly basis as indicated to the Meeting Minutes of the Board and upon assuming the COO (commissioner) post in 2015. The action the seven governors made on November 2 is to prevent Narvasa's re-appointment, which needs two- thirds votes (8 out of 12), which obviously Narvasa will not get given the non-support of the majority.Majority PBA bloc: Narvasa‚Äôs ‚Äòcontinued defiance‚Äô could halt league operations, JC Ansis, Sports5, November 3, 2017 Resignation and transition Narvasa submitted his resignation letter, hours before the opening of the 2017‚Äì2018 PBA season on December 17, 2017. The board however asked Narvasa to stay until December 31, 2017 to have a smooth transition to his successor. PBA media bureau chief Willie Marcial will serve as officer-in-charge effective January 1, 2018, until Narvasa's successor will be named.

It is a serious pest of Robinia pseudoacacia, the black locust tree, with which it is sympatric. Etymology The specific name, robiniae, is derived from the name Robinia, which is the generic name of the black locust tree, Robinia pseudoacacia, on which the larvae feed. The name Robinia was coined by Linnaeus to honor the royal French gardeners Jean Robin (father) and Vespasien Robin (son). Description From a distance, M. robiniae can easily be mistaken for a wasp or bee. It can also be mistaken for two closely related species: M. caryae and M. decora. The adult beetle ca be long, and it has a W-shaped third stripe on the elytra. The antennae of both sexes are dark brown. The male's antennae are two-thirds its body length, and the female's are one-half. The legs are reddish brown. Geographic range and habitat Because there has been increasing use of R. pseudoacacia as an ornamental tree, the range of M. robiniae has expanded along with that of the tree. It is, however, still confined to North America and has not been recorded on any other continent where black locust has been introduced. The beetle can be found almost anywhere that unprotected black locust trees grow, and the beetle is often more abundant when Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is also present. Because of the adults' floral preferences, they tend to stay in uncultivated fields and meadows. Life cycle and diet Adult on Solidago The females are often found running up and down black locust trunks in search of wounds in which to lay their eggs in the fall. Both sexes are most common from late day to dusk. Adults feed on pollen of goldenrods of the genus Solidago. The eggs hatch and the larvae spend the winter hibernating within the bark. Once winter ends, the larvae burrow into the tree trunk and start to tunnel. These tunnels are around long by wide, and serve as a primary infection site for wind-borne spores of the fungus Phellinus robiniae, which causes a damaging heart rot disease of Robinia species. The larvae pupate in late July and early August, and adults start to emerge in late August and throughout September. Pest status In 1900, due to attack by M. robiniae, the value of Robinia pseudoacacia was reported to be practically destroyed in nearly all parts of the United States beyond the mountain forests which are its home. Were it not for these beetles and their larval tunnels promoting fungal infections, it could be one of the most valuable timber trees that could be planted in the northern and middle states; young trees grow quickly and vigorously for a number of years, but soon become stunted and diseased, and rarely live long enough to attain any commercial value. Currently, only one registered product, carbaryl, is effective against M. robiniae. It is applied in a single dose when adults are most active (August/September).

The term in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency in medieval and early modern Japan to keep some kami separate from Buddhism.Rambelli and Teeuwen (2002:21-22) While some kami were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same kami in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism. This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole. It should not be confused with shinbutsu bunri (\\"separation of kami and buddhas\\") or with haibutsu kishaku (\\"abolish Buddhas and destroy ShƒÅkyamuni\\"), which are phenomenons recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it.  History  When foreign Buddhism arrived in Japan it became necessary to harmonize it with local kami beliefs. This was done in a number of ways, among them shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç, or \\"syncretism of kami and buddhas\\", and its opposite, shinbutsu kakuri. =Fusion of kami and buddhas= After Buddhism arrived in Japan, the Japanese developed a syncretism of local kami beliefs and foreign Buddhism called shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç. When Buddhism was introduced through China in the late Asuka period (6th century), rather than discard the old belief system the Japanese tried to reconcile it with the new, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples were attached to local Shinto shrines and vice versa; both were devoted to both kami and Buddha. The depth of the resulting influence of Buddhism on the local religion can be seen for example in the fact that the type of shrine we see today, with a large worship hall and images, is itself of Buddhist origin.Tamura, page 21 The influential theory, common in Japan until the Meiji period, even states that Buddhist gods choose to appear to the Japanese as native kami in order to save them.Breen and Teeuwen (2000:95) =Resistance to shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç= While in popular practice kami and buddhas were both mixed and combined in a \\"common religion\\", they were at the same time isolated and separated in various ways elsewhere.Sat≈ç Makoto; The two religions never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity inside a difficult, largely unsystematized and tense relationship.Sueki (2007:7-8) This relationship was, rather than between two systems, between particular kami and particular buddhas. The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities. Besides shinbutsu shugo there was always the other side of the coin, the shinbutsu kakuri. For example, at Iwashimizu Hachiman-g≈´ some rites were kami rites, other were Buddhist, and were therefore conducted by different people. There was in the Japanese a strong resistance to the complete assimilation of their kami with foreign gods. This visible resistance to Buddhism can be traced all the way back to the Nihon shoki's sixth-century account of the first introduction of Buddhism to Japan. Later history is dotted with accounts of friction between some kami and Buddhist temples that lie in their territories. At Ise Jing≈´, for example, the shrine-temple was moved twice because of the incessant rain caused by the kami angered by its excessive proximity to the shrines. An 804 book, the , stipulates that on Ise lands some Buddhist words (buddha, s≈´tra, goj≈´not≈ç, monk, temple or vegetarian food) cannot be uttered and must be replaced with others. The book even specifies these replacement words () to be used instead of proscribed ones: nakago (\\"middle child\\") for a buddha, kawarabuki (\\"tile- roofed building\\") for \\"temple,\\" and somegami (\\"stained paper\\") for s≈´tra. There was therefore a conscious desire to keep the kami away from Buddhism. Toward the end of the ninth century the practice spread to other shrines. The J≈çgan shiki (871) prohibits all Buddhist rites at court offices and at all province offices during the imperial enthronement period, or . Also, monks and nuns couldn't enter the imperial palace during the abstinence before, during and after some kami rituals at court. The Engi shiki says that, in some periods of the year, monks and nuns may not enter the imperial palace. In the Heian period this kind of separation became a common practice with many well- attested practical consequences. This taboo was rigorously observed at the imperial palace for centuries. It not only lasted, but gained new force during the Edo period under the Tokugawa. It is important to note that Buddhism was proscribed only insofar as the emperor was concerned and during the periods prescribed by the rites, but otherwise the usual mixing of kami and buddhas would take place. = Origins of the shinbutsu kakuri = The precise origin of the phenomenon does not appear to be related to the Buddhist special relationship with death. Direct contact with death was forbidden in temples too, and Buddhism was not outlawed at most shrines. Shinbutsu kakuri originated within rituals and shrines like Ise Jing≈´ with deep ties which had profound ties with the emperor,Ise Jung≈´ is the imperial household's shrine. According to the Encyclopedia of Shinto article Ise Shink≈ç, Ise Jung≈´ is dedicated specifically to the emperor, and in the past even his mother, wife and grandmother needed his permission to worship there. and always remained strictly tied to him and to the ceremony of his enthronement. It later spread to other official ceremonies. It has been argued that it was a reaction against Buddhist political interference that peaked with the D≈çky≈ç incident of 768 in which Empress Sh≈çtoku wanted to give the throne to monk D≈çky≈ç. It seems therefore that imperial ritual was isolated from Buddhism to protect the principle of hereditary imperial rule. The practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of kami practices into Buddhism. Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and Kamo Shrines allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of kami.

Protection is placed by the first member of the rope team and the last member removes the pieces of gear. The length of rope used during simul climbing varies but is often between . In most cases, the climbing team maintains multiple pieces of protection between them to prevent a system failure if one of the pieces was to fail. Usually, a belay device is not used. However, the first climber may be belayed by the second until enough rope is out for the leader to avoid a ground fall. Similarly, the leader may use a belay device as the second approaches a belay station to avoid the potential for a large fall. Fall potential The roles of the leader and second in simul climbing are very different than they are in free climbing. If the leader falls during free climbing, the second (follower) is pulled up from their belay station. In simul climbing, if the leader falls, the second is pulled up from wherever they are climbing. The hazards of a fall for the second climber relative to the lead climber are more similar than they are when they are free climbing. Nonetheless, the hazards during a fall are significantly different for simul climbing when compared to free climbing. For example, in simul climbing, the leader can be pulled off the rock when the second climber falls unexpectedly. If both climbers are climbing on or above an overhang and either falls, they may both fall away from the rock and be left hanging by their rope beneath the overhang. This would require them to climb the rope, or swing themselves, or adjust their weight difference significantly so that one of them can reach the rock again. In free climbing, the second climber traditionally belays from a stationary belay position and is not in a position to fall. In simul climbing the second is actively climbing and can sustain a fall. If the second falls while simul climbing the leader catches the fall with their own body. This jolt has a high likelihood of pulling the leader off the rock towards their last piece of gear. This sort of fall has the potential to be devastating for the leader. To avoid this possibility it is traditional to put the better climbers second so that they will not fall. Variations Simul climbing or variations of simul climbing are commonly used while speed climbing.

Laces on mountain road with high sinuosity at Luz Ardiden Rio Cauto at Guamo Embarcadero, Cuba, is not taking the shortest path downslope. Therefore, its sinuosity index is > 1. Two ski tracks with different degrees of sinuosity on the same slope Sinuosity, sinuosity index, or sinuosity coefficient of a continuously differentiable curve having at least one inflection point is the ratio of the curvilinear length (along the curve) and the Euclidean distance (straight line) between the end points of the curve. This dimensionless quantity can also be rephrased as the \\"actual path length\\" divided by the \\"shortest path length\\" of a curve. The value ranges from 1 (case of straight line) to infinity (case of a closed loop, where the shortest path length is zero or for an infinitely-long actual pathLeopold, Luna B., Wolman, M.G., and Miller, J.P., 1964, Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology, San Francisco, W.H. Freeman and Co., 522p.). Interpretation The curve must be continuous (no jump) between the two ends. The sinuosity value is really significant when the line is continuously differentiable (no angular point). The distance between both ends can also be evaluated by a plurality of segments according to a broken line passing through the successive inflection points (sinuosity of order 2). The calculation of the sinuosity is valid in a 3-dimensional space (e.g. for the central axis of the small intestine), although it is often performed in a plane (with then a possible orthogonal projection of the curve in the selected plan; \\"classic\\" sinuosity on the horizontal plane, longitudinal profile sinuosity on the vertical plane). The classification of a sinuosity (e.g. strong / weak) often depends on the cartographic scale of the curve (see the coastline paradox for further details) and of the object velocity which flowing therethrough (river, avalanche, car, bicycle, bobsleigh, skier, high speed train, etc.): the sinuosity of the same curved line could be considered very strong for a high speed train but low for a river.

The sinuosity index can be explained, then, as the deviations from a path defined by the direction of maximum downslope. For this reason, bedrock streams that flow directly downslope have a sinuosity index of 1, and meandering streams have a sinuosity index that is greater than 1. It is also possible to distinguish the case where the stream flowing on the line could not physically travel the distance between the ends: in some hydraulic studies, this leads to assign a sinuosity value of 1 for a torrent flowing over rocky bedrock along a horizontal rectilinear projection, even if the slope angle varies. For rivers, the conventional classes of sinuosity, SI, are: * SI <1.05: almost straight * 1.05 ‚â§ SI <1.25: winding * 1.25 ‚â§ SI <1.50: twisty * 1.50 ‚â§ SI: meandering It has been claimed that river shapes are governed by a self-organizing system that causes their average sinuosity (measured in terms of the source-to-mouth distance, not channel length) to be ,. but this has not been borne out by later studies, which found an average value less than 2..

The basic idea is to use high-energy fast neutrons from a fusion reactor to trigger fission in nonfissile fuels like U-238 or Th-232. Each neutron can trigger several fission events, multiplying the energy released by each fusion reaction hundreds of times, but there is no self-sustaining chain reaction from fission. This would not only make fusion designs more economical in power terms, but also be able to burn fuels that were not suitable for use in conventional fission plants, even their nuclear waste. In general terms, the hybrid is similar in concept to the fast breeder reactor, which uses a compact high-energy fission core in place of the hybrid's fusion core. Another similar concept is the accelerator-driven subcritical reactor, which uses a particle accelerator to provide the neutrons instead of nuclear reactions. History The concept dates to the 1950s, and was strongly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s. At that time the first powerful fusion experiments were being built, but it would still be many years before they could be economically competitive. Hybrids were proposed as a way of greatly accelerating their market introduction, producing energy even before the fusion systems reached break-even. However, detailed studies of the economics of the systems suggested they could not compete with existing fission reactors. The idea was abandoned and lay dormant until the 2000s, when the continued delays in reaching break-even led to a brief revival around 2009. These studies generally concentrated on the nuclear waste disposal aspects of the design, as opposed to the production of energy. The concept has seen cyclical interest since then, based largely on the success or failure of more conventional solutions like the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository Another major design effort for energy production was started at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under their LIFE program. Industry input led to the abandonment of the hybrid approach for LIFE, which was then re- designed as a pure-fusion system. LIFE was cancelled when the underlying technology, from the National Ignition Facility, failed to reach its design performance goals. Apollo Fusion, a company founded by Google executive Mike Cassidy in 2017, was also reported to be focused on using the subcritical nuclear fusion-fission hybrid method.{{cite news newspaper=Forbes url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-03/former-google-vice- president-starts-a-company-promising-clean-and-safe-nuclear-energy title= Former Google Vice President Starts a Company Promising Clean and Safe Nuclear Energy first=Brad last=Stone date=3 April 2017 Their web site is now focussed on their hall effect thrusters, and mentions fusion only in passing. Fission basics Conventional fission power plants rely on the chain reaction caused when nuclear fission events release neutrons that cause further fission events. This process is known as a chain reaction. Each fission event in uranium releases two or three neutrons, so by careful arrangement and the use of various absorber materials the system can be balanced such that one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This careful balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of several isotopes, mainly a trace amount of U-235 and over 99% U-238. When they undergo fission, both of these isotopes release fast neutrons with an energy distribution peaking around 1 to 2 MeV. This energy is too low to cause fission in U-238, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction. U-235 will undergo fission when struck by neutrons of this energy, so it is possible for U-235 to sustain a chain reaction. The probability of one neutron causing fission in another U-235 atom before it escapes the fuel or is captured by some other atom is too low to maintain criticality in a mass of natural uranium, so the chain reaction can only occur in fuels with increased amounts of U-235. This is accomplished by concentrating, or enriching, the fuel, increasing the amount of U-235 to produce enriched uranium, while the leftover, now mostly U-238, is a waste product known as depleted uranium. U-235 will undergo fission more easily if the neutrons are of lower energy, the so-called thermal neutrons. Neutrons can be slowed to thermal energies through collisions with a neutron moderator material, the easiest to use being the hydrogen atoms found in water. By placing the fission fuel in water, the probability that the neutrons will cause fission in another U-235 is greatly increased, which means the level of enrichment needed to reach criticality is greatly reduced. This leads to the concept of reactor-grade enriched uranium, with the amount of U-235 increased from just less than 1% in natural ore to between 3 and 5%, depending on the reactor design. This is in contrast to weapons-grade enrichment, which increases to the U-235 to at least 20%, and more commonly, over 90%. In this case no moderator is needed as the sheer number of U-235 atoms makes it likely most neutrons will cause fission. In order to maintain criticality, the fuel has to retain that extra concentration of U-235. A typical fission reactor burns off enough of the U-235 to cause the reaction to stop over a period on the order of a few months. A combination of burnup of the U-235 along with the creation of neutron absorbers, or poisons, as part of the fission process eventually results in the fuel mass not being able to maintain criticality. This burned up fuel has to be removed and replaced with fresh fuel. The result is nuclear waste that is highly radioactive and filled with long-lived radionuclides that present a safety concern. The waste contains most of the U-235 it started with, only 1% or so of the energy in the fuel is extracted by the time it reaches the point where it is no longer fissile. One solution to this problem is to reprocess the fuel, which uses chemical processes to separate the U-235 (and other non-poison elements) from the waste, and then mixes the extracted U-235 in fresh fuel loads. This reduces the amount of new fuel that needs to be mined and also concentrates the unwanted portions of the waste into a smaller load. Reprocessing is expensive, however, and it has generally been more economical to simply buy fresh fuel from the mine. Like U-235, Pu-239 can maintain a chain reaction, so it is a useful reactor fuel. However, Pu-239 is not found in commercially useful amounts in nature. Another possibility is to breed Pu-239 from the U-238 through neutron capture, or various other means. This process only occurs with higher-energy neutrons than would be found in a moderated reactor, so a conventional reactor only produces small amounts of Pu when the neutron is captured within the fuel mass before it is moderated. More typically, special reactors are used that are designed specifically for the breeding of Pu-239. The simplest way to achieve this is to further enrich the original U-235 fuel well beyond what is needed for use in a moderated reactor, to the point where the U-235 maintains criticality even with the fast neutrons. The extra fast neutrons escaping the fuel load can then be used to breed fuel in a U-238 assembly surrounding the reactor core, most commonly taken from the stocks of depleted uranium. The Pu-239 is then chemically separated and mixed into fresh fuel for conventional reactors, in the same fashion as normal reprocessing, but the total volume of fuel created in this process is much greater. In spite of this, like reprocessing, the economics of breeder reactors has proven unattractive, and commercial breeder plants have ceased operation. Fusion basics Fusion reactors typically burn a mixture of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). When heated to millions of degrees, the kinetic energy in the fuel begins to overcome the natural electrostatic repulsion between nuclei, the so-called coulomb barrier, and the fuel begins to undergo fusion. This reaction gives off an alpha particle and a high energy neutron of 14 MeV. A key requirement to the economic operation of a fusion reactor is that the alphas deposit their energy back into the fuel mix, heating it so that additional fusion reactions take place. This leads to a condition not unlike the chain reaction in the fission case, known as ignition. Deuterium can be obtained by the separation of hydrogen isotopes in sea water (see heavy water production). Tritium has a short half life of just over a decade, so only trace amounts are found in nature. To fuel the reactor, the neutrons from the reaction are used to breed more tritium through a reaction in a blanket of lithium surrounding the reaction chamber. Tritium breeding is key to the success of a D-T fusion cycle, and to date this technique has not been demonstrated. Predictions based on computer modeling suggests that the breeding ratios are quite small and a fusion plant would barely be able to cover its own use. Many years would be needed to breed enough surplus to start another reactor. Hybrid concepts Fusion‚Äìfission designs essentially replace the lithium blanket with a blanket of fission fuel, either natural uranium ore or even nuclear waste. The fusion neutrons have more than enough energy to cause fission in the U-238, as well as many of the other elements in the fuel, including some of the transuranic waste elements. The reaction can continue even when all of the U-235 is burned off; the rate is controlled not by the neutrons from the fission events, but the neutrons being supplied by the fusion reactor. Fission occurs naturally because each event gives off more than one neutron capable of producing additional fission events. Fusion, at least in D-T fuel, gives off only a single neutron, and that neutron is not capable of producing more fusion events. When that neutron strikes fissile material in the blanket, one of two reactions may occur. In many cases, the kinetic energy of the neutron will cause one or two neutrons to be struck out of the nucleus without causing fission. These neutrons still have enough energy to cause other fission events. In other cases the neutron will be captured and cause fission, which will release two or three neutrons. This means that every fusion neutron in the fusion‚Äìfission design can result in anywhere between two and four neutrons in the fission fuel. This is a key concept in the hybrid concept, known as fission multiplication. For every fusion event, several fission events may occur, each of which gives off much more energy than the original fusion, about 11 times. This greatly increases the total power output of the reactor. This has been suggested as a way to produce practical fusion reactors in spite of the fact that no fusion reactor has yet reached break-even, by multiplying the power output using cheap fuel or waste. However, a number of studies have repeatedly demonstrated that this only becomes practical when the overall reactor is very large, 2 to 3 GWt, which makes it expensive to build. These processes also have the side-effect of breeding Pu-239 or U-233, which can be removed and used as fuel in conventional fission reactors. This leads to an alternate design where the primary purpose of the fusion‚Äìfission reactor is to reprocess waste into new fuel. Although far less economical than chemical reprocessing, this process also burns off some of the nastier elements instead of simply physically separating them out. This also has advantages for non- proliferation, as enrichment and reprocessing technologies are also associated with nuclear weapons production. However, the cost of the nuclear fuel produced is very high, and is unlikely to be able to compete with conventional sources. Neutron economy A key issue for the fusion‚Äìfission concept is the number and lifetime of the neutrons in the various processes, the so-called neutron economy. In a pure fusion design, the neutrons are used for breeding tritium in a lithium blanket. Natural lithium consists of about 92% Li-7 and the rest is mostly Li-6. Li-7 breeding requires neutron energies even higher than those released by fission, around 5 MeV, well within the range of energies provided by fusion. This reaction produces tritium and helium-4, and another slow neutron. Li-6 can react with high or low energy neutrons, including those released by the Li-7 reaction. This means that a single fusion reaction can produce several tritiums, which is a requirement if the reactor is going to make up for natural decay and losses in the fusion processes. When the lithium blanket is replaced, or supplanted, by fission fuel in the hybrid design, neutrons that do react with the fissile material are no longer available for tritium breeding. The new neutrons released from the fission reactions can be used for this purpose, but only in Li-6. One could process the lithium to increase the amount of Li-6 in the blanket, making up for these losses, but the downside to this process is that the Li-6 reaction only produces one tritium atom. Only the high-energy reaction between the fusion neutron and Li-7 can create more than one tritium, and this is essential for keeping the reactor running. To address this issue, at least some of the fission neutrons must also be used for tritium breeding in Li-6. Every one that does is no longer available for fission, reducing the reactor output. This requires a very careful balance if one wants the reactor to be able to produce enough tritium to keep itself running, while also producing enough fission events to keep the fission side energy positive. If these cannot be accomplished simultaneously, there is no reason to build a hybrid. Even if this balance can be maintained, it might only occur at a level that is economically infeasible. Overall economy Through the early development of the hybrid concept the question of overall economics appeared difficult to handle. A series of studies starting in the late 1970s provided a much clearer picture of the hybrid in a complete fuel cycle, and allowed the economics to be better understood. These studies appeared to indicate there was no reason to build a hybrid. One of the most detailed of these studies was published in 1980 by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Their study noted that the hybrid would produce most of its energy indirectly, both through the fission events in its own reactor, and much more by providing Pu-239 to fuel conventional fission reactors. In this overall picture, the hybrid is essentially identical to the breeder reactor, which uses fast neutrons from plutonium fission to breed more fuel in a fission blanket in largely the same fashion as the hybrid. Both require chemical processing to remove the bred Pu-239, both presented the same proliferation and safety risks as a result, and both produced about the same amount of fuel. Since that fuel is the primary source of energy in the overall cycle, the two systems were almost identical in the end. What was not identical, however, was the technical maturity of the two designs. The hybrid would require considerable additional research and development before it would be known if it could even work, and even if that were demonstrated, the end result would be a system essentially identical to breeders which were already being built at that time. The report concluded: > The investment of time and money required to commercialize the hybrid cycle > could only be justified by a real or perceived advantage of the hybrid over > the classical FBR. Our analysis leads us to conclude that no such advantage > exists. Therefore, there is not sufficient incentive to demonstrate and > commercialize the fusion‚Äìfission hybrid. Rationale The fusion process alone currently does not achieve sufficient gain (power output over power input) to be viable as a power source. By using the excess neutrons from the fusion reaction to in turn cause a high-yield fission reaction (close to 100%) in the surrounding subcritical fissionable blanket, the net yield from the hybrid fusion‚Äìfission process can provide a targeted gain of 100 to 300 times the input energy (an increase by a factor of three or four over fusion alone). Even allowing for high inefficiencies on the input side (i.e. low laser efficiency in ICF and Bremsstrahlung losses in Tokamak designs), this can still yield sufficient heat output for economical electric power generation. This can be seen as a shortcut to viable fusion power until more efficient pure fusion technologies can be developed, or as an end in itself to generate power, and also consume existing stockpiles of nuclear fissionables and waste products. In the LIFE project at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory LLNL, using technology developed at the National Ignition Facility, the goal is to use fuel pellets of deuterium and tritium surrounded by a fissionable blanket to produce energy sufficiently greater than the input (laser) energy for electrical power generation. The principle involved is to induce inertial confinement fusion (ICF) in the fuel pellet which acts as a highly concentrated point source of neutrons which in turn converts and fissions the outer fissionable blanket. In parallel with the ICF approach, the University of Texas at Austin is developing a system based on the tokamak fusion reactor, optimising for nuclear waste disposal versus power generation. The principles behind using either ICF or tokamak reactors as a neutron source are essentially the same (the primary difference being that ICF is essentially a point-source of neutrons while Tokamaks are more diffuse toroidal sources). Use to dispose of nuclear waste The surrounding blanket can be a fissile material (enriched uranium or plutonium) or a fertile material (capable of conversion to a fissionable material by neutron bombardment) such as thorium, depleted uranium or spent nuclear fuel. Such subcritical reactors (which also include particle accelerator-driven neutron spallation systems) offer the only currently-known means of active disposal (versus storage) of spent nuclear fuel without reprocessing. Fission by- products produced by the operation of commercial light water nuclear reactors (LWRs) are long-lived and highly radioactive, but they can be consumed using the excess neutrons in the fusion reaction along with the fissionable components in the blanket, essentially destroying them by nuclear transmutation and producing a waste product which is far safer and less of a risk for nuclear proliferation. The waste would contain significantly reduced concentrations of long-lived, weapons-usable actinides per gigawatt-year of electric energy produced compared to the waste from a LWR. In addition, there would be about 20 times less waste per unit of electricity produced. This offers the potential to efficiently use the very large stockpiles of enriched fissile materials, depleted uranium, and spent nuclear fuel. Safety In contrast to current commercial fission reactors, hybrid reactors potentially demonstrate what is considered inherently safe behavior because they remain deeply subcritical under all conditions and decay heat removal is possible via passive mechanisms. The fission is driven by neutrons provided by fusion ignition events, and is consequently not self-sustaining. If the fusion process is deliberately shut off or the process is disrupted by a mechanical failure, the fission damps out and stops nearly instantly. This is in contrast to the forced damping in a conventional reactor by means of control rods which absorb neutrons to reduce the neutron flux below the critical, self- sustaining, level. The inherent danger of a conventional fission reactor is any situation leading to a positive feedback, runaway, chain reaction such as occurred during the Chernobyl disaster. In a hybrid configuration the fission and fusion reactions are decoupled, i.e. while the fusion neutron output drives the fission, the fission output has no effect whatsoever on the fusion reaction, completely eliminating any chance of a positive feedback loop. Fuel cycle There are three main components to the hybrid fusion fuel cycle: deuterium, tritium, and fissionable elements. Deuterium can be derived by separation of hydrogen isotopes in sea water (see heavy water production). Tritium may be generated in the hybrid process itself by absorption of neutrons in lithium bearing compounds. This would entail an additional lithium bearing blanket and a means of collection. The third component is externally derived fissionable materials from demilitarized supplies of fissionables, or commercial nuclear fuel and waste streams. Fusion driven fission also offers the possibility of using thorium as a fuel, which would greatly increase the potential amount of fissionables available. The extremely energetic nature of the fast neutrons emitted during the fusion events (up to 0.17 the speed of light) can allow normally non-fissioning U-238 to undergo fission directly (without conversion first to Pu-239), enabling refined natural Uranium to be used with very low enrichment, while still maintaining a deeply subcritical regime. Engineering considerations Practical engineering designs must first take into account safety as the primary goal. All designs should incorporate passive cooling in combination with refractory materials to prevent melting and reconfiguration of fissionables into geometries capable of un-intentional criticality. Blanket layers of Lithium bearing compounds will generally be included as part of the design to generate Tritium to allow the system to be self-supporting for one of the key fuel element components. Tritium, because of its relatively short half-life and extremely high radioactivity, is best generated on site to obviate the necessity of transportation from a remote location. D-T fuel can be manufactured on site using Deuterium derived from heavy water production and Tritium generated in the hybrid reactor itself. Nuclear spallation to generate additional neutrons can be used to enhance the fission output, with the caveat that this is a tradeoff between the number of neutrons (typically 20-30 neutrons per spallation event) against a reduction of the individual energy of each neutron. This is a consideration if the reactor is to use natural Thorium as a fuel. While high energy (0.17c) neutrons produced from fusion events are capable of directly causing fission in both Thorium and U-238, the lower energy neutrons produced by spallation generally cannot. This is a tradeoff which affects the mixture of fuels against the degree of spallation used in the design.

This is an important topic in wrestling since breaks in the skin are easily invaded by bacteria or fungi and wrestling involves constant physical contact that can cause transmission of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. These infections can also be spread through indirect contact, for example, from the skin flora of an infected individual to a wrestling mat, to another wrestler. According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Injury Surveillance System, ten percent of all time-loss injuries in wrestling are due to skin infections.Bubb, Bobert G. \\"Skin Infections.\\" Wrestling Rules and Interpretations (2008): WA-15-A-18.  Common forms of infection  Bacterial infections, or pathogens, make up the largest category of include Furuncles, Carbuncles, Folliculitis, Impetigo, Cellulitis or Erysipelas, and Staphylococcal disease. These range in severity, but most are quickly identified by irritated and blotchy patches of skin. Bacterial infections, of all skin infections, are typically the easiest to treat, using a prescribed anti-bacterial lotion or cr√®me. Molluscum Contagiosum is caused a DNA pox virus called the molluscum contagiosum virus. For adults, molluscum infections are often sexually transmitted, but in wrestling, it is spread either through direct contact or through contact with shared items such as gear or towels. Molluscum Contagiosum can be identified by pink bulbous growths that contain the virus. These typically grow to be 1‚Äì5 millimeters in diameter, and last from 6 to 12 months without treatment and without leaving scars. Some growths may remain for up to 4 years.\\"Bacterial Infections\\" About Infections. 18 Dec. 2008 Treatment for Molluscun Contagiosum must be designated by a healthcare professional because they can be dangerous. Usually for treatment liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze the molluscum off but other methods include other creams that burn the warts off, or oral medications. The herpes simplex virus comes in two different strains, though only one is spread among wrestlers. Type 1 (HSV-1) can be transmitted through contact with an infected individual, and usually associated with sores on the lips, mouth, and face. HSV-1 can also cause infection of the eye, or even infection of the lining of the brain, known as meningoencephalitis. The lesions will heal on their own in 7 to 10 days, unless the infected individual has a condition that weakens the immune system. Once an infection occurs, the virus will spread to nerve cells, where it remains for the rest of the person's life. Occasionally, the virus will suddenly display recurring symptoms, or flares.Berman, Kevin. \\"Molluscum Contagiosum\\" MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia. National Institute of Health. 18 December 2008David, Zieve. \\"Herpes Simplex\\" MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia. National Institute of Health. 18 December 2008 There is no complete treatment for Herpes Simplex 1 but there is prescription medication to help ease and relieve the symptoms of the virus. Antiviral oral medication and topic medication can be prescribed to relieve the pain and soreness of the herpes virus. Verrucae are small skin lesions which can be found on the bottom surface of the foot. They vary in length, from one centimeter in diameter upwards. Verrucae are caused by the human papilloma virus, which is common in all environments but does often attack the skin. The color of the lesion is usually paler then the normal tone of the skin, and is surrounded by a thick layer of calloused skin. Depending on the development of the Verrucae, the surface may show signs of blood vessels, which feed the infection. Advanced Tinea CorporisTinea infections, more commonly known as Ringworm, are the most common skin infections transmitted through wrestling. It is caused by parasitic fungi that survive on keratin, an organic material that is found in skin, hair, and nails. There are several varieties of Tinea, which are classified depending on their location. Tinea corporis is found on the body, tinea cruris (jock itch) on the groin, tinea capitis on the scalp, and tinea pedis (athlete's foot) on the foot. Although they are not harmful, they are highly contagious and difficult to treat. The symptoms of ringworm include patches of skin that are red, swollen, and irritated, forming the shape of a ring. Ringworm will last between two and four weeks with treatment.‚ÄúRingworm‚Äù MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia, U.S. National Library of Medicine. 05-01-2007 Tinea infections can be combatted orally or topically with numerous different medications. Some topical treatments include Mentax 1%, Lamisil 1%, Naftin 1% and Spectazole and these creams should be applied two times a day until the infection is gone. Oral treatments for Tinea include Lamisil, Sporanox, and Diflucan.  Rules  At the start of each wrestling meet, trained referees examine the skin of all wrestlers before any participation. During this examination, male wrestlers are to wear shorts; female wrestlers are only permitted to wear shorts and a sports bra. Open wounds and infectious skin conditions that cannot be adequately protected are considered grounds for disqualification from both practice and competition. This essentially means that the skin condition has been deemed as non-infectious and adequately medicated, covered with a tight wrapping and proper ointment. In addition, the wrestler must have developed no new lesions in the 72 hours before the examination. Wrestlers who are undergoing treatment for a communicable skin disease at the time of the meet or tournament shall provide written documentation to that effect from a physician. This documentation should include the wrestler's diagnosis, culture results (if possible), date and time therapy began, and the exact names of medication for treatment. These measures aren't always successful, and the infection is sometimes spread regardless.  Prevention  According to the NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations and NFHS Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, used by all high schools in the United States: \\"Infection control measures, or measures that seek to prevent the spread of disease, should be utilized to reduce the risks of disease transmission. Efforts should be made to improve wrestler hygiene practices, to utilize recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, and to handle blood and other bodily fluids appropriately. Suggested measures include: promotion of hand hygiene practices; educating athletes not to pick, squeeze, or scratch skin lesions; encouraging athletes to shower after activity; educating athletes not to share protective gear, towels, razors or water bottles; ensuring recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection of wrestling mats, all athletic equipment, locker rooms, and whirlpool tubs are closely followed; and verifying clean up of blood and other potentially infectious materials.\\" More ways of prevention include wearing long sleeve shirts and sweatpants to limit the amount of skin to skin contact. A wrestler should also not share their equipment with other teammates. Body wipes are also common to see Coaches must also enforce the disinfecting and sanitary cleansing of the wrestling mats and other practice areas. This can greatly limit the spread of skin infections that can infect an individual indirectly. One high school wrestling coach from Southern California described his methods of prevention using three simple procedures. ‚ÄúKeep the mats [clean]‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got to bleach and mop them every day before practice. Along the same lines, gear should also be washed regularly, especially headgear‚Ä¶Most importantly, the wrestlers need to shower immediately after practices. If one kid doesn‚Äôt, and he gets [infected], it can spread to everyone else on the team within a week. I‚Äôve had it happen before, to the point where some schools won‚Äôt allow any of our guys to wrestle in a meet. When this happens, it‚Äôs a huge blow to the school‚Äôs record and reputation. In the future, we are less likely to be invited to exclusive tournaments in the coming year.‚Äù  Treatment  For every form of contagious infection, there is a readily available form of medication that can be purchased at any pharmacy. It is a commonly held belief among wrestlers, however, that these ointments do not treat symptoms Sometimes wrestlers who don't want to report an infection to their coach will resort to unusual and unhealthy treatments. Included among these ‚Äòhome remedies‚Äô are nail polish remover, bleach, salt, and vinegar solutions, which are used to either suffocate or burn the infection, often leaving extensive scars. The remedies, while sometimes successful, are not guaranteed to actually kill the infection, often only eliminating visible symptoms temporarily. Even though the infection may no longer be symptomatic, it can still be easily transmitted to other individuals. Because of this, it is recommended that wrestlers attempting to treat skin infections use conventional medicine, as prescribed by a physician.  Significant outbreaks  HSV-1 (July 1989) ‚Äì An outbreak of Herpes Simplex was reported at a four-week high school wrestling camp in Minneapolis, which was attended by wrestlers from 26 states and 1 Canadian province. According to a report on the outbreak: ‚ÄúWrestlers wore jerseys during practice sessions, but the use of headgear was optional. Wrestling mats were mopped twice each day with disinfectant. Epidemiologic and clinical data were collected during the final two days of the camp after officials alerted the Minnesota Department of Health, which, in turn, alerted the Centers for Disease Control. Results from 171 wrestlers (of 175 attendees) showed that 35 percent (60 boys) met the case definition for HSV-1 infection.‚Äù\\"Herpes gladiatorum at a high school wrestling camp - Minnesota\\" American Journal of Diseases of Children 144.n5 (May 1990): 530(1).

The museum is located on the small island of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen next to Christiansborg Palace. Designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll, the building was constructed from 1838‚Äì48 following a public collection of funds in 1837. History The idea of a Bertel Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen emerged in the mid 1830s. A committee was in December 1836 set up at the initiative of Hans Puggaard. Its members included consisting was established b Joakim Frederik Schouw, Henrik Nicolai Clausen, Niels Laurits H√∏yen, Hermann Ernst Freund, Jonas Collin and Just Mathias Thiele. On 10 January 1837, it launched a nation-wide fund raising campaign. The following 15 men were elected as board members on a General Assembly held on 21 June 1837: H.N. Clausen (190 votes), Just Mathias Thiele (189 votes), Jonas Collin (185 votes), N.L. H√∏yen (183 votes), Hermann Ernst Freund (179 votes), J.F.

In addition, Joseph Hambro, Carl Moltke (60 votes), J.H. Lund or J.L. Lund (46 votes), Hans Christian √òrsted (44 votes), Heinrich Reventlow-Criminil (39 votes) were elected as alternates. Architecture Thorvaldsen Museum with Christiansborg Palace The building is strongly inspired by antique Greek architecture and built around an inner courtyard where the artist is buried. The courtyard is notable for being painted in Egyptian motifs: tall date palms; lions and crocodile prowl among exotic birds and plants. The Egyptian influence on the exterior is more chaste. Here, enormous doors in severe trapezoidal style define the architect's intentions to pay homage at once to Attic Greek, Pompeiian and Egyptian style. It is noteworthy for its unique use of colors both inside and outside. Every room in the museum has a unique ceiling decoration in the grotesque style. The outside is adorned with a frieze depicting Thorvaldsen's homecoming from Rome in 1838, made by J√∏rgen Sonne. Collections The museum displays a comprehensive collection of the artist's works in marble as well as plaster, including the original plaster models used in the making of cast bronze and marble statues and reliefs, which are now on display in museums, churches, and at other locations around the world. The museum also features paintings, Greek, Roman and Egyptian antiques, drawings, and prints that Thorvaldsen collected during his lifetime, as well as a wide array of personal belongings that he used in his work and everyday life.

In 2006, Fahim Ahmad allegedly made the gesture when speaking about the possibility of Canadian Security Intelligence Service agents coming to his apartment, which was used as evidence of his conspiracy to commit terrorism by a police informant.  Politics  Jair Bolsonaro making the finger gun gesture = Brazil = The President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro usually makes the finger gun gesture alluding to his ideas of changing the gun control laws to make weapons more accessible to the regular citizen. This gesture became a symbol of the bolsonarism, being used by supporters of it ideology. In 27 September 2019, deputy Eduardo Bolsonaro (PSL) posed for a photo in front of the Non-Violence sculpture at the United Nations headquarters in New York City making the finger gun gesture.

It is a traditional dish in the United Kingdom, especially South and Mid Wales and the English Midlands. (payment required) (payment required) Faggots originated as a traditional cheap food consumed by ordinary country people in Western England, particularly west Wiltshire and the West Midlands. Their popularity spread from there, especially to South Wales in the mid-nineteenth century, when many agricultural workers left the land to work in the rapidly expanding industry and mines of that area. Faggots are also known as \\"ducks\\" in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Lancashire, often as \\"savoury ducks\\". The first use of the term in print was in the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser of Saturday 3 June 1843, a news report of a gluttonous man who ate twelve of them. The first use of the term in print, as cited in the Oxford English Dictionary, dates from 1851, in a piece by Henry Mayhew in which he describes a dish identical to the modern product with chopped liver and lights in an outer wrapper of caul. This was in London. Preparation and serving A faggot being cooked Commonly, a faggot consists of minced pork liver and heart, wrapped in bacon, with onion and breadcrumbs. Often, the faggot is cooked in a crock with gravy and served with peas and mashed potato. The mixture is shaped by hand into small balls, wrapped with caul fat (the omentum membrane from the pig's abdomen), and baked. Faggots may also be made with beef. Another variation of the faggot is pig's fry (testicles) wrapped in pig's caul: the pig's fry and boiled onions are minced (ground) together, then mixed with breadcrumbs or cold boiled potatoes, seasoned with sage, mixed herbs and pepper, all beaten together and then wrapped in small pieces of caul to form a ball. They are then baked in the oven and are usually served cold. Production The dish gained in popularity during the rationing in World War II, but declined over the following decades. The \\"nose-to-tail eating\\" trend has resulted in greater demand for faggots in the 21st century; British supermarket chain Waitrose once again sold beef faggots from 2014 onwards and in 2018 it was estimated that \\"tens of millions\\" of faggots were eaten every year. Faggots are often homemade and are to be found in traditional butchers' shops and market stalls, though larger supermarkets generally stock the Mr Brain's brand of mass-produced faggot; this is a frozen food product available in the UK, made of liver and onions rolled into meatballs and served in a sauce. These differ significantly from traditional faggots, which have a coarser texture and contain far less water. A popular dish is faggots and peas. This combination is common in the Black Country area of the West Midlands. It is still common to see small butchers' shops in the area selling faggots cheaply, made to their own recipe. Double meaning The use of the word \\"faggot\\" has caused controversy due to its additional meaning as a pejorative term for a homosexual man in American English. In 2004, a radio commercial for the UK supermarket chain Somerfield, in which a man rejects his wife's suggested dinner saying \\"I've got nothing against faggots, I just don't fancy them\\" was found to have breached the Advertising and Sponsorship Code and was banned by the industry regulator Ofcom. In November 2013, it was reported that British Facebook users had been blocked temporarily for using the word, in its culinary sense, on the website. Facebook said that the word had been \\"misinterpreted.\\" See also *Meatball *Rissole *Scrapple References Category:British cuisine Category:English cuisine Category:British pork dishes Category:Meatballs Category:Obscenity controversies Category:Offal Category:Welsh cuisine ","title":"Faggot (food)"},{"id":"20767041","title":"Khalatse"},{"id":"20767053","text":"Bachigondanahalli is a village in the southern state of Karnataka, India.Village code= 892300 Bachigondanahalli, Bellary, Karnataka It is located in the Hagaribommanahalli taluk of Bellary district in Karnataka.

However, she soon receives a package from Russia, enclosed with the stake she used on Dimitri, and a note from him saying he was not really staked properly, and was still alive, waiting for Rose to finish school to find him. Rose realizes that with Dimitri still a Strigoi, she has a chance to restore him to his former life, but only by finding Robert Doru.

Loknath and featured music by M. S. Viswanathan. It was released during the Diwali day in 1981. In the titles, Komal Swaminathan was credited for the original story, while screenplay was by K. Balachander. It is said that Komal Swaminathan was fully satisfied with the movie version of his powerful play. Thanneer Thanneer deals with issues such as water scarcity and political corruption. Inhabitants of a drought-ridden village in Tamil Nadu, Athipati, try a cooperative method to bring water to their village, but their attempts are thwarted by unscrupulous politicians who try to use the water problem for their political gains. The film has been highly critically acclaimed and considered a \\"classic\\", and fetched several accolades including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards South. IBN Live included the film in its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. Balachander has revealed that there is no existing copy of the negative of the film anymore.  Plot  Thaneer Thaneer is a political drama and a universal human story based in a dry rural hamlet near Kovilpatti, in the Tamil Nadu state of India. This is a film about administration negligence of suffering villagers, excessive bureaucratic regulation (Red tape), greed, power and powerlessness. When a remote village, Athipatti in Madurai district faces severe water shortages, the inhabitants adopt all possible means to bring their problem to the attention of the authorities. But the process soon reveals the apathetic attitude of politicians, bureaucrats and the press alike. A convict Vellaiswamy (Guhan) wanted for the murder of a local landlord turns the villagers' plight to his advantage and begins a co-operative scheme to transport water in a cart from a spring ten miles away with help of Vathiyar (R. K. Raman). The local politicians try to make people of village to vote for them in election. But all people of the village boycott the elections. The local politician beats the convict and breaks the vehicle used for transporting water. The villagers decide to build canal by themselves. But Alagiri (Radha Ravi), husband of Sevanthi (Saritha) comes to the village and finds the convict hidden in the village. The convict promises to Alagiri that he will surrender after the canal is finished. But fate intervenes in the form of a Public Works Department Officer, who stops villagers from finishing the canal work. The villagers are shot by police. The convict dies due to thirst for water. A villager joins the naxalites. Vathiyar (Vaathiyar Raman) is arrested for aiding the convict. The villagers leave the town. But Sevanthi (Saritha) watches the sky every evening in hope of rain. These incidents are narrated by a Press reporter who had come to the village. The final scene mocks bureaucracy by showing pictures of govt. sponsored meetings for water resource improvement. It shows all the political parties' flags in the farmland. It shows that bureaucracy and politics fail the common man's aspirations.  Cast  * Saritha as Sevanthi * Vaathiyar Raman as Vathiyar * Shunmugham * A. K. Veeraswami * Radha Ravi as Alagiri * Guhan as Vellaisamy  Soundtrack  Soundtrack was composed by M. S. Viswanathan and songs were written by Kannadasan and Vairamuthu.  Reception  Featuring fine performances, this film fared well at many international festivals where it was screened. Audiences were moved by the film's realistic depiction of life in rural India, far removed from the exotic dream world of much popular cinema. P. S. Vaidyanathan of India Today in his review praised the film citing \\"With his masterly touch, Balachander makes every scene throb with life ‚Äì life as it is lived in the raw in India's poverty-stricken villages. Therein lies his ‚Äì and the writer's ‚Äì triumph. And that's what elevates the film far above the general run-of-the-mill movies and the director's own acclaimed previous efforts and converts it into a bold, thought-provoking classic.\\" Saritha's performance was widely appreciated who supposedly lost the national award to Rekha (for Umrao Jaan) that year by a narrow margin.

He was the author of a number of papyrus-letters, mostly addressed to his father Claudius Tiberianus, a veteran settled in Karanis.  Military Service  Claudius Terentianus enlisted in the classis Alexandriae (Alexandrian fleet) sometime around 110 AD. He complained about life in the fleet, and subsequently transferred to a legion. He was deployed to Syria, possibly in relation to Trajan's Parthian campaign, and was wounded quelling civic unrest in Alexandria. He was discharged in 136 AD, and likely settled in the village of Karanis.  Family  Claudius Terentianus repeatedly refers to Claudius Tiberianus as his father. While a few scholars think this may be an honorary title, most believe that Terentianus is Tiberianus' biological son (both do share the same nomen). Terentianus also calls another man named Ptolemaios \\"father\\" (P Mich 5393); this is likely an honorary designator, although Ptolemaios may be his uncle by marriage. Terentianus also refers to a woman he calls his \\"mother\\" living in Alexandria, who is most likely his aunt Tabetheus. If she is the same woman who addresses Claudius Tiberianus as \\"brother\\" in P. Mich 5403, then she was living in Alexandria near where Terentianus was stationed. The same letter mentions that Terentianus had a brother named Isidoros and a sister named Segathis, who are being cared for by the aunt in Alexandria. It may be that Tiberianus was a widower, and entrusted his children to his sister in Alexandria while he was occupied with his own military career.  Letter Highlights  *P Michigan 5390: Results of a shopping spree in Alexandria; request for new boots. *P Michigan 5391: Terentianus recounts his enlistment in the fleet, and requests military equipment. *P Michigan 5393: Dispute with Ptolemaios, his \\"father,\\" addressed to Claudius Terentianus, his father. *P Michigan 5400: A Riot in Alexandria, Terentianus is wounded. Possibly connected to the diaspora revolt of 115-117 AD. References *Adams, J. N. The Vulgar Latin of the Letters of Claudius Terentianus. (P. Mich. VIII 467-72.

It contains high-quality recordings from 40 speakers in Columbus, Ohio conversing freely with an interviewer. The interviewer's voice is heard only faintly in the background of these recordings. The sessions were conducted as Sociolinguistics interviews, and are essentially monologues. The speech has been orthographically transcribed and phonetically labeled. The audio and text files, together with time-aligned phonetic labels, are stored in a format for use with speech analysis software (Xwaves and Wavesurfer). Software for searching the transcription files is also available at the project web site. The corpus is available to researchers in academics and industry. The project was funded by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and the Office of Research at Ohio State University.

The single species that makes up the genus is Jasarum steyermarkii. It was discovered in 1960, but wasn't described until 1977 due to classification difficulties with regards to understanding this species. Jasarum is now believed to be closely related to Caladium and it may have evolved from Caladiums that once grew in seasonal swamps. Jasarum steyermarkii is an aquatic species that is native to two river systems in Venezuela and Guyana. It is found growing in acidic blackwater and is unique in that it is the only submerged aquatic species in Araceae endemic to South America. Jasarum steyermarkii has thin ribbon-like leaves that can get as long as 30 cm. Running down the length of the leaf is a clear midrib that has veins moving at right angles to the edge of the leaf. The spathes produced open above the surface of the water and are about 15 cm long.

In the case of benzodiazepine dependence, however, the continued use seems to be associated with the avoidance of unpleasant withdrawal reaction rather than from the pleasurable effects of the drug. Benzodiazepine dependence develops with long-term use, even at low therapeutic doses, without the described dependence behavior. Addiction consists of people misusing or craving the drug not to relieve withdrawal symptoms, but to experience its euphoric or intoxicating effects. It is necessary to distinguish between addiction to and abuse of benzodiazepines and physical dependence on them. The increased GABAA inhibition caused by benzodiazepines is counteracted by the body's development of tolerance to the drug's effects; the development of tolerance occurs as a result of neuroadaptations, which result in decreased GABA activity and increased excitability of the glutamate system; these adaptations occur as a result of the body trying to overcome the central nervous system depressant effects of the drug to restore homeostasis. When benzodiazepines are stopped, these neuroadaptations are \\"unmasked\\" leading to hyper-excitability of the nervous system and the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Therapeutic dose dependence is the largest category of people dependent on benzodiazepines. These individuals typically do not escalate their doses to high levels or abuse their medication. Smaller groups include patients escalating their dosage to higher levels and drug misusers as well. It is unclear exactly how many people illicitly abuse benzodiazepines. Tolerance develops within days or weeks to the anticonvulsant, hypnotic muscle relaxant and after 4 months there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anxiolytic properties. Some authors, however, disagree and feel that benzodiazepines retain their anxiolytic properties. Long-term benzodiazepine treatment may remain necessary in certain clinical conditions. Numbers of benzodiazepine prescriptions have been declining, due primarily to concerns of dependence. In the short term, benzodiazepines can be effective drugs for acute anxiety or insomnia. With longer-term use, other therapies, both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic, become more effective. This is in part due to the greater effectiveness over time of other forms of therapy, and also due to the eventual development of pharmacological benzodiazepine tolerance. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine dependence include feeling unable to cope without the drug, unsuccessful attempts to cut down or stop benzodiazepine use, tolerance to the effects of benzodiazepines, and withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Some withdrawal symptoms that may appear include anxiety, depressed mood, depersonalisation, derealisation, sleep disturbance, hypersensitivity to touch and pain, tremor, shakiness, muscular aches, pains, twitches, and headache. Benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal have been associated with suicide and self-harming behaviors, especially in young people. The Department of Health substance misuse guidelines recommend monitoring for mood disorder in those dependent on or withdrawing from benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine dependence is a frequent complication for those prescribed for or using for longer than four weeks, with physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms being the most common problem, but also occasionally drug-seeking behavior. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, perceptual disturbances, distortion of all the senses, dysphoria, and, in rare cases, psychosis and epileptic seizures. =Elderly= Long-term use and benzodiazepine dependence is a serious problem in the elderly. Failure to treat benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can cause serious medical complications. The elderly have less cognitive reserve and are more sensitive to the short (e.g., in between dose withdrawal) and protracted withdrawal effects of benzodiazepines, as well as the side-effects both from short-term and long-term use. This can lead to excessive contact with their doctor. Research has found that withdrawing elderly people from benzodiazepines leads to a significant reduction in doctor visits per year, it is presumed, due to an elimination of drug side-effects and withdrawal effects. Tobacco and alcohol are the most common substances that elderly people get a dependence on or misuse. The next-most-common substance that elderly people develop a drug dependence to or misuse is benzodiazepines. Drug-induced cognitive problems can have serious consequences for elderly people and can lead to confusional states and \\"pseudo-dementia\\". About 10% of elderly patients referred to memory clinics actually have a drug-induced cause that most often is benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines have also been linked to an increased risk of road traffic accidents and falls in the elderly. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines are still not fully understood in the elderly or any age group. Long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with attentional and visuospatial functional impairments. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead to improved alertness and decreased forgetfulness in the elderly. Withdrawal led to statistical significant improvements in memory function and performance related skills in those having withdrawn successfully from benzodiazepines, whereas those having remained on benzodiazepines experienced worsening symptoms. People having withdrawn from benzodiazepines also felt their sleep was more refreshing, making statements such as \\"I feel sharper when I wake up\\" or \\"I feel better, more awake\\", or \\"It used to take me an hour to fully wake up.\\" This suggests that benzodiazepines may actually make insomnia worse in the elderly. Cause Tolerance occurs to the muscle- relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon cessation a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs. This can lead to benzodiazepines being taken for longer than originally intended, as people continue to take the drugs over a long period of time to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a lot of time to doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV for substance abuse and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia escalate their dosage, sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed dose levels. Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients escalated their dosage. Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that the drugs are acting to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects which can be mistaken as continued drug efficacy. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing effects of benzodiazepines occurs within a few weeks in most patients. =Risk factors= The risk factors for benzodiazepine dependence are long-term use beyond four weeks, use of high doses, use of potent short-acting benzodiazepines, dependent personalities, and proclivity for drug abuse. Use of short-acting benzodiazepines leads to repeated withdrawal effects that are alleviated by the next dose, which reinforce in the individual the dependence. A physical dependence develops more quickly with higher potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax) than with lower potency benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Symptom severity is worse with the use of high doses, or with benzodiazepines of high potency or short half-life. Other cross-tolerant sedative hypnotics, such as barbiturates or alcohol, increase the risk of benzodiazepine dependence. Similar to opioids' use for pain, therapeutic use of benzodiazepines rarely leads to substance abuse. MechanismTolerance and physical dependence= Tolerance develops rapidly to the sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines. The anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effects last for a few weeks before tolerance develops in most individuals. Tolerance results in a desensitization of GABA receptors and an increased sensitization of the excitatory neurotransmitter system, such as NMDA glutamate receptors. These changes occur as a result of the body trying to overcome the drug's effects. Other changes that occur are the reduction of the number of GABA receptors (downregulation) as well as possibly long-term changes in gene transcription coding of brain cells. The differing speed at which tolerance occurs to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines can be explained by the speed of changes in the range of neurotransmitter systems and subsystems that are altered by chronic benzodiazepine use. The various neurotransmitter systems and subsystems may reverse tolerance at different speeds, thus explaining the prolonged nature of some withdrawal symptoms. As a result of a physical dependence that develops due to tolerance, a characteristic benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome often occurs after removal of the drug or a reduction in dosage. Changes in the expression of neuropeptides such as corticotropin- releasing hormone and neuropeptide Y may play a role in benzodiazepine dependence. Individuals taking daily benzodiazepine drugs have a reduced sensitivity to further additional doses of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to benzodiazepines can be demonstrated by injecting diazepam into long-term users. In normal subjects, increases in growth hormone occurs, whereas, in benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals, this effect is blunted. Animal studies have shown that repeated withdrawal from benzodiazepines leads to increasingly severe withdrawal symptoms, including an increased risk of seizures; this phenomenon is known as kindling. Kindling phenomena are well established for repeated ethanol (alcohol) withdrawal; alcohol has a very similar mechanism of tolerance and withdrawal to benzodiazepines, involving the GABAa, NMDA, and AMPA receptors. The shift of benzodiazepine receptors to an inverse agonist state after chronic treatment leads the brain to be more sensitive to excitatory drugs or stimuli. Excessive glutamate activity can result in excitotoxicity, which may result in neurodegeneration. The glutamate receptor subtype NMDA is well known for its role in causing excito-neurotoxicity. The glutamate receptor subtype AMPA is believed to play an important role in neuronal kindling as well as excitotoxicity during withdrawal from alcohol as well as benzodiazepines. It is highly possible that NMDA receptors are involved in the tolerance to some effects of benzodiazepines. Animal studies have found that glutamergic changes as a result of benzodiazepine use are responsible for a delayed withdrawal syndrome, which in mice peaks 3 days after cessation of benzodiazepines. This was demonstrated by the ability to avoid the withdrawal syndrome by the administration of AMPA antagonists. It is believed that different glutamate subreceptors, e.g., NMDA and AMPA, are responsible for different stages/time points of the withdrawal syndrome. NMDA receptors are upregulated in the brain as a result of benzodiazepine tolerance. AMPA receptors are also involved in benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal. A decrease in benzodiazepine binding sites in the brain may also occur as part of benzodiazepine tolerance. =Cross tolerance= Benzodiazepines share a similar mechanism of action with various sedative compounds that act by enhancing the GABAA receptor. Cross tolerance means that one drug will alleviate the withdrawal effects of another. It also means that tolerance of one drug will result in tolerance of another similarly-acting drug. Benzodiazepines are often used for this reason to detoxify alcohol- dependent patients and can have life-saving properties in preventing or treating severe life-threatening withdrawal syndromes from alcohol, such as delirium tremens. However, although benzodiazepines can be very useful in the acute detoxification of alcoholics, benzodiazepines in themselves act as positive reinforcers in alcoholics, by increasing the desire for alcohol. Low doses of benzodiazepines were found to significantly increase the level of alcohol consumed in alcoholics. Alcoholics dependent on benzodiazepines should not be abruptly withdrawn but be very slowly withdrawn from benzodiazepines, as over-rapid withdrawal is likely to produce severe anxiety or panic, which is well known for being a relapse risk factor in recovering alcoholics. There is cross tolerance between alcohol, the benzodiazepines, the barbiturates, the nonbenzodiazepine drugs, and corticosteroids, which all act by enhancing the GABAA receptor's function via modulating the chloride ion channel function of the GABAA receptor.World Health Organisation - Assessment of Zopiclone Neuroactive steroids, e.g., progesterone and its active metabolite allopregnanolone, are positive modulators of the GABAA receptor and are cross tolerant with benzodiazepines. The active metabolite of progesterone has been found to enhance the binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine binding sites on the GABAA receptor. The cross-tolerance between GABAA receptor positive modulators occurs because of the similar mechanism of action and the subunit changes that occur from chronic use from one or more of these compounds in expressed receptor isoforms. Abrupt withdrawal from any of these compounds, e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, corticosteroids, neuroactive steroids, and nonbenzodiazepines, precipitate similar withdrawal effects characterized by central nervous system hyper-excitability, resulting in symptoms such as increased seizure susceptibility and anxiety. While many of the neuroactive steroids do not produce full tolerance to their therapeutic effects, cross-tolerance to benzodiazepines still occurs as had been demonstrated between the neuroactive steroid ganaxolone and diazepam. Alterations of levels of neuroactive steroids in the body during the menstrual cycle, menopause, pregnancy, and stressful circumstances can lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and a reduced therapeutic effect. During withdrawal of neuroactive steroids, benzodiazepines become less effective. =Physiology of withdrawal= Withdrawal symptoms are a normal response in individuals having chronically used benzodiazepines, and an adverse effect and result of drug tolerance. Symptoms typically emerge when dosage of the drug is reduced. GABA is the second-most-common neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (the most common being glutamate) and by far the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA. The use of benzodiazepines has a profound effect on almost every aspect of brain and body function, either directly or indirectly. Benzodiazepines cause a decrease in norepinephrine (noradrenaline), serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine. These neurotransmitters are needed for normal memory, mood, muscle tone and coordination, emotional responses, endocrine gland secretions, heart rate, and blood pressure control. With chronic benzodiazepine use, tolerance develops rapidly to most of its effects, so that, when benzodiazepines are withdrawn, various neurotransmitter systems go into overdrive due to the lack of inhibitory GABA-ergic activity. Withdrawal symptoms then emerge as a result, and persist until the nervous system physically reverses the adaptions (physical dependence) that have occurred in the CNS. Withdrawal symptoms typically consist of a mirror image of the drug's effects: Sedative effects and suppression of REM and SWS stages of sleep can be replaced by insomnia, nightmares, and hypnogogic hallucinations; its antianxiety effects are replaced with anxiety and panic; muscle-relaxant effects are replaced with muscular spasms or cramps; and anticonvulsant effects are replaced with seizures, especially in cold turkey or overly-rapid withdrawal. Benzodiazepine withdrawal represents in part excitotoxicity to brain neurons. Rebound activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis also plays an important role in the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to alterations in gene expression, which results in long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system. During withdrawal from full or partial agonists, changes occur in benzodiazepine receptor with upregulation of some receptor subtypes and downregulation of other receptor subtypes. =Withdrawal= Long-term use of benzodiazepines leads to increasing physical and mental health problems, and as a result, discontinuation is recommended for many long-term users. The withdrawal syndrome from benzodiazepines can range from a mild and short-lasting syndrome to a prolonged and severe syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms can lead to continued use of benzodiazepines for many years, long after the original reason for taking benzodiazepines has passed. Many patients know that the benzodiazepines no longer work for them but are unable to discontinue benzodiazepines because of withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can emerge despite slow reduction but can be reduced by a slower rate of withdrawal. As a result, withdrawal rates have been recommended to be customized to each individual patient. The time needed to withdrawal can vary from a couple of months to a year or more and often depends on length of use, dosage taken, lifestyle, health, and social and environmental stress factors. Diazepam is often recommended due to its long elimination half-life and also because of its availability in low potency doses. The non- benzodiazepine Z drugs such as zolpidem, zaleplon, and zopiclone should not be used as a replacement for benzodiazepines, as they have a similar mechanism of action and can induce a similar dependence. The pharmacological mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is the internalization (removal) of receptor site in the brain and changes in gene transcription codes in the brain. With long-term use and during withdrawal of benzodiazepines, treatment- emergent depression and emotional blunting may emerge and sometimes also suicidal ideation. There is evidence that the higher the dose used the more likely it is benzodiazepine use will induce these feelings. Reducing the dose or discontinuing benzodiazepines may be indicated in such cases. Withdrawal symptoms can persist for quite some time after discontinuing benzodiazepines. Some common protracted withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal effects. The protracted withdrawal state may still occur despite slow titration of dosage. It is believed that the protracted withdrawal effects are due to persisting neuroadaptations. Diagnosis For a diagnosis of benzodiazepine dependence to be made, the ICD-10 requires that at least 3 of the below criteria are met and that they have been present for at least a month, or, if less than a month, that they appeared repeatedly during a 12-month period. * Behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that are associated with the repeated use and that typically include a strong desire to take the drug. * Difficulty controlling use * Continued use despite harmful consequences * Preference given to drug use rather than to other activities and obligations * Increased tolerance to effects of the drug and sometimes a physical withdrawal state. These diagnostic criteria are good for research purposes, but, in everyday clinical practice, they should be interpreted according to clinical judgement. In clinical practice, benzodiazepine dependence should be suspected in those having used benzodiazepines for longer than a month, in particular, if they are from a high-risk group. The main factors associated with an increased incidence of benzodiazepine dependence include: * Dose * Duration * Concomitant use of antidepressants Benzodiazepine dependence should be suspected also in individuals having substance use disorders including alcohol, and should be suspected in individuals obtaining their own supplies of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine dependence is almost certain in individuals who are members of a tranquilizer self-help group. Research has found that about 40 percent of people with a diagnosis of benzodiazepine dependence are not aware that they are dependent on benzodiazepines, whereas about 11 percent of people judged not to be dependent believe that they are. When assessing a person for benzodiazepine dependence, asking specific questions rather than questions based on concepts is recommended by experts as the best approach of getting a more accurate diagnosis. For example, asking persons if they \\"think about the medication at times of the day other than when they take the drug\\" would provide a more meaningful answer than asking \\"do you think you are psychologically dependent?\\". The Benzodiazepine Dependence Self Report Questionnaire is one questionnaire used to assess and diagnose benzodiazepine dependence. =Definition= Benzodiazepine dependence is the condition resulting from repeated use of benzodiazepine drugs. It can include both a physical dependence as well as a psychological dependence and is typified by a withdrawal syndrome upon a fall in blood plasma levels of benzodiazepines, e.g., during dose reduction or abrupt withdrawal. Prevention Due to the risk of developing tolerance, dependence, and adverse health effects, such as cognitive impairment, benzodiazepines are indicated for short-term use only - a few weeks, followed by a gradual dose reduction. =The Committee on the Review of Medicines (UK)= The Committee on the Review of Medicines carried out a review into benzodiazepines due to significant concerns of tolerance, drug dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal problems, and other adverse effects and published the results in the British Medical Journal in March 1980. The committee found that benzodiazepines do not have any antidepressant or analgesic properties and are, therefore, unsuitable treatments for conditions such as depression, tension headaches, and dysmenorrhea. Benzodiazepines are also not beneficial in the treatment of psychosis. The committee also recommended against benzodiazepines for use in the treatment of anxiety or insomnia in children. The committee was in agreement with the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (USA) that there is little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics are beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due to the development of tolerance. Benzodiazepines tend to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3‚Äì14 days of continuous use, and, in the treatment of anxiety, the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retains efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after 4 months of continuous use due to the development of tolerance. The committee found that the regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterized by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremors, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal symptoms tend to develop within 24 hours upon cessation of short-acting benzodiazepines, and 3‚Äì10 days after cessation of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Withdrawal effects could occur after treatment, lasting only 2 weeks at therapeutic dose levels; however, withdrawal effects tend to occur with habitual use beyond 2 weeks and are more likely the higher the dose. The withdrawal symptoms may appear to be similar to the original condition. The committee recommended that all benzodiazepine treatment be withdrawn gradually and recommended that benzodiazepine treatment be used only in carefully selected patients and that therapy be limited to short-term use only. It was noted in the review that alcohol can potentiate the central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines and should be avoided. The central nervous system-depressant effects of benzodiazepines may make driving or operating machinery dangerous, and the elderly are more prone to these adverse effects. High single doses or repeated low doses have been reported to produce hypotonia, poor sucking, and hypothermia in the neonate, and irregularities in the fetal heart. The committee recommended that benzodiazepines be avoided in lactation. The committee recommended that withdrawal from benzodiazepines be gradual, as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea. The committee also made a mistake concluding: Treatment Benzodiazepines are regarded as a highly addictive drug class. A psychological and physical dependence can develop in as short as a few weeks but may take years to develop in other individuals. Patients wanting to withdraw from benzodiazepines typically receive little advice or support, and such withdrawal should be by small increments over a period of months. Benzodiazepines are usually prescribed only short-term, as there is little justification for their prescribing long-term. Some doctors however, disagree and believe long-term use beyond 4 weeks is sometimes justified, although there is little data to support this viewpoint. Such viewpoints are a minority in the medical literature. There is no evidence that \\"drug holidays\\" or periods of abstinence reduced the risk of dependence; there is evidence from animal studies that such an approach does not prevent dependence from happening. Use of short-acting benzodiazepines is associated with interdose withdrawal symptoms. Kindling has clinical relevance with regard to benzodiazepines; for example, there is an increasing shift to use of benzodiazepines with a shorter half-life and intermittent use, which can result in interdose withdrawal and rebound effects. =Cognitive behavioral therapy= Cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be more effective for the long-term management of insomnia than sedative hypnotic drugs. No formal withdrawal programs for benzodiazepines exists with local providers in the UK. Meta-analysis of published data on psychological treatments for insomnia show a success rate between 70 and 80%.no citation A large-scale trial utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy in chronic users of sedative hypnotics including nitrazepam, temazepam, and zopiclone found CBT to be a significantly more effective long-term treatment for chronic insomnia than sedative hypnotic drugs. Persisting improvements in sleep quality, sleep onset latency, increased total sleep, improvements in sleep efficiency, significant improvements in vitality, physical and mental health at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups were found in those receiving CBT. A marked reduction in total sedative hypnotic drug use was found in those receiving CBT, with 33% reporting zero hypnotic drug use. Age has been found not to be a barrier to successful outcome of CBT. It was concluded that CBT for the management of chronic insomnia is a flexible, practical, and cost-effective treatment, and it was also concluded that CBT leads to a reduction of benzodiazepine drug intake in a significant number of patients. Chronic use of hypnotic medications is not recommended due to their adverse effects on health and the risk of dependence. A gradual taper is usual clinical course in getting people off of benzodiazepines, but, even with gradual reduction, a large proportion of people fail to stop taking benzodiazepines. The elderly are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of hypnotic medications. A clinical trial in elderly people dependent on benzodiazepine hypnotics showed that the addition of CBT to a gradual benzodiazepine reduction program increased the success rate of discontinuing benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs from 38% to 77% and at the 12-month follow-up from 24% to 70%. The paper concluded that CBT is an effective tool for reducing hypnotic use in the elderly and reducing the adverse health effects that are associated with hypnotics such as drug dependence, cognitive impairments, and increased road traffic accidents. A study of patients undergoing benzodiazepine withdrawal who had a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder showed that those having received CBT had a very high success rate of discontinuing benzodiazepines compared to those not having receive CBT. This success rate was maintained at the 12-month follow- up. Furthermore, it was found that, in patients having discontinued benzodiazepines, they no longer met the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, and that the number of patients no longer meeting the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder was higher in the group having received CBT. Thus, CBT can be an effective tool to add to a gradual benzodiazepine dosage reduction program leading to improved and sustained mental health benefits (Disputed). =Letter to patients= Sending a letter to patients warning of the adverse effects of long-term use of benzodiazepines and recommending dosage reduction has been found to be successful and a cost-effective strategy in reducing benzodiazepine consumption in general practice. Within a year of the letter's going out, there was found to be a 17% fall in the number of benzodiazepines being prescribed, with 5% of patients having totally discontinued benzodiazepines. A study in the Netherlands reported a higher success rate by sending a letter to patients who are benzodiazepine-dependent. The results of the Dutch study reported 11.3% of patients discontinuing benzodiazepines completely within a year. =Flumazenil= Flumazenil delivered via slow subcutaneous infusion represents a safe procedure for those withdrawing from long-term, high dose benzodiazepine dependency. It has a low risk of seizures even amongst those who have experienced convulsions when previously attempting benzodiazepine withdrawal. Epidemiology Research studies have come to different conclusions on the number of therapeutic dose users who develop a physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. Estimates by researchers of the number of people affected range 20‚Äì100% of patients prescribed benzodiazepines at therapeutic dosages long term are physically dependent and will experience withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines can be addictive and induce dependence even at low doses, with 23% becoming addicted within 3 months of use. Benzodiazepine addiction is considered a public health problem. Approximately 68.5% of prescriptions of benzodiazepines originate from local health centers, with psychiatry and general hospitals accounting for 10% each. A survey of general practitioners reported that the reason for initiating benzodiazepines was due to an empathy for the patients suffering and a lack of other therapeutic options rather than patients demanding them. However, long-term use was more commonly at the insistence of the patient, it is presumed, because physical dependence or addiction had developed. Approximately twice as many women as men are prescribed benzodiazepines. It is believed that this is largely because men typically turned to alcohol to cope with stress and women to prescription drugs. Biased perception of women by male doctors may also play a role in increased prescribing rates to women; however, increased anxiety features in women does not account for the wide gap alone between men and women. Based on findings in the US from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), an annual compilation of patient characteristics in substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States, admissions due to \\"primary tranquilizer\\" (including, but not limited to, benzodiazepine-type) drug use increased 79% from 1992 to 2002. A study published in the British Journal of General Practice in July 2017 found that in a sample taken from a survey conducted in 2014‚Äì2015 in Bradford a mean of 0.69% of registered patients had been prescribed benzodiazepines for more than a year. This would suggest that there were around 300,000 long-term users of diazepine in the UK. History Previously, physical dependence on benzodiazepines was largely thought to occur only in people on high-therapeutic-dose ranges. Low- or normal-dose dependence was not suspected until the 1970s, and it was not until the early 1980s that it was confirmed. Low-dose dependence has now been clearly demonstrated in both animal studies and human studies, and is a recognized clinical disadvantage of benzodiazepines. Severe withdrawal syndromes can occur from these low doses of benzodiazepines even after gradual dose reduction. An estimated 30‚Äì45% of chronic low-dose benzodiazepine users are dependent and it has been recommended that benzodiazepines even at low dosage be prescribed for a maximum of 7‚Äì14 days to avoid dependence. As a result, the global trend is toward strict regulations for the prescription of benzodiazepines due to this risk of low-dose dependence. Some controversy remains, however, in the medical literature as to the exact nature of low-dose dependence and the difficulty in getting patients to discontinue their benzodiazepines, with some papers attributing the problem to predominantly drug-seeking behavior and drug craving, whereas other papers having found the opposite, attributing the problem to a problem of physical dependence with drug-seeking and craving not being typical of low-dose benzodiazepine users. Society and cultureMisuse and addiction= Lorazepam (Ativan) tablets. Benzodiazepines are one of the largest classes of abused drugs; they are classed as schedule IV controlled drugs because of their recognized medical uses. Across the world the most frequently diverted and abused benzodiazepines include temazepam, diazepam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, and in the United States alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam. Benzodiazepines can cause serious addiction problems. A survey of doctors in Senegal found that many doctors feel that their training and knowledge of benzodiazepines is, in general, poor; a study in Dakar found that almost one-fifth of doctors ignored prescribing guidelines regarding short- term use of benzodiazepines, and almost three-quarters of doctors regarded their training and knowledge of benzodiazepines to be inadequate. More training regarding benzodiazepines has been recommended for doctors. Due to the serious concerns of addiction, national governments were recommended to urgently seek to raise knowledge via training about the addictive nature of benzodiazepines and appropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines. A six-year study on 51 Vietnam veterans who were drug abusers of either mainly stimulants (11 people), mainly opiates (26 people), or mainly benzodiazepines (14 people) was carried out to assess psychiatric symptoms related to the specific drugs of abuse. After six years, opiate abusers had little change in psychiatric symptomatology; five of the stimulant users had developed psychosis, and eight of the benzodiazepine users had developed depression. Therefore, long-term benzodiazepine abuse and dependence seems to carry a negative effect on mental health, with a significant risk of causing depression. Benzodiazepines are also sometimes abused intra-nasally. In the elderly, alcohol and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused substances, and the elderly population is more susceptible to benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and delirium than are younger patients.

Review by Livia Capponi  Military career  Claudius Tiberianus first appears as a speculator legionis, a legionary soldier on detachment as a special agent to the provincial governor. He holds this title at the time his son Terentianus enrolled in the fleet at Alexandria, around 110 AD. Shortly thereafter, he retired, and is subsequently referred to as a veteran. Terentianus writes to Tiberianus requesting both military equipment as well as contacts to help him transfer from the fleet to a legion.  Family  It is generally held that Claudius Tiberianus had at least one son, Claudius Terentianus. In addition, a letter from a sister in Alexandria refers to two other children, Isidorus and Segathis. In all likelihood, this sister is the woman named Tabetheus who identifies herself as his sister in a different letter. Tabetheus is the mother of a man named Saturnilus, who subsequently murdered a man. Tabetheus sought help from Tiberianus in paying the blood money to settle the murder charge. While it is possible that Tiberianus is merely a patron to all the people mentioned in the letters, and the kinship terms of \\"father\\" and \\"brother\\" are honorific, in all likelihood most of the correspondents in the Tiberianus archive represent blood relatives.

It is common in tropical climates.Stedman's Electronic Medical Dictionary Ulcers occur on exposed parts of the body, primarily on anterolateral aspect of the lower limbs and may erode muscles and tendons, and sometimes, the bones.Medcyclopedia-Tropical ulcer These lesions may frequently develop on preexisting abrasions or sores sometimes beginning from a mere scratch. Signs and symptoms The vast majority of the tropical ulcers occur below the knee, usually around the ankle. They may also occur on arms. They are often initiated by minor trauma, and subjects with poor nutrition are at higher risk. Once developed, the ulcer may become chronic and stable, but also it can run a destructive course with deep tissue invasion, osteitis, and risk of amputation. Unlike Buruli ulcer, tropical ulcers are very painful. Lesions begin with inflammatory papules that progress into vesicles and rupture with the formation of an ulcer. Chronic ulcers involve larger area and may eventually develop into squamous epithelioma after 10 years or more. =Complications= *Skin color: Rarely, Jungle rot will result in complications with skin pigmentation. It has been known to leave the victim with different colors such as bright red, blue, green, and a rare color change of orange. *Deep tissue invasion - Infection may spread deep to the subcutaneous tissue, but rarely involve the bone *Chronic ulceration - characterised by thick rim of fibrous tissue around the ulcer edges *Recurrent ulceration - most commonly happen in children *Squamous cell carcinoma - may develop at the rate of 2 to 15% of the chronic ulcers that persists for more than three years *Tetanus: by entry of tetanus bacilli through the ulcer. Microbiology There is now considerable evidence to suggest that this disease is an infection. Mycobacterium ulcerans has recently been isolated from lesions and is unique to tropical ulcers. Early lesions may be colonized or infected by, Bacillus fusiformis (Vincent's organism), anaerobes and spirochaetes. Later, tropical ulcer may become infected with a variety of organisms, notably, staphylococci and/or streptococci. The condition has been shown to be transmissible by inoculation of material from affected patients. Prevention Adequate footwear is important to prevent trauma. General good health and nutrition also reduce ulcer risk. Adequate and prompt cleansing and treatment of ankle and leg skin breaks is also important. Improving hygiene and nutrition may help to prevent tropical ulcers. Treatment *Antibiotics: In early stages, penicillin or metronidazole are used in combination with topical antiseptic. *Improved nutrition and vitamins. *Non-adherent dressings and elevation of limbs. *Large infected ulcers may require debridement under anesthesia. *Skin grafting may be helpful in advanced cases to ensure the lesion does not progress to chronic stage. *In extreme cases, amputation is necessary. Epidemiology Tropical ulcer has been described as a disease of the 'poor and hungry'; it may be that slowly improving socioeconomic conditions and nutrition account for its decline. Urbanization of populations could be another factor, as tropical ulcer is usually a rural problem. More widespread use of shoes and socks also provides protection from initiating trauma. Despite this, susceptible individuals still develop tropical ulcers. Sometimes outbreaks can occur; one was recorded in Tanzania in sugarcane workers cutting the crops while barefoot. Tropical ulcers can also occur to the visitors of tropics. The disease is most common in native laborers and in schoolchildren of the tropics and subtropics during the rainy season and is caused in many instances by the bites of insects, poor hygiene, and pyogenic infections. Males are more commonly infected than females. =Geographic distribution= Tropical ulcer is seen throughout the tropics and subtropics.

He was born on 16 October 1861 in Alsisar, India. His father was Thakur Chattu Singh, a resident of Alsisar. Ajit Singh was later adopted to Khetri and after the death of Fateh Singh, he became the eighth king of Khetri in 1870. In 1876 he married Rani Champawatiji Sahiba and the couple had one son and two daughters. He died on 18 January 1901 at Sikandra, and was cremated at Mathura.

Though Khetri was small in size, the state was one of the most advanced and progressed states of Rajasthan of that time. Ajit Singh was a big admirer of arts and music. In 1897 he went to England to attend Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. = Marriage and personal life = In 1876 Ajit Singh married Rani Champawatiji Sahiba, daughter of Thakur Devi Singh of Auwa. Rani Champawatiji Sahiba died on 16 May 1904. Ajit Singh and Champawatiji Sahiba had two daughters and one son. * Their first daughter, Surya Kumari, was born on 16 September 1882, married Rajadhiraja Sahib Umaid Singhji II Bahadur of Shahpura in 1894. Surya Kumari died on 8 August 1913 at Shahpura. * Their second daughter, Chandra Kumari, was born on 17 January 1889. She married Maan Singh of Pratapgarh in 1903. * Their only son, Jai Singh Sahib, was born in Agra on 26 January 1893. He studied at Mayo College, Ajmer. In 1901, after the death of Ajit Singh, Jai became the ninth king of Khetri. In 1905 he established Ajit Singh Hospital in memory of his father. He died on 30 March 1910 in Jaipur after suffering from tuberculosis. = Death = Ajit Singh died on 18 January 1901 in Sikandara, and was cremated at Mathura. At the time of death he was 39 years 3 months old. Incidentally Swami Vivekananda too died at the age of 39. In a letter written to Marhy Hale, on 18 May 1901, Vivekananda informed‚Äî > The Raja of Khetri died from a fall a few months ago. So you see things are > all gloomy with me just now, and my own health is wretched. Yet I am sure to > bob up soon and am waiting for the next turn. In a separate letter written to Mrs. Ole Bull on 26 January 1901, Swami Vivekananda wrote: > I went to see Mrs. Sevier at Mayavati. On my way I learnt of the sudden > death of the Raja of Khetri. It appears he was restoring some old > architectural monument at Agra, at his own expense, and was up some tower on > inspection. Part of the tower came down, and he was instantly killed.  Relationship with Swami Vivekananda  Since the first meeting in June 1891 till Ajit Singh's death in January 1901, Ajit Singh remained a very close friend and disciple of Vivekananda. On 22 November 1898 Vivekananda sent a letter to Ajit Singh in which he described Ajit Singh as his only friend in life. = First meeting with Swami Vivekananda (1891) = After the death of Ramakrishna, in January 1887 Vivekananda (then Narendranath Datta) and eight other disciples of Ramakrishna took their formal monastic vow at Baranagar math. In 1888, Vivekananda left the monastery of Baranagar and started his life as a wandering monk. In June 1891 Vivekananda reached Khetri and there on 4 June 1891 he met Ajit Singh for the first time. Ajit Singh's first meeting with Vivekananda has been described in detail in some later books. According to Mani Shankar Mukherjee's The Monk As Man: The Unknown Life of Swami Vivekananda, on 4 June 1891, Ajit Singh woke up at 6:30 am. That evening he met Pratap Singh, king of Jodhpur and spent around half an hour with him. After that he was informed that a monk has come to see him. Ajit Singh met the monk. Ajit Singh found that the monk was proficient in English, Bengali and Sanskrit languages. Ajit Singh and the monk discussed on a wide range of subjects. Then Ajit Singh asked the monk to dine with him. After dinner, around 11 pm at the night, the monk left the palace of Ajit Singh. The monk was Swami Vivekananda and this was the first meeting of Ajit Singh and Vivekananda. On his first visit to Khetri Vivekananda stayed there from 4 June 1891 to 27 October 1891. During his time as a wandering monk this was Vivekananda's longest stay at a single place. To protect him from hot wind of Rajasthan, Ajit Singh suggested that Vivekananda wear a turban and showed him how to wear it in the Rajasthani style. Vivekananda learned the technique very quickly and later invented a few other variations of wearing it. Later in his life, the turban became a part of his common dress. During his stay Vivekananda closely observed the culture and lifestyle of Rajputana and later praised it in his lectures and letters. = Second meeting with Swami Vivekananda (1893) = Swami Vivekananda visited Khetri twice more in his lifetime‚Äî in April 1893 and in December 1897. In 1893, Vivekananda stayed in Khetri for three weeks‚Äî from 21 April to 10 May. An incident that happened during his second visit, which was later widely analysed, relates to Ajit Singh organizing a function where a courtesan was to sing. Ajit Singh invited Vivekananda to attend the performance but Vivekananda refused the request, explaining that he was a monk and thus could not attend such performances. The dancing girl heard about this comment and at the function she sang a famous song by Sur‚Äî O Lord, look not upon my evil qualities! Thy name, O Lord, is Same-Sightedness. Make us both the same Brahman! The incident was an eye- opener for Vivekananda and he realized that everything is but the manifestation of God. On 9 May, one day before leaving for Bombay, Vivekananda was asked to visit the women's section of the palace where he blessed Jai Singh, the newborn son of Ajit Singh.  Assistance and encouragement to join Parliament of World's religions  Vivekananda wished to sail to America to attend the Parliament of the World's Religions as a speaker which was to be held in Chicago in 1893. When Ajit Singh learned about this, he encouraged Vivekananda to join the Parliament as a representative of Hinduism and India and provided him financial aid and the tickets for his voyage. It was on Ajit Singh's request that Swamiji assumed his monastic name Vivekananda in preference to Sachidananda. In a letter written to Haridas Viharidas Desai in May 1893, Vivekananda wrote‚Äî > You may remember that I had from before a desire to go to Chicago. When at > Madras, the people there, of their own accord, in conjunction with H.H. of > Mysore and Ramnad made every arrangement to send me up. And you may also > remember that between H.H. of Khetri and myself there are the closest ties > of love. Well, I, as a matter of course, wrote to him that I was going to > America. Now the Raja of Khetri thought in his love that I was bound to see > him once before I departed, especially as the Lord has given him an heir to > the throne and great rejoicings were going on here; and to make sure of my > coming he sent his Private Secretary all the way to Madras to fetch me, and > of course I was bound to come. On 10 May 1893, Vivekananda left Khetri for Bombay. Ajit Singh escorted him till Jaipur and Munshi Jagmohahlal, an employee of Khetri, escorted him up to Bombay. Ajit Singh arranged to send more money to Vivekananda after his arrival at Boston, as American dollars. In America Vivekananda lost his money and when Ajit Singh learnt of it, he immediately sent 150 more through telegraph service. Initially Vivekananda had a lower-class ticket for his voyage but Ajit Singh had it exchanged for a first class ticket. He also gave him a substantial amount of money for meeting his personal expenses during the journey. Vivekananda wrote a stream of letters to Ajit Singh from the West, and later from India. Ajit Singh is known for the financial support he provided to Vivekananda for his social service. On 17 December 1897 at a meeting in Khetri Swamiji noted that whatever little he had done for the uplift of India would not have been possible had he not met the Raja of Khetri.Sailendra Nath Dar, A Comprehensive Biography of Swami Vivekananda (Madras:Vivekananda Prakashan Kendra, 1976), p.1027. Again, he wrote in a letter to Munshi Jagmohanlal on 11 October 1897, \\"Certain men are born in certain periods to perform certain actions in combination. Ajit Singh and myself are two such souls‚Äîborn to help each other in a big work for the good of mankind.‚Ä¶ We are as supplement and complement.\\"Benishankar Sharma, Swami Vivekananda‚ÄîA Forgotten Chapter of His Life (Calcutta: Oxford Book and Stationary, 1963), p.118. = Third meeting with Swami Vivekananda (1897) = In 1897 Ajit Singh sent Vivekananda several letters and invited him to visit Khetri again which Vivekananda accepted. At that time he was staying in Dehradun from where he proceeded to Khetri via Delhi, Alwar and Jaipur. When Ajit Singh got the news of Vivekananda's arrival, he traveled from his palace to welcome him. There, Vivekananda was formally welcomed and taken in a procession to Khetri. At Khetri, all employees of the palace showed their respect to Vivekananda by touching his feet and giving him a two rupee coin each. Ajit Singh gave Vivekananda 3000 coins as a token of respect and love. On 17 December 1897 Vivekananda publicly expressed his gratitude to Ajit Singh. He said that \\"it would not have been possible for me to do what little I have done for India but my friendship with Khetri's Maharaja.\\" On 20 December 1897, Vivekananda delivered a lecture in Khetri which was attended by Ajit Singh and several Europeans.  Assistance to Vivekananda's family  From 1891 Ajit Singh started sending a monthly stipend of 100 to Vivekananda'a family. On 1 December 1898 Vivekananda wrote to Ajit Singh from Belur requesting him to make the donation permanent so that even after Vivekananda's death his mother Bhuvaneswari Devi would get the financial assistance on a regular basis. From 1891 Ajit Singh started sending a monthly stipend of 100 to Vivekananda's family in Kolkata. On 1 December 1898 Vivekananda wrote to Ajit Singh from Belur requesting him to make the donation permanent so that even after Vivekananda's death his mother would continue to get the financial assistance on regular basis. In that letter Vivekananda wrote‚Äî > One thing more will I beg of you ‚Äì if possible, the 100 Rs. a month for my > mother be made permanent, so that even after my death it may regularly reach > her. Or even if your Highness ever gets reasons to stop your love and > kindness for me, my poor old mother may be provided [for], remembering the > love you once had for a poor S√¢dhu. Ajit Singh continued to send the monthly allowance until his death on 18 January 1901. Historians and researchers have estimated the current value of 100 Indian rupees as something between to . Mani Shankar Mukherjee in his book The Monk As Man: The Unknown Life of Swami Vivekananda commented‚Äî \\"It is, indeed remarkable that a disciple should be so generous towards his teacher's family\\". Ajit Singh did not want to publicize this assistance and thoroughly wanted to keep it a secret. Mahendranath Datta, Swami Vivekananda's brother, wrote in his book‚Äî > Khetri's Maharaj used to send 100 rupees to Swamiji's mother on a regular > basis. The money was sent every month via Sharat Maharaj, Yogen Maharaj and > Mr Sandel. He specially requested that this arrangement be not discussed > with others. The letters stored at Khetri's archive show that Ajit Singh frequently communicated with members of Vivekananda's family from 1892 onwards. On 28 February 1893, Mahendranath Datta, the younger brother of Vivekananda sent a letter to Khetri in which he expressed his anxiety on not receiving any letter from Ajit Singh for a long time. In his next letter dated 22 March 1893 Mahendranath told Ajit Singh the names of the books he recently read. He also informed him that Bhupendranath Datta (youngest brother of Vivekananda and Mahendranath) was admitted in Metropolitan School, Kolkata, one of the most reputed schools of the city. This shows the frequency of communication between Ajit Singh and the family members of Vivekananda.  Founding of the Ramakrishna Mission at Khetri  In 1958 the Ramakrishna Mission was started at the Palace of Khetri which was donated by Ajit Singh's grandson, Bahadur Sardar Singh. The building has been renamed as Vivekananda Smriti Mandir and houses marble statues of Ajit Singh and Swami Vivekananda. The room at the topmost storey where Swamiji used to stay and have spiritual discourses with Ajit Singh, has been converted into a prayer room.

It was located northeast of Winters, at an elevation of 118 feet (36 m). History Buckeye was named for the native Buckeye (Aesculus californica) trees growing along Buckeye Creek. The town was in existence before April 11, 1855, when a church was then built in it. Reverend JN Pendegast, the pastor of the church in nearby Woodland, reported the news in 1858 that a church had indeed been built in Buckeye. The local post office was established on May 17, 1855, and named after the town. JO Maxwell was the postmaster between 1857-1860 and transferred the post office to his store named Buckeye Store which he built in 1857. In 1870 the area had a Masonic Hall, saloon, hotel, two stores, blacksmith, shoemaker's shop, boarding house, and the Buckeye School, which was located on County Roads 31 and 90A. It also still had a post office. Buckeye thrived until the Vaca Valley Railroad was built west of the town. The railroad tracks reached the new townsite of Winters in 1875, when the town was established. The Vaca Valley and Clear Lake Railroad passed by Buckeye away in 1877, when it progressed north from Winters to the new townsite of Madison, when the town was established. Buckeye residents subsequently moved to the new towns of Winters and Madison, and the post office was closed. They even divided the church's building materials between the two cities they were migrating to. In 1879 the only thing left of the town was the school they had built and two farmers who had stayed behind.

WRNC was one of three radio stations licensed to operate in the city and one of seven that once operated in Rockingham County, North Carolina. The station was licensed to broadcast on 1600 kHz. Its power output was 1,000 watts and used a three tower antenna system, broadcasting both day and night at full power from the transmitter site located on North Carolina Highway 87, west of Reidsville. History The station was initially licensed in 1947 as WFRC, owned by the Piedmont Carolina Broadcasting Company. The original studios were located in downtown Reidsville at the northern corner of South Scales and Gilmer Streets. The programming audio was fed by a telephone loop to the transmitter site on NC Highway 87 (West Harrison Street) which also served as residence for the engineering staff. In the early 1970s, the owners of WFRC moved the studios and offices to the transmitter site. Operating at 1 kW, the three tower array for the station was used at night to direct the signal and avoid interference with other stations. The night signal pattern was northwest and southeast. During daytime operations, only the center tower emitted the broadcast signal. Until the late 1970s, the station used one transmitter, a tube type Raytheon RA-1000, but it later became a backup when the station purchased a transistorized Harris Corporation transmitter. The station switched signal patterns at night using a Gates antenna phasor. In November 1979, the station was sold to new stockholders, organizing as the Rockingham Radio Corporation, which changed the call letters to WKXQ. The calls changed again to WRNC in 1982. Three sales followed in the mid-1980s. In 1987, due to intense competition from FM stations in the nearby Greensboro, North Carolina market, the station signed off for several months under silent authority. But with threats of permanent license revocation from the FCC, the station signed back on the air as a daytime broadcast only station. With failing equipment and no revenue, WRNC finally signed off the air several months later and the owners surrendered the license to the FCC. In the early 1990s, all of the station's equipment and property, including all three towers, was auctioned off to the public. The property is now privately owned and all that remains are the building which has been gutted. All three towers were dropped and removed from the premises. Programming Under all three call signs, the station was an ABC News Radio affiliate station and aired news and sports from the ABC Entertainment Network. It was also an Associated Press newswire station as well as a Tobacco Radio Network affiliate.

Benefits  * Enables a single PCell library and PDK to support any OpenAccess tool * Reduces PCell and PDK development and support costs * Creates choices in building analog design flows IPL was founded by Applied Wave Research (AWR), Ciranova, Silicon Navigator, Springsoft and Synopsys in order to provide an open, interoperable, next generation way of doing PDKs for analog and mixed signal design. Previously, PDK's were developed in proprietary languages, like Cadence's SKILL or Mentor's AMPL, for proprietary use with a single companies' tool suite. With the advent of OpenAccess for IC design and new programming paradigm's, the founders developed a methodology for creating PDK's that could be used by any modern analog design tool. The broader alliance has developed an OpenAccess testing ecosystem. The ecosystem includes tools and test cases from the participating vendors. The validation is done by loading a PCell library and PDK into this ecosystem and exercising the various design tools. As a final check, the PCell-loaded test cases are streamed out to GDSII and design rule checked with Mentor Calibre nmDRC.

He started his career with music director S.D. Burman as a lyricist in the 1963 film Bandini and worked with many music directors including R. D. Burman, Salil Chowdhury, Vishal Bhardwaj and A. R. Rahman. He was awarded Padma Bhushan in 2004, the third-highest civilian award in India, the Sahitya Akademi Award and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award ‚Äî the highest award in Indian cinema. He has won several Indian National Film Awards, 21 Filmfare Awards, one Academy Award and one Grammy Award. Gulzar also writes poetry, dialogues and scripts. He directed films such as Aandhi and Mausam during the 1970s and the TV series Mirza Ghalib in the 1980s. He also directed Kirdaar in 1993.  Early life  Gulzar was born in a Khatri Sikh family as Sampooran Singh Kalra, to Makhan Singh Kalra and Sujan Kaur, in Dina, Jhelum District, British India (present-day Pakistan). In school, he had read translations of the works of Tagore which he recounted as one of his life's many turning points. Due to the partition, his family split and he had to stop his studies and come to Mumbai (then called Bombay) to support his family. Sampooran took up many small jobs in Mumbai to eke out a living, including one at a garage at Vichare motors on Bellasis road (Mumbai). There he used to touch up accident-damaged cars by mixing shades of paint, in his own words \\"I had a knack for colours\\". His father rebuked him for being a writer initially. He took the pen name Gulzar Deenvi and later simply Gulzar. In an interview with Rajyasabha TV, he recounted enjoying his work as a painter as it allowed him a lot of time to simultaneously read, write, attend college and be involved with the PWA (Progressive Writers Association).  Career  Lyricist = It was during his interactions in the PWA Sunday meetings that Shailendra and Bimal Roy encouraged him to join films. Gulzar began his career under film directors Bimal Roy and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. His book Ravi Paar has a narrative of Bimal Roy and the agony of creation. He started his career as a songwriter with the music director Sachin Dev Burman for the movie Bandini (1963). In films, he found an environment associated with literature in the group he worked with, including Bimal Roy, most of whose films were based on literary works. Shailendra, who has penned the rest of the songs in the movie requested Gulzar to write the song \\"Mora Gora Ang Layle\\", sung by Lata Mangeshkar. Directed and produced by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the 1968 film Aashirwad had dialogues and lyrics written by Gulzar. Song lyrics and poems written by Gulzar gave the poetic attribute and the \\"much-needed additional dimension\\" to Ashok Kumar's role in the film. Ashok Kumar received the Best Actor at the Filmfare and at the National Film Awards for this role. Gulzar's lyrics, however, did not gain much attention until 1969's Khamoshi, where his song \\"Humne Dekhi Hai Un Aankhon Ki Mehekti Khushboo\\" (lit., \\"I have seen the fragrance of those eyes\\") became popular. Ganesh Anantharaman in his book Bollywood Melodies describes Gulzar's lyrics, with the purposeful mixing of the senses, to be \\"daringly defiant\\". For the 1971 film Guddi, he penned two songs, of which \\"Humko Man Ki Shakti Dena\\" was a prayer which is still sung in many schools in India. As a lyricist, Gulzar had a close association with the music director Rahul Dev Burman. He has also worked with Sachin Dev Burman, Shankar Jaikishan, Hemant Kumar, Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal, Madan Mohan, Rajesh Roshan, and Anu Malik. Gulzar worked with Salil Chowdhury in Anand (1971) and Mere Apne (1971); Madan Mohan in Mausam (1975), and more recently with Vishal Bhardwaj in Maachis (1996), Omkara (2006) and Kaminey (2009); A. R. Rahman in Dil Se.. (1998), Guru (2007), Slumdog Millionaire (2008) and Raavan (2010) and Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy in Bunty Aur Babli (2005). Gulzar took inspiration from Amir Khusrow's \\"Ay Sarbathe Aashiqui\\" to pen \\"Ay Hairathe Aashiqui\\" for Mani Ratnam's 2007 Hindi film Guru, which had music composed by A. R. Rahman. Another Ratnam-Rahman hit, \\"Chaiyya Chaiyya\\" from Dil Se.. also had lyrics written by Gulzar, based on the Sufi folk song \\"Thaiyya Thaiyya\\", with lyrics by poet Bulleh Shah. For another collaboration with Rahman for Danny Boyle's 2007 Hollywood film Slumdog Millionaire, Rahman and Gulzar won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"Jai Ho\\" at the 81st Academy Awards. The song received international acclaim and won him a Grammy Award (shared with Rahman) in the category of Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. He also wrote a song for the Pakistani Drama Shehryar Shehzadi, and this song Teri Raza, has been sung by Rekha Bhardwaj and was composed by Vishal Bhardwaj. = Direction = After writing dialogues and screenplay for films such as Aashirwad, Anand and Khamoshi, Gulzar directed his first film Mere Apne (1971). The film was a remake of Tapan Sinha's Bengali film Apanjan (1969). Meena Kumari played the lead role of Anandi Devi, an old widow caught in between the local fights of unemployed and tormented youngsters. Anandi Devi's death in one of the fights makes them realise the futility of violence. The film was rated \\"Above Average\\" at the box office. He then directed Parichay and Koshish. Parichay was based on a Bengali novel, Rangeen Uttarain by Raj Kumar Maitra and inspired from the Hollywood film The Sound of Music. He wrote the story of Koshish based on the struggle faced by a deaf-dumb couple wherein Sanjeev Kumar won National Film Award for Best Actor. In 1973, he directed Achanak, inspired by the 1958 murder case KM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra, and the story writer Khwaja Ahmad Abbas earned a Filmfare nomination for Best Story. Later he directed Aandhi, based on the Hindi novel \\"Kaali Aandhi\\" by Kamleshwar. Along with various wins and nominations, the film also won Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie. Although the film was believed to be based on the life of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the film was based on life of Tarkeshwari Sinha. In the 1975's emergency, the film was banned from theatres. His next film Khushboo was based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's Pandit Mashay. His Mausam, which won the National Award for 2nd Best Feature Film, Filmfare Best Movie and Filmfare Best Director awards, along with other six Filmfare nominations, was loosely based on the story \\"Weather\\", from the novel, The Judas Tree, by A.J. Cronin. His 1982 film Angoor was based on Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors. His films told stories of human relationships entangled in social issues. Libaas was a story of an extra-marital affair of an urban couple. Due to its objectionable subject, the film never got released in India. Mausam pictured a story of a father who tries to improve the life of his prostitute-daughter. In Maachis, a young Punjabi boy engages in terrorism to fight a bad situation only to realise its temporary nature. Hu Tu Tu dealt with corruption in India and how a man decides to fight it. Gulzar uses \\"flashback\\" in the narration of his stories very effectively (Aandhi, Mausam, Ijaazat, Machis, Hu Tu Tu). He also has mutual partnerships with various actors and other crew. The Gulzar ‚Äì Sanjeev Kumar partnership resulted in few fine films (Koshish, Aandhi, Mausam, Angoor, Namkeen) which represent Sanjeev Kumar's finest work as an actor. Actors like Jeetendra (Parichay, Khushboo, Kinara), Vinod Khanna (Achanak, Meera, Lekin) and Hema Malini (Khushboo, Kinara, Meera) worked with Gulzar to gain respectability as artists and delivered some of their best and most introspective work in films. R D Burman composed songs for almost all the movies directed by him in the 1970s and the 1980s (Parichay, Khushboo, Aandhi, Angoor, Ijaazat, Libaas). Many of their popular songs were sung by Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. These include \\"Musafir Hoon Yaron\\" (Parichay), \\"Tere Bina Zindagi Se Koi\\" (Aandhi), and \\"Mera Kuch Samaan\\" (Ijaazat). In 1988, Gulzar directed an eponymous television serial Mirza Ghalib, starring Naseeruddin Shah and broadcast on Doordarshan. Later he also directed Tahreer Munshi Premchand Ki about the novels of Premchand. = Poetry = Gulzar primarily writes in Urdu and Punjabi; besides several dialects of Hindi such as Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Haryanvi and Marwari. His poetry is in the Triveni type of stanza. His poems are published in three compilations; Chand Pukhraaj Ka, Raat Pashminey Ki and Pandrah Paanch Pachattar. His short stories are published in Raavi-paar (also known as Dustkhat in Pakistan) and Dhuan (smoke). For the peace campaign Aman ki Asha, jointly started by India's and Pakistan's leading media houses, Gulzar wrote the anthem \\"Nazar Main Rehte Ho\\", which was recorded by Shankar Mahadevan and Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. Gulzar has written ghazals for Ghazal Maestro Jagjit Singh's albums \\"Marasim\\" (1999) and \\"Koi Baat Chale\\" (2006). = Other contributions = Gulzar has written lyrics and dialogues for several Doordarshan TV series including Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland, Hello Zindagi, Guchche and Potli Baba Ki with Vishal Bhardwaj. He has more recently written and narrated for the children's audiobook series Karadi Tales. Gulzar is also associated with Aarushi, Eklavya foundation an NGO based in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh working in the field of education. He has written stories and poetry for the magazine Chakmak. = Academic = In April 2013, Gulzar was appointed as the Chancellor of the Assam University.  Personal life  Gulzar is married to actress Raakhee. The couple has a daughter, Meghna Gulzar. Meghna Gulzar grew up with her mother and father and, after completing her graduation in filmmaking from New York University, went on to become a director of films such as Filhaal, Just Married, Dus Kahaniyaan, Talvar, Raazi, and Chhapaak (for which Gulzar wrote the lyrics) and authored the biography of her father Gulzar, in 2004.  Awards and nominations  As on 2019, Gulzar has won a total of 36 awards and honours, including 5 National Film Awards, 21 Filmfare Awards, 1 Academy Award for Best Original Song (2008), 1 Grammy Award (2010), 2002 Sahitya Akademi Award for Urdu, Padma Bhushan (2004), and 2013 Dadasaheb Phalke Award.

The 56th inauguration, which set a record attendance for any event held in Washington, D.C., marked the commencement of the first term of Barack Obama as President and Joe Biden as Vice President. Based on combined attendance numbers, television viewership, and Internet traffic, it was one of the most-observed events ever by the global audience. \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\", a phrase from the Gettysburg Address, served as the inaugural theme to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. In his speeches to the crowds, Obama referred to ideals expressed by Lincoln about renewal, continuity and national unity. Obama mentioned these ideals in his speech to stress the need for shared sacrifice and a new sense of responsibility to answer America's challenges at home and abroad. Obama and others paid homage to Lincoln in the form of tributes and references during several of the events, starting with a commemorative train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C. on January 17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21, 2009, included concerts, a national day of community service on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith inaugural prayer service. The presidential oath as administered by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the United States Constitution, which led to its re‚Äëadministration the next day. In addition to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the Presidential Inaugural Committee increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened the entire length of the National Mall as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens. Context By definition, the inauguration marked the formal culmination of the presidential transition of Barack Obama that began when he won the United States presidential election on November 4, 2008 and became the President-elect. In accordance with Article I, Section 6 of the United States Constitution, Obama resigned from the United States Senate effective November 16, 2008.Letter of resignation from Barack Obama to Richard Cheney, November 18, 2008; published in the Congressional Record, November 19, 2008, page S10609 (Communication from the Honorable Barack Obama ) He was formally elected by the Electoral College on December 15, 2008. The results were certified by a joint session of Congress on January 8, 2009. Obama, who originally campaigned using the slogan \\"Change We Can Believe In\\" and later \\"Change We Need\\", was widely celebrated as the first African American president of the United States and a symbol of change from his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Obama also represented a generational change as the first man elected President who was born in the 1960s. He inherited what Peter Orszag termed an \\"economic mess\\" that became known as the late-2000s financial crisis. Planning left The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee. Although the election was scheduled for November 4, 2008, the congressional committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 24, 2008. =Joint Congressional Committee= The swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of United States Senators Dianne Feinstein, committee chair, Bob Bennett and Harry Reid, and United States Representatives John Boehner, Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi. The committee is overseen by the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies chose the inaugural theme, \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\", a phrase from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address from the Civil War era. The theme, which was selected by the committee to mark the inaugural occasion and honor the 200th anniversary year of Lincoln's birth, expressed \\"Lincoln's hope that the sacrifice of those who died to preserve the United States would lead to 'a new birth of freedom' for the nation.'\\" In his reliance on the inaugural theme, Obama wanted \\"to give Americans reassurance that today, as in Lincoln's time, the country would find its way through any crisis\\". The congressional committee released the full schedule of the January 20 inaugural events on December 17, 2008. The inauguration schedule referred to the President‚Äëelect as \\"Barack H. Obama\\", although Obama specified previously that he intended to use his full name for his swearing-in ceremony, including his middle name Hussein. Obama decided to use his full name \\"Barack Hussein Obama\\" to \\"follow the tradition, not trying to make a statement one way or the other\\" for the inaugural ceremony. During the election campaign, Obama's detractors tried to use his middle name to imply falsely that he was a Muslim. The District of Columbia City Council passed legislation to enable bars and restaurants to stay open around‚Äëthe‚Äëclock to provide hospitality services to the inaugural festivities attendees. After reaching an agreement with the congressional committee, District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty signed legislation to temporarily allow bars and restaurants to operate 24 hours during the weekend leading up to the inauguration, but with 4:00 am EST as the cut‚Äëoff for alcoholic beverage service. The Hotel Association of Metropolitan Washington agreed to pay for extended train service provided by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on January 19 to accommodate visitors attending inaugural events and workers providing support for those events. =Presidential Inaugural Committee= The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration‚Äërelated events at the direction of the President‚Äëelect and Vice President‚Äëelect of the United States, such as the train ride, concerts, parade, balls and prayer service. The co-chairs of the committee were William Daley, Penny Pritzker, John Rogers, Patrick Ryan and Julianna Smoot. For the first time in history, the Presidential Inaugural Committee opened the full length of National Mall, which extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony. The presidential committee set aside a section of the mall close to the U.S. Capitol for people holding reserved tickets for the inaugural event. The committee directed the opening of the entire National Mall to make the event \\"'the most open and accessible in history,' allowing those who [could not] get the [reserved] tickets to the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds to fill the mall\\". To enable people in attendance to see and hear the swearing-in ceremony, the committee arranged for placement of JumboTrons at points along the entire mall. Despite criticism that such a large event could not be carbon-friendly, the presidential committee incorporated environment-friendly measures in its planning of the inaugural events. The environmental measures included the use of recyclable carpet for the platform, retrieval of recyclable items from outdoor areas after an event, and the use of recycled paper for invitations and inaugural ball tickets. Fundraising The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee attempted to raise more individual contributions in smaller dollar amounts compared with the second inauguration of George W. Bush in 2005. The 2009 contribution limit was set at $50,000 for donations by individuals, whereas individuals and companies were able to give a maximum of $250,000 apiece for the 2005 event. As of January 30, 2009, the presidential committee raised more than $53 million, with at least 458 people giving the committee-imposed maximum of $50,000, including celebrity donors such as George Soros, Halle Berry, Jamie Foxx and George Lucas. Emphasizing a change from business as usual, the committee set stringent guidelines for campaign contributions, barring donations from corporations, political action committees, registered federal lobbyists, labor and trade unions, registered foreign agents and non-U.S. citizens. The committee did accept donations from people with active lobbying interests before the federal government, but not registered as federal lobbyists, such as Google executive Eric Schmidt and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer. Based on its fundraising efforts and crowd estimates for the Obama inauguration, the presidential committee set its budget at $160‚Äì$170 million for the inauguration, including about $45 million for the gala events. The federal government contributed about $49 million, including $1.2 million to cover the actual swearing-in ceremony. The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75 million alone for police, fire and medical services. To help fund the efforts, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency as a precaution so that funds could be sought from Federal Emergency Management Agency. =Invitations and tickets= The Presidential Inaugural Committee and members of the 111th U.S. Congress distributed invitations and color-coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections on or near the U.S. Capitol grounds to view the swearing-in ceremony. Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses, but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S. politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry. House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‚Äëcome, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event. Because of high demand and limited availability of the reserved tickets, some people planned to offer their tickets for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services. Sales offers for tickets reached as high as $1,750 each for the reserved standing room section behind the Capitol Reflecting Pool, $5,500 each for the reserved standing room section in front of the Reflecting Pool and $20,000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds. In one case, a former legislative aide to Representative Ted Poe was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used Craigslist and e‚Äëmail to offer five tickets to the buyer for $4,500. Federal and state officials became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S. Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill to die in the closing days of the lame duck legislative session. Pre-inaugural eventsTrain ride: Commemorating Lincoln= On January 17, 2009, Obama hosted a whistle stop train tour in honor of the 200th anniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln's 1861 train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. to capture the mood of the 1861 Springfield to Washington train tour traveled by Lincoln to his own inauguration. For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the Georgia 300, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his presidential primary campaign. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests. Obama aboard the Georgia 300 on January 17, 2009 For the train ride to Washington, Obama invited 41 \\"everyday Americans\\" that he met during his presidential campaign to accompany him on the tour and attend other inaugural events, including the swearing-in ceremony, the parade and an inaugural ball. The group of citizens who joined the tour had shared stories with then-candidate Obama about themselves and their families during the presidential campaign, and included Matt Kuntz and Lilly Ledbetter. Kuntz, who lost his own step‚Äëbrother to suicide after returning home from the Gulf War, dedicated his efforts to improve mental health screening for Iraq War veterans. Ledbetter, who learned years later that her employer had discriminated against her in pay based on gender, lost her case before the Supreme Court because she did not file her claim within 180 days of the discriminatory act. Nine days after his inauguration, Obama as president signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, allowing claims filed against employers not only within 180 days of the pay discrimination, but also restarting the 180-day period for claims upon receiving any paycheck based on a discriminatory pay action. Obama commenced the tour in Philadelphia by holding a town hall meeting at 30th Street Station with a few hundred supporters. At the first stop in Wilmington, Delaware Vice President‚Äëelect Biden and his family joined the tour. Biden, dubbed \\"Amtrak Joe\\" for his daily commutes on Amtrak between Wilmington and Washington, built a reputation as a supporter of increased funding for U.S. commuter rail transportation. The train continued to Baltimore, Maryland, its second stop, where Obama spoke to a crowd of about 40,000 people. During his speeches to the crowds, he emphasized the theme \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\" using phrases associated with Lincoln such as \\"better angels\\" and \\"a new declaration of independence\\". Obama referred to patriotic forebearers in his speech when he reminded the crowds that \\"we should never forget that we are the heirs of that first band of patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew.\\" Thousands of well‚Äëwishers gathered at various points along the train route taking pictures, cheering and waving American flags and homemade signs, with Obama reciting his trademark rejoinder \\"I love you back\\" to the enthusiastic crowds. The one-day train tour concluded at Union Station in Washington, D.C. =We Are One concert= We Are One concert held at the Lincoln Memorial on January 18, 2009. On January 18, 2009, the day after Obama arrived in Washington, D.C., an inaugural concert, \\"We Are One\\", took place at the Lincoln Memorial. The concert featured performances and readings of historical passages by more than three dozen celebrities. Attendance at the concert was free to the public, and HBO broadcast the concert live on an open feed, enabling anyone with cable television to watch the event. An estimated 400,000 people attended the concert at the Lincoln Memorial. The Washington Metro recorded 616,324 passenger trips during the day, breaking the old Sunday ridership record of 540,945 passenger trips set on July 4, 1999. =King Day of Service= The eve of the Inauguration Day, January 19, 2009, fell on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a U.S. federal holiday in recognition of Dr. King's birthday. Obama called upon communities everywhere to observe the King Day of Service, a day of citizen volunteer service honoring the human rights leader. More than 13,000 community service events took place across the nation on the day, the largest participation in the 14 years since Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act and more than double the previous year's events. Obama spent an hour at Walter Reed Army Medical Center meeting privately with the families of troops who were recovering from wounds sustained in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan. After visiting the medical center, he, along with Martin Luther King, III, headed to the Sasha Bruce House homeless shelter for teens to participate with others in service activities. Joe Biden hung drywall at a Habitat for Humanity home in N.E. Washington, D.C. Biden's wife, Jill, their daughter, Ashley Biden, Michelle Obama and the Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, spent the morning at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium where they helped thousands of volunteers prepare more than 85,000 care packages destined for U.S. troops overseas. Later that evening, the President-elect hosted three separate bipartisan dinners to honor the service of John McCain, Colin Powell and Joe Biden. =Kids' Inaugural: \\"We Are the Future\\"= On the evening of January 19, 2009, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden hosted the \\"Kids' Inaugural: We Are the Future\\" event at the Verizon Center. Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, and the Jonas Brothers honored military families in concert. The show was broadcast live on the Disney Channel and on Radio Disney. Other celebrity participants included Bow Wow, George Lopez, Corbin Bleu, Queen Latifah, Billy Ray Cyrus, Shaquille O'Neal and Jamie Foxx. In keeping with the service theme of the day, Michelle Obama issued a call for children to become engaged in public service by volunteering in homeless shelters, visiting elderly people or writing letters to U.S. troops. The Washington Metro recorded 866,681 passenger trips on January 19, breaking the single day ridership record of 854,638 passenger trips set on July 11, 2008. Inaugural eventsCeremony: \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\"= oath of office on January 20, 2009 at the U.S. Capitol. The inaugural ceremony took place at the West Front of the United States Capitol on January 20, 2009. The ceremony opened with the playing of pre‚Äërecorded music and a live performance by \\"The President's Own\\" United States Marine Band, followed by live performances by the San Francisco Boys Chorus and San Francisco Girls Chorus. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the first woman to preside over a U.S. presidential inauguration, acted as the day's Master of Ceremonies. From left to right: Itzhak Perlman, Gabriela Montero, Yo-Yo Ma and Anthony McGill performing John Williams' \\"Air and Simple Gifts\\" at the inauguration. Obama officially became the president at noon during this performance. Evangelical pastor Rick Warren delivered the invocation for the inaugural ceremony, followed by a performance by vocalist Aretha Franklin, who sang \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\". The program featured a performance of John Williams' composition \\"Air and Simple Gifts\\", which was both pre-recorded and performed live synched with the recording by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Itzhak Perlman, pianist Gabriela Montero and clarinetist Anthony McGill. National Public Radio described the performance by the quartet as \\"a transporting moment that moved many with its beauty and calm\\", while The New York Times called it the \\"classical-music equivalent of lip-syncing\\". Aretha Franklin made a fashion statement by wearing a hat with a distinctive Swarovski crystal-studded bow. Vice President‚Äëelect Biden took his oath from Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. After he completed his oath of office, Biden received in his honor as the new Vice President the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march \\"Hail, Columbia\\" by members of the armed forces. After the performance of \\"Air and Simple Gifts\\", Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to President‚Äëelect Obama shortly after noon. The inaugural ceremony ran longer than scheduled, which delayed the administering of the oath so that it finished around 12:05 pm EST (17:05 UTC). However, Obama assumed the presidency at the expiration of President Bush's term at noon under the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After he completed the presidential oath, Obama received in his honor as the new President the 21-gun salute, and the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march \\"Hail to the Chief\\" by members of the armed forces. Obama delivered his inaugural address to the crowds as the President of the United States following his swearing-in ceremony. Poet Elizabeth Alexander then delivered the inaugural poem, \\"Praise Song for the Day\\", and civil rights activist Joseph Lowery, minister of the United Methodist Church, delivered the benediction. The United States Navy Band \\"Sea Chanters\\" chorus concluded the ceremony with a performance of the United States national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". =Oath of office= Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to Obama. Michelle Obama held the Bible, which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration, as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath. Nearly four years earlier, then-Senator Obama had been one of 22 Senators to vote against Roberts during Roberts' Supreme Court nomination; the inauguration marked the first time a Chief Justice administered the oath to a President-elect who had previously voted against the Chief Justice's confirmation. Roberts and Obama made several mistakes as they recited the oath. The proper wording for the oath of office is prescribed in the Constitution: Roberts had practiced for the ceremony carefully. However, a memo noting his planned pauses in the recitation of the oath failed to reach Obama's staff before the swearing-in. As a result, Obama inadvertently interrupted Roberts during the first phrase, stating \\"I, Barack\\" while Roberts was finishing \\"do solemnly swear\\". Obama then correctly repeated the entire phrase \\"I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.\\" Roberts, who was not using notes, rendered the next phrase as \\"that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully,\\" misplacing the word faithfully and saying president to instead of president of. Obama repeated, \\"that I will execute\\", then paused. Roberts attempted to correct the wording, but stumbled: \\"the off‚Äì faithfully the pres‚Äì the office of President of the United States.\\" Obama then repeated Roberts' initial incorrect wording. Roberts ended the presidential oath by appending the phrase \\"so help you God\\" to the end of the constitutionally prescribed oath, and Obama responded \\"so help me God\\" when he was prompted. Obama had asked previously to include \\"so help me God\\" after the oath. Roberts then congratulated Obama as the new president. Second oath ceremony President Obama (right) retakes the oath of office from Chief Justice Roberts at the White House on January 21, 2009. President Obama and Chief Justice Roberts stand near a portrait of Benjamin Henry Latrobe, designer and an early Architect of the Capitol. Much public discussion arose about the errors in administering and reciting the oath. Several constitutional scholars said that Obama should retake the oath. Boston University constitutional scholar Jack Beermann suggested that while the courts would likely never even consider a challenge, he would still advise Obama to retake the oath if he were his lawyer since \\"the Constitution says what he's supposed to say.\\" Although Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, indicated at first that President Obama did not plan to retake the oath, Chief Justice Roberts agreed to re-administer the oath at the request of White House counsel Greg Craig. The second oath ceremony took place on the evening of January 21, 2009 in the Map Room of the White House before a small audience of presidential aides, reporters and a White House photographer. Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re-administer the oath out of an abundance of caution. Craig added that \\"the oath of office was administered effectively and ... the President was sworn in appropriately ... But the oath appears in the Constitution itself.\\" No Bible was present during the retake of the inauguration. Inaugural address The central theme of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility‚Äîboth in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin. Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, \\"we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents.\\" The speech reinforced words such as \\"legacy\\" and \\"heritage\\", as well as values such as \\"honesty\\", \\"courage\\" and \\"patriotism\\", which \\"are old\\" values. Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by Thomas Paine in The American Crisis, which were ordered by George Washington to be read to his troops: \\"Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].\\" Because Obama's campaign message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as president within the margins of the nation's traditions. Obama's goal for his Inaugural speech was to stir the following response among Americans: \\"This is why I want to go into public service and be a better politician. This is why I want to go home and be a better parent, better worker, better citizen.\\"Alter, Jonathan. The Promise President Obama, Year One. Simon & Schuster, 2010. . As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said \\"what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility‚Äîa recognition, on the part of every American\\" and \\"those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account.\\" Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song \\"Pick Yourself Up\\" from the musical comedy Swing Time, saying that \\"starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.\\" In an article for The New York Times, columnist and former drama critic Frank Rich noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address \\"one subtle whiff of the Great Depression\\". Obama's speech contained several biblical references and was compared to oratory of the \\"black church tradition.\\" Obama also highlighted the United States' religious diversity, referring to the country's \\"patchwork heritage\\" as a strength and saying, \\"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers.\\" This was the first time a United States President acknowledged American non-believers in an inaugural address. Obama's inaugural address received mixed reviews, with some describing the tone of the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and clich√©d. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about the tone of the speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage. Prayers Obama's selections of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren had a history of vocal opposition to same-sex marriage, and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for \\"forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes even when we differ.'\\" Warren mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the Lord's Prayer. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that \\"as we leave this mountaintop, help us to hold on to the spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family.\\" Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day \\"when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right\\". =Post-ceremony traditions= alt=George W. Bush wearing a suit, tie, scarf and overcoat while looking out the window from a skyward vehicle. After the inaugural ceremony on the west front of the U.S. Capitol, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden escorted former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush to a departure ceremony on the east side of the U.S. Capitol. Before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition, President Obama signed his first presidential orders in the President's Room at the Capitol, and then signed the guest book for the luncheon. The first order signed by Obama was a proclamation declaring his Inauguration Day a \\"National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation\\", in which he called \\"upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century\\". Next, Obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his Cabinet and several sub‚ÄëCabinet officials to the U.S. Congress for its approval. The Obamas and Bidens then attended an inaugural luncheon at the U.S. Capitol before traveling from there to the presidential reviewing stand at the White House to watch the parade. Luncheon As former President and Mrs. Bush began their journey to their Texas home, the Obamas and Bidens joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol. Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Commemorating the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial, the red and white china used during the luncheon were replicas of those used in the Lincoln White House. Obama addresses the luncheon attendees in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol. A luncheon at the U.S. Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glac√©. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use. During the luncheon, Senator Ted Kennedy collapsed after suffering a seizure, and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon. These reports were later denied, and Byrd, a longtime friend of Kennedy, eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave. Parade 2009 Inaugural parade route President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama walking the inaugural parade route The inaugural parade route ran along Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. from the U.S. Capitol, ending at the north face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama traveled in the new armored limousine because of potential security threats. The President and First Lady twice exited their limousine, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the parade.Lawrence, J. (January 20, 2009). An inaugural parade they won't soon forget. USA Today. Retrieved January 28, 2009. Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the parade route at several points with their children Beau, Hunter and Ashley. The parade lasted more than two hours during the afternoon and early evening following the inaugural ceremony. Parade participants included 15,000 people, 240 horses, a mariachi band, dozens of marching bands, the Virginia Military Institute corps of cadets, and two drum and bugle corps: The Cadets and the Colts. Obama invited the marching band from Punahou School, his high school in Hawaii, to perform in the parade along with the marching unit of its Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Vice President Joe Biden invited several groups from Delaware to march in the parade. The Delaware section was led by the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association of which Biden is an honorary member, the Fightin' Blue Hen Marching Band, The Pride of Delaware, from Biden's alma mater, the University of Delaware, and the Delaware State University Hornets Approaching Storm marching band. NASA astronaut Rex J. Walheim marched in the parade carrying an American flag and wearing a prototype of NASA's next generation spacesuit. Astronaut Michael L. Gernhardt drove a prototype lunar rover in the parade. In addition to Astronauts Walheim and Gernhardt, the crew of the STS-126 Space Shuttle Endeavour mission also marched in the inaugural parade. Inaugural balls President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended 10 official inaugural balls during the evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old New York- based designer Jason Wu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns. The Neighborhood Inaugural Ball, one of six balls held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, was the first stop of the evening for the President and First Lady. The Obamas danced their first song as Beyonc√© Knowles serenaded them with her rendition of the Glenn Miller classic \\"At Last\\". According to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball was the first ball with free or affordable tickets, a contrast to recent history in which \\"inaugural balls generally have been closed to everyday Americans, populated instead by an exclusive circle of dignitaries and donors.\\" A portion of the tickets for the ball was reserved for Washington D.C. residents. The nine other official inaugural balls attended by the Obamas that evening included: * The Commander-in-Chief's Ball, National Building Museum, held only for the second time, included active and reserve duty members of the United States military, the families of American service members currently deployed overseas, the families of military personnel killed in action and recipients of the Purple Heart. * The Eastern Ball, Union Station, held for guests from the New England states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont and the Atlantic territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. James Taylor performed for guests attending the ball. * The Mid-Atlantic Ball, Washington Convention Center, held for guests from the District of Columbia and the Mid-Atlantic States of Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia. This ball featured the first 2009 appearance by The Dead. * The Midwestern Ball, Washington Convention Center, held for guests from the Midwestern states of Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin. * The President Obama Home States Ball, Washington Convention Center, for guests from Barack Obama's home states of Hawaii and Illinois. * The Southern Ball, D.C. Armory, held for guests from the Southern states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. * The Vice President Biden Home States Ball, Washington Convention Center, for guests from Joe Biden's home states of Delaware and Pennsylvania. * The Western Ball, Washington Convention Center, for guests from the Western states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Colorado, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, and the Pacific territories of American Samoa and Guam. * The Youth Ball, Washington Hilton and Towers, an event held specifically for guests between the ages of 18 and 35 years old. President Obama and the First Lady also attended one inaugural ball during the evening of January 21, 2009. * The Obama for America Staff Ball, D.C. Armory, held for staff members of President Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. The ball featured speeches by David Plouffe, Joe Biden and Barack Obama, as well as a performance by Jay-Z. After they made their formal visits to the circuit of January 20 inaugural balls, the Obamas hosted an after-midnight gathering at the White House for 70 of their earliest supporters, close friends and family. Guests who attended the after hours celebration at the White House included Oprah Winfrey, Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, Representatives Artur Davis of the state of Alabama and Neil Abercrombie of the state of Hawaii, and Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation also attended the after hours event, including Senator Dick Durbin and Representatives Melissa Bean, Jan Schakowsky, Luis Gutierrez and Jerry Costello. National prayer service On January 21, 2009, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, gathered at the Washington National Cathedral for a national day of prayer. At the prayer service, the Obamas and Bidens were joined in the front pew by former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, who was sworn in as Secretary of State later that day. The prayer service was attended by about 3,200 other invited guests, including members of the U.S. Congress, diplomats and other dignitaries. From left to right: the Obamas, Bidens and Clintons in the front pew at the Washington National Cathedral on January 21, 2009 The theme of the interfaith worship service reflected inclusiveness and religious diversity, with a mix of Protestant pastors, female Hindu and Muslim religious leaders, rabbis and Catholic and Episcopal bishops who delivered scripture readings and prayers throughout the service. Prayers for the service drew from passages from the 1789 inauguration prayer service of George Washington and the 1865 inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln, including phrases such as \\"with malice toward none, with charity for all\\". The featured sermon for the inaugural prayer service was delivered by Reverend Sharon E. Watkins, general minister and president of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the first woman to deliver the sermon for the inaugural prayer service. In her sermon, Watkins integrated passages from a variety of sources, such as passages summoned from sources rooted in the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Cherokee faiths. Unofficial events In addition to the official events, groups and supporters held an array of gatherings and celebrations throughout Washington, D.C. and the surrounding region in the days before and the evening following the inauguration. One such event, a newly created \\"People's Inaugural Ball\\" was held for economically and physically disadvantaged people from across the United States who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Earl W. Stafford, a businessman from Fairfax County, Virginia, spent an estimated $1.6 million through his family's foundation to bring approximately 300 guests to Washington, D.C., hosting the ball on January 19, 2009 for a total of about 450 people. Clothing, shoes, tuxedos and hotel rooms for attendees were provided as part of the invitation. AttendanceDignitaries, family and celebrity guests= Outgoing President George W. Bush, outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney, former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, and former vice presidents Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle, and Al Gore, along with their respective wives, attended the inauguration, including Hillary Clinton (Obama's choice to succeed Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state), who had been Obama's main opponent in the Democratic primaries (Clinton was attending as a former First Lady, not as the losing candidate). Cheney was in a wheelchair because of an injury that he suffered while moving boxes. Congressman John Lewis, the only living speaker from the historic 1963 rally at the March on Washington, was present on the stage during the inauguration. More than 180 of the Tuskegee Airmen attended as invited guests for the inauguration. The five-person crew of US Airways Flight 1549 attended the swearing-in ceremony, including Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who landed the aircraft in the Hudson River near Manhattan after losing both engines due to a bird strike just after departing LaGuardia Airport. Eighty-seven-year-old Sarah Obama led a group of Obama's Kenyan relatives from his father's home village of Kogelo. Other relatives who traveled from Kenya as guests included Obama's aunt, Maggie Obama, his uncle, Sayid Obama, as well as his half-brother Malik Obama. Also, Kenya youth activist and Chair of the Martin Luther King, Jr Africa Foundation, Mwangi Mukami, attended the Inaugural events. Mwangi Mukami had served as Chair of the Obama Worldwide Supporters Campaign though it was unrelated to the official campaign. Joe Biden's son, Beau, Attorney General for the state of Delaware and an officer and Judge Advocate in the Delaware Army National Guard, received a special furlough from serving in Iraq to participate in the ceremonies. Celebrity guests included the actors Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, talk show host Oprah Winfrey, singer Beyonc√© Knowles, director Steven Spielberg, boxer Muhammad Ali, and golfer Tiger Woods. =Crowds and general ticket holders= Crowds watch the inauguration at the National Mall. The Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial behind it, are in the background. No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inaugural ceremony, although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of any event ever held in Washington, D.C. Government agencies and federal officials, who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8 million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. The Washington Post reported the estimated crowd size for the inaugural ceremony, and the National Park Service said it did not contest the estimate. Stephen Doig, a professor at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 million people attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken a little less than 45 minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. Despite his crowd estimate, Doig stated that \\"if I had to bet, I would say the [Barack] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [Johnson] or any of the other things ... I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd.\\" Approximately 1.2 million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. Amid the massive crowds that arrived at the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration, about 4,000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to reserved areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates at the start of the formal ceremony. Many ticket holders were stuck in tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the National Mall. People dubbed one such tunnel \\"the Purple Tunnel of Doom\\", after the purple tickets that would-be viewers held. Others remained stuck in long lines as they waited to gain entry to the reserved areas. Senator Dianne Feinstein, in her capacity as chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, launched an investigation to address complaints by the affected ticket holders. The committee later announced that ticket holders who were unable to enter the Capitol grounds to view the ceremony would receive a copy of the swearing-in invitation and program, photos of President Obama and Vice President Biden and a color print of the inaugural ceremony. Inauguration Day broke several records for the Washington Metropolitan Transit system. The 1,120,000 estimated Metrorail riders broke the record of 866,681 trips set the day before (which had broken the record set on July 11, 2008), and marked the first million trip day in the system's history. Metro also provided 423,000 bus trips and 1,721 MetroAccess trips for a total of 1,544,721 trips, the highest ridership day ever in the transit authority's history. As of October 2018, the inauguration day crowd is still the largest in Metrorail history, but the 2017 Women's March has the highest counted, not estimated, single day ridership of 1,001,613. In addition, the Sunday events helped Metro set a Sunday single-day record of 616,324 that is still largest Sunday crowd. =Security= As with the 54th and 55th Presidential Inaugurations, in 2001 and 2005, respectively, the 56th Presidential Inauguration in 2009 was designated as a National Special Security Event (NSSE), resulting in the United States Secret Service being the lead Federal agency for the development and implementation of the overall security plan;Title 18 United States Code, Section 3056 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) being the lead Federal agency for counter terrorism, intelligence, and criminal investigation; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) being the lead Federal agency for crisis management in the aftermath of any terrorist attack, natural disaster or other catastrophic incident. The United States Capitol Police had primary responsibility for security and emergency response within the Capitol Complex to include the Inaugural Platform and the Inaugural Luncheon. The NSSE designation was made by Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, on December 10, 2008.Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 7 The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the September 11 attacks. Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington, D.C. for the inaugural activities, planners raised concerns about public safety and security. Army General Richard Rowe, head of the joint military task force for the Washington, D.C. area, explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats, especially in light of the Mumbai attacks in India that occurred in November 2008. Attention was heightened by terrorist threats. U.S. National Guard vehicle on K Street, N.W. in Washington, D.C. during the inauguration The police presence in the District of Columbia temporarily doubled, augmented by the addition of 8,000 police officers from around the United States. The police force was assisted by 1,000 FBI agents to provide security for the event, and the Secret Service Countersniper team was assigned to hidden locations throughout the area. The Transportation Security Administration had over 300 officers from its National Deployment Force on hand to assist the Secret Service with security inspections of attendees entering the National Mall. Ten thousand National Guard troops were on site, with 5,000 troops providing security duty in a ceremonial capacity and 1,300 unarmed troops aiding Park Police in crowd control at the National Mall. C Company of the 1‚Äì175 Infantry provided security between the first and second public viewing areas of the National Mall at the 7th Street, N.W. intersection, while the remaining members performed other security functions. The Federal Aviation Administration implemented additional airspace restrictions over Washington, D.C. between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm on January 20, 2009. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was chosen as the designated survivor to ensure continuity of government in case of catastrophe, and he spent Inauguration Day at a U.S. military installation outside of the Washington, D.C. area. No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony or parade was arrested on Inauguration Day. According to a senior federal agent associated with managing security, the fact that no arrests were made by any agency during the inaugural events was unheard of for a record crowd of nearly two million gathering in Washington, D.C. In the 2009 book In the President's Secret Service, author and journalist Ronald Kessler said intelligence officials received information that individuals associated with Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based Islamist insurgency group, might try to disrupt the inauguration. More than a dozen counter-sniper teams were stationed along the inauguration parade route in response, and the criminal records of nearby employees and hotel guests were scrutinized, but no such attack took place. Kessler also reported a number of perceived inadequacies in the security during the inauguration, including an instance in which more than 100 major campaign donors and VIPs were able to board \\"secure\\" buses without being checked. Viewership Bob Weir (playing guitar) and Mickey Hart (playing drums) of the Grateful Dead performing at the Mid-Atlantic Inaugural Ball, January 20, 2009 =Television audience= Nielsen television ratings indicated that 29.2% of televisions in the 56 largest media markets in the United States were tuned to the inauguration, the largest audience since Ronald Reagan's first inauguration in 1981 and nearly double the viewership of the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush. The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51% of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed in part to a snowstorm that kept people inside and in part to the large African American population in that community. Of the top 10 media markets in terms of viewership, four were in North Carolina, two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland, with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership. In addition, schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday. As measured between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm EST, U.S. television viewership for the Obama inaugural events achieved an average of 37.8 million across 17 broadcast and cable channels, not including online viewers who watched live streaming video of the events. Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S. television viewership of 37.8 million across both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S. television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8 million across the ABC, CBS and NBC broadcast networks alone. Measurements of television viewership in Europe showed that Germany drew the largest audience for the Obama inauguration at 11 million viewers, followed by France at 7 million and the United Kingdom at 5.1 million. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), 6.5 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched highlights of the inauguration during its early evening news program. =Internet traffic= The Obama inauguration resulted in a surge of Internet traffic to news and social networking websites and a record number of video streams. CNN reported that it generated more than 21 million video streams by 3:30 pm EST that day‚Äîan all-time record, in addition to receiving 136 million page views that day. At one point during the surge of traffic to view the Obama inauguration, the BBC reported downtime during its own live video feed at its website. The heavy website traffic caused the BBC video feed to cut out for 30 minutes, with web visitors seeing the message \\"Please come back later\\" instead of the live video footage. The technology company Akamai reported that 5,401,250 web users logged on news sites in less than one minute, the fifth highest peak among news websites since the company started tracking data in 2005. During at-peak usage, news websites served seven million simultaneous video streams, which was the highest number of simultaneous video streams in Akamai's history. The Obama inaugural ceremony not only achieved the highest Internet viewership for a U.S. presidential inauguration, the inaugural event was the first to feature a live audio description of a swearing-in ceremony and the first to include closed captioning in the live webcast of the event. International reaction United States embassy in Nairobi, Kenya The international community paid unprecedented attention to the inauguration of Barack Obama. Millions of people, including citizens of numerous countries around the world and American expatriates living in those countries, watched the Obama inauguration live on television and on the Internet. In some countries, the Obama inauguration garnered as much viewership as the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Celebrations surrounding the inauguration, praise of the event's significance and congratulations to Obama on his inauguration were internationally diverse. In Kenya, the home country of Obama's father, people celebrated the inauguration as a public holiday. Indonesians and Americans in Jakarta watched the inauguration at a free midnight ball featuring performances by students from State Elementary School Menteng 01, the school that Obama attended as a child. The city of Obama in Japan celebrated the event with fireworks, bell-ringing and hula-dancing at the Hagaji Temple. Governor General Micha√´lle Jean and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada extended congratulations on behalf of Canadians, while Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n wished Obama \\"great success in the work as the new President of the United States\\". Israeli President Shimon Peres described Obama's inauguration as a \\"great day\\" for the United States, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted that \\"The whole world is watching the inauguration of President Obama, witnessing a new chapter in both American history and the world's history.\\" Leaders of some countries reserved enthusiasm for the Obama inauguration, with coverage of the event even muted in some places. Cuban President Ra√∫l Castro, brother of former Cuban president Fidel Castro, declared that \\"[Obama] looks like a good man, I hope he is lucky\\", while Ricardo Alarc√≥n, president of the Cuban legislature, admitted in his comments about Obama that \\"the incoming [U.S.] president 'is a big question mark.'\\" Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki expressed hope for openness for a new direction, noting that \\"if Obama chooses the right path, compensates the past, lifts hostility and U.S. hegemony, and revises the previous political mistakes, we will have no hostility.\\" State-owned Channel One Russia, Russia's flagship early evening news show, covered Obama's presidential inauguration as a minor news story, devoting much of the day's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine. The People's Republic of China covered the Obama inauguration live on its state‚Äëcontrolled China Central Television, providing simultaneous translation into Mandarin Chinese with a brief delay to allow censoring of Obama's comments. When President Obama mentioned \\"earlier generations faced down fascism and communism\\", Chinese state television officials cut away abruptly from the televised speech and switched to a discussion in the studio. State-controlled print, radio and television media in North Korea provided no coverage or mention of the Obama inauguration in the hours after the event, opting instead to cover news about Equatorial Guinea welcoming the North Korean ambassador. Ordinary citizens in Iraq even viewed the new president with cautious optimism. One Iraqi citizen opined that \\"If [Obama] can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over\\", adding a belief that \\"[Obama] is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests.\\" Another citizen noted that \\"Obama won't get the same treatment,' ... 'But he won't have too long to prove himself to us.'\\" See also * First 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency * Presidency of Barack Obama * Presidential transition of Barack Obama * Second inauguration of Barack Obama * Timeline of the Barack Obama presidency (2009) * List of unofficial events for the first inauguration of Barack Obama * 2008 United States presidential election * Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign  References External links * President Obama 2009 Inaugural Ceremony.

Caterina served as Regent of Milan from 1402 to 1404, during her elder son's minority, but due to Gian Maria's suspicion of her alleged treason (planted in his mind by her enemy, the condottiero Facino Cane), he had his mother arrested and imprisoned in the castle of Monza, where she was presumably poisoned in 1404.  Family  Bernab√≤ Visconti and Beatrice Regina della Scala, the parents of Caterina Visconti Caterina was born in Milan, one of the seventeen children of Bernab√≤ Visconti, Lord of Milan, and Beatrice Regina della Scala (1331 - 18 June 1384). Her paternal grandparents were Stefano Visconti, Lord of Milan, and Valentina Doria, and her maternal grandparents were Mastino II della Scala and Taddea da Carrara. Her niece, Isabeau of Bavaria, daughter of her eldest sister, Taddea, was a Queen consort of France upon her marriage in 1385 to King Charles VI. Following the murder of her maternal grandfather, Isabeau became one of the most implacable enemies of Caterina's husband Gian Galeazzo and his daughter, Valentina, Duchess of Orleans.  Marriage  Early in 1379, a possible marriage was discussed between Caterina and King Richard II of England. The King's tutor and advisor, Sir Simon Burley went to Milan to negotiate, but he had misgivings about the match. Bernab√≤ also rejected it, as he favoured another alliance for his daughter. On 2 October 1380, in the Church of San Giovanni in Conca, at the age of about nineteen, Caterina married her first cousin, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, whose first wife Isabelle of Valois had died in 1373 in childbirth, leaving him three sons who all died young, and a daughter, Valentina Visconti, who, in 1389, married Louis, Duke of Orleans. From Isabelle, Gian Galeazzo had inherited the title of Count of Vertus in Champagne. In 1385, Gian Galeazzo deposed Caterina's father, Bernab√≤ as Lord of Milan. Bernab√≤ was imprisoned at the Castle of Trezzo where he was allegedly poisoned on orders of Gian Galeazzo. Caterina became the Duchess of Milan on 11 May 1395, when her husband was created the first duke by Wenceslaus, King of the Romans for 100,000 florins. To commemorate the event, a missal was painted by Anovelo da Imbonate, depicting, in the foreground, the kneeling figures of Caterina and Gian Galeazzo. It is now in the library of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. Her husband granted her the castle of Monza and the signoria of Vicenza. Caterina and her husband commissioned the construction of the Certosa di Pavia, which began on 27 August 1396. Issue She and Gian Galeazzo had three children: * Daughter (June 1385 ‚Äì 9 July 1385). * Gian Maria Visconti (7 September 1388 ‚Äì assassinated 16 May 1412), 2nd Duke of Milan, married Antonia Malatesta, died childless. * Filippo Maria Visconti (23 September 1392 ‚Äì 13 August 1447), 3rd Duke of Milan, married Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda, widow of Facino Cane. The marriage was childless and he had her executed on charges of adultery. By his mistress, Agnese del Maino, he had a daughter, Bianca Maria Visconti, who succeeded him as Duchess of Milan.  Regency and death  When Gian Galeazzo died of a fever on 3 September 1402, Caterina became regent for her son Gian Maria who was fourteen years old. The Duchy was riven by strife and numerous revolts as rival factions between Gian Galeazzo's legitimate and illegitimate heirs contested for land and power during her regency. Caterina's faction was led by Francesco Barbavara, Count of Valsesia, and a member of the regency council. The faction led by her enemy, the condottiero Facino Cane, however prevailed; thus he, along with the illegitimate sons of Gian Galeazzo, created doubts about Caterina's loyalty in her son's mind. Convinced of his mother's treachery, Gian Maria had Caterina arrested on 18 August 1404 and imprisoned in her own castle of Monza, where she died on 17 October 1404, allegedly of poisoning. She was about forty-three years old. Her son Gian Maria was assassinated in 1412 by a group of Milanese Ghibellines. Caterina's second son Filippo Maria succeeded him as Duke of Milan.

The Aviation Building, also known as the Fritz Hotel, was a building located in Miami, Florida, United States. The building stood from 1927 to the mid-1970s when it was torn down and replaced. The address of the building was 3240 NW 27th Avenue which was 16 blocks east of the east end of runway 9/27 at Miami International Airport. The building was used for a number of purposes, none of which was a hotel. HistoryConstruction= Construction for the Fritz Hotel began in 1925 by M.R. Harrison Construction Company. By 1927 three quarters of the construction was completed, but halted due to the Great Depression. The unfinished building was never used as a hotel. The building served many other purposes throughout its 50-year history as the owners repurposed the hotel's shell. After being unoccupied for 10 years, the building was rented out to small businesses. The owners would complete parts of the building to the specifications of different manufacturers. =Hen House= The first use of the building was a temporary hen house where it held up to 60,000 hens. Because such an expensive building was used for hens, it was often nicknamed the \\"Million Dollar Hen House\\". =Embry-Riddle= In November 1940 the Technical Division of Embry-Riddle School of Aviation (now Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University) moved into the south wing of the building. The Technical Division handled aircraft mechanic training. By 1941 Embry-Riddle had acquired the entire building, filled it with offices, classrooms, workshops, military barracks, a cafeteria, library, and clinic, and renamed it the Aviation Building. In April 1965 the school was packed into trucks and moved to Daytona Beach, Florida overnight. =National Weather Service= On June 1, 1958, the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office of Miami, Florida, moved into part of the building, while Embry-Riddle remained there. A WSR-57 network radar was installed on top of the building on June 26, 1959. The NWS moved its offices out of the building on December 23, 1964. =Clothing factory= After the NWS and Embry-Riddle moved out the building remained vacant for a few years. In the late 1960s the building was used as a clothing factory. Lorenzo Blanco owned the structure. =Removal= The building was demolished in May 1971 and replaced with a county juvenile detention center and courthouse.

They all share the same goal: to convince live audience members that there is no better place that they could be at the moment. This is achieved through establishing a bond between performer and audience. Live performance events tend to use visual scenery, lighting, costume amplification and a shorter history of visual projection and sound amplification reinforcement. Visual support Live event visual amplification =Introduction Live event visual amplification is the display of live and pre-recorded images as a part of a live stage event. Visual amplification began when films, projected onto a stage, added characters or background information to a production. 35 mm motion picture projectors became available in 1910 - but which theatre or opera company first used a movie in a stage production is not known. In 1935, less costly 16 mm film equipment allowed many other performance groups and school theaters to use motion pictures in productions. In 1970, closed circuit video cameras and videocassette machines became available and Live Event Visual Amplification came of age. For the first time live closeups of stage performers could be displayed in real time. These systems also made it possible to show pre- recorded videos that added information & visual intensity to a live event. One of the first video touring systems was created by video designer TJ McHose in 1975 for the rock band The Tubes using black and white television monitors. Touring black-and-white video system The Tubes 1975 Touring color system Kool Jazz Festival 1978 In 1978, TJ McHose designed a touring color video system that enlarged performers at the Kool Jazz Festivals in sports stadiums across the United States. =Live event visual reinforcement= Introduction  Live event visual reinforcement is the addition of projected lighting effects and images onto any type of performance venue. Visual Reinforcement began more than 2000 years ago. In China during the Han Dynasty, Shadow puppetry was invented to \\"bring back to life\\" Emperor Wu's favorite concubine. Mongolian troops spread Shadow play throughout Asia and the Middle East in the 13th century. Shadow puppetry reached Taiwan in 1650, and missionaries brought it to France in 1767. The next major advance in Visual reinforcement for events was the magic lantern, first conceptualized by Giovanni Battista della Porta in his 1558 work Magiae naturalis. The Magic Lantern became practical by 1750 with the oil lamp and glass lenses. Special effect animation attachments were added in the 1830s. In 1854, the Ambrotype positive photographic process on glass made Magic lantern slide creation much less expensive. Magic lanterns were greatly improved by the application of limelight to live stage production in 1837 at Covent Garden Theatre and improved again when electric arc lighting became available in 1880. In 1910, Adolf Linnebach invented the Linnebach lantern, a lensless wide angle glass slide projector. In 1933, the Gobo metal shadow pattern for the ellipsoidal spotlight allowed images to appear and disappear by dimmer control. In 1935, 16 mm Kodachrome film projectors added the first fully animated visual reinforcement to live events.

Movie theatre sound was greatly improved in 1937 when the Shearer Horn system debuted. One of the first large-scale outdoor public address systems was at 1939 New York World's Fair. In the 1960s, rock and roll concerts promoted by Bill Graham at The Fillmore created a need for quickly changeable sound systems. In the early 1970s, Graham founded FM Productions to provide touring sound and light systems. By 1976 in San Francisco, the technical debate over infinite baffle vs horn-loaded enclosures, and line arrays vs distributed driver arrays, was ongoing at FM because of the proximity of The Grateful Dead and their scene Ultrasound, John Meyer, and others. But at that time there were parallel developments in other parts of the United States - Showco (Dallas) and Clair Bros (Philadelphia) had different approaches; Clair in particular was moving in the direction of modular full-range enclosures. They would rig as many as needed (or clients like Bruce Springsteen could afford) in whatever configuration they thought would cover a particular venue. Stanal Sound in southern California used fiberglass futuristic looking equipment for artists like Kenny Rogers.

It was created by Justin Esch and Dave Lefkow, founders of J&D;'s Foods, in November 2008, and sold 40,000 jars within six months. It was test-marketed in Grand Forks, North Dakota, to determine consumer interest. After being featured on both The Daily Show and The Oprah Winfrey Show, sales of Baconnaise increased significantly, with more than a million jars sold. History In an interview with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated that they came up with the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while making a joke about the subject over a meal at a diner. The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company. Baconnaise has been featured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart several times as a repeat joke. In 2009, Jon Stewart used it in a skit that drew negative attention from Seattle Post-Intelligencers Leslie Kelly. Stewart commented, \\"Baconnaise, for people who want to get heart disease but, you know, too lazy to actually make bacon.\\" In 2010, Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J&D;'s Foods. According to J&D;'s Foods, a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made, but it was declined by Comedy Central. Using it as a prop in a later episode, Stewart referred to Baconnaise as \\"capitalism's greatest triumph\\". Baconnaise was discussed on The Oprah Winfrey Show on April 24, 2009, when Esch and Lefkow were interviewed by Winfrey via Skype. After her guests and she ate sandwiches that used the product, she commented, \\"Vegetarian and kosher! Thanks Justin and Dave! Get your own Baconnaise!\\" After her endorsement, the traffic on the company website and telephones overwhelmed its systems. Lefkow stated that a year after the show aired over a million jars of Bacconaise were sold. Production Esch and Lefkow have stated that they started with just mayonnaise and bacon and worked with chefs to determine how to have mayonnaise that tastes like bacon without having bacon as an ingredient. Lefkow stated that developing and refining the taste of Baconnaise resulted in him having \\"nothing but bacon and mayonnaise for breakfast for the next six months.\\" Lefkow refined the taste of Baconnaise by comparing real bacon to the developing product. Baconnaise contains no bacon, artificial flavors, or MSG, but the actual process and ingredients in the product are a trade secret. A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, egg yolk, gluconic acid, yeast extract, stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum, gum arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium disodium EDTA, and autolyzed yeast extract. J&D;'s Foods also released a light version of Baconnaise. Marketed as Baconnaise Lite, it contains 30 Cal per serving and less fat than the original Baconnaise. Baconnaise is sold in 15-oz (443-ml) plastic jars.  Release  The product's marketing test was at Pike Place Market in Seattle, where it sold up to 120 jars a week. The product debuted in October 2008, at the Seattle Semi Pro Wrestling League in the Heaven's Night Club. The event featured a costumed fight between mayonnaise and a slab of bacon.  Reception  Will Goldfarb of the website Serious Eats reviewed Baconnaise, stating, \\"[it] works fairly well as a sandwich condiment, but the assertive smokiness can overpower mild ingredients.\\" Goldfarb recommended it as a sandwich condiment, but cautioned against using it in dips, salad dressings, and fish dishes. The \\"Baconnaise Lite\\" was met with a positive review from \\"Hungry Girl\\", though the reviewer noted its name was \\"a bit of an oxymoron\\". Baconnaise, while being both vegetarian and kosher-friendly, does not taste like mayonnaise. = Original recipes = Original recipes featuring animal fat-infused mayonnaise, including Baconnaise, were covered on the Serious Eats website. The recipe includes crumbled bacon strips, liquid rendered bacon fat, canola oil, egg yolks, and Dijon mustard with water and lemon juice.

It stars Doug Jones (an alumnus of the university) as Jerry Arthur: a forty-something door-to-door salesman going through a mid-life crisis. Jerry has to deal with the stresses of work, his estranged daughter returning home, and a sudden interest in punk music - sparked by a chance meeting with a group of teenagers. The film is directed by Morgan Mead, with the screenplay written by David Hamilton, both Ball State alums. Filming began in July 2008, and wrapped in August 2008. The film first screened for Muncie audiences on May 7, 2009 to a sold-out screening room attended by over 800 people. It has since made its way through the film festival ranks and continues to earn awards and praise, most notably for the performances of leads Doug Jones and Katlyn Carlson. The film is most notable for featuring Steven Yeun before he achieved widespread fame for his role in AMC's The Walking Dead. Synopsis Door-to- door salesman, Jerry Arthur's life is filled with slamming doors and low expectations. The world has lost its attraction. He is a middle-aged divorc√© who lives on his own. He has an unsure and unwanted future, a daughter he has had no contact with for ten years, a dead-end job and low self-esteem. In other words, Jerry is close to hitting rock bottom. Jerry's life changes when his ex-wife dies and their daughter moves in with him. Around the same time, he stumbles on a group of young people with their futures before them. Their energy and music reminds him that you can influence your life for the better regardless of the past...if you choose to do so. Through new and old friends alike, Jerry discovers you can move forward even when you can't see exactly where you are going. As Jerry puts it, ‚ÄúWhat happened to going with your gut? My gut‚Äôs been telling me to turn things around.‚Äù Cast *Doug Jones as Jerry: Jerry is a door-to-door salesman who is stuck in a rut. He's going through the day to day motions of his life at home and at work because he's afraid to take a chance and doesn't know where to start. All it takes is a little inspiration from the ‚Äúeloquence‚Äù of punk to jump-start his re- invention. *Don Stark as David: As a fellow Milton-Hill salesman to Jerry, David loves the sale, and doesn't mind the dirty reputation. In fact, he is long over it, because he works to buy the perfect life. At this point in his life, he finds value in excess. But he is smart and enjoys a good time. *Catherine Hicks as Dana Holderman: Dana has spent her life working for men in a largely chauvinistic profession. She fights to be called their equal, and is, at times, harder than she actually needs to be. However, she also cares deeply about the company she works for, and will go to great lengths not to endanger it. All this toughness isolates a different side of her though, and at times she is extremely lonely and vulnerable. *Allison Scagliotti as Trisha: Trisha has been without her father most of her life, and has no siblings, leaving her in the care of her over-achieving mother. She is desperately in search of a father figure, but is afraid of being hurt by her father, Jerry, because of the things her mother has told her. *Katlyn Carlson as Jordan: Jordan is the kind of girl that comes from a house with all older brothers. She is looking for inspiration in her life, and she has hidden desires to be a clothing designer, but isn't quite at peace with her choices in life. She is suffering a certain level of discontent due to a recently ended relationship. *Steven Yeun as Chaz: Chaz works at a record store, and likes most music but is generally known as a hipster. He is part of a band with Slim and Zeb mostly because it is something to do and his friends are involved. Chaz is a flirt and a party-guy. He also lives with Jordan and regularly finds himself trying to be big brother to a girl who already has too many brothers. *Levi Holloway as Slim: Slim sings in a rock band and is the tortured soul artist among the members. Passionate and fearless, he takes everything seriously. However, he is also known by his friends Chaz and Zeb for his ridiculous and mischievous sides. *Josh Breit as Zeb: Zeb is the strong silent type, and only speaks when he has something profound to say. Some think that Zeb takes himself too seriously, when in fact, he is usually just bored and finds ways to amuse himself. If Chaz is the mouth and Slim is the soul, then Zeb is the brain. ProductionDevelopment= Originally conceived in 2006 by Mead and writing partner Andy Janoch as a starring vehicle for Doug Jones, Mead took the original project to Ball State University professor Rodger Smith, who along with his Institute for Digital Education and Entertainment (IDEE) program, was interested in involving the university with a film project. Mead, Janoch and Smith went through several scripts drafts before Mead contacted David Hamilton, a college-friend who was working in Los Angeles for the series ER. Hamilton did a script re-write and along with fellow 'ER' alum Zach Baliva, came on board to produce the film. Though Ball State University had the equipment to produce a motion picture, they did not have the necessary personnel, so professionals from Los Angeles, Chicago, and Austin were hired to take the roles of department heads, to further the student's experience on the project, and to give the film a more polished-look. Nathan Wilson was hired as the Director of Photography, after having worked on several high-profile films. Michael Bricker was brought on board as Production Designer, based on his work on smaller films produced in Austin, TX and with the University of Texas at Austin. Blair Scheller was hired out of Chicago for his experience in the sound departments on big-budget motion pictures. All of this led to a more rounded experience for the Ball State University students who would fill out the support crews and production positions. Originally slated for a January start, the script was re-written to be a set in the summer time, with a New Year's Eve celebration being changed to a party taking place on the Fourth of July. Production finally began in July 2008, in Muncie, Indiana, after Jones had completed his promotional duties for Hellboy II. Principal photography lasted for 20 days. During the shooting of several scenes, the temperatures would reach triple-digits, but the young crew and the experienced cast kept working and shooting wrapped only one day behind what had originally been scheduled, with only a single pick-up shot filmed some time later (to replace a shot that was unusable due to a digital glitch in the original footage). =Casting= With star Doug Jones already in place, casting sessions began in Los Angeles, Chicago, Indianapolis, and Muncie, Indiana. The Los Angeles casting sessions brought Allison Scagliotti, Don Stark and Catherine Hicks into the mix. From Chicago, Josh Breit, Steven Yeun, Levi Holloway and Jonathan Keaton. All the other roles in the film were performed by local stage actors from the Muncie area (where the film was shot) and students from the University. The trickiest part to cast turned out to be that of Jordan, the young woman who steals Jerry's heart and motivates his journey. While the producers were unable to decide whom to cast for a long period of time, Mead found his Jordan in an audition for Trisha, Jerry's daughter, from Chicago-based Katlyn Carlson.\\" Mead has been impressed with the actress' abilities and physical presence, and insisted that she was Jordan. The producers agreed and Carlson won a role for which she did not audition, but was nonetheless excited to receive. =Awards= *Winner Best Actor in a Feature To Doug Jones Strasbourg International Film Festival *Winner Best Picture International Filmmaker Festival *Winner Supporting Actress International Filmmaker Festival *Winner Best Soundtrack International Filmmaker Festival *Official Selection Heartland Film Festival *Winner Best Comedy Route 66 Film Festival *Best Feature Film Santa Clarita Valley Film Festival *The Hoosier Award The Indiana Film Journalists Association (To Doug Jones, Morgan Mead, and David Hamilton for their contributions).

History On May 24, 1920, the first Huntington Beach well, the Huntington A-1 , was brought in as a producing well. By October 1921, the field had 59 producing wells. Even with 16 of those 59 wells being idle, the field produced per day, with each well producing from 50 to 200 barrels daily. The conflict of coastal oil drilling with beachfront recreation and tourism has been a central theme in Southern California politics. The discovery of oil was followed by a real estate boom in the surrounding communities. For example, as the Huntington Beach Oil Field expanded, the homes in that area that stood in the path of drawing oil from the ground were physically relocated north in 1921-1922 to lots in Midway City, California, which \\"started Midway City\\". In addition, the discovery led to the development of the oceanfront community of Sunset Beach, California, which was established in 1905.

It is a combat flight simulator in which the player controls an aircraft to protect refugees from enemy forces. Gameplay The object of the game is to protect a series of refugees from enemy aircraft, tanks and submarines. The player's view consists of a crosshairs upon a simple ground and sky horizon, with an altimeter, a shield indicator and a radar. Refugees walk along the horizon, and the player must fire his guns at enemy units to prevent them from killing the refugees. Score is gained by destroying enemy units, and for refugees crossing the screen safely. However, due to a bug in the score calculation for refugees, should the player not allow any (or very few) refugees to survive a stage he will be rewarded with a bonus far in excess of what would be scored had the refugees been saved. To achieve this the player invariably has to shoot the refugees himself - which although not the point of the game can be just as challenging, as whilst doing this the enemy will still be launching missiles and shooting at the player. Reception Zzoom was received well by the video game press when it was released in 1983, and it remained among the top twenty best-selling games well into 1984. Crash called it \\"a very memorable game and excellent value for money\\", whilst Personal Computer Games described it as \\"one of the all-time greats in a very competitive market\\".

History The piece was probably already well known around 1800 in Frankfurt am Main. On 31 March 1814, it was played in the presence of Emperor Francis I of Austria, Tsar Alexander I, and King Friedrich Wilhelm III during the expedition of the allied troops in Paris at the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition. Due to its title, the march became popular during the time of the German Empire. In addition, still later during the Weimar Republic and later in the Third Reich, it was a popular symbol of Franco-German enmity. In 1940, after the victory of the German armed forces over France, the march was played, as in 1814, during the formal entry of the German troops into Paris. In the Federal Republic of Germany it is rarely played in public due to modern Germany‚Äôs alliance with France. Abroad, it is particularly popular in Russia, where it has formed part of the traditional repertoire of the country's military music since 1814.

It connects the city centre with the primarily residential, inner-city neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, in the hills immediately southwest of downtown. It is mainly maintained as a tourist attraction and is nowadays considered a heritage tramway system, having been designated a national historic monument in 1985. The line has a very unusual gauge: . The main line is long.Claydon, G. B.; and Mather, G. (August 1977). \\"South American Tramways Today / Part 2: Rio de Janeiro\\". Modern Tramway and Light Rapid Transit magazine (UK), pp. 271‚Äì279. Ian Allan Publishing. ISSN 0309-8222. Having run continuously since its opening in 1877 (except for a 2011‚Äì15 suspension), it is one of the oldest street railway lines in the world and having been electrically powered since 1896, it is the oldest electric railway in all of Latin America.Morrison, Allen (1 November 2010; later updates). \\"The Tramways of Latin America in 2015\\". Retrieved 2015-11-28. It is also the only remaining metropolitan tram system in Brazil. The only other original tram systems in the country to have survived past 1971 are the Campos do Jord√£o interurban tram/light rail line, which continues to operate today, and the Itatinga line (near Bertioga), a rural and non-public tram line which had ceased operation as a tramway by 2017. All other cities closed their systems by 1971 (Santos being the last), but since that time, three towns, Bel√©m, Campinas and Santos, have reinstated trams as heritage services, and Rio de Janeiro opened a modern light rail/tram system in 2016. All service on the line was suspended starting in August 2011, as a result of a serious accident, but limited service resumed in July 2015, with new tramcars, and with passengers no longer allowed to stand on the running boards. Following studies after the 2011 suspension, it was decided to buy new trams that would be replicas of the vintage previous fleet, and an order for 14 such cars was placed in 2012. Rebuilding of the line then commenced, and was continuing in late 2014, at which time reopening was projected for 2015, in time for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In July 2015, limited service resumed between Esta√ß√£o Carioca (Carioca Station) and Largo do Curvelo, and was extended from the latter point to Largo do Guimar√£es in December 2015, making the length of route in operation about . Work continued slowly, and at times intermittently, on restoration of additional sections of the main route to Dois Irm√£os. In February 2018, just five trips per day were extended from Largo Guimar√£es to Pra√ßa Odylo, and then on 22 October 2018 all service was extended to Largo do Fran√ßa. The full route between Largo da Carioca and Dois Irm√£os was finally restored to operation and passenger service in January 2019. Routes bidirectional single-track. The Santa Teresa tram route rises from downtown Rio de Janeiro and follows a circuit of Santa Teresa hill, offering a high-level view of the city. It passes over the high Carioca Aqueduct, a former aqueduct constructed in the 18th century and electric trams used to run beneath it.The Aqueduct. Allen Morrison. 1998. Retrieved 2010-11-15. Except for the aqueduct, the route is shared by motor vehicles. Before the 1960s, Rio de Janeiro trams served the entire downtown area and all near suburbs, but since 1967 only the Santa Teresa line remained. Lastly, it offered two regular services, until 2011. Since the 2015 reopening, only one route has remained. =Current service= The surviving route runs from near Largo da Carioca (in the central area, at ) to Morro Dois Irm√£os (\\"Two Brothers hill\\", at ) and is long. As of early 2020, the service was operating Monday to Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:40 p.m., Saturdays 10:00 to 5:40, and Sundays 11:00 to 4:40. The advertised headway was 25 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon. Special service Just two trips per day operate on a route between Carioca terminal and Rua Murat√≥ri, which has only of route ‚Äì all of which is bi-directional single-track ‚Äì not shared with the main Carioca‚ÄìDois Irm√£os service. These were departing Carioca at 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. in late 2018 and early 2019. Having closed in 1966, the short branch was reopened in late 2015 and formally \\"inaugurated\\" in January 2016, but actual public service was not introduced until sometime later in 2016 and has been very limited and intermittent since then. =Former services=Paula Matos line The second route, which last operated in 2011, ran from the same departure terminal to Largo do Guimar√£es and then, turning off of the main route, continued onward to terminate at Largo das Neves (). This terminus was always indicated as Paula Mattos on the destination signs of the vintage tramcars, though the neighbourhood to which the name refers adopted the modernised spelling of Paula Matos many years ago. Its length ‚Äî about two-thirds of which was shared with route 1 ‚Äî was . Silvestre line Starting in 1999 a few trips on the main (Dois Irm√£os) route, on Saturdays only, had continued beyond Morro Dois Irm√£os, to Esta√ß√£o Silvestre (), a route section previously closed in 1966. However, operation of these trips became sporadic and is thought to have ceased by 2005 or 2006; the section of tramway between Dois Irm√£os and Silvestre was closed definitively in 2008, after the theft of most of the overhead trolley wire.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, July 2008, p. 271. LRTA Publishing (UK). History If horse-drawn tramways are included, trams have operated in Rio de Janeiro since 1859 ‚Äì continuously, apart from an 1866‚Äì1868 suspension. There are only four cities in the world in which trams have run longer: New Orleans (since 1835), Boston (1856), Mexico City and Philadelphia (both 1858).Morrison, Allen (1989). The Tramways of Brazil: A 130-Year Survey, p. 23. Bonde Press. . Rio de Janeiro's first tramway was a horsecar line on which service was inaugurated on 30 January 1859 (testing began in 1858). Constructed by Thomas Cochrane and operated by the Companhia de Carris de Ferro da Cidade a Tijuca, the service ran between the city centre and Tijuca. In 1862 steam trams replaced the horsecars, making the Tijuca line the first steam-powered tramway in South America, but the higher speed and poor condition of the track led to many derailments, and the line was closed in November 1866. It was reopened in January 1870, by a different company. A new horse-drawn tramway was built in 1868 by Charles B. Greenough and a service running from Rua do Ouvidor to Largo do Machado commenced on 9 October, extended to Botafogo six weeks later. By January 1871, the line had reached Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, 10 km from the city centre. Another tramway using horse-drawn vehicles, constructed by Albert H. Hager and run by the Rio de Janeiro Street Railway, opened on 25 November 1869. The first route ran to the palace grounds at Quinta da Boa Vista, with routes to Caju and S√£o Crist√≥v√£o following later. In 1870 the Rio de Janeiro Street Railway (soon to be renamed the Companhia de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o) reopened the route of Cochrane's pioneer tramway to Tijuca. A new horse-drawn tram, constructed by Jo√£o Batista Viana Drummond and run by the Companhia Ferro-Carril da Vila Isabel, opened in 1873. Further routes were opened to the Vila Isabel zoo, Engenho Novo, M√©ier and the suburbs along the Dom Pedro II Railroad on the northwest side of town. The Ferro-Carril de Jacarepagu√° company opened a new line in 1875, running from the Dom Pedro II Railroad's Cascadura station to Taquara and Freguesia. In name only, the Santa Teresa tramway's first horse-drawn line, operated by Empreza de Carris de Ferro de Santa Theresa, opened in the same year of 1875, but served only the flat terrain within the city centre, not actually serving any of the Santa Teresa neighbourhood (or any part of the line that survives today); it was gauge. The same company built both a funicular (513 m long) to take passengers from the city centre up to Santa Teresa hill and a separate hilltop tram line which started at the top of the funicular. The hilltop Santa Teresa tramway, the predecessor of the current line, opened on 13 March 1877, with a gauge of .The Santa Teresa Tramway. Allen Morrison. 1998. Retrieved 2010-11-15. It ran from the funicular station east to Curvelo and west to Largo do Fran√ßa. This main Santa Teresa line was extended from Largo do Fran√ßa to Silvestre in 1890. The operating company's name changed in 1885 and again in 1891, but kept the name Companhia Ferro-Carril Carioca from 1891 until the beginning of 1964. Meanwhile, steam trams were reintroduced to Rio in 1882, this time on the Tijuca line, operated by the S√£o Crist√≥v√£o tramway company. A tram crossing the Carioca Aqueduct 1892 saw the arrival of the first electric tram, on the Botanical Garden route. This was the first electrified street railway in all of Latin America, aside from a tram line that was extended in 1890 from Laredo, Texas, into Nuevo Laredo, Mexico (barely onto Latin American soil). It was quickly followed by other electric tram lines in Rio, including a Rua do Catete service in 1894 and two new lines in Flamengo in 1896. In 1896 electric trams replaced the horsecars on the Santa Teresa line, and the line was extended across the then-abandoned aqueduct between Santa Teresa and Santo Antonio hills (the Carioca Aqueduct), with the city terminus uniquely being built on the second floor of the company's office building on Largo da Carioca. During this rebuilding, the line's gauge was changed from to , which it retains to the present day. The Santa Teresa system's electrification was completed in 1897. By 1897 the Carioca railway had been completely electrified, making it the first totally electric tram system in South America. Electrification expanded rapidly over the next few decades and by 1928 the last horse-drawn trams had been withdrawn from service. From around the 1950s, the Rio de Janeiro tram system went into decline, with many lines being closed, and by the end of the decade most of the tram routes of the former S√£o Crist√≥v√£o system had gone. Closures continued through the 1960s, with the closure of the Alto da Boa Vista route in 1967, leaving only the Santa Teresa tram still running. The Silvestre Line had been cut back to Dois Irm√£os in 1966; the section beyond was abandoned following storm damage. The Santa Teresa tram moved to its new modern terminal in 1975, in the gardens of the Petrobr√°s oil company, located on the roof of the company's parking garage. This was the Santa Teresa line's sixth successive city-centre terminus; it remains the system's terminal today. The system is currently operated by the Companhia Estadual de Engenharia de Transportes e Log√≠stica. =Depots and terminals= During the heyday of the Rio de Janeiro tram system, there were a number depots (carhouses) and terminals. Depots at Cascadura, Penha, M√©ier, Alto da Boa Vista, Usina, Triagem, 28 de Setembro, Vila Isabel, S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, Bonjardim, Rua Larga, Santo Antonio (neighbourhood), Largo do Machado, Largo dos Leoes and Cosme Velho are all now closed, and the only depot still operating is Santa Teresa itself. Most termini are also now closed, including Freguesia (Jacarepagu√°), Taquara, Madureira, Iraj√°, Cavalcante, Inahauma, Caxambi, Piedade, Quintino Bocai√∫va, Caju, Andarai, Santa Alexandrina, Estrela, Praia Vermelha, Leme, G√°vea and Silvestre. Lastly, three termini have still been served, near Largo da Carioca, at Dois Irm√£os and Largo de Neves, and of these Largo da Carioca is the only one with a terminal (building). One historic mule tram depot, at Vila Guaran√≠, is preserved. Problems Rio de Janeiro's trams are often overcrowded, but the longstanding practice of allowing passengers to stand on the running boards, seen in this 2009 photo, has now been banned. Prior to the 2011 suspension, the tram's fleet was outdated, with only five cars remaining in use on a regular basis, which were 50‚Äì60 years old. The cars were open- sided with wooden cross-benches, leading to street children often hopping on and off for free rides. Electricity to the cars is provided through roof- mounted trolley poles, and all cars are bi-directional. The old cars were built locally by the tramway companies, but several key components were supplied by foreign manufacturers: traction motors from English Electric, controllers from General Electric and trucks by the Peckham Manufacturing Company (Kingston, New York). They were built in the 1950s, but in appearance were similar to the cars that the line had used since the 1890s. By the 2000s, the cars and tracks were not in good repair, so the ride was slow and bumpy, though the carriages were regularly repainted in keeping with the tram's heritage image. The ride is good for sightseeing, but besides tourists, there are few regular paying passengers and so the tramway was increasingly running at a loss. The new replica trams, which began to arrive in 2014, have new safety features, but retain the appearance of the old cars, for heritage- preservation value and tourist appeal. They are bi-directional, open-sided cars, using trolley poles to collect current. Suspension and renovation One of the new trams, which are replicas of the old ones, in the Carioca terminal loop in 2015 In the mid-2010s, the old trams were still in storage in the depot, which remained out of use at that time. Six people were killed and at least 50 injured when a tram derailed in late August 2011. All service was suspended indefinitely after the accident. The year 2012 saw the start of a R$110m project for the procurement of new rolling stock and the renovation of the tram line. An order for 14 new two-axle trams was placed in 2012 with a Brazilian manufacturer named T'Trans (based in Tr√™s Rios). Delivery was originally projected to begin in November 2013, but was delayed, and the first car was not delivered until August 2014. Reopening of the line was planned to take place in stages, starting with the section between Largo da Carioca and Largo do Curvelo. In May 2014, this was predicted to occur in August 2014, but was delayed. By 1 October 2014, only one new tramcar had been delivered, and it was making test runs. By the end of 2014, five of the new trams had been delivered, numbered 16‚Äì20. After additional delays, the first segment finally reopened on 27 July 2015, with very limited service initially, covering only the section from Carioca terminus to Largo do Curvelo and running only between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., every 20 minutes, Monday to Saturday.Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, October 2015, p. 413. LRTA Publishing (UK) Service was extended from Largo do Curvelo to Largo do Guimar√£es on 28 December 2015, but without any expansion to the limited hours of operation. During the 2016 Summer Olympics, the hours of operation were temporarily expanded, to 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and the frequency was doubled, to every 10 minutes. By that time, mid-2016, additional delays had caused the estimated date of restoration of service over the full line to Dois Irm√£os to be postponed to at least December 2017. Service was finally restored through to Dois Irm√£os in January 2019, in stages. In February 2018, a limited-service extension ‚Äì served by only five trips per day ‚Äì from Largo Guimar√£es to Pra√ßa Odylo came into operation, and on 22 October 2018 all service was extended to Largo do Fran√ßa. The final stage was reached on 21 January 2019, making the route once again Largo da Carioca to Dois Irm√£os, a length of . Of the order for 14 new replica-vintage tramcars that was placed with T'Trans in 2012, only eight cars had been delivered by mid-2019, numbered 16‚Äì23. As of 2015, the old trams were in storage at the depot (carhouse), their fate undecided, and the new trams that had been delivered so far were stored in the Carioca terminal loop; the present status is unclear.

Gillette, The Human Drift, Boston, New Era Publishing Co., 1894. The book details Gillette's theory that replacing competitive corporations with a single giant publicly owned trust (\\"the United Company\\") would cure virtually all social ills. The plan One- third of the book is devoted to Gillette's plan for an immense three-level metropolis (called \\"Metropolis\\") on the site of Niagara Falls. Designed to accommodate a population of tens of millions of inhabitants, the mega-city would draw its electric power from the Falls. (A photograph of the Falls served as the book's frontispiece.) The first large electrical generating facilities at Niagara Falls, utilizing the new alternating current system of Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, were being constructed at the time Gillette wrote.David Lindsay, House of Invention: The Secret Life of Everyday Objects, New York, Lyons Press, 2000; p. 10. Gillette's city was to possess \\"a perfect economical system of production and distribution,\\" run by the United Company; it would in fact be the only city on the North American continent. Economies of scale would mean that a single one of every necessary facility -- one steel mill, one shoe factory, etc. -- would exist. Advances in mechanization would generate ever-greater efficiencies, and ever-greater wealth for the whole society. Social progress would be natural and inevitable; gender equality would be the rule.Patrick Vincent McGreevy, Imagining Niagara: The Meaning and Making of Niagara Falls, Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 1994; pp. 124-34. Gillette gives a highly specific picture of his metropolis: it is shaped in a perfect rectangle, 135 miles on the long side and 45 on the short. Even with necessary farming and mining, most of the rest of North America outside Metropolis would be a natural environment. Gillette saw the city as containing the full population of the United States at that time, sixty million people; he also thought that the city could accept another thirty million in future population growth. Gillette wanted the buildings of Metropolis to be built of porcelain, for endurance and cleanliness. (His thinking on this point may have been influenced by the famous \\"White City\\" of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.) Gillette favored circular buildings, even for residences (25-floor apartment complexes), and a hexagonal street plan. (Though the details of his plan were highly specific, Gillette was not rigidly committed to them; in a future revised version he would switch to a circular shape for his city, and raise the apartment buildings to 50 stories.) The text of The Human Drift was accompanied with abundant illustrations and plans, a graph of the \\"Educational and Industrial Pyramid,\\" and other features of Gillette's scheme. \\"His book is important for the attention it received in its time,\\" though today it is \\"a curiosity.\\"Susan L.

Like Zhang's earlier film, Curiosity Kills the Cat, Lost Indulgence takes place in the central Chinese city of Chongqing. The film is a family drama about the relationship between a mother and son (Jiang Wenli and Tan Jianci) after the sudden death of the father (Eric Tsang). Lost Indulgence navigated a complicated series of schedules and cancellations before it was allowed to screen abroad, at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2008.  Plot  Upon the apparent death of his taxi-driver father (Eric Tseng), Xian-chuen (Tan Jianci) and his mother Li (Jiang Wenli) take in his father's last fare, Su-Dan (Karen Mok), a bar girl, to fulfill the family's obligations. The father, Wu Tao drove his cab into the Yangtze River, breaking Su-Dan's leg and potentially paralyzing her for life, though his body was not recovered. The son, a bereaved and sullen teenager, does not take to the crippled Su-Dan at first, his thoughts preoccupied with a school crush and the sudden death of his father. As time goes on, however he warms to her presence (and her ever- exposed legs). Su-Dan, restricted to a wheelchair sees the boy as a substitute little brother. Meanwhile, Li, who works as a medic at a factory, is forced to work double shifts at a veterinarian hospital to help make ends meet. There she meets a handsome stranger (Eason Chan) who brings in his injured dog, and a tentative romance begins to form.  Cast  * Jiang Wenli as Li, the mother in the family. She takes on her husband's last passenger before his death. * Tan Jianci as Xian-chuen, Li and Wu Tao's sullen teenage son. * Eric Tseng as the father, Wu Tao, a taxi-driver, Li's husband and Xian-chuen's father, early in the film he is killed when his taxi plunges off a bridge into a river. * Karen Mok as Su-Dan, a crippled bar girl who was Li's husband's last passenger. * Eason Chan  Release  Lost Indulgence navigated a complicated series of schedules and cancellations before it was allowed to screen abroad. Originally scheduled to premiere at the 2008 Hong Kong International Film Festival, the film was pulled at the last moment by its producers due to failure to gain Chinese censor approval. For many in the industry, the decision to withdraw the film was fallout from the decision by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television to ban director Lou Ye and producer Nai An for improperly screening their 2006 film Summer Palace at the Cannes Film Festival without permission. Others saw the heightened concern as a result of public criticism and controversy surrounding Ang Lee's sexually explicit Lust, Caution and Feng Xiaogang's allegorical war story Assembly. The withdrawal of the film was also seen as a sign of the growing influence that the Chinese Film Bureau has had on Hong Kong productions (or in this case co- productions). Lost Indulgence missed a second scheduled screening at the Udine East Asian Film Festival, when a screening was again canceled due to failure to obtain official permission. Upon this second cancellation, critics speculated that producers were taking extra care before the Olympics rather than seeing the delays as a clear cut case of censorship. Despite these setback, the film eventually did get its international premiere at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival on April 25, 2008. Critical reception The film opened to mixed reviews. Perry Lam of Muse Magazine called the movie 'an object lesson in how bad casting can skew a movie irredeemably.'

Hon. George Robertson MP) in July 1998. Specifically, this recognised that deployed air operations are likely to take place at the end of a long supply chain or line of communication. Control of this line of communication ia a task which falls to the service military police organisations: The Royal Air Force Police and the Royal Military Police. To undertake this expanded task, the establishment of the RAF Police was increased by a number of both regular personnel and reservists. After a study, it was decided that the most effective way for the reservists to be formed was as members of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. These personnel would then be integrated with the existing Tactical Police and Security Squadron to form Tactical Police Wing. Recruiting for 3 (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) Police Squadron, began in earnest in October 2002. No 3 (Tactical Provost Wing) Police Squadron is based at RAF Honington in Suffolk. During 2005 elements of 3 TPS deployed on exercise with Territorial Army units of the Royal Military Police to Poland for Exercise Uhlan Eagle.Royal Military Police journal More latterly known as 3 (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) Police Squadron, No: 3 Royal Air Force (Tactical) Police Wing The (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) element is often abbreviated to (RAuxAF) Tactical Provost Wing is an independent Unit based at RAF Honington. The Wing had its roots in the Support Squadron of Headquarters Royal Air Force Provost and Security Services, which was formed in 1968 to provide a force reserve for the Provost Marshal, as they were then known, to deploy in support of operations, exercises and other contingencies. It was re-titled Tactical Police and Security Squadron in 1996 as part of an increased focus on support to deployed operations. The primary focus for the Squadron and latterly the Wing has been Lines of Communication Policing and policing of deployed operations and exercises in the United Kingdom and overseas. The Squadron and Wing also provides air transport fleet worldwide through searches of passengers and cargo, the guarding of aircraft and cargoes, and the assessment of airfield security. In addition it continues to provide Royal Air Force Police personnel to undertake military policing and security tasks on both deployed operating bases and in wider operational areas. There have been few Royal Air Force operations in the last 30 years which have not seen the deployment of RAF Police personnel including RAuxAF Police. 3 (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) Police Squadron is totally integrated into No: 3 Royal Air Force (Tactical) Police Wing structure. Much of its support comes from Wing level resources and, in turn, personnel can expect to work directly alongside their regular counterparts. Applicants to join are invited to attend the Squadron HQ at RAF Henlow for a half day selection board. The board includes an aptitude test, interview and medical examination. Selected recruits complete a Basic Recruit Course held at RAF Halton. The BRC is in two phases: *Phase 1 - 4 weekends at RAF Honington *Phase 2 - Trade Training is then done at weekends and a residential 16-day period. continuation then takes place at RAF Honington for one weekend every month (Usually the second weekend, except November because of Remembrance weekend).

It was the first protected area in Bulgaria that is completely managed and maintained by a non-governmental organization, the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds(BSPB). BSPB prepares and implements activities adopted by the Council of Minister's Management Plan, but receives its funding completely from entrance fees, souvenirs sold, and donations. Through this arrangement, it aims to be a sustainable model for nature conservation, environmental education, and eco- tourism. Located south of the port city of Bourgas on the Southeastern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, Poda is surrounded by the Black Sea and three large lakes - Vaya Lake, Mandra Lake, and Atanasovsko Lake. Along with the protected area Poda, they form a large wetland area called the Burgas Lakes. It is a biologically important area as a resting station for many of the migratory birds who use the Eastern European migratory route, Via Pontica; as well as an important nesting habitat for many breeding species. In 1994, it was classified as a CORINE and in 2002 Poda was included in the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. It is proposed to be included in the European Natura 2000 network within the natural area Mandra - Poda. Ecology Despite occupying a relatively small area, 265 bird species have been observed in the protected area Poda. 46 bird species nest in the area and it is the only location on the Black Sea Coast with a mixed heron breeding colony of spoonbill, glossy ibis, purple heron, grey heron, night heron, great white egret and little egret. Other species breeding in the area are marsh harriers, common terns and little terns, and great cormorants - which have forsaken their usual breeding sites in reed beds and made their nests in the abandoned electrical pylons in the area. Its rich biodiversity is attributed to the three different types of water habitats it contains - brackish, fresh, and hyper-saline salt water. During the winter months in the bay at Poda, pygmy cormorants, a globally endangered species, rest at Poda. Other endangered species in the area at this time are Dalmatian pelicans and white-headed ducks. They share the bay with thousands of coots, pochards, and other ducks. Poda is located along Europe's second largest bird migration route, the Via Pontica. Annually, 75% of the European white stork population (over 250,000), 100% of the white pelican population (over 40,000) and thousands of raptors, waterfowl and song birds can be observed during the months of migration in March-April and August-September. Poda Nature CenterOther rare species of note in the protected area include Bulgaria's largest snake, the four-lined rat-snake (Elaphe sauromates); Europe's smallest mammal, the pygmy white toothed shrew; nutria, which are not native to the area; and a worldwide endangered European otter. Tourism To facilitate its mission of environmental education and eco-tourism, BSPB has operated a Nature Conservation Center at Poda since 1997. It is open the entire year and offers lectures on the unique habitats and species in the area to tourists and visiting groups of students. Visitors can use the center's binoculars and telescopes, species identification posters, and nature path with a covered bird hide to observe the different birds in the protected area. Guided tours are given by on-site ornithologists or BSPB volunteers that explain the different habitats and common species found in each. The center receives around 15,000 visitors a year, mostly in the summer.

He was the stepfather of Albert, Prince Consort, and grandfather of Hans Poelzig. Life Alexander von Hanstein came from the Th√ºringer noble family of Hanstein Castle and was the son of Baron Friedrich von Hanstein and his wife, Anna Maria. In 1824, Alexander was equerry (Stallmeister) for Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. The duke's marriage was rocky; his first wife, Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, had an affair with von Hanstein, and Louise was exiled from the dukedom in the autumn of 1824. She was assigned a residence in the Principality of Lichtenberg, now in Saarland, and Alexander followed her there. On the death of Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe- Gotha-Altenburg, on 11 February 1825, Louise became sole heiress of the House of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. In the subsequent discussions over the inheritance, a separation agreement was hammered out and the Saxon duchies were re-organised. Ernest separated from Louise on 31 March 1826, and in the same year exchanged Saalfeld for Gotha. Now free, Louise planned to marry von Hanstein, and in preparation for such a marriage Alexander was created Count of P√∂lzig and Beiersdorf on 19 July 1826 by Louise‚Äôs uncle Frederick, Duke of Saxe- Altenburg. On 18 October 1826, Alexander and Louise married at St. Wendel, the capital of the small principality of Lichtenberg. They resided in the castle there and spent some happy years; but the marriage remained childless and Louise was prohibited by her first husband from contacting her children in Coburg. After Louise's early death from cancer in 1831, Alexander went into the Prussian service and commanded the regiment of the corps C√ºrrassier in Potsdam. He married the 21-year-old Marie Therese von Carlowitz (1812-1845) on 18 April 1833 in Coburg. As Count and Countess of P√∂lzig, they lived at Schloss P√∂lzig and had three children: * Maximilan Anton (18 February 1834 - between 1865 and 1871) * Clara Henriette Marie (3 April 1835 - 25 April 1879) * Thekla Marie Agnes (29 November 1841 - 4 April 1903) In 1845, Alexander approached his stepson Prince Albert, who in the meantime had married Queen Victoria, and Albert allowed him a pension. His second daughter, Clara, married the British shipowner George Acland Ames on 13 July 1854. Their sixth child, Hans, was born on 30 April 1869 in Berlin. Because Ames did not acknowledge Hans as his son, he was given the surname Poelzig. Clara and Ames separated in July 1869, and Clara returned to P√∂lzig. She lived as a \\"the young countess\\" in the Schloss and died 10 years later in Beiersdorf. Hans Poelzig grew up in Berlin and became a world-famous architect and set designer. Alexander's grandchildren, the Ames family in England, inherited the schloss on his death in 1884.

The plot concerns several poor families living in the slums of 19th century London. Rich in naturalistic detail, the novel concentrates on the individual problems and hardships which result from the typical shortages experienced by the lower classes‚Äîwant of money, employment and decent living conditions. The Nether World is pessimistic and concerns exclusively the lives of poor people: there is no juxtaposition with the world of the rich. Plot summary The old Michael Snowdon returns from Australia to London after inheriting a substantial sum of money from his deceased son. Despite being able to live a comfortable, if not luxurious life, he spends only on necessities and lives like a poor man, keeping his fortune secret. In London he finds his granddaughter, Jane, a weak child whom he rescues from the tyranny of the Peckovers (mother and daughter), in whose house she is employed as a household drudge. Jane's father, Joseph, is another son of Michael's who disappeared a few years ago in search of work, leaving Jane with the Peckovers. Michael nurtures a plan to bestow his fortune on Jane after his death, but he wants Jane to spend this money on charity and social work rather than on her own needs. He engages Jane in charitable activities and everyday work even before he reveals the secret of his wealth to her, trying to inculcate to her the principles of benevolence. Joseph Snowdon returns suddenly to London. Formerly he argued with his father and is not on amiable terms with him. Joseph is preyed upon by the young Clem Peckover who marries him after she and her mother begin suspecting that Joseph's father is rich. Michael receives Joseph reservedly, without revealing intent of sharing the fortune with him. Joseph, pestered by his disappointed wife, also believes that Michael is rich, and tries to win his father's respect by improving relations with Jane. He also befriends Jane's older friend, Sidney Kirkwood. Sidney, an honest and sympathetic character, apparently intends to marry Jane in the future, unaware of Michael's fortune. Joseph, fearing that if Sidney, Michael's favorite, marries Jane, then Michael will leave most of the fortune to the young couple. Therefore, he develops a plan to make Clara Hewett, Sidney's former love, more fond of Sidney, and catalyze their marriage. Clara Hewett is a young attractive woman who left her poor family with an intention of becoming a famous actress and escaping poverty. Clara's brother Bob, a promising artist, chooses to remain in the same social class: he marries a poor and unfortunate girl Pennyloaf whom he does not love. When Clara was living with her family, she, proud and ambitious, scorned the attention of Sidney. Sidney is a friend of her father John and the two quarrel because of Clara after she left. John believes that the loss of his daughter is Sidney's fault. Later, when John's sickly wife dies, Sidney helps the struggling Hewett family with some of his savings, and John becomes contrite about his earlier misunderstanding of Sidney's nature. In search of fame and fortune Clara joins a traveling theatre and shows talent, but her plans are thwarted by a rival actress who, jealous of Clara's success, disfigures Clara's face with an acid. Clara is admitted to a hospital, and Joseph informs John anonymously of her whereabouts. Clara is taken home, but now that all her hopes for better life are ended, she starts re-evaluating her ungratefulness towards her father and Sidney, and also contemplates suicide. Meanwhile, Michael reveals his secret separately to Jane and Sidney and emphasizes his plan for how the fortune should be spent. At first, Sidney seems to like the idea of life's work for charity, but later believes that Michael's plan is futile and that the money should rather be spent on Jane's education and her enjoyment of life. Disagreeing with Michael's plans, and feeling that his dignity is compromised by Joseph's broaching the question of the old man's money, Sidney reduces his relationship with Jane and instead offers marriage to Clara who accepts it gratefully. Jane, heartbroken and uncertain of her firmness to carry out Michael's plan, becomes disfavored by the old man. After his explanation with Jane, Michael destroys his will, contemplates the matter, but before he can compose a new will he suffers a stroke and dies. In the absence of a will, the scheming Joseph inherits all the money. His wife is making plans to kill him, but Joseph escapes abroad with the money, content to leave Jane only a small pension. The novel has a tragic end for all its characters. Sidney and Clara have an unhappy marriage exacerbated by material wants. Jane rejects her father's pension after discovering his intrigues and declines an offer of marriage from a well-to-do business clerk, thus accepting a life of toil. Bob Hewett largely abandons his wife and children and dies fleeing arrest for forging coins. Clem is accused of trying to poison her mother and is tried in court. Joseph's fortune is squandered in the financial markets of the United States, a misfortune that he cannot survive. 'The Nether World' opens near Clerkenwell Close in central London, and throughout the novel focusses on the Clerkenwell area, then largely working class and a centre of workshop and small factory trades. The novel is remarkable for its very strong sense of place. Further reading * Coustillas, Pierre, ed. (2013). George Gissing: The Critical Heritage. London: Routledge, pp. 134‚Äì156. * Farrar, F. W.

A (fully) quantified Boolean formula is a formula in quantified propositional logic where every variable is quantified (or bound), using either existential or universal quantifiers, at the beginning of the sentence. Such a formula is equivalent to either true or false (since there are no free variables). If such a formula evaluates to true, then that formula is in the language TQBF. It is also known as QSAT (Quantified SAT). Overview In computational complexity theory, the quantified Boolean formula problem (QBF) is a generalization of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which both existential quantifiers and universal quantifiers can be applied to each variable. Put another way, it asks whether a quantified sentential form over a set of Boolean variables is true or false. For example, the following is an instance of QBF: : \\\\forall x\\\\ \\\\exists y\\\\ \\\\exists z\\\\ ((x \\\\lor z) \\\\land y) QBF is the canonical complete problem for PSPACE, the class of problems solvable by a deterministic or nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial space and unlimited time. Given the formula in the form of an abstract syntax tree, the problem can be solved easily by a set of mutually recursive procedures which evaluate the formula. Such an algorithm uses space proportional to the height of the tree, which is linear in the worst case, but uses time exponential in the number of quantifiers. Provided that MA ‚ää PSPACE, which is widely believed, QBF cannot be solved, nor can a given solution even be verified, in either deterministic or probabilistic polynomial time (in fact, unlike the satisfiability problem, there's no known way to specify a solution succinctly). It can be solved using an alternating Turing machine in linear time, since AP = PSPACE, where AP is the class of problems alternating machines can solve in polynomial time. When the seminal result IP = PSPACE was shown (see interactive proof system), it was done by exhibiting an interactive proof system that could solve QBF by solving a particular arithmetization of the problem. QBF formulas have a number of useful canonical forms. For example, it can be shown that there is a polynomial-time many-one reduction that will move all quantifiers to the front of the formula and make them alternate between universal and existential quantifiers. There is another reduction that proved useful in the IP = PSPACE proof where no more than one universal quantifier is placed between each variable's use and the quantifier binding that variable. This was critical in limiting the number of products in certain subexpressions of the arithmetization.  Prenex normal form  A fully quantified Boolean formula can be assumed to have a very specific form, called prenex normal form. It has two basic parts: a portion containing only quantifiers and a portion containing an unquantified Boolean formula usually denoted as \\\\displaystyle \\\\phi. If there are \\\\displaystyle n Boolean variables, the entire formula can be written as :\\\\displaystyle \\\\exists x_1 \\\\forall x_2 \\\\exists x_3 \\\\cdots Q_n x_n \\\\phi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\\\dots, x_n) where every variable falls within the scope of some quantifier. By introducing dummy variables, any formula in prenex normal form can be converted into a sentence where existential and universal quantifiers alternate. Using the dummy variable \\\\displaystyle y_1, :\\\\displaystyle \\\\exists x_1 \\\\exists x_2 \\\\phi(x_1, x_2) \\\\quad \\\\mapsto \\\\quad \\\\exists x_1 \\\\forall y_1 \\\\exists x_2 \\\\phi(x_1, x_2) The second sentence has the same truth value but follows the restricted syntax. Assuming fully quantified Boolean formulas to be in prenex normal form is a frequent feature of proofs.  Solving  There is a simple recursive algorithm for determining whether a QBF is in TQBF (i.e. is true). Given some QBF :Q_1 x_1 Q_2 x_2 \\\\cdots Q_n x_n \\\\phi(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n). If the formula contains no quantifiers, we can just return the formula. Otherwise, we take off the first quantifier and check both possible values for the first variable: :A = Q_2 x_2 \\\\cdots Q_n x_n \\\\phi(0, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n), :B = Q_2 x_2 \\\\cdots Q_n x_n \\\\phi(1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n). If Q_1 = \\\\exists, then return A \\\\lor B. If Q_1 = \\\\forall, then return A \\\\land B. How fast does this algorithm run? For every quantifier in the initial QBF, the algorithm makes two recursive calls on only a linearly smaller subproblem. This gives the algorithm an exponential runtime O(2n). How much space does this algorithm use? Within each invocation of the algorithm, it needs to store the intermediate results of computing A and B. Every recursive call takes off one quantifier, so the total recursive depth is linear in the number of quantifiers. Formulas that lack quantifiers can be evaluated in space logarithmic in the number of variables. The initial QBF was fully quantified, so there are at least as many quantifiers as variables. Thus, this algorithm uses O(n + log n) = O(n) space. This makes the TQBF language part of the PSPACE complexity class.  PSPACE-completeness  The TQBF language serves in complexity theory as the canonical PSPACE-complete problem. Being PSPACE-complete means that a language is in PSPACE and that the language is also PSPACE-hard. The algorithm above shows that TQBF is in PSPACE. Showing that TQBF is PSPACE-hard requires showing that any language in the complexity class PSPACE can be reduced to TQBF in polynomial time. I.e., :\\\\forall L\\\\in \\\\mathsf{PSPACE}, L\\\\leq_p \\\\mathrm{TQBF}. This means that, for a PSPACE language L, whether an input is in L can be decided by checking whether f(x) is in TQBF, for some function that is required to run in polynomial time (relative to the length of the input). Symbolically, :x\\\\in L\\\\iff f(x)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{TQBF}. Proving that TQBF is PSPACE-hard, requires specification of . So, suppose that L is a PSPACE language. This means that L can be decided by a polynomial space deterministic Turing machine (DTM). This is very important for the reduction of L to TQBF, because the configurations of any such Turing Machine can be represented as Boolean formulas, with Boolean variables representing the state of the machine as well as the contents of each cell on the Turing Machine tape, with the position of the Turing Machine head encoded in the formula by the formula's ordering. In particular, our reduction will use the variables c_1 and c_2, which represent two possible configurations of the DTM for L, and a natural number t, in constructing a QBF \\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t} which is true if and only if the DTM for L can go from the configuration encoded in c_1 to the configuration encoded in c_2 in no more than t steps. The function , then, will construct from the DTM for L a QBF \\\\phi_{c_{start},c_{accept},T}, where c_{start} is the DTM's starting configuration, c_{accept} is the DTM's accepting configuration, and T is the maximum number of steps the DTM could need to move from one configuration to the other. We know that T = O(exp(n)), where n is the length of the input, because this bounds the total number of possible configurations of the relevant DTM. Of course, it cannot take the DTM more steps than there are possible configurations to reach c_\\\\mathrm{accept} unless it enters a loop, in which case it will never reach c_\\\\mathrm{accept} anyway. At this stage of the proof, we have already reduced the question of whether an input formula (encoded, of course, in c_{start}) is in L to the question of whether the QBF \\\\phi_{c_{start},c_{accept},T}, i.e., f(w), is in TQBF. The remainder of this proof proves that can be computed in polynomial time. For t=1, computation of \\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t} is straightforward‚Äîeither one of the configurations changes to the other in one step or it does not. Since the Turing Machine that our formula represents is deterministic, this presents no problem. For t>1, computation of \\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t} involves a recursive evaluation, looking for a so-called \\"middle point\\" m_1. In this case, we rewrite the formula as follows: :\\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}=\\\\exists m_1(\\\\phi_{c_1,m_1,\\\\lceil t/2\\\\rceil}\\\\wedge\\\\phi_{m_1,c_2,\\\\lceil t/2\\\\rceil}). This converts the question of whether c_1 can reach c_2 in t steps to the question of whether c_1 reaches a middle point m_1 in t/2 steps, which itself reaches c_2 in t/2 steps. The answer to the latter question of course gives the answer to the former. Now, t is only bounded by T, which is exponential (and so not polynomial) in the length of the input. Additionally, each recursive layer virtually doubles the length of the formula. (The variable m_1 is only one midpoint‚Äîfor greater t, there are more stops along the way, so to speak.) So the time required to recursively evaluate \\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t} in this manner could be exponential as well, simply because the formula could become exponentially large. This problem is solved by universally quantifying using variables c_3 and c_4 over the configuration pairs (e.g., \\\\\\\\{ (c_1,m_1),(m_1,c_2)\\\\\\\\}), which prevents the length of the formula from expanding due to recursive layers. This yields the following interpretation of \\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}: :\\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}=\\\\exists m_1\\\\forall (c_3,c_4)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{ (c_1,m_1),(m_1,c_2)\\\\\\\\}(\\\\phi_{c_3,c_4,\\\\lceil t/2\\\\rceil}). This version of the formula can indeed be computed in polynomial time, since any one instance of it can be computed in polynomial time. The universally quantified ordered pair simply tells us that whichever choice of (c_3,c_4) is made, \\\\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}\\\\iff\\\\phi_{c_3,c_4,\\\\lceil t/2\\\\rceil}. Thus, \\\\forall L\\\\in \\\\mathsf{PSPACE}, L\\\\leq_p \\\\mathrm{TQBF}, so TQBF is PSPACE-hard. Together with the above result that TQBF is in PSPACE, this completes the proof that TQBF is a PSPACE-complete language. (This proof follows Sipser 2006 pp. 310‚Äì313 in all essentials. Papadimitriou 1994 also includes a proof.) Miscellany *One important subproblem in TQBF is the Boolean satisfiability problem. In this problem, you wish to know whether a given Boolean formula \\\\phi can be made true with some assignment of variables. This is equivalent to the TQBF using only existential quantifiers: :: \\\\exists x_1 \\\\cdots \\\\exists x_n \\\\phi(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) :This is also an example of the larger result NP \\\\subseteq PSPACE which follows directly from the observation that a polynomial time verifier for a proof of a language accepted by a NTM (Non-deterministic Turing machine) requires polynomial space to store the proof. *Any class in the polynomial hierarchy (PH) has TQBF as a hard problem. In other words, for the class comprising all languages L for which there exists a poly-time TM V, a verifier, such that for all input x and some constant i, :: x \\\\in L \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\exists y_1 \\\\forall y_2 \\\\cdots Q_i y_i \\\\ V(x,y_1,y_2,\\\\dots,y_i)\\\\ =\\\\ 1 : which has a specific QBF formulation that is given as :: \\\\exists \\\\phi such that \\\\exists \\\\vec{x_1} \\\\forall \\\\vec{x_2} \\\\cdots Q_i \\\\vec{x_i}\\\\ \\\\phi(\\\\vec{x_1},\\\\vec{x_2},\\\\dots,\\\\vec{x_i})\\\\ =\\\\ 1 :where the \\\\vec{x_i}'s are vectors of Boolean variables. *It is important to note that while TQBF the language is defined as the collection of true quantified Boolean formulas, the abbreviation TQBF is often used (even in this article) to stand for a totally quantified Boolean formula, often simply called a QBF (quantified Boolean formula, understood as \\"fully\\" or \\"totally\\" quantified). It is important to distinguish contextually between the two uses of the abbreviation TQBF in reading the literature. *A TQBF can be thought of as a game played between two players, with alternating moves. Existentially quantified variables are equivalent to the notion that a move is available to a player at a turn. Universally quantified variables mean that the outcome of the game does not depend on what move a player makes at that turn. Also, a TQBF whose first quantifier is existential corresponds to a formula game in which the first player has a winning strategy. *A TQBF for which the quantified formula is in 2-CNF may be solved in linear time, by an algorithm involving strong connectivity analysis of its implication graph. The 2-satisfiability problem is a special case of TQBF for these formulas, in which every quantifier is existential... *There is a systematic treatment of restricted versions of quantified Boolean formulas (giving Schaefer-type classifications) provided in an expository paper by Hubie Chen. *Planar TQBF, generalizing Planar SAT, was proved PSPACE-complete by D.

Papadimitriou. Computational Complexity. Addison-Wesley, 1994. .

In a 1979 scholarly paper, Leslie Valiant proved that the computational problem of computing the permanent of a matrix is #P-hard, even if the matrix is restricted to have entries that are all 0 or 1. In this restricted case, computing the permanent is even #P-complete, because it corresponds to the #P problem of counting the number of permutation matrices one can get by changing ones into zeroes. Valiant's 1979 paper also introduced #P as a complexity class.Lance Fortnow. My Favorite Ten Complexity Theorems of the Past Decade. Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science: Proceedings of the 14th Conference, Madras, India, December 15‚Äì17, 1994. P. S. Thiagarajan (editor), pp. 256‚Äì275, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2007. ; p. 265 Valiant's definition of completeness, and his proof of completeness of 01-permanent, both used polynomial-time Turing reductions. In this kind of reduction, a single hard instance of some other problem in #P is reduced to computing the permanent of a sequence of multiple graphs, each of which could potentially depend on the results of previous permanent computations. A later simplification by showed that it is possible to use a weaker notion of reduction, a polynomial-time counting reduction, that translates the other problem into a single instance of the permanent problem. Significance One reason for interest in the computational complexity of the permanent is that it provides an example of a problem where constructing a single solution can be done efficiently but where counting all solutions is hard. As Papadimitriou writes in his book Computational Complexity: Specifically, computing the permanent (shown to be difficult by Valiant's results) is closely connected with finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph, which is solvable in polynomial time by the Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm.John E. Hopcroft, Richard M. Karp: An n^{5/2} Algorithm for Maximum Matchings in Bipartite Graphs. SIAM J. Comput. 2(4), 225‚Äì231 (1973) For a bipartite graph with 2n vertices partitioned into two parts with n vertices each, the number of perfect matchings equals the permanent of its biadjacency matrix and the square of the number of perfect matchings is equal to the permanent of its adjacency matrix. Since any 0‚Äì1 matrix is the biadjacency matrix of some bipartite graph, Valiant's theorem impliesDexter Kozen. The Design and Analysis of Algorithms. Springer-Verlag, New York, 1991. ; pp. 141‚Äì142 that the problem of counting the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph is #P-complete, and in conjunction with Toda's theorem this implies that it is hard for the entire polynomial hierarchy.Seinosuke Toda. PP is as Hard as the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy. SIAM Journal on Computing, Volume 20 (1991), Issue 5, pp. 865-877. The computational complexity of the permanent also has some significance in other aspects of complexity theory: it is not known whether NC equals P (informally, whether every polynomially-solvable problem can be solved by a polylogarithmic-time parallel algorithm) and Ketan Mulmuley has suggested an approach to resolving this question that relies on writing the permanent as the determinant of a matrix.Ketan Mulmuley.

Ben-Dor and Halevi's proof Below, the proof that computing the permanent of a 01-matrix is #P-complete is described. It mainly follows the proof by . =Overview= Any square matrix A = (a_{ij}) can be viewed as the adjacency matrix of a directed graph, with a_{ij} representing the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. Then, the permanent of A is equal to the sum of the weights of all cycle-covers of the graph; this is a graph-theoretic interpretation of the permanent. #SAT, a function problem related to the Boolean satisfiability problem, is the problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments of a given Boolean formula. It is a #P-complete problem (by definition), as any NP machine can be encoded into a Boolean formula by a process similar to that in Cook's theorem, such that the number of satisfying assignments of the Boolean formula is equal to the number of accepting paths of the NP machine. Any formula in SAT can be rewritten as a formula in 3-CNF form preserving the number of satisfying assignments, and so #SAT and #3SAT are equivalent and #3SAT is #P-complete as well. In order to prove that 01-Permanent is #P-hard, it is therefore sufficient to show that the number of satisfying assignments for a 3-CNF formula can be expressed succinctly as a function of the permanent of a matrix that contains only the values 0 and 1. This is usually accomplished in two steps: # Given a 3-CNF formula œÜ, construct a directed integer-weighted graph G_\\\\phi, such that the sum of the weights of cycle covers of G_\\\\phi (or equivalently, the permanent of its adjacency matrix) is equal to the number of satisfying assignments of œÜ. This establishes that Permanent is #P-hard. # Through a series of reductions, reduce Permanent to 01-Permanent, the problem of computing the permanent of a matrix all entries 0 or 1. This establishes that 01-permanent is #P-hard as well. =Constructing the integer graph= Given a 3CNF-formula \\\\phi with m clauses and n variables, one can construct a weighted, directed graph G_\\\\phi such that # each satisfying assignment for \\\\phi will have a corresponding set of cycle covers in G_\\\\phi where the sum of the weights of cycle covers in this set will be 12^m ; and # all other cycle covers in G_\\\\phi will have weights summing to 0. Thus if (\\\\\\\\#\\\\phi) is the number of satisfying assignments for \\\\phi, the permanent of this graph will be 12^m \\\\cdot (\\\\\\\\#\\\\phi). (Valiant's original proof constructs a graph with entries in \\\\\\\\{-1,0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\} whose permanent is 4^{t(\\\\phi)}\\\\cdot(\\\\\\\\#\\\\phi) where t(\\\\phi) is \\"twice the number of occurrences of literals in \\\\phi\\" ‚Äì m.) The graph construction makes use of a component that is treated as a \\"black box.\\" To keep the explanation simple, the properties of this component are given without actually defining the structure of the component. To specify GœÜ, one first constructs a variable node in GœÜ for each of the n variables in œÜ. Additionally, for each of the m clauses in œÜ, one constructs a clause component Cj in GœÜ that functions as a sort of \\"black box.\\" All that needs to be noted about Cj is that it has three input edges and three output edges. The input edges come either from variable nodes or from previous clause components (e.g., Co for some o < j) and the output edges go either to variable nodes or to later clause components (e.g., Co for some o>j). The first input and output edges correspond with the first variable of the clause j, and so on. Thus far, all of the nodes that will appear in the graph GœÜ have been specified. Next, one would consider the edges. For each variable x_i of \\\\phi, one makes a true cycle (T-cycle) and a false cycle (F-cycle) in G_\\\\phi. To create the T-cycle, one starts at the variable node for x_i and draw an edge to the clause component C_j that corresponds to the first clause in which x_i appears. If x_i is the first variable in the clause of \\\\phi corresponding to C_j, this edge will be the first input edge of C_j, and so on. Thence, draw an edge to the next clause component corresponding to the next clause of \\\\phi in which x_i appears, connecting it from the appropriate output edge of C_j to the appropriate input edge of the next clause component, and so on. After the last clause in which x_i appears, we connect the appropriate output edge of the corresponding clause component back to x_i's variable node. Of course, this completes the cycle. To create the F-cycle, one would follow the same procedure, but connect x_i's variable node to those clause components in which ~x_i appears, and finally back to x_i's variable node. All of these edges outside the clause components are termed external edges, all of which have weight 1. Inside the clause components, the edges are termed internal edges. Every external edge is part of a T-cycle or an F-cycle (but not both‚Äîthat would force inconsistency). Note that the graph G_\\\\phi is of size linear in \\\\phi, so the construction can be done in polytime (assuming that the clause components do not cause trouble). Notable properties of the graph A useful property of G_\\\\phi is that its cycle covers correspond to variable assignments for \\\\phi. For a cycle cover Z of G_\\\\phi, one can say that Z induces an assignment of values for the variables in \\\\phi just in case Z contains all of the external edges in x_i's T-cycle and none of the external edges in x_i's F-cycle for all variables x_i that the assignment makes true, and vice versa for all variables x_i that the assignment makes false. Although any given cycle cover Z need not induce an assignment for \\\\phi, any one that does induces exactly one assignment, and the same assignment induced depends only on the external edges of Z. The term Z is considered an incomplete cycle cover at this stage, because one talks only about its external edges, M. In the section below, one considers M-completions to show that one has a set of cycle covers corresponding to each M that have the necessary properties. The sort of Z's that don't induce assignments are the ones with cycles that \\"jump\\" inside the clause components. That is, if for every C_j, at least one of C_j's input edges is in Z, and every output edge of the clause components is in Z when the corresponding input edge is in Z, then Z is proper with respect to each clause component, and Z will produce a satisfying assignment for \\\\phi. This is because proper Z's contain either the complete T-cycle or the complete F-cycle of every variable x_i in \\\\phi as well as each including edges going into and coming out of each clause component. Thus, these Z's assign either true or false (but never both) to each x_i and ensure that each clause is satisfied. Further, the sets of cycle covers corresponding to all such Z's have weight 12^m, and any other Z's have weight 0. The reasons for this depend on the construction of the clause components, and are outlined below. The clause component To understand the relevant properties of the clause components C_j, one needs the notion of an M-completion. A cycle cover Z induces a satisfying assignment just in case its external edges satisfy certain properties. For any cycle cover of G_\\\\phi, consider only its external edges, the subset M. Let M be a set of external edges. A set of internal edges L is an M-completion just in case M\\\\cup L is a cycle cover of G_\\\\phi. Further, denote the set of all M-completions by L^M and the set of all resulting cycle covers of G_\\\\phi by Z^M. Recall that construction of G_\\\\phi was such that each external edge had weight 1, so the weight of Z^M, the cycle covers resulting from any M, depends only on the internal edges involved. We add here the premise that the construction of the clause components is such that the sum over possible M-completions of the weight of the internal edges in each clause component, where M is proper relative to the clause component, is 12. Otherwise the weight of the internal edges is 0. Since there are m clause components, and the selection of sets of internal edges, L, within each clause component is independent of the selection of sets of internal edges in other clause components, so one can multiply everything to get the weight of Z^M. So, the weight of each Z^M, where M induces a satisfying assignment, is 12^m. Further, where M does not induce a satisfying assignment, M is not proper with respect to some C_j, so the product of the weights of internal edges in Z^M will be 0. The clause component is a weighted, directed graph with 7 nodes with edges weighted and nodes arranged to yield the properties specified above, and is given in Appendix A of Ben-Dor and Halevi (1993). Note that the internal edges here have weights drawn from the set \\\\\\\\{-1,0,1,2,3\\\\\\\\}; not all edges have 0‚Äì1 weights. Finally, since the sum of weights of all the sets of cycle covers inducing any particular satisfying assignment is 12m, and the sum of weights of all other sets of cycle covers is 0, one has Perm(GœÜ) = 12m¬∑(#œÜ). The following section reduces computing Perm(G_\\\\phi) to the permanent of a 01 matrix. =01-Matrix= The above section has shown that Permanent is #P-hard. Through a series of reductions, any permanent can be reduced to the permanent of a matrix with entries only 0 or 1. This will prove that 01-Permanent is #P-hard as well. Reduction to a non-negative matrix Using modular arithmetic, convert an integer matrix A into an equivalent non-negative matrix A' so that the permanent of A can be computed easily from the permanent of A', as follows: Let A be an n \\\\times n integer matrix where no entry has a magnitude larger than \\\\mu. * Compute Q = 2 n! \\\\cdot \\\\mu^n + 1. The choice of Q is due to the fact that \\\\operatorname{Perm}(A) \\\\le n! \\\\cdot \\\\mu^n * Compute A' = A\\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\,Q * Compute P = \\\\operatorname{Perm}(A') \\\\bmod Q * If P < Q/2 then Perm(A) = P. Otherwise \\\\operatorname{Perm}(A) = P - Q The transformation of A into A' is polynomial in n and \\\\log (\\\\mu), since the number of bits required to represent Q is polynomial in n and \\\\log (\\\\mu) An example of the transformation and why it works is given below. :A = \\\\begin{bmatrix}2 & -2  -2 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix} :\\\\operatorname{Perm}(A) = 2 \\\\cdot 1 + (-2) \\\\cdot (-2) = 6. Here, n = 2, \\\\mu = 2, and \\\\mu^n = 4, so Q = 17. Thus :A' = A \\\\bmod 17 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 15  15 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}. Note how the elements are non-negative because of the modular arithmetic. It is simple to compute the permanent :\\\\operatorname{Perm}(A') = 2 \\\\cdot 1 + 15 \\\\cdot 15 = 227 so P = 227 \\\\bmod 17 = 6. Then P < Q/2, so \\\\operatorname{Perm}(A) = P = 6. Reduction to powers of 2 Figure 1: Construction of 2Power from NonNeg Note that any number can be decomposed into a sum of powers of 2. For example, :13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 This fact is used to convert a non-negative matrix into an equivalent matrix whose entries are all powers of 2. The reduction can be expressed in terms of graphs equivalent to the matrices. Let G be a n-node weighted directed graph with non-negative weights, where largest weight is W. Every edge e with weight w is converted into an equivalent edge with weights in powers of 2 as follows: :w = 2^{x_1} + 2^{x_2} + \\\\cdots + 2^{x_r}, 0 \\\\le x_1 \\\\le x_2 \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le x_r \\\\le \\\\log (w) This can be seen graphically in the Figure 1. The subgraph that replaces the existing edge contains r nodes and 3r edges. To prove that this produces an equivalent graph G' that has the same permanent as the original, one must show the correspondence between the cycle covers of G and G'. Consider some cycle-cover R in G. * If an edge e is not in R, then to cover all the nodes in the new sub graph, one must use the self-loops. Since all self-loops have a weight of 1, the weight of cycle-covers in R and R' match. * If e is in R, then in all the corresponding cycle-covers in G', there must be a path from u to v, where u and v are the nodes of edge e. From the construction, one can see that there are r different paths and sum of all these paths equal to the weight of the edge in the original graph G. So the weight of corresponding cycle-covers in G and G' match. Note that the size of G' is polynomial in n and \\\\log W. Reduction to 0‚Äì1 Figure 2: Construction of a 01-matrix from 2Power The objective here is to reduce a matrix whose entries are powers of 2 into an equivalent matrix containing only zeros and ones (i.e. a directed graph where each edge has a weight of 1). Let G be a n-node directed graph where all the weights on edges are powers of two. Construct a graph, G', where the weight of each edge is 1 and Perm(G) = Perm(G'). The size of this new graph, G', is polynomial in n and p where the maximal weight of any edge in graph G is 2^p. This reduction is done locally at each edge in G that has a weight larger than 1. Let e = (u, v) be an edge in G with a weight w = 2^r > 1. It is replaced by a subgraph J_e that is made up of 2r nodes and 6r edges as seen in Figure 2. Each edge in J_e has a weight of 1. Thus, the resulting graph G' contains only edges with a weight of 1. Consider some cycle-cover R in G. * If an original edge e from graph G is not in R, one cannot create a path through the new subgraph J_e. The only way to form a cycle cover over J_e in such a case is for each node in the subgraph to take its self-loop. As each edge has a weight of one, the weight of the resulting cycle cover is equal to that of the original cycle cover. * However, if the edge in G is a part of the cycle cover then in any cycle cover of G' there must be a path from u to v in the subgraph. At each step down the subgraph there are two choices one can make to form such a path. One must make this choice r times, resulting in 2^r possible paths from u to v. Thus, there are 2^r possible cycle covers and since each path has a weight of 1, the sum of the weights of all these cycle covers equals the weight of the original cycle cover.

See also * Bellary * Districts of Karnataka ReferencesExternal links * http://Bellary.nic.in/ Siddammanahalli or Siddammana Halli derives its name from a person called Siddamma who was supposed to have lived here and halli is for village. Education: There are three primary Schools of which one is the Government run primary school in Kannada medium and there are two privately run English and Kannada Medium Primary School. Most of the village students go to neighbouring Bellary for further studies. The nearest high school is in Kuditini. Some of the children of this village become engineers, doctors, and other professionals and have migrated to various parts of India and abroad. Transport: It is connected to Kuditini, Kurugodu, and Bellary by KSRTC buses. There are plenty of privately run jeeps and autos connecting the village to neighbouring Kuditini and Kurugodu. Though buses reach Bellary via Kuditini, most of the people with their own vehicles use the country route via a village called Yerangli and Kollagal to reach Bellary. Occupation: Agriculture is the predominant occupation. Many landlords lease their lands for agriculture on various non-written contracts. In last 2 decades, there has been a considerable influx of people from coastal Andhra Pradesh seeking the opportunity to take lands on lease for cultivation resulting in the formation of various hamlets or locally called, camps around Siddammanahalli. the important one among them is the Maruthi camp which is from the village. The Bulibayappa temple is situated in this camp which is the most important temple for the people of Siddammanahalli. This village has the highest irrigated land in Bellary District. Health: There is Primary Health Centre with a Doctor available during weekdays and many surrounding village people come here for treatment. There are a couple of RMP Doctors who run private clinics. There were a couple of HIV related deaths and many people are aware as a result of the modes of transmission. Still the access to health care, sanitation, and basic amenities are poor. However, there is a good supply of drinking water due to development of a water lake. There is a power cut for 12 hours per day as compared 1‚Äì2 hours in urban areas. Religion and Caste: Majority of the population is Hindu. Predominant Caste is Reddys, Boya, and Madigas. There are few Lingayath and Kuruba families and one Muslim family (maybe more). There were a couple of caste related clashes in the last 2 decades, however, in last few years the incidences are becoming less frequent and people are living peacefully, particularly last 7‚Äì10 years have been very peaceful. Every year on the third Saturday of Shravan masa according to the Hindu calendar special prayers are held in the Bulibayyappa temple in Maruthi camp. It is a very auspicious day for the citizens of the village. There is a strong belief among the village members that on this night that Lord Hanuman visits this temple to offer his blessings and wishes to the devotees. The village priest does a special prayer which starts with a bath in the village salt water well and he proceeds to the Maruthi camp on foot to offer prayers in the Bulibayappa temple. A fire torch is carried along and there is a myth that once they had run out of oil en route to the temple and the priest advised filling it water and the fire torch was lit and the procession continued. On this day all the family members who have migrated to different places reunite with their respective families to celebrate this important festival of the village. The next day there is pulling of the Village Car called theru in Kannadaa and Telegu. Ugadhi, Gouri Pournima, Diwali, Ganesh, and Chthurthi are some of the festivals people celebrate here. Language: Telegu and Kannada are two of the important languages spoken. Politics: Traditionally the loyalties of people were divided between the Congress and Janata Party and later Janata Dals(S). In the recent years due to the emergence of BJP and the influence of Reddy Brothers in Bellary, the people have shifted their loyalties to BJP. However, with the decline of the Reddy brothers, the people are likely to align with N Suryanarayana Reddy of JDS party. Sports: Cricket is the popular game followed/played.

It is located approximately 100 kilometres west of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales. Description and history Bruce's Walk originally began as a maintenance track in 1931. The Railway Department had agreed to supply electricity to the Blue Mountains Shire Council from the power station at Lithgow and a transmission line was put through from Blackheath to Lawson, with a track to provide maintenance access. The line went south from Blackheath, passed a little west of the Grand Canyon, through the bush east of Medlow Bath, across the ridges north of Katoomba, Leura and Wentworth Falls, across the gullies on the fringes of Bullaburra and into Lawson. The authorities then decided to promote the maintenance track as a walking trail, which was duly opened on 21 November 1931. The surveyor who planned the track was A.Bruce, as a result of which the track eventually became known as Bruce's Walk. A pamphlet was published to publicise the walk, which passed through a variety of scenery, including glens and ridges. However, from World War II onwards, the track was forgotten and neglected. Parts of the track were also blocked off when the council constructed Lake Greaves in 1942 as a local water supply. Much later, however, a local walker named Dick Rushton found a copy of the pamphlet published in 1931 and set out to clear and mark the track. In 1980 he led a party of walkers along the section of track between Bullaburra and Wentworth Falls, and in 1983 he created a written guide to the track. By 1986, Bruce's Walk had come to the attention of two other walkers, Jim Smith and Wilf Hilder, who organised a group of volunteers to clear the track between Bullaburra and Wentworth Falls. In the process, they found many artefacts and features, including signs, shelter caves, seats and picnic tables. This part of the track was officially opened on 24 May 1986, by Alderman David Lawton. The opening was attended by 118 people, including Dick Rushton, who was by then eighty years old.How To See The Blue Mountains, Jim Smith (Second Back Row Press), 1986, pp.64-66 (This opening was condemned by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Mayor of the Blue Mountains City Council.)

IM nails have long been used to treat fractures of long bones of the body. Gerhard K√ºntscher is credited with the first use of this device in 1939, during World War II, for soldiers with fractures of the femur. Prior to that, treatment of such fractures was limited to traction or plaster, both of which required long periods of inactivity. IM nails resulted in earlier return to activity for the soldiers, sometimes even within a span of a few weeks, since they share the load with the bone, rather than entirely supporting the bone.  Design  The earliest IM nails were triangular or 'V' shaped in cross-section. Later they were modified to their present and more rotationally stable clover-leaf shape. Several modifications and shapes were introduced subsequently for various bones such as V-nails for tibia, radius and ulna nails, Rusch nails etc. Although stainless steel was used for older IM nails, titanium has several advantages, including lower mechanical failure rates and improved biocompatibility. A more significant problem with earlier designs was their failure to prevent collapse or rotation in inherently unstable fractures. This was addressed by the introduction of the concept of 'locking' the nails, where bolts on each end of the nail fix it to the bony cortex, preventing rotation among the fragments. This led to the emergence of locked IM nailing, which is the standard today. The extension mechanism of intramedullary can be of two types: ratcheting, such as in the Bliskunov, Albizzia, and the Internal Skeletal Kinetic Distractor (ISKD, removed from market in 2015) nails; and rotating spindle, as in the Fitbone, Phenix, PRECICE, and PRECICE 2 nails.  Complications  At a median 14 years after tibial nailing of isolated tibial fractures, patients' function is comparable to population norms, but objective and subjective evaluation shows persistent sequelae which are not insignificant. One potential complication of intramedullary nailing after a fracture is bone malrotation, where the broken bone is fixated out of alignment and heals incorrectly, causing a rotated limb.

Early life and monastic profession Born Benjamin Fearnley Carlyle, he was educated at Blundell's School. In 1892, he commenced medical training at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He did not complete his medical training. Instead, influenced by the Oxford Movement of the period, he embraced a vision of monastic life as he envisioned it having been followed in the Middle Ages, full of ritual and tradition. A charismatic individual, Carlyle succeeded where others had failed in having the vision of such a life within the Church of England approved by the Archbishop of Canterbury. By 1895 he had established a community of monks under his leadership, taking monastic vows under the monastic name of Aelred, assuming the role of abbot. Establishment of Caldey and conversion to Catholicism After several moves, Carlyle's community was established on Caldey Island, South Wales in 1906. When the Caldey Island community came into conflict with the Bishop of Oxford in 1913 over conformity to Anglican practices, Carlyle and most of his monks became Catholic. They were only the second such group to be received in a corporate manner into the Catholic Church, the example having been set by the Society of the Atonement (Franciscan) in the U.S. several years earlier. The Community were received into the Catholic Church on 21 February 1913, and on 1 March that year Abbot Columba Marmion of Maredsous visited the island to assist the community in its preparations for its entrance into full communion. In May 1913 Abbot Marmion took Carlyle (in Roman terms at this point a simple layman) to Rome for an audience with Pope Pius X, and on 29 June Marmion presided at the Solemn Mass at Caldey during which the community received the habit and the canonical establishment of the monastery became finalised. Following the establishment of Caldey as a Benedictine monastery proper, Carlyle spent a probationary year at Maredsous before taking his solemn monastic vows in June 1914 and being ordained priest several weeks later on 5 July.http://www.marmion.be/marme1250.html Website accessed 22 April 2015 Although himself new to the Benedictine order, he then returned to Caldey as its abbot. Due to financial pressures, the community moved to Prinknash Park, Gloucestershire in 1928. It established daughter communities at Saint Michael's Abbey, Farnborough in 1947, and Pluscarden Abbey the following year. While still a member of the Church of England, Carlyle served as canonical visitor to two Benedictine communities of nuns. The first, the Community of SS. Mary and Scholastica, founded in 1868 in Middlesex, also became Catholic in 1913, and now resides at Curzon Park, Chester.Curzon Park website The second, originally named the Community of the Holy Comforter, had been an active Anglican sisterhood founded in 1891, but adopted the enclosed Benedictine life under Carlyle's inspiration in 1906. This community remained Anglican and has resided at Malling Abbey since 1916, replacing the other community which had moved to North Wales after their reception into the Catholic Church. Carlyle and Ignatius Lyne Carlyle's role in the re- establishment of monasticism in the Anglican Communion differs from that of Joseph Leycester Lyne in that the Caldey order, whilst incorporating many features of Roman Catholic Benedictine practice, did actually seek to remain at first a specifically Anglican foundation under defined Anglican obedience. When in 1913 the position of Carlyle and many of his community became untenable, it was to Rome that the Order submitted. Lyne, meanwhile, never seems to have had much grip on Benedictine spirituality per se, preferring a more eclectic approach which for all its Catholic trappings was much more characterised by its creator's essential Evangelicalism and even Calvinism. Although Lyne styled himself \\"Father Ignatius of Jesus OSB\\", leading some to place him before Carlyle as the father of Anglican Benedictinism (Lyne himself saw his role as being senior to that of Carlyle in this respect), his claim on Anglican obedience is much diluted by the fact that for many years he held no licence to officiate and proved unwilling to submit to conditions which might have permitted an Anglican bishop either to restore licensed status to him or to ordain him beyond the diaconate he had received in 1860. Lyne's eventual ordination to the priesthood at the hands of the controversial Old Catholic prelate Rene Vilatte in 1898 ended any claims Lyne might have had on Anglican status altogether, a fact underlined by the erasure of his name from Crockford's Clerical Directory (a publication in which as a \\"priest in colonial Orders\\", Carlyle never appeared either, despite being in better standing), and therefore any notion of the two abbots, Lyne and Carlyle, being part of one Anglican Order of St Benedict has no concrete basis in fact. The only linking between the two Orders came following Lyne's death in 1908, when the \\"new Abbey of Llanthony\\" which Lyne had built passed into the hands of the Caldey Benedictines, at a time when its Prior, Dom Asaph Harris (who died in 1959) had also submitted to Vilatte and only two elderly nuns (whose names and religious affiliation have been lost to time) remained in a corrugated iron enclosure. Carlyle found he had no use for maintaining the \\"older foundation\\" and apart from sending monks there on occasional retreat did not use it at all, despite his ownership of it under the terms of Lyne's will.Anson, P.F, 1940, The Benedictines of Caldey, published by Prinknash Abbey.Anson, P.F, 1973. Building Up the Waste Places ‚Äì The revival of monastic life in the Church of England, London, Faith Press. Relationship with Peter Anson Carlyle enjoyed a close relationship with Peter Anson (1889‚Äì1976), who was among the monks of Caldey who seceded to Rome in 1913 and who, having left the cloister for a career as a writer and artist on religious and maritime matters, became Carlyle's biographer. Anson, whose particular brand of Catholicism included beliefs in continual revelation and in the paranormal, later claimed that he had received a psychic communication from Carlyle at the moment of the former abbot's death in 1955. Some have speculated that the relationship between Carlyle and Anson may have been in some sense homoerotic, based upon Anson's assertion that under Carlyle's rule \\"particular spiritual friendships\\" were not discouraged, but the most vocal promoter of the idea that Carlyle may have been actively gay seems overly keen upon accentuating his role as a self-styled abbot of an Anglican foundation after the manner of Ignatius Lyne at the expense of his eventual emergence as the Roman Catholic Abbot of Caldey in good standing. This of course proves nothing, but it does lead to questions regarding objectivity. Against this has to be set the actuality that the primary source for information regarding the Caldey Benedictines is Peter Anson, who is credited as being the leading authority on the subject despite his closeness to Carlyle himself, who appears to have regarded Anson as a close friend despite Anson's somewhat unpredictable nature and his inability to settle to the monastic life.Anson, P.F. 1946. A Roving Recluse, Cork, Mercier Press In the final analysis, the question of whether Carlyle could be considered either a religious mountebank or \\"gay icon\\" cannot be resolved, though the former evaluation seems unfair and even inaccurate.http://anglicanhistory.org/academic/hilliard_unenglish.pdf Article accessed 22 April 2015 Furthermore, as the ecclesiastical historian Rene Kollar OSB indicates: \\"Unlike others who sought and failed to bring Roman Catholic practices into the Established Church and failed, Carlyle enjoyed the explicit ecclesiastical sanction of the Archbishop of Canterbury for his work, and with this seal of approval he could dismiss critics and disbelievers...\\".Rene M. Kollar, The Harvard Theological Review Vol. 76, No. 2 (Apr. 1983), pp. 205‚Äì224 It should also be recognised that whilst Anson's biography of Carlyle indicates that expressions of filial affection between monks \\"sometimes took a form which would not be found in any normal monastery to-day (the) embraces, ceremonial and non-ceremonial, were regarded as symbolical of fraternal charity\\". His indication that \\"Our variant of the Roman rite permitted a real hug and kisses on the cheek between the giver and the recipient of the Pax Domini at the conventual Mass\\" appears an honest statement of how things were, and cannot of itself be seen as indicating any departure from celibacy either on the part of Carlyle or of any other monk who was under vows at Caldey during the Anglican years (the reference here to the \\"Pax Domini\\" reflecting the use of the Tridentine Mass even before the Caldey Benedictine Order made its collective submission to Rome).Anson, P.F. 1958, Abbot Extraordinary, A memoir of Aelred Carlyle, Monk and Missionary, London, Faith Press From monk to missionary and final years After some years as Abbot of Caldey, Carlyle was exclaustrated in 1921 and released from his Benedictine vows in 1935. He worked for many years as a missionary priest in Canada ending as a secular priest in Vancouver. Upon his retirement in 1951, he returned to England and became a conventual (i.e., residential) oblate at Prinknash Abbey. In 1953, he was allowed to renew his solemn monastic vows. When he died in 1955, he was a full member of the community he had founded sixty years earlier. He was permitted the dignity of abbot at his funeral, and an abbatial mitre and crozier were placed on his coffin.Anson, P.F. 1958, Abbot Extraordinary, A Memoir of Aelred Carlyle, Monk and Missionary, London, Faith Press Caldey has been in the hands of the Cistercian Order since 1929.

It is famous for its classic statement of what negligence is and the standard of care to be met. Facts The defendants, Birmingham Waterworks Company, were the water works for Birmingham. They had been incorporated by statute for the purpose of supplying Birmingham with water. The statute provided that: > the company should, upon the laying down of any main-pipe or other pipe in > any street, fix, at the time of laying down such pipe, a proper and > sufficient fire-plug in each such street, and should deliver the key or keys > of such fire-plug to the persons having the care of the engine-house in or > near to the said street, and cause another key to be hung up in the watch- > house in or near to the said street. By sect. 87, pipes were to be eighteen > inches beneath the surface of the soil. By the 89th section, the mains were > at all times to be kept charged with water. The defendants derived no profit > from the maintenance of the plugs distinct from the general profits of the > whole business, but such maintenance was one of the conditions under which > they were permitted to exercise the privileges given by the Act. The main- > pipe opposite the house of the plaintiff was more than eighteen inches below > the surface. The fire-plug was constructed according to the best known > system, and the materials of it were at the time of the accident sound and > in good order. The defendant had installed a fireplug into the hydrant near Mr Blyth's house. That winter, during a severe frost, the plug failed causing a flood and damage to Mr Blyth's house. Blyth sued the Waterworks for negligence. Judgment In establishing the basis of the case, Baron Alderson, made what has become a famous definition of negligence: The court found that the severe frost could not have been in the contemplation of the Water Works. They could only have been negligent if they had failed to do what a reasonable person would do in the circumstances. Birmingham had not seen such cold in such a long time, and it would be unreasonable for the Water Works to anticipate such a rare occurrence. B. Martin offered a concurring opinion, stating that \\"hold otherwise would be to make the company responsible as insurers.\\" B. Bramwell delivered a dissenting judgment on the law, but reached the same result on the facts.

Founded in 1902 and incorporated in 1909, it is one of the oldest such organizations in the world. It is named in honor of John James Audubon, an ornithologist and naturalist who painted, cataloged, and described birds of North America in Birds of America published in sections between 1827 and 1838. The society owns of woodland adjacent to Forest Park, managed as a nature sanctuary and features indigenous vegetation and fauna, including a small stand of old growth timber. The sanctuary is open to the public for free. Much of the sanctuary surrounds Balch Creek near its headwaters and contains more than of hiking trails which connect to Forest Park's extensive trail system. Within the sanctuary is a nature center containing classrooms, retail store, wildlife taxidermy exhibits, auditorium, and a wildlife care center. The care center treats injured and orphaned native wildlife utilizing professional staff and more than one hundred volunteers. More than 3,500 animals are brought to the center each year. A peregrine falcon named Finnegan is among the educational birds at the sanctuary. Displays of live educational birds are adjacent to the care center. Five birds are on display, having injuries or imprinting that prevent them from successful reintroduction to the wild. Currently there is a Great Horned Owl, male and female American Kestrels, and a Turkey Vulture. There is also a Western Painted Turtle that was rescued from a pet store and now lives in a tank inside the Care Center. In 2007, there were 21,615 hours volunteered to the society's efforts, including visitor reception, trail maintenance, tour guides, nature store attendant, clerical, conservation activists, and wildlife caretakers. It is one of the most highly rated charities of its kind, based on operational and organizational efficiency. The society is frequently consulted for expertise related to practical wildlife questions and wildlife management practices.  History  Portland birders created the John Burroughs Club in 1898. In 1901, birders in Astoria‚ÄîOregon's second largest city at the time‚Äîformed the Oregon Audubon Society. In 1902 the Portland group merged with them as Oregon Audubon Society. The named changed to Audubon Society of Portland in 1966 when members agreed to affiliate with the National Audubon Society. The society has long conducted letter writing campaigns to influence legislation. They helped pass the Model Bird Law in 1903, protecting native birds from being shot and sold. A 1925 letter writing campaign to President Calvin Coolidge successfully led to creation of Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge. The society takes credit for helping to establish several national refuges, including William L. Finley NWR, Three Arch Rocks NWR, Klamath NWR, Ankeny NWR, Baskett Slough NWR, and Malheur NWR.

Key personnel were also to be seized, and targets of opportunity exploited when encountered. The effort was a business and technology-oriented parallel of sorts to the Monuments Men pursuit of art and financial treasure. The program was designed to loot the defeated Germany's intellectual assets and impede its ability to compete in the postwar political and economic spheres while giving a boost to the nations conducting it.The Guardian: How T-Force abducted Germany's best brains for Britain Though unacknowledged at the time, the T-Force mission also included preventing advanced Nazi technology from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union‚Äîdestroying whatever could not be seized and hauled away before Soviet troops arrived.

T-Force units were attached to the three army groups on the Western Front; the Sixth United States Army Group, 21st Army Group and 12th US Army Group. The targets of the T-Force were selected and recommended by the Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee (CIOS). T-Force units were lightly armed and highly mobile. British troops included two companies of the 1st Buckinghamshire Battalion, a territorial army battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, along with the 5th Battalion King's Regiment (Liverpool). American units included both infantry and combat engineers, including the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion. World War II T-Force units accompanied combat units when capturing industrial plants, or arrived soon afterward to take control of them. They had to prevent any looting or sabotaging in the plants, and were responsible for ensuring that key personnel did not escape and no documents were removed. Once the T-Force took control of a plant, CIOS would be informed of it, and investigators were sent there immediately.Profiting the crown: Canada's Polymer Corporation, 1942-1990 In practice, their methods were characteristically heavy-handed: \\"Their methods had echoes of the Gestapo: kidnapping at night by state officials who offered no evidence of identity.\\"Cobain, Ian, The Guardian: How T-Force abducted Germany's best brains for Britain \\"Usually an NCO arrives without notice at the house or office of the German and warns that he will be required. He does not give him any details of the reasons, nor does he present his credentials. Some time later the German is seized (often in the middle of the night) and removed under guard. This procedure savours very much of the Gestapo methods and, quite apart from causing great and unnecessary inconvenience to the individual and to the industry employing him, it is bound to create feelings of alarm and insecurity.\\" What couldn't be carried off was destroyed. An unknown number of victims were taken in the waning weeks of the war; somewhere between 500 and 1,500 more were abducted in the postwar period by Britain alone. Replica of the German experimental nuclear reactor captured and dismantled by Alsos Mission T-Force personnel at Haigerloch during Operation Big Among the key activities of T-Force units was the Alsos Mission set up to seize key elements of the German nuclear energy project in southwestern Germany in the waning stages of World War II. A working experimental nuclear reactor, uranium ingots, heavy water, and several dozen top atomic scientists and their staffs were seized, including Werner Heisenberg. On 5 May 1945, to deny the Soviet Union a warm-water port, a T-Force unit went into territory designated for conquest by the Red Army and seized Kiel. By that time, in accordance with the terms of a surrender of German forces at L√ºneburg Heath, Allied troops had been ordered not to move north past Bad Segeberg; but the T-Force group, led by Major Tony Hibbert, was given permission to advance to Kiel and seize the targets there. Not knowing that this permission had been given in error, the T-Force moved into the city unopposed and took control of their assigned targets. A strong German force present in the city was reluctant to surrender when asked by the T-Force, until Admiral Karl D√∂nitz instructed them to do so.A diary of ‚ÄòT‚Äô Force operations in KIEL ARCRE‚ÄîArchive research & document copying Aggressive actions such as Hibbert's on behalf of T-Force and the preemptive bombing of the Auergesellschaft atomic materials processing plant in Oranienburg can be seen as the beginning of the Cold War, which together with the scope and nature of how operations were carried out account for the continued scarcity of publicly available information on its role. Postwar In postwar Germany, T-Force was tasked with carrying out abductions of German scientists and businessmen. In addition, in a related program German businessmen are also alleged to have been forced to travel to post-war Britain to be questioned by their commercial rivals, being interned if they refused to reveal trade secrets. Such abductions not only helped cripple the German recovery and enabled Britain to use German technological knowledge in building up the British economy after the war,Cobain, Ian, The Guardian: \\"Herbert Morrison, lord president of the council, told the prime minister, Clement Attlee: 'It is most important at this formative stage to start shaping the German economy in the way which will best assist our own economic plans and will run the least risk of it developing into an unnecessarily awkward competitor.'\\" they also denied it to the Soviets. For example, Courtauld's received the latest information on manmade fibres, Dorman Long benefited from information and equipment originating from the Hermann Goering Steel Works and even the British coal industry had pit props sent to them from the Harz Mountains. On the military side much information was gathered, which could have been vital, had the war in the Far East not ended so soon. Apart from this, there were wider political and economic implications, including the significance of the early liberation of Kiel, which prevented the Russians from adding Schleswig- Holstein and the Jutland Peninsula to their area of influence, as indeed they temporarily did with the Danish island of Bornholm. The unit's role remained secret until very recently, coming to wider notice only with the publication of Sean Longden's book T Force, the Race for Nazi War Secrets, 1945 in September 2010. The post-war French war crimes trials concentrated on French native collaborators. The records of the Milit√§rbefehlshaber Frankreich (MBF) were necessary for the prosecution. However, these captured records were the results of the British and American T-Force document hunters. The French had not prepared for this task, and so had to work with the British and American forces for the trials. \\"Yet whereas the British and Americans entered the Reich well prepared for the document hunt- Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) had assigned special Target Forces, the French could not keep pace. Thus, the most prominent military and political records, including parts of the MBF, found their way to document centers under Anglo- American jurisdiction\\".\\"Fight for the Files: Captured German Records after World War II\\". 2002.

Many of the operations of the T-Force units were turned over to the Field Information Agency; Technical (FIAT). In its charter, issued at the end of May 1945, FIAT was authorized to \\"coordinate, integrate, and direct the activities of the various missions and agencies\\" interested in scientific and technical intelligence but prohibited from collecting and exploiting such information on its own responsibility.US Archives and Records Service.

Albert-Louis, Baron de Pouilly et de Chaffour, Comte de Roussy (1731‚Äì1795) and his wife Marie Antoinette (1746‚Äì1800) emigrated together with their children during the French Revolution. Their sons, Albert (1775‚Äì1799) and Emmanuel (baptised at Nancy on 24 January 1777), took the name Mensdorff from a community in the county of Roussy, Luxembourg. The brothers entered military service against revolutionary and Napoleonic France, and Albert was killed in battle in 1799.

On 1 June 1940, his ammunition supply depleted, he was forced to destroy his guns.Trebah My Story, Page 18: Hibbert and Bradshaw Families‚ÄîMajor Hibberts Log As captured by Internet Archive Wayback Machine 20 Aug 2011 Evacuated from Dunkirk on the tugboat \\"Sun X\\", Hibbert was mentioned in dispatches that described his meritorious actions in the face of the enemy and were sent to the high command. 1st Parachute Brigade In October 1940, Hibbert joined the original No. 2 Commando, the initial unit of the paratrooper corps Winston Churchill had called for after the debacle in France.Formation of Airborne Forces, 1940-41 ParaData, Airborne Assault (Registered Charity)Text of Churchill's call for a parachute corps ParaData, Airborne Assault (Registered Charity) Having been redesignated No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion in November 1940,Formation and Early Airborne Forces ParaData, Airborne Assault (Registered Charity) the unit became the 1st Parachute Battalion the following September. As part of the newly formed 1st Parachute Brigade, it was soon part of the emergent 1st Airborne Division. Hibbert served in the North African Campaign, during which he became a staff officer, and in the Italian Campaign. In July 1944, after he'd attended the Staff College at Camberley, he became Brigade Major of the 1st Parachute Brigade. On 17 September 1944, the first day of the ill-fated Operation Market Garden, Brigade HQ, led by Hibbert, and the 2nd Parachute Battalion, led by Lieutenant-Colonel John Frost, reached the Arnhem road bridge,Personal account of Major Tony Hibbert's experiences of the Battle of Arnhem ParaData, Airborne Assault (Registered Charity) their intact objective in the operation. In the operation's plan, the bridge had had to be held for only two days; but the two units, along with other elements of the 1st Airborne Division, held its northern end, against fierce opposition, for three. While leading a remnant group in withdrawal from the bridge, toward nearby Oosterbeek, where the rest of the Division was still fighting, Hibbert was captured by the Germans. After escaping from a truck in which he and other prisoners were being transported to a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany, Hibbert was sheltered by the Dutch Resistance. Most British and Polish troops who hadn't been killed, captured, or wounded in the attempt to take Arnhem were successfully withdrawn from the area, in Operation Berlin. Hibbert and other officers of the 1st Brigade regrouped and planned Operation Pegasus, by which well over one hundred sheltered men, including them, got out of the area a month thereafter. Shortly after the men crossed the Rhine, under cover of darkness, and were met by the Allied force that had been sent to retrieve them, Hibbert's leg was broken, when a jeep on whose bonnet he was riding was in a collision. The five months' hospitalisation this cost him was, in his words, a \\"thoroughly unsatisfying climax\\" to a \\"thoroughly unsatisfactory battle.\\" Operation Eclipse Having been all but destroyed in Operation Market Garden, the 1st Airborne Division saw no action in the war's remainder, but Hibbert's own participation in the conflict continued. In April 1945, still on crutches, Hibbert was discharged from hospital. On the morning of 5 May, in part of Operation Eclipse, he led a T-Force from L√ºbeck to the German port city of Kiel.A diary of ‚ÄòT‚Äô Force operations in KIEL ARCRE‚ÄîArchive research & document copying The force consisted of some hundreds of men from the 5th King's Regiment of the British Army and the 30th Assault Unit of the Royal Navy.\\"Operation Eclipse\\"‚ÄîHistory Learning Site Although the German forces in northwest Germany had surrendered at L√ºneburg Heath the evening before, the officers of the German Navy in Kiel were convinced they had not surrendered. The German troops north of the Kiel Canal were reluctant to hand in their arms. Even so, Hibbert and his small force established their authority in a city with tens of thousands of German fighters. No other Allied force arrived until 7 May, when troops of the 15th Division moved into the city. Swedish intelligence reports that the Red Army would violate the Yalta agreement and advance from Germany to Denmark were what had prompted Operation Eclipse. Capture of Denmark would have given the Soviet Union a postwar port free of the ice that blocked its own port of Murmansk several months each year. By establishing Allied control of Kiel and of the German scientific bases between that city and the Danish border, Hibbert's force forestalled such a Russian move. On V-E Day, 8 May, Hibbert was placed under arrest by the British military. His advance to Kiel had required him to go north of Bad Segeberg, in apparent violation of the surrender terms that had been agreed at L√ºneburg Heath. The advance had been made on orders from the 21st Army Group, whose Chemical Warfare branch controlled T-Force operations,History of ‚ÄòT‚Äô Force Activities in 21 Army Group ARCRE‚ÄîArchive research & document copying but there was a question whether the 21st Army Group had had the authority to issue such an order. Hibbert was absolved of blame the next day by his Corps Commander and released, but the arrest meant that his \\"rather frustrating military career\\", as he himself later put it, had ended with \\"a certain artistic symmetry.\\" On 3 September 1939, the day the British declared war, he‚Äôd been arrested for crashing his Battery Commander's command car‚Äîand had been exonerated. He‚Äôd spent the first day and the last day of the war under arrest. Life after the military Invalided out of the Army in 1947, Hibbert returned to CG Hibbert, his family's wine and spirits business, which was on the verge of collapse. Finding \\"the cut and thrust of commercial life\\", as he put it, \\"as exciting as war with no prisoners taken,\\" he turned the firm around and rose to be its managing director. Among the diverse fields to which he extended it was soft-drink canning, in which he introduced the ring pull can to the United Kingdom. He received the Queen's Award for Industry. In 1960, on land he owned at Lymington, Hibbert formed Salterns Sailing Club, which is run for and by youngsters (\\"with some adult help\\").Salterns Sailing Club‚ÄîWelcomeSalterns Sailing Club‚ÄîWho Runs the Club As a sailor himself, he competed worldwide in the International Moth Class of dinghy, which he helped to invent. Hibbert tried twice to retire. His first retirement, in 1972, was to Devon, where he entered upon a gentleman farmer's life, which didn‚Äôt suit him. For his second retirement, in 1981, his wife and he sought a house with \\"no work, no worries and no responsibilities.\\" When they bought Trebah, in Cornwall, they dreamt of \\"the quiet pleasures of retirement, mornings spent drinking gin on the terrace and summer afternoons sailing and fishing from the beach.\\"Trebah My Story, Page 12: The Hibberts 1981 to 2002‚ÄîMajor Hibberts Log As captured by Internet Archive Wayback Machine 20 Aug 2011 Not until they‚Äôd received a visit from the Secretary of the Cornwall Garden Society, eight days after they‚Äôd moved in, did they learn they‚Äôd purchased what had once been one of England's most beautiful and important gardens.Trebah My Story, Page 13: The Hibberts 1981 to 2002‚ÄîMajor Hibberts Log As captured by Internet Archive Wayback Machine 20 Aug 2011 What began as a three-year commitment on their part, to restore the garden, became a decades-long, open-ended undertaking that gave them what Hibbert called the happiest years of their lives.\\"The Invisible Hand of Man\\" The Green File‚Äîwith Mark Cullen, CJAD 800 AM, Montreal In 2006, Hibbert was presented an MBE for his contribution to tourism and sailing.

New Zealand In New Zealand the Oath of Allegiance is available in English or Maori in two forms, one an oath containing the phrase 'so help me God' and the other an affirmation which does not. The Police Act 1958 and the Oaths Modernisation Bill still includes the phrase. United Kingdom The Oath of Allegiance set out in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868 ends with this phrase, and is required to be taken by various office-holders. United States The phrase \\"So help me God\\" is prescribed in oaths as early as the Judiciary Act of 1789, for U.S. officers other than the President. The act makes the semantic distinction between an affirmation and an oath.Judiciary Act of 1789, Sec. 7. Accessed 2013-07-04. The oath, religious in essence, includes the phrase \\"so help me God\\" and \\"[I] swear\\". The affirmation uses \\"[I] affirm\\".

Historians maintain that George Washington himself added the phrase to the end of his first oath, setting a precedent for future presidents and continuing what was already established practice in his day. All Presidents since have used this phrase, according to Marvin Pinkert, executive director of the National Archives Experience.Interview with NPR's Morning Edition, see . =Oath of citizenship= The United States Oath of Citizenship (officially referred to as the \\"Oath of Allegiance\\", 8 C.F.R.

Normally, it is not required to be said if the speaker has a personal or moral objection, as is true of all oaths administered by the United States government. However, a change in October 2013 to Air Force Instruction 36-2606 made it mandatory to include the phrase during Air Force enlistments/reenlistments. This change has made the instruction \\"consistent with the language mandated in 10 USC 502\\". The Air Force announced on September 17, 2014, that it revoked this previous policy change, allowing anyone to omit \\"so help me God\\" from the oath. =State laws= Some of the states have specified that the words \\"so help me God\\" were used in oath of office, and also required of jurors, witnesses in court, notaries public, and state employees. Where this is still the case, there is the possibility of a court challenge over eligibility, as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), that such state-law requirements violate citizens' rights under the federal Constitution. Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia retain the required \\"so help me God\\" as part of the oath to public office. Historically, Maryland and South Carolina did include it but both have been successfully challenged in court. Other states, such as New Hampshire, North Dakota and Rhode Island allow exceptions or alternative phrases. In Wisconsin, the specific language of the oath has been repealed.  Equivalent in other languages Croatian= In Croatia, the text of presidential oath, which is defined by the Presidential Elections Act amendments of 1997 (Article 4), ends with \\"Tako mi Bog pomogao\\" (So help me God).Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o izboru predsjednika Republike Hrvatske (NN 71/97.) In 2009, concerns about the phrase infringing on Constitution of Croatia were raised. Constitutional Court of Croatia ruled them out in 2017, claiming that it is compatible with constitution and secular state. The court said the phrase is in neither direct nor indirect relation to any religious beliefs of the elected president. It doesn't represent a theist or religious belief and does not stop the president in any way from expressing any other religious belief. Saying the phrase while taking the presidential oath does not force a certain belief on the President and does not infringe on their religious freedoms. =Filipino= In the Oath of Office of the President of the Philippines, the phrase \\"So help me God\\" (Filipino: Kasihan naw√¢ ako ng Diyos) is mandatory, though the phrase can be omitted voluntarily, in which case it would become an affirmation instead of an oath.Constitution of the Philippines (1987).

Both scripts were devised based on the Greek alphabet and share commonalities, but the exact nature of relationship between the Glagolitic and the Cyrillic alphabets, their order of development, and influence on each other has been a matter of great study, controversy, and dispute in Slavic studies. Glagolitic precedence The theory that Glagolitic script was created before Cyrillic was first put forth by G. Dobner in 1785, and since Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik's 1857 study of Glagolitic monuments, √úber den Ursprung und die Heimat des Glagolitismus, there has been a virtual consensus in the academic circles that St. Cyril developed the Glagolitic alphabet, rather than the Cyrillic. This view is supported by numerous linguistic, paleographic, and historical accounts. Points that support this view include: # The Greek-derived Cyrillic script spread quickly across the Slavia Orthodoxa lands because it replaced the Glagolitic alphabet, which was designed to fit the sound system of Slavic speech. By comparison, the West Slavic languages, as well as Slovene and Croatian, took a longer time to adapt the Roman alphabet to their local needs with special digraphs and diacritics for Slavic phonemes only becoming accepted with the advent of printing in the 16th Century. # There are significantly fewer Glagolitic monuments, suggesting that the new writing system was replaced by a newer system that was more vigorous and voluminous in output. # Old Church Slavonic canon monuments written in Glagolitic script are generally older than their Cyrillic counterparts. # The most archaic features of Old Church Slavonic canon monuments (e.g., the uncontracted and unassimilated endings of definite adjective forms -aego, -aago, -aemu, -aamu, -uemu, -uumu as opposed to contracted forms; second- and third-person dual imperfect endings -≈°eta, -≈°ete as opposed to the -sta, -ste in Cyrillic monuments; sigmatic aorist is not attested in Glagolitic monuments, which otherwise preserve more morphological archaisms) are generally much more common in Glagolitic than in Cyrillic canon. \\"Spomenici pisani glagoljicom u pravilu su primjetljivo arhaiƒçniji po jeziku nego oni koji su pisani ƒáirilicom. [Monuments written in Glagolitic are generally noticeably more archaic in language than those written in Cyrillic.]\\" The evidence of pre-Moravian-mission phonetics Glagolitic alphabet was devised for and which it indirectly reflects, characteristic of the phonological system of a South Slavic Macedonian dialect in a specific timeframe of the late 9th century ‚Äì the ƒëerv, ≈°t and dzelo, and which are present in Glagolitic monuments either exclusively or predominantly, further corroborates their antiquity over Cyrillic in which these sounds are absent or changed by means of sound changes assumed to have occurred in the later period. # Of surviving Old Church Slavonic palimpsests, the observed tendency is for Glagolitic or Cyrillic to be written over Glagolitic, Cyrillic over Cyrillic, but never Glagolitic over Cyrillic. All extant palimpsests are written in Cyrillic and modern photographic analysis has shown a previous layer of Glagolitic letters. # Some Cyrillic canon monuments contain occasional Glagolitic letters, words, or sentences, all written by the hand of the same scribe. Conversely, Cyrillic words or letters found in the Glagolitic monuments are seen as later additions. # Cyrillic glosses are present in Glagolitic manuscripts, but not the other way around. # Some scribal errors in Cyrillic monuments indicate that the Cyrillic manuscript was copied from a Glagolitic original. For example, in Sava's book is written instead of . The digraph is written in Glagolitic as , while is written as . The similarity of Glagolitic letters and has caused an obvious spelling mistake. # The numerical value of Glagolitic letters is an orderly progression in agreement with the sequence of letters in the alphabet allowing for the writing of numbers past at least 2,000. Cyrillic numerals, on the other hand, follow Greek numerical usage and does not assign numerical values to certain non-Greek Slavic letters (b, ≈æ, ≈°t, ≈°, y, ƒï, ', '). This makes necessary the use of a thousands sign similar to the Greek sampi for marking numbers larger than 999. This also means letters pronounced similarly have different numerical values in the Glagolitic and Cyrillic numeral systems. Discernable scribal errors indicate transposition from Glagolitic numeral system into Cyrillic, and not the other way around. # Glagolitic monuments contain many more untranslated Greek words, which implies they are preserving the original text of translations conducted by St. Cyril. Furthermore, Glagolitic monuments contain many errors in translated phrases, while Cyrillic monuments have significantly rectified these errors. # The style of the Glagolitic monuments is often unclear and sometimes almost completely unintelligible without the Greek original (e.g. a series of pages in the Glagolita Clozianus). This should indicate their creation toward the early period of Slavic literacy when there was no skill in translation. # The relation between the Glagolitic monuments in Moravia and those in the Balkans is best explained by presuming expansion of the Glagolitic tradition from Moravia, before the 10th Century when the Magyar‚ÄìGerman wedge separated Western and Southern Slavs. Chernorizets Hrabar's account Leaf 40 of a preserved manuscript containing Hrabar's account In his famous treatise On the Letters (), written as early as the end of the 9th or beginning of the 10th Century, the Bulgarian monk Chernorizets Hrabar stated: > :Being still pagans, the Slavs did not have their own letters, but read and > communicated by means of tallies and sketches. After their baptism they were > forced to use Roman and Greek letters in the transcription of their Slavic > words but these were not suitable ...Here the text includes 11 examples of > Slavic words, such as \\"\\" /≈æivƒõt≈≠/ \\"life\\", that cannot be written in Roman or > Greek letters without diacritical marks to change the sound values. At last, > God, in his love for mankind, sent them St. Constantine the Philosopher, > called Cyril, a learned and upright man, who composed for them 38 letters, > some [24 of them] similar to the Greek, but some [14 of them] different, > suitable to express Slavic sounds. According to , Hrabar's account points to an earlier usage of Greek and Roman alphabet for writing by the Slavs, which was a very difficult task. The initial letters of the words he cites illustrate that. The initial consonants in (≈æ), (dz), (ch), (ƒç), and (≈°) were completely absent in the contemporary Byzantine Greek phonology, as well as the initial nasal vowels illustrated by («´) and (ƒô). The same is true for the initial syllable in (ju or √º). In other cases, changes in pronunciation from Ancient Greek to Byzantine Greek made the letters no longer suitable for Slavic versions of the letters. For example, in the word , the Greek letters the letters and , by the time of Byzantine Greek, were pronounced as labial and velar fricatives instead of voiced bilabial and velar stops. Similarly, the Greek letter had acquired phonetic value of [i] in Byzantine Greek, making it no longer suitable to represent the initial yus in the word . Hrabar's phrase \\",\\" which translates as \\"tallies and sketches\\" or \\"strokes and incisions,\\" has long puzzled scholars. Possible meaning range from simple marks used as an aid in counting, to adaptations of Turkic (as in Proto-Bulgar epigraphy) and Germanic (such as of the Gothic alphabet created by Wulfila) runes. However, no authentic Slavic runic writing been discovered, despite linguistic traces of Bulgar and Gothic tribes interacting with Slavic tribes and the Proto-Slavic Urheimat. Furthermore the Glagolitic alphabet does not contain any runic elements. Hrabar's account further describes how St. Cyrill was sent by God to Slavs \\"to compose 38 letters, some according to the shape of Greek letters, some according to the Slavic word.\\" This particular statement has led some philologists to conclude Hrabar is speaking of the Cyrillic script. However, that theory is disputed by the analysis of St. M. Kuljbakin in Bele≈°ke o Hrabrovoj Apologiji (Glas SKA, Beograd, 1935). According to Kuljbakin, Hrabar's 38 letters corresponds to the number of letter in the Glagolitic alphabet, while the Early Cyrillic script had more than 40 graphemes. According to I. Go≈°ev, another statement by Hrabar points to the Glagolitic alphabet. When Hrabar writes that the first letter of the alphabet compiled by St. Cyrill, (), was \\"God's gift\\" to the Slavs and therefore was mark√®dly different from pagan Greek (alpha). In this interpretation, represents the sign of the cross and is a symbolic invocation of God's blessing. Bulgarian scholar is the most vocal supporter of the theory of the development of Cyrillic from a Slavic Greek-based writing alphabet; however, no examples of such a script have been preserved. Georgiev does not deny that St. Cyril developed the Glagolitic script, but he argues Cyrillic is the older script, deriving from cursive Greek. The \\"Russian letters\\" in Vita Constantini > \\"And he found there the Evangel and Psalter written with Russian letters, > and upon finding a man who spoke the language, talked with him; and > perceiving the power of the speech, he added various letters for his own > language, consonant vocal sounds; and praying to God, immediately began to > compose and reveal, and many marvelled at him, glorifying God.\\"Vita > Constantini, VIII, 15, lines 0‚Äì4. The phrase \\"\\" (often translated as \\"Russian letters\\") in Vita Constantini is another enigmatic statement that has puzzled Slavists for a long time. This chronicle of the life of St. Cyril and the first Slavic hagiography describes his early mission to the Khazars in sourthern Crimea. There, in Cherson, he discovered a gospel text and psalter written in \\"Russian letters.\\" Although Crimea circa 860 was probably a multiethnic community (especially its main port city, Cherson), it is considered unlikely that Slavs had yet settled there, as the Slavs of the Southern Dnieper region were at that time still separated from the northern shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov by the steppe, which was controlled by Khazars and later Pechenegs, who remained heathens until long after the conversion of the Rus' in 966. For this reason, scholars generally reject the connection of \\"\\" in Vita Constantini with Eastern Slavs, although some Russian nationalists do maintain that St. Cyril found an Old East Slavic text and encountered a man who spoke that language. argues it is highly unlikely St. Cyril would have been as concerned as Chapter XIV of Vita Constantini records about the need to develop a writing systems for the Slavs of Moravia had he earlier encountered a Slavic script in Crimea. According to the hypothesis originally propounded by French Slavist Andr√© Vaillant and further developed by Roman Jakobson, Dietrich Gerhardt, Karel Hor√°lek, Robert Auty, Horace G. Lunt, and others, ' was the result of a flopping of consonants by a later Slavic scribe with the original word being ' or Syriac and referring to the Aramaic language. Given the likely presence of Aramaic-speaking merchants and Syrian Christian refugees in Crimea, especially the port city of Cherson, at the time, this Syriac hypothesis remains the dominant belief. Vita Constantini, VIII, 1-18, containing the controversial excerpt. According to an alternate theory, \\"\\" may refer to Gothic with the author of Vita Constantini confusing one Old Germanic language (Gothic) with another (Early Old Swedish), the language of Varangians, who were referred to in contemporary Slavic and Byzantine Greek sources as \\"\\" or \\"\\" (Rus'). This theory was advocated by Czech-American Slavist Francis Dovrn√≠k and Polish Slavist Tadeusz Lehr-Sp≈Çawi≈Ñski. The chief argument is that Goths were Christianized as early as the 4th Century by the mission of the bishop Wulfila, and a Gothic presence remained in the Crimea as late as the 16th Century (cf. Crimean Gothic). The chief argument against this theory is that a medieval copyist would have been unlikely to confuse the language of the notoriously pagan Varangians for that of Christian-Arian Goths of the Balkans. Harvey Goldblatt suggested another radical reinterpretation in his essay On the 'rous'kymi pismeniy' in the 'Vita Constantini' and Rus'ian Religious Patriotism.Studia slavica mediaevalia et humanistica, Riccardo Picchio Dicata, M.Colucci et al., eds., Rome 1986, pp. 311‚Äì328 Goldblatt noted that the majority of preserved codices containing Vita Constantini are East Slavic (Goldblatt counted app. 40) and read \\"\\" but the numerically fewer South Slavic manuscripts read \\",\\" \\",\\" and \\"\\" (or corrupted forms that can be derived from it). Given that the earliest attestation for Viti Constantini is from the 15th Century, it cannot be assumed, according to Goldblatt, that they all reflect one uniform and complete text tradition, supposedly written in Moravia before 882. Glodblatt points to the oldest version of the Russian Church Slavonic text ' (The Story of Russian Writing), which was recorded immediately following a version of Vita Constantini.Goldblatt 1986:325 While not presuming a direct relationship between the texts, notes that the ties the Vita Constantini directly to the Russia-centered ideology of the 15th Century \\"Rus'ian lands,\\" after the defeat of the Slavs at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 and the fall of Tarnovo, the Bulgarian capital, in 1393. With the loss of Constantinople to Muslim Ottoman Turks in 1453, there was a desire to see the transfer of religious and cultural power from the Greek Orthodox-influenced Byzantine and the Slavic Balkans to Muscovy. The notion of Cyril discovering \\"Russian letters\\" in Cherson or that he would have studied with a \\"Russian\\" in the Crimea would therefore be welcomed in 15th Century Muscovy, reinforcing the image of Moscow as the center of the true Orthodox faith. An alternate theory by the Greek Slavist emphasizes the lack of textual support for the Syriac hypothesis; no existing version of the Vita Constantini actually includes the allegedly correct reading of . To accept the Syriac theory, Tachiaos argues, one must assume that the sour- to rous- (sur- to rus-) metathesis must have occurred very early to have been repeated in all extant manuscripts. Instead, Tachiaos claims that the Old Church Slavonic verbs and were used with the specialized meaning of \\"to receive\\" and \\"to interpret, teach, preach,\\" and the text refers to Slavic translations prepared ahead of St. Cyril's mission to Crimea. Thus the described Cherson episode means St. Cyril \\"received\\" a Slavonic gospel text and a psalter and a met a man who understood the language and soon began to read the gospel and preach it. A final theory proposed by notes that Rus' strongholds likely existed in Crimea during the 9th Century, arguing that some settlements likely existed in the older period of merger of Rus' and Alanic tribes. A troop of Rus' reportedly settled in Crimea as early as the late 8th Century, following the siege of Suro≈æ) around 790. The Life of St. Stefan of Suro≈æ (≈Ωitie Stefana ispovednika, ep. Suro≈æskago) reports the subsequent conversion some Rus' knyaz who led the siege to Christianity. Religious rites in the region were conducted in Byzantine Greek and Gothic, depending on the locality, but it is possible Rus' settlers also founded their own churches using their language for liturgical ceremonies. Therefore, St Cyril may have encountered a remnant text from these rites. As far as the alphabet is concerned, Vernadsky argues that could be a borrowing from an Indo-Iranian language ‚Äî Old Indic roc√° (shining, radiant), r√∫ci (light, lustre), Avestan raoƒçah- (light, esp. heavenly), or Old Indic ruk·π£a- or Avestan raox≈°na (radiant) ‚Äî indicating an \\"enlightened\\" or \\"inspired\\" alphabet. None of these proposed theories is flawless or free of heavy criticism, and none enjoys widespread acceptance among Slavists. Thus, as concludes, \\"This therefore is one of the remaining controversial issues of the Cyrillo‚ÄìMethodian research today as much as ever\\".

Imports into Estonia doubled in 2006. The total value of trade between the countries in 2007 was ‚Ç¨30.8 million. While Indian investment in Estonia is small-scale and is in the commercial and food sector, Estonia has no direct investment in India. However, Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet has expressed desire to improve economic ties and appoint a non-resident ambassador and open its own embassy besides two existing honorary embassies. India has signed the Joint Business Council Agreement with the Estonian Chamber of Commerce.  Cultural  The first person from Estonia to visit India at the end of the 17th century was the cleric Eberhard Eckhold (Eckholz) who was born in Tallinn and had studied in the Academia Gustaviana of Tartu. Nothing particular is known about his visit. Adam Johann von Krusenstern's expedition visited India on his way to China in 1797‚Äì1798 during the first Russian circumnavigation. He stayed for short whiles in Madras and Calcutta, acquainted with the commercial and administrative activity of the East India Company and made a two-month journey on board HMS Orpheus in the Bay of Bengal. The fact that Krusenstern's library contained around forty items on the history and geography of India and on the Sanskrit literature shows his great interest towards the country. The first Estonian textbooks to mention India were written by Georg Gottfried Marpurg (1805) and Karl Ernst Berg (1811). The first Estonian publication to arrive in India was P√ºhhap√§iwa Wahhe-luggemissed (Sunday Intermediary Readings) of Otto Wilhelm Masing (1818). The book contained a hundred-page description of the nature and society of India. Sanskrit language publications were printed at the University of Tartu and from 1837, Sanskrit teaching classes commenced, taught by professor Karl Friedrich Keil. One of his successors Leopold Alexander von Schroeder became an outstanding indologist, known for his translations and original studies on the early Indian literature. Several papers on the missionary work in India, especially among the Tamils were published in the middle of the 19th century. \\"Maailma maade √µpetus\\" (Lesson on Countries of the World) by Berend Gildenmann gave a short systematic overview of the geography of India, improved by the editions of 1854 and 1868. Johann Voldemar Jannsen's articles on India which were widely popular contributed further to the Estonians' knowledge on the country as he published up-to-date information on the course of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Further impact in the knowledge was made by the intellectuals Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald, Voldemar Hansen, Eduard Friedrich Lossius and others. The first atlas in Estonian \\"Maakaardi raamat\\", published in 1857, contained a map of India under the title of Indo-Brittia Riik (Indo-Britain State), populated by toponyms from Masing's and Jannsen's publications. Several protestant missionaries from Estonia contributed in India. The first one was Arnold Nerling who worked among the Tamils in 1862‚Äì1872. Born in Reval, Franz Mathissen studied in the school of the Basel Mission, was sent to work in Calcutta in 1867 and stayed there for the rest of his life. His schoolmate Johannes Hesse from Weissenstein was sent to work in the mountains by Nilagiri in 1869‚Äì1874. Albert Grubert from Ahrensburg who had studied in Leipzig, worked in 1871‚Äì1876 in Nagapatnam. While they were Baltic Germans, the only missionary of Estonian ethnicity was Christoph Bransfeld from K√§rdla who worked with the Gossner Theological College in 1880‚Äì1896. By the late 19th century, India was widely known to Estonians. In addition to the textbooks and the press, brochures were issued on the mission, the Rebellion of 1857, Nana Sahib (1884), the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78 (1892), the hinduism (1892), the British Raj (1895) and more. These were supported by the letters of the missionaries in India published by the Estonian press. Playing Indian music has become a tradition in the Estonian film festival Orient. Veena player Dr.Mustafa Raza has performed in the festival three times. The Estonian-Indian Cultural Society was established in 2004 and since then has made regular donations to the Estonian Institute of Humanities, the National Library of Estonia and the University of Tartu.  Political  The Estonian‚ÄìIndian Parliament Group was established in the Riigikogu in 2004.Riigikogus moodustati Eesti-India parlamendir√ºhm (Estonian-Indian Parliament Group established in Riigikogu. In Estonian). Eesti P√§evaleht Estonia has supported India's bid for a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. Estonia also supports the Indian draft on Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) in the United Nations.  Science  In a collaboration with Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, CCMB, Hyderabad, India, Estonian Biocentre and University of Tartu has published dozens of papers on origin and migrations of South Asian populations. Apart from these many Indian students and researchers are working currently in University of Tartu and Tallinn University of Technology. Gyaneshwer Chaubey was the first Indian student in University of Tartu defended his PhD theses in 2010. Later in 2015, Chandana Basu became the first female Indian student to complete her PhD.  Agreements  Estonia and India have several agreements on co-operations on subjects varying from Science and Technology to Culture, Education, Science, Sports, Arts, Mass Media, Tourism and Youth Affairs. In 1999 India and Estonia signed a joint business council agreement to increase investment and trade between the two countries. * Declaration of Principles and Directions of Co-operation between the Republic of Estonia and the Republic of India which came into force 15 October 1993 * Agreement on Co-operation in the Fields of Science and Technology which came into force on August 6, 1999 * Agreement on Co-operation in the Spheres of Culture, Education, Science, Sports, Arts, Mass Media, Tourism and Youth Affairs which came into force 11 November 1999 * Agreement on Economic and Technical Co-operation which came into force 13 March 2000 * Agreement on Trade and Economic Co-operation which came into force 24 August 2004 References External links  * Estonian Ministry of foreign Affairs about the relation with India * Indian embassy in Helsinki (also accredited to Estonia) India Estonia ","title":"Estonia‚ÄìIndia relations"},{"id":"20769338","text":"Mars mission may refer to: * Exploration of Mars, or any mission to assist in this endeavour ** List of missions to Mars *** List of Mars orbiters **** Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first interplanetary mission *** Mars rover mission(s) ** Human mission to Mars *** List of crewed Mars mission plans * Lego Mars Mission, a theme for Lego toys See also * Mission to Mars (disambiguation) ","title":"Mars mission"},{"id":"20769339","text":"First Tuesday may refer to: * First Tuesday - a monthly NBC newsmagazine television program (1969 to 1973) first hosted by Sander Vanocur * First Tuesday (documentary strand) - a monthly British current affairs television documentary strand * First Tuesday (networking forum) - a London-based networking forum * First Tuesday Book Club - an Australian book discussion television programme See also *Election Day (United States), often but not always held on the first Tuesday of November ","title":"First Tuesday"},{"id":"20769342","text":"The table of years in country music is a tabular display of all years in country music, to provide an overview and quick navigation to any year.

METC is located at Joint Base San Antonio on Fort Sam Houston, Texas with a field training site located at Camp Bullis.  Base Realignment and Closure  METC is the result of the 2005 BRAC legislation that required the bulk of enlisted technical medical training in the Army, Air Force, and Navy to be collocated to Fort Sam Houston, Texas with the potential of transitioning to a tri- service education and training effort. Consolidation is expected to result in government savings and makes the campus the largest enlisted military medical education and training facility in the world. I Construction METC's footprint covers more than one million square feet on Fort Sam Houston and cost more than $1 billion to build and equip. Eleven new facilities have been built, including three 1,200-student dormitories, and five existing buildings were renovated/transitioned to accommodate METC students. Construction began July 21, 2008. Three dormitories were built to accommodate Air Force and Navy students. Other facilities include a dining facility, fitness center, five new medical instructional facilities (MIFs), a biomedical equipment technician field training site, a Navy and Air Force shared command building, student activity center, academic support facility, and a METC headquarters building. Two other dorms were built nearby for Army students, with one housing technical school students. The dorm rooms themselves were individually constructed offsite at a plant in Belton, Texas and shipped. Each of the five, 4-story dormitories cost approximately $ to complete. The dormitories consist of 600 apartment-styled dorms on three upper floors while the bottom floor are classrooms and administrative spaces. Due to the unique circumstances of a military dormitory over traditional college dorms (such as noise from aircraft, armored vehicles, and artillery, as well as the Army's policies on the amount of floor space allocated per soldier), contractors were forced to find a unique way to deal with the sound. The traditional method of party walls would not work because of the already limited floor space. A new soundproof drywall was used instead to give students as much living space as possible. Academics Founding Commandant Rear Admiral Kiser USN, (RET) METC entered into its initial operating capability June 30, 2010 and reached full operating capability on September 15, 2011. Its initial training course was Radiology Technician. Their courses were phased in throughout the rest of the year and into 2011. The METC campus graduates around 16,500 students each year, with an average daily student load of approximately 5,500. METC officials will also employ an operating staff and faculty of 1,200. On August 10, 2014 METC realigned under the Education and Training Directorate of the newly established Defense Health Agency and entered into initial operational capability. By service, the student breakdown includes approximately 51 percent Army, 31 percent Navy and 18 percent Air Force. The longest program offered is cytology, which is the study of cells, at 52 weeks; and the shortest, at four weeks, is patient administration. Consolidated basic and specialty enlisted training from five separate service medical learning centers have moved to San Antonio, Texas. Local impact The Medical Education and Training Campus has already brought $ to San Antonio and is estimated to bring an additional $ per year after 2011.

He was the Paramount Chief of the Iban people for more than 55 years.Tun Jugah Foundation They affectionately called him \\"Apai\\" meaning \\"father\\" in the Iban language. Tun Jugah played a fundamental role in bringing the state of Sarawak into the formation of the Federation of Malaysia which materialized on 16 September 1963. Sarawak had been made a British colony after the way and was granted its independence on 22 July 1963. Tun Abdul Rahman Ya'kub said that Tun Jugah was \\"the bridge to Malaysia,\\" i.e. without his signature, there wouldn't be any Malaysia today. His candidacy as the first Sarawak Governor was rejected by Tunku Abdul Rahman on the basis that the posts of the Sarawak Chief Minister and the Sarawak Governor cannot be both held by Iban at the same time. He was unfortunately illiterate, like so many other Ibans during his time. He signed documents by stamping his thumb print. However, he managed to become a state leader, i.e. the first Sarawakian and Iban Federal Minister in charge of Sarawak Affairs in the Cabinet of Malaysia. He was famous for his often-quoted reminder before the formation of Malaysia, \\"Anang baka tebu, manis ba pun tang tabar ba ujung,\\" i.e. \\"Do not be like the sugar cane, sweet at the beginning but tasteless at the end\\". He was elected a member of Parliament during Malaysia's first elections in 1963. Tun Jugah, who was Sarawak‚Äôs Internal Affairs Minister, was appointed as the first president of the United Traditional Bumiputera Party or Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) until his death in 1981. The party was founded with the purpose of the improvement of the livelihood and protect the rights of the Sarawakian Bumiputera in many fields such as politics, economy and social. PBB was formed from the combination of three parties in Sarawak; Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS), Barisan Rakyat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA) and Parti Pesaka Anak Sarawak (PESAKA). Tun Jugah was one of the early members who instrumental in setting up Pesaka with other Iban Penghulus of Batang Rajang. He died peacefully on 9 July 1981 at Kuching, leaving behind his wife Toh Puan Tiong anak Anding, his children and grandchildren. His famous quote was \\"Anang aja Malaysia tu baka Tebu, Manis di pun, tabar Di ujung\\" (Let's hope that Malaysia will not end up as a sugarcane, sweet in the beginning, but turned less sweet in the end).

After the dissolution of Denmark‚ÄìNorway Iceland was a part of the Kingdom of Denmark from 1814 to 1918 and a separate kingdom in a personal union with Denmark until 1944, when Iceland declared independence. Both countries are full members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, Nordic Council, NATO, and Council of Europe. There are around 18,000 Icelanders living in Denmark This consists of 8,959 Icelandic nationals resident in Denmark and 9,069 Iceland-born migrants. and 2,900 Danes living in Iceland. Residing in Iceland in 2011, there were 1,604 Danish-born people with two Icelandic parents, 698 Danish-born with one Icelandic parent, and 650 other Danish-born migrants. The relationship between Iceland and Denmark remained close after Iceland's independence, and for many years Danish was taught as the second language in Iceland, and is still compulsory as a third language from seventh grade onward. History19th century= Iceland achieved home rule in 1874, and became a fully sovereign state in 1918, united with Denmark under a common King. In 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark- Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the Treaty of Kiel. Iceland, however, remained a Danish dependency. Throughout the 19th century, the country's climate continued to worsen, resulting in mass emigration to the New World, particularly Manitoba in Canada. About 15,000 out of a total population of 70,000 left. However, a new national consciousness was revived, inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from Continental Europe, and an Icelandic independence movement arose under the leadership of J√≥n Sigur√∞sson. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and limited home rule, which was expanded in 1904. The Icelanders abolished the monarchy in 1944. =20th century= The German occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark. As a result, on 10 April, the Parliament of Iceland, Al√æingi, elected to take control of foreign affairs, electing a provisional governor, Sveinn Bj√∂rnsson, who later became the republic's first president. During the first year of World War II, Iceland strictly enforced a position of neutrality, taking action against both the United Kingdom and German forces violating the laws of neutrality. On 10 May 1940, Operation Fork was launched and UK military forces began an invasion of Iceland by sailing into Reykjav√≠k harbor. The government of Iceland issued a protest against what it called a \\"flagrant violation\\" of Icelandic neutrality. On the day of the invasion, prime minister Hermann J√≥nasson read a radio announcement telling Icelanders to treat the British troops with politeness as guests. Following a referendum on 24 May 1944, Iceland formally became an independent republic on 17 June 1944. Since Denmark was still occupied by Nazi Germany, many Danes felt offended that the step should have been taken at this time. Despite this the Danish king, Christian X, sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people.

History The building which houses the honorary New Zealand Consulate General in Copenhagen in 2015 There is a small Danish community in New Zealand, descended from a group of early settlers who came to clear thick North Island bush, in the middle years of the 19th century, and stayed to found settlements including Dannevirke and Norsewood. A former Prime Minister and high-ranking churchman from Denmark, Danish Prime Minister, Bishop Ditlev Gothard Monrad, settled in Karere near Palmerston North in the 1860s, and set up the first dairy plant in the region. Monrad returned to Denmark after a stay of three years, but other members of his family stayed in New Zealand. He left behind his collection of art now housed at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Other Danes came to the Seventy Mile Bush area in 1872 and founded the town which retains the Danish name of Dannevirke, commemorating the Danevirke in Slesvig. The other town created by the Danes was Norsewood. In 1946, the two countries signed an agreement regarding 'exchange of notes', and other property held during World War II. In 2016 Karen Pullar was appointed by the Queen of Denmark, Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II as Consul General of Denmark to New Zealand.

The countries have a very long history together: they were both part of the Kalmar Union between 1397 and 1523, and Norway was in a Union with Denmark between 1524 and 1814. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1905, after Norway ended its union with Sweden. Denmark has an embassy in Oslo and Norway has an embassy in Copenhagen. Both countries are full members of the Nordic Council, Council of the Baltic Sea States, NATO, and the Council of Europe. There are around 15,000 Norwegians living in Denmark and around 20,000 Danes living in Norway.Statistics Norway Kalmar Union The Kalmar Union is a historiographical term meaning a series of personal unions that united the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway (with Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Shetland, and Orkney), and Sweden (including Finland) under a single monarch, though intermittently and with a population less than 3,000,000. The countries had not technically given up their sovereignty, nor their independence, but in practical terms, they were not autonomous, the common monarch holding the sovereignty and, particularly, leading foreign policy; diverging interests (especially the Swedish nobility's dissatisfaction over the dominant role played by Denmark and Holstein) gave rise to a conflict that would hamper the union in several intervals from the 1430s until the union's breakup in 1523 when Gustav Vasa became king of Sweden. Norway and its overseas dependencies, however, continued to remain a part of the realm of Denmark‚ÄìNorway under the Oldenburg dynasty for several centuries until its dissolution in 1814. Denmark‚ÄìNorway Embassy of Norway in Copenhagen Denmark‚ÄìNorway is the historiographical name for a former political entity consisting of the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, including the originally Norwegian dependencies of Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Following the strife surrounding the break-up of its predecessor, the Kalmar Union, the two kingdoms entered into another personal union in 1524 which lasted until 1814. The corresponding adjective and demonym is Dano- Norwegian. The term Kingdom of Denmark is sometimes used to include both countries in the period 1536‚Äì1660, since the political and economic power emanated from Copenhagen, Denmark. The term covers the \\"royal part\\" of the Oldenburgs as it was in 1460, excluding the \\"ducal part\\" of Schleswig and Holstein. The administration used two official languages, Danish and German, and for several centuries both a Danish and German Chancery existed.Rigsarkivets Samlinger. Arkivalier f√∏r 1848.

She spearheaded the MƒÅori Renaissance in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Biography She was born Te Kumeroa Ngoingoi NgƒÅwai on 29 December 1921 at Tokomaru Bay, on New Zealand's East Coast, the eldest of five children of Hori NgƒÅwai, a labourer and minister in the Ringat≈´ faith from the Te WhƒÅnau-a-Ruataupare hap≈´ of the NgƒÅti Porou iwi of Tokomaru Bay, and his wife Wikitoria Karu of NgƒÅti Tara Tokanui in the Hauraki region. She attended Hukarere Girls‚Äô School from 1938 to 1941. Ngoi was a niece of Tuini NgƒÅwai, another prominent composer and promoter of the language and culture. In the early 1940s, Ngoi travelled around New Zealand in a fundraising drive for the war effort with the Hokowhitu-ƒÅ-T≈´ Concert Party. Her aunt, who founded the group, trained her in kapa haka performance and groomed her for leadership. She continued her involvement after the war. In 1945, she married Rikirangi Ben Pƒìwhairangi of Tokomaru Bay. The only child of the marriage was a son, Terewai Pƒìwhairangi, but they fostered many other children. Ngoi taught MƒÅori language and tutored the MƒÅori club at Gisborne Girls' High School for three years from 1973. In 1974 she also began teaching a course of MƒÅori studies in Gisborne for the University of Waikato. In 1977, Kara Puketapu, the new secretary of the Department of MƒÅori Affairs called on her assistance in setting up T≈´ Tangata, a scheme that targeted at-risk MƒÅori youth in the cities, and attempted to connect them with their iwi. She continued working for the Department as an adviser, and was involved in the preliminary consultations that led to the establishment of the k≈çhanga reo movement, which saw children receiving their schooling in MƒÅori. From 1978 on, she was an adviser to the National Council of Adult Education. In this capacity she promoted MƒÅori language and culture around the country, especially in rural areas. She was the co-founder, with Katerina Mataira, of the highly acclaimed Te Ataarangi programme of teaching MƒÅori, which was the basis of a TV programme and a series of books, Te reo (1985). Among PƒÅkehƒÅ who have heard of her, she is best known as the composer of the poi song Poi E, which topped New Zealand charts in 1984 in a recording by Dalvanius Prime and the Patea MƒÅori Club, and sold 15,000 copies. She also wrote the popular song E Ipo which was performed by Prince Tui Teka. She died in Tokomaru Bay on 29 January 1985. Her tangihanga (funeral) was held at PƒÅkirikiri Marae. A waiata tangi (lament) composed for her by Dr Tƒ´moti KƒÅretu was for a number of years the signature piece of the kapa haka group of the Te Tumu School of MƒÅori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies at the University of Otago. Honours and awards In the 1978 New Year Honours, Pƒìwhairangi was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for community service.

He had been a fund manager and capital raiser until 2008 when one of the funds in Gabriel Capital LP, his $5 billion group of hedge funds became insolvent because a large portion of its assets was invested with the convicted Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff. The fallout from his investment with Madoff has been extensive. He navigated a series of lawsuits without a finding of fraud or knowledge of the scheme, but agreed to repay any fees earned from the investment in Madoff historically. He had to resign a series of positions including his role as Non-executive Chairman of GMAC. Personal Merkin is the son of prominent businessman Hermann Merkin and Ursula Merkin (n√©e Ursula Sara Breuer), both German-born Orthodox Jews who fled Germany prior to World War II to escape Nazism. Merkin's sister is Daphne Merkin, a writer. He and his wife, Lauren, have four children. On May 20, 2009, he resigned as President of Fifth Avenue Synagogue, which was founded by his father in 1959. Members include some of his largest Madoff-related investors, losing in total, more than $1 billion. Merkin attended Ramaz, an Upper East Side Modern Orthodox prep school, Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh and Yeshivat Har Etzion yeshivas in Israel, then Columbia University and Harvard Law School. In 1995, he paid $11 million for an 18-room duplex formerly owned by Ron Perelman, a member of his synagogue, at 740 Park Avenue, sometimes referred to as \\"the world's richest apartment Building.\\" In 2003, he began to collect 12 Mark Rothko paintings, the largest private collection in the world, worth an estimated $150 million. The Rothkos were sold in 2008, under an agreement with the receiver, for $320 million. Merkin also owns a home in Atlantic Beach, New York, valued at $1.7 million, and a property in Eagle County, Colorado, worth $506,000. Business background \\"It's very, very difficult for Ezra to make decisions. He worried about the big picture, fretted over allocations. His gift was that he was a world-class salesman. He recognized that many people didn't have (investment decision) confidence, that if people had confidence in him, then he could give them confidence,\\" said one money manager who worked with him over the years. From 1979 to 1982, he worked for the law firm Milbank Tweed. He worked at Halcyon Investments from 1982 to 1985. He moved on to Halcyon, a hedge fund run by Alan B. Slifka, his father's friend. There he met Joel Greenblatt, who founded Gotham Capital in 1985, where Merkin worked until 1988, as an analyst and a managing partner in Gotham Capital LP and Ariel Capital LP. In 1988, he started Gabriel Capital to raise capital, and funnel it to managers in exchange for a fee. By 1992, Merkin was raising money and co-managing securities with and for Stephen A. Feinberg, a manager whose private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, later bought controlling shares in Chrysler (80%) and GMAC (51%, at a cost of $6.4 billion), the financing arm of General Motors. Merkin invested his funds into Cerberus and its portfolio companies. His Gabriel fund invested $79 million in Chrysler, $66 million in GMAC, and $67 million in Cerberus partnerships, according to year-end statements. Although Cerberus lost its controlling stake in Chrysler, ultimately, investors in Chrysler and GMC received more than their investment back in proceeds. In 2005, Cerberus and Gabriel bought a 9.9% combined interest in Bank Leumi, but in April 2009, decided to sell to boost liquidity due to their substantial financial losses in 2008. Merkin managed Ascot Partners LP, a hedge fund which was valued at $1.8 billion prior to the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. =GMAC= In 2006, Cerberus appointed Merkin as nonexecutive Chairman of GMAC, a large investment for Cerberus. This investment was nearly a washout, but ultimately Cerberus investors recouped their capital. However, in January 2009, Merkin had to resign from his chairmanship as a condition of the U.S. Federal Reserve granting GMAC bank holding company status, so it could obtain access to bailout money. =Victor Teicher= Victor Teicher specialized in merger- related investments. In 1988 he was indicted for insider trading, convicted in 1990, and in 1994 jailed for a year. In August 1998, Merkin again hired Teicher to manage about $1 billion as an independent operator, paying him $1 million a year plus incentives. In 1988 Merkin began putting a substantial portion of the money he raised for Gabriel Capital with Teicher. From 1988 to 1998, Teicher actually managed Merkin's off-shore, Ariel fund and Gabriel Capital. Merkin \\"occupied himself primarily with raising money for the funds using his extensive social and professional network.\\" While in jail, Teicher was running about $375 million from Merkin's investors. In January 1995, Merkin took over Teicher's staff, put Gabriel Capital's name on the door, and hired Nathan Leight to manage the money. Teicher had told Merkin not to invest with Madoff because such steady returns were impossible. After Madoff's arrest, Teicher immediately sent some emails to Merkin: > You, however, took a brilliant career and actively, willingly, wiped your > ass with it when it was obvious that you (knew what you) were doing. > The Madoff news is hilarious;hope you negotiate out of this mess as well as > possible....Unfortunately, you've paid a big price for a lesson on the cost > of being greedy. > I guess you did such a good job in fooling a lot of people, you ultimately > fooled yourself...a man's name tells you who he is; Madoff made off with the > money. Bernard Madoff scandal Ultimately, Merkin's investments with Madoff were extraordinarily costly for his investors and for him personally ‚Äì both in dollars and in terms of reputation. Merkin's funds had been longtime investors in Madoff. Starting in 1992, Merkin began investing some of the funds under his management into Madoff, collecting an annual fee of 1 ‚Äì 1.5% of the funds' total assets. By 2005, Merkin earned about $35 million a year simply for funneling money to Madoff. Merkin invested personally and through family trusts and foundations $7 million in Ascot in its first six years, and less than $2 million over the following 10 years. He did not reinvest his $169 million in management fees for the years 1995 to 2007 back into his Ascot Partners, although he had more than $100 million in personal capital invested through his funds in Madoff. Merkin was charged with fraud with connection with the Madoff investments. Ultimately, he prevailed in the fraud cases and no court ruled that he had any actual knowledge of the Madoff fraud. Although ultimately, this case was settled without a finding of fraud by Merkin, Merkin agreed to return any fees which he earned over the years associated with investments in Madoff's fund. Merkin was hit with a series of lawsuits from disgruntled investors to recover funds lost in the Madoff scandal, but in most of these cases Merkin prevailed. Merkin had been sued for his role in running a \\"feeder fund\\" for Madoff. Merkin lost three arbitration cases related to the Madoff investments. The cases included findings of negligence by Merkin but not fraud. On May 7, 2009, Madoff Bankruptcy Trustee, Irving Picard filed a lawsuit against Merkin seeking to recover almost $500 million withdrawn from Madoff accounts in the last six years. The complaint alleged that since 1995, Merkin steered more than $1.0 billion to Madoff through three private hedge funds, Ascot Partners, Ariel Fund, and Gabriel Capital. Since 2002, the funds withdrew at least $494 million from Madoff ‚Äì returns that Merkin \\"knew or should have known\\" were fraudulent. There were at least 500 instances in the last 10 years when his Madoff account statements showed large blocks of stock bought or sold at prices that did not match the stock's trading range for the day when the transactions supposedly occurred. Merkin was not shown to have had actual knowledge of any wrongdoing and won this case. As of May 18, 2009, Merkin's control of Ascot, Gabriel and Ariel hedge funds were placed into receivership for liquidation by Guidepost Partners. One receiver was responsible for managing the remaining money, nearly $1 billion, in the Gabriel and Ariel funds, and another was responsible for overseeing Ascot, whose entire $1.8 billion in assets was lost to Madoff's Ponzi scheme. New York University was given until the end of May 2009 to review the agreement. Merkin collected over $470 million for managing three funds, Ariel, Gabriel and Ascot Partners, over the last decade, of which he paid back $405 million to investors after finding out about the Madoff scheme. The three funds had about $1.4 billion in assets remaining in 2009 with about $700 million in Ariel.Merkins art sale On June 22, 2012, Merkin agreed to pay back $405 million to investors in his hedge funds without any finding of fraud on his part. Picard, however, sued in bankruptcy court to stop the settlement, saying it obstructed his own effort to obtain $500 million from Merkin and his funds for other investors. Ultimately, Picard's suit to stop the settlement was unsuccessful. Quotes \\"It is not easy to stay on the sidelines while others are busy getting rich. Wall Street, moreover, is constitutionally predisposed to overdo things. The stereotype imagines a Wall Street populated by bulls and bears. In reality, the Street itself is neither bull nor bear but shark, constantly shifting direction in an eternal search for food. This feeding process involves massive shifts of capital, which inevitably, is sometimes misallocated.\\" ‚Äì J. Ezra Merkin, writing in an introduction to a chapter in the 75th anniversary version of Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis. \\"As long as investors remain human, and thus subject to greed, fear, pressure, doubt, and the entire range of human emotions, there will be money to be made by those who steel themselves to overcome emotion. Think of Graham and Dodd as embodying the spirit of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who declared: 'Blest are those/Whose blood and judgement are so well commingled,/that they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger/to sound what stop she please.'\\" ReferencesExternal links * Deposition of J.

These countries were part of the Kalmar Union between 1397 and 1523, although, there exists an inherited cultural competition between Sweden and Denmark. From 1448 to 1790 the two kingdoms were at war nearly at every chance, in more than one case a new king trying to prove his worth by waging war on the other country for little or no political reason. There have been 11 Dano-Swedish wars between 1521 and 1814. Today, the countries are separated by the √òresund, which links the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Denmark has an embassy in Stockholm and 2 consulates general (in G√∂teborg and Malm√∂). Sweden has an embassy in Copenhagen and 16 honorary consulates (in Aabenraa, Aarhus, Aalborg, Esbjerg, Frederikshavn, Gren√•, Helsing√∏r, Holb√¶k, Kolding, Nuuk, Nyk√∏bing Falster, Odense, R√∏nne, Skagen, T√≥rshavn and Viborg). Both countries are full members of the Nordic Council, of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, of the Council of Europe, and of the European Union. Around 21,000 Swedish people live in Denmark and around 42,000 Danish people live in Sweden. Historic conflictsSecond Northern War= The Second Northern War (1655‚Äì60) was fought between Sweden and its adversaries the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1655‚Äì60), Russia (1656‚Äì58), Brandenburg-Prussia (1657‚Äì60), the Habsburg Monarchy (1657‚Äì60) and Denmark‚ÄìNorway (1657‚Äì58 and 1658‚Äì60). The Dutch Republic often intervened against Sweden. In 1655, Karl X Gustav of Sweden invaded and occupied western Poland-Lithuania, the eastern half of which was already occupied by Russia. The rapid Swedish advance became known in Poland as Swedish Deluge. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a Swedish fief, the Polish-Lithuanian regular armies surrendered and the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa fled to the Habsburgs. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia initially supported the estates in Royal Prussia, but allied with Sweden in return for receiving the Duchy of Prussia as a Swedish fief. Exploiting the hurt religious feelings of the Roman Catholic population under Protestant occupation and organizing Polish-Lithuanian military leaders in the Tyszowce Confederation, John II Casimir Vasa managed to regain ground in 1656. Russia took advantage of the Swedish setback, declared war on Sweden and pushed into Lithuania and Swedish Livonia. Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William I full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia in return for military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II R√°k√≥czi who invaded Poland-Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland-Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland in the spring of 1657, in an attempt to settle old scores from the Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg. Dano-Swedish War (1658‚Äì60) The Dano-Swedish War of 1658‚Äì60 was a war between Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Sweden. It was a continuation of an earlier conflict between the two belligerents which had ended just months earlier, after Sweden and Denmark brokered a peace agreement in Roskilde in 1658. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Swedish king Charles X Gustav desired to add the province of Royal Prussia in Poland to the Swedish realm, but his position in the region was not strong enough with the opposition of Brandenburg and Austria.Frost, p. 180. However, the Danes stalled and prolonged the fulfillment of some provisions of the earlier peace; the Swedish king decided to use this as a pretext to attack with an ambitious goal: to vanquish Denmark as a sovereign state and raze the capital of Copenhagen. A quick and decisive defeat of Denmark was however only seen as a means to a greater end. The long-term goal was to wage war in Europe without fearing Danish interference. =Scanian War= The Scanian War was a part of the Northern Wars involving the union of Denmark‚ÄìNorway, Brandenburg and Sweden. It was fought mainly on Scanian soil, in the former Danish provinces along the border with Sweden and in Northern Germany. While the latter battles are regarded a theater of the Scanian war in English, Danish and Swedish historiography, they are seen as a separate war in German historiography, called the Swedish-Brandenburgian War. The war was prompted by the Swedish involvement in the Franco-Dutch War. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries. The United Provinces, under attack by France, sought support from Denmark‚ÄìNorway. After some hesitation, King Christian V started the invasion of the Scania (Sk√•neland) in 1675, while the Swedish were occupied with a war against Brandenburg. The invasion of Scania was combined with a simultaneous Norwegian front called the Gyldenl√∏ve Wae, forcing the defending Swedes to fight a two-front war in addition to their entanglements in the Holy Roman Empire.  √òresund Bridge  Embassy of Denmark in Stockholm In 1991, the Danish and Swedish governments signed an agreement to establish a fixed link across the √ñresund. The agreement was ratified by the two countries' parliaments in August of the same year. √ñresundskonsortiet, a joint venture between A/S √ñresund and SVEDAB AB, constructed the permanent link between Sweden and Denmark. The project cost more than DKK12 billion and comprises a 16.4 km (10-mile) link between Copenhagen and Malm√∂ consisting of a tunnel, a bridge and the artificial island Peberholm. Cultural links Embassy of Sweden in Copenhagen There are extensive cultural links between Denmark and Sweden, which are often referred to as \\"brother peoples\\" (Danish/Swedish: broderfolk). The southern part of Sweden, Scania, was a part of Denmark until 1658, and the Scanian landscapes still contain many references to the Danish rule, such as in the name of many towns and cities, including Kristianstad. The construction of the √òresund Bridge has rekindled those ties, with the creation of the √òresund Region as the transnational metropolitan area comprising Copenhagen and Malm√∂. In addition, many Swedes and Danes consider themselves culturally and historically linked, in large part because the languages are mutually intelligible especially in the border regions. Even in modern times, there have been serious talks of a Nordic Union, either within or in competition with the European Union, and a Nordic Passport Union has been in existence since 1952, allowing all citizens of the Nordic countries to travel freely without documents.

It was the first earthquake to be recorded on any seismic instrument in the state since 1917. Tremors were felt over much of Minnesota, northern Iowa, and the eastern Dakotas.

The quake also cracked the foundations of two homes on East Fifth Street in Morris. Many reports included extremely loud \\"bangs\\" and \\"explosions\\". These sounds lead to one man thinking that a nearby gas plant had exploded. If the earthquake had occurred elsewhere, however, it may have caused a larger amount of damage.

These were made before the Compton Potters' Arts Guild was formally set up, but many of the same people were involved. The doorway of the Watts Mortuary Chapel The Compton Potters' Arts Guild was an art pottery, founded by and based at the Surrey home of Scottish artist, Mary Fraser Tytler. Background A follower of the Home Arts and Industries Association, set up by Earl Brownlow in 1885 to encourage handicrafts among the lower classes, Fraser-Tytler, the wife of Victorian era painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts, had offered to design and build a new mortuary chapel when the council in Compton, Surrey were developing a new cemetery. Setting up a local evening class, led by Louis Deuchars, Mary got them designing and modelling designs guided by her and influenced by friends and crafts people: Edward Burne-Jones, Walter Crane, Alexander Fisher, William de Morgan and Phoebe Traquair. The resultant Romanesque/Celtic revival exterior of the Watts Mortuary Chapel aroused such interest, that before work on the polychrome interior had started, Watts had set up permanent Arts and Crafts communities in both Compton and her home-town of Aldourie, Scotland. The outputs of the Compton group resulted in the formation in 1899 of the Compton Potters' Arts Guild. Production The innovative terracotta garden ornaments produced by the evening class group, recommended by Gertrude Jekyll, expanded into a production centre of mainly Gothic Revival, Arts and Crafts and latterly Art Nouveau style pottery, with many of its designs involved Celtic knots. The pottery's output was extensive, from large terracotta garden pottery to smaller household figures, jugs, plaques and pendants. In Green Lane cemetery, Farnham, there is a Compton Pottery memorial to May Margaret Barber, widow of Charles Burton Barber, the Victorian artist.Jenny Mukerji, The Farnham Diary, December 2009 edition After World War I, many pairs of bookends were made including Archers, Sunburst, Galleon, Fruit and Flowers. The majority of the pottery was made from a soft white body and decorated with tempera, an egg-based paint susceptible to wear and which washes off. Its designs and products were featured by many London shops, including Liberty & Co. One of its potters was featured in the first BBC filler intermission film, the well known 'Potter's Wheel'. After the death of its founder, the Guild continued until 1954, by which time competition from more modern designs had severely reduced its sales.

Toponymy The name of Pra- Loup consists of Pra, Pro and lovin, derived from a patoise form Pralovin, isolated houses in a clearing and Latin lupinus \\"pr√© au loup\\", loup itself coming from olim le Lau, hamlet. Therefore: Pra-Loup means \\"meadow grown for hay, or pasture\\". Pra-Loup residents are called praloupiens and the praloupiennes. According to the F√©nie couple, Pra-Loup is the \\"meadow of loup\\", an owner's first name. History Ski cabin at Pra-Loup Chalets at Pra-Loup The site of Pra-Loup has been known since the 1st century BC, with the presence of Ligurian shepherds coming from the Mediterranean, who settled here and gave birth to the local tribes. The hamlet took shape in the 12th century, the Chalaisian monks, who came via , built four formerly associated buildings: The church, the school, the priory and the presbytery. From the 14th century to the 17th century, the hamlet grew, with the construction of farms and a hostel, as well as with pastoralism. Until 1920, the hamlets were sparsely populated, often completely self-sufficient with the mill and oven, though notably lacking drinking water. The inhabitants found an ingenious system to pick up a meagre water source by building a wooden pipeline with hollowed tree trunks, \\"le bourn√©ous\\", visible at the Museum of Jausiers Valley. At the end of the 1950s, Pierre Grou√®s, a medical philanthropist, had the idea to create a skiing resort to develop the attractiveness of the village. To do this, it was surrounded by the best specialists of the moment: √âmile Allais, French alpine skier and , France's alpine ski team coach. The ski resort took shape in the 1960s. Instead of the 3,000 beds that were planned for the ski resort, Honor√© Bonnet offered a capacity of 10,000 beds for reasons of profitability. From the summit of Pegueiou, he found fertile ground and also identified a possibility by the small valley of Agneliers, which later became the link with , inaugurated in 1977. Under the leadership of Michel Lantelme, Mayor of Allos and Louis Lequette, Mayor of Uvernet-Fours, this very large-scale ski area is one of the largest in the Southern Alps. Since 1981, Pra-Loup has been classified health resort (by decree of 13 January 1981). Economy The Fumeton, inspired by the , was created in Pra- Loup, chosen to be concerned with the enhancement of lamb and mutton. A delicacy of the Provence Alps, it is presented in the form of a dark red meat block and with a weight of about . Cut into thin slices, it is eaten both as an entr√©e and as accompaniment of mountain dishes including raclette, and also accompanies gratins, salads or pizzas. In recent years, the Fumeton has been made in Barcelonnette. SportTour de France= Pra-Loup was used as the finish of stage 15 in the 1975 Tour de France. The race from Nice was won by Bernard Th√©venet of France, and is regarded in cycling lore as the mountain climb where the career of Eddy Merckx faltered.Bicycling, Great moments of the Tour de France (See Eddy Merckx - 1975 Tour de France, Pierre Chany).

In 1945 he won his first major race and went on to win a number of premier events including two editions of the Australian Cup. He competed for the last time in Australia in 1952 and the following year accepted a contract to ride in India. Then, in 1954 he spent five months in France before moving to ride in Singapore and Malaysia. At the Perak Turf Club racecourse in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, he won the 1954 Sultan Gold Vase, repeating as winner in 1958 when he also won the Perak Derby. In 1955, he won the prestigious Singapore Gold Cup at the Bukit Timah Race Course. In the late 1950s Bougoure returned to race in Europe where his association with trainer Vincent O'Brien and Paddy Prendergast helped make him one of the top jockeys in Ireland and England during the first half of the 1960s. He became the only Australian to lead the jockeys' list in Ireland, accomplishing the feat in 1960. His success in 1963 helped make Prendergast the first Irish-based trainer to ever win the British trainers' title. Bougoure's numerous wins in Ireland include the 1960 and 1963 runnings of the Irish Derby and in England he won three of the Classics, taking the 1963 Epsom Oaks with the filly Noblesse, the 1963 St. Leger Stakes with Ragusa and in 1964 the 1,000 Guineas Stakes aboard Pourparler. Garnet Bougoure returned to Singapore during the second half of the 1960s where he continued to riding until retiring in 1969. He then embarked on a career in training that would last several decades until leaving the sport completely in 1995 at age seventy-three. Bougoure returned to Australia to be close to his children and died there in Frankston in 2008. He was predeceased by his wife Margaret Moore, the sister of jockey George Moore, who died in 1983.

The band was assembled by John Eichler who, as well as working for Famepushers, was production manager at Strand Cosmetics, where he hired people either for 'musical ability' or 'strangeness'. The eponymous debut album, Help Yourself, was recorded from late 1970 to early 1971. Malcolm Morley, (guitars/keyboards/vocals) wrote all the songs on this album, which was recorded with another former Sam Apple Pie member Dave Charles (drums/percussion/vocals), ex member of Monday Morning Glory Band, Richard Treece (guitars/vocals/harmonica) and former Growth member Ken Whaley (bass) The album was recorded before the band had played a gig, having been signed to Liberty Records by Andrew Lauder, head of A&R.; The band toured on the Downhome Rhythm Kings package with Brinsley Schwarz & Ernie Graham (ex Eire Apparent), who were all managed by Famepushers. After the tour, Ken Whaley was fired, but no other bass player was recruited. Help Yourself, Ernie Graham and his guitarist Jonathan \\"Jojo\\" Glemser, moved into Headley Grange in 1971, shortly after Led Zeppelin IV had been recorded there. The line-up was amalgamated to include both Graham (who had just released his eponymous solo album backed by Help Yourself and Brinsley Schwarz) and Glemser, both of whom were guitarists, so Treece switched to bass. The band played the 1971 Glastonbury Festival Sleevenotes by Nigel Cross to CD re- release of Ernie Graham his eponymous 1971 album (Hux 032) Sam Apple Pie having played the first Glastonbury in 1970. \\"Street Songs\\", from their first album, was issued on a United Artists double album sampler All Good Clean Fun. A tour was arranged to promote this album, so Help Yourself joined Man and Leicester band Gypsy, on a tour of Switzerland. The second album Strange Affair was recorded at the Grange, initially with Richard Treece still on bass, and adding his guitar parts later, until Paul Burton, their then Road Manager and former Sam Apple Pie roadie, joined on bass, to complete the album.review by Valve of Beware the Shadow in Head Heritage retrieved 20 November 2008 Strange Affair was released in early 1972, by which time both Graham and Glemser had left. The new line-up of Burton, Morley, Treece and Charles appeared on their first Peel Session in April 1972 The Peel Sessions BBC Radio 1 retrieved 20 November 2008 and recorded the next album Beware of the Shadow almost immediately. Sean Tyla, who had been the band's roadie, helped with some of the songwriting, notably \\"All Electric Fur Trapper\\", which was based on a fairy tale he had written. Shortly after completing the album, the band left Headley Grange, Tyla moved in with ex member Ken Whaley, and they formed Ducks Deluxe. Just as the Helps were due to start a tour to promote Beware of The Shadow, Morley suffered a bout of depression, (\\"The Shadow\\" referred to in the album title).Sleevenotes by John Tobler to CD re- release of Strange Affair, The Return of Ken Whaley and Happy Days (BGOCD 452) Rather than cancel the tour, Deke Leonard, who had just been fired by Man, stood in. Leonard stayed with the band after Morley had recovered, whilst Help Yourself backed Leonard on his first solo album Iceberg In December 1972, Help Yourself with Leonard and B. J. Cole, played at Man's Christmas Party. The double 10\\" album, Christmas at the Patti recorded at this concert, contains far more of their performance (24‚Äô) than their hosts (11‚Äô30‚Äô‚Äô). Ducks Deluxe also played this concert, but Whaley had already left. Beware of the Shadow was released in late 1972, but none of the first three albums sold well. The Helps appealed to a hippie audience such as fans of Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service so they were moderately successful in the U.S. but never toured there. In 1973, the band proposed touring with Roger Ruskin Spear, the Flying Aces and Vivian \\"Spiv\\" Morris, in a vaudeville show called \\"Happy Days\\", which was to be held in a circus tent. They started recording material for this in January, but Burton was unhappy with the proposed theatrical tour, so he left. Whaley returned and the band started recording their new album in February, finishing the Happy Days album in March and the Helps album in April, when they also recorded their second Peel Session. After a two-month \\"Happy Days\\" tour, the fourth album, The Return of Ken Whaley, was released, with the Happy Days album included free with the first 5,000 copies. The fourth album did not sell well either, and the band were not getting many gigs, so they were surprised when United Artists asked them to record another album, which they started recording in July 1973, with a line-up augmented by Sean Tyla. The album was to be called 5 and a cover was commissioned from Rick Griffin. They only had \\"half formed ideas\\" and although they eventually laid down 8 tracks, they gave up recording and disbanded in August 1973.Sleevenotes by Phil Mc Mullen to the 2004 release of 5 (Hux 054) They re-formed for \\"The Amazing ZigZag Concert\\" on 28 April 1974 with a core line-up of Morley, Treece, Whaley and Charles with Burton and Leonard guesting. Being incomplete, 5 was not issued, although a few years later some fans tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the band to complete the album. After Morley released his solo album Aliens in 2001, the suggestion re-arose, and the album was finally completed in 2002/2003 by Morley, Treece and Whaley, with Kevin Spacey on drums, as Charles had other commitments. The album was eventually released in 2004.

He was born in 1877 in Scotland. He died in Lui, South Sudan on 10 February 1935. His Early Life Fraser was born at Crock Ban on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland in 1877. At the age of 14 he ran away from home and joined the army as a drummer boy. He was converted to be a committed Christian while serving in South Africa during the Boer War, through overhearing some officers discuss spirituality. After his conversion he continued in the army, but began to develop a vision of service as a missionary. While serving in India he first met his future wife Eileen Galbraith, the sister of a British officer, Alexander Norman Galbraith (1879‚Äì1915) and fell in love with her, but he was then only a sergeant, and she turned down his proposal. On returning to Scotland, Fraser enrolled in evening school and did well, going on to study medicine at Edinburgh and Glasgow, qualifying in July 1914Glasgow medical journal by Glasgow and West Scotland Medical Association; Royal Medico-Chirurgical Society of Glasgow 1914 https://archive.org/details/glasgowmedicaljo82glas/page/202 with the express aim of becoming a medical missionary. After completing his study he again proposed to Eileen, and this time she accepted. Eileen had meanwhile had a period teaching, together with her elder half sister Alice, in Sudan at Omdurman and Wad Medani. They married on 30 November 1916 at St Simon Zealote's, ChelseaLondon Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Reference Number: p74/sim/006. Eileen was the daughter of Ven. Henry Galbraith, Archdeacon of Glendalough, County Wicklow, Ireland. During the First World War Dr. Fraser again saw active service with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Western Europe and Turkey, ending the war as a major. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1917Supplement to the London Gazetter, 1 May 1914 p. 4163. Eileen enrolled as a nurse and served in France from February to July 1916 with the British Committee of the French Red Cross. After the war Dr. Fraser went on to complete his medical training by studying surgery qualifyin at F.R.C.S. in Edinburgh in 1920. It was this background that the Frasers brought to their missionary service. It enabled Dr. Fraser to develop a strategy, which drew heavily on his military experience, that the Holy Spirit was able to use to establish the church throughout Moru country.TINGWA, Peter O. The History of the Moru Church in Sudan. A Missionary in Sudan Dr and Mrs Fraser arrived in the Moru country on 22 December 1920, about ten years after the area became part of Sudan. They settled in Lui, which was chosen as being close to permanent water but away from fly infested rivers.FRASER, E. (1938) The Doctor comes to Lui: A story of beginning in Sudan. Wayman & Sons Ltd., London A clear missionary strategy The church in Lui at the time of Dr FraserThe way the church developed in Moru country resulted from the strategy that Dr Fraser applied, interacting with the nature of the culture of the Moru people, and guided by the Holy Spirit.LAWIRI, E.B. (1987) The Growth of the Church in Moru Country. Moru Literacy Project, Mundri, Sudan. Dr Fraser's strategy reflected his experience as a soldier, together with his skills as a doctor, a teacher and a preacher. The work he was involved in shows an understanding of the completeness of man combined with a clear strategy of reaching out to the people God had given him to work with. Dr Fraser was a strong man with a strong character, and as a keen hunter had important characteristics respected by the Moru people. He was also seen by them as someone who was close to God. Patients at Lui hospital in 1923, having been wounded by lions.As a medical doctor, Dr. Fraser began work on the hospital immediately he arrived, so that he managed to complete the first temporary buildings within five months of arrival. Even before the hospital building was completed the Frasers began to build a small temporary school building, and started teaching a few boys. Alongside they started preaching and bringing the gospel.WERNER, R W ANDERSON AND A WHEELER (2000) Day of Devastarion Day of Contentment - The History of the Sudanesee Church across 2000 years. Paulines Publications Africa An important part of Dr Fraser's strategy was moving out from the centre into the whole of the Moru, and neighbouring Jur and Avokaya areas, and he did this as soon as he had local people to do so. When work was started at a new centre two people were sent together. One of the pair was a dresser and the other a teacher, but working closely together. On Sundays they would both work together in preaching and establishing the local church. Dr Fraser provided them with standardised medical kits and specific routines and procedures were established. The teams were required to send back reports to Fraser at Lui hospital at regular intervals.An article, researched and written by Mr. James Lomole Simeon, Esq., Chancellor of the Diocese of Khartoum, Sudan 2003) http://www.dacb.org/stories/sudan/fraser_kenneth.html By his death in 1935 Dr Fraser had managed to get a coverage of what is now Mundri county, with eleven dispensaries, based at the chiefs' areas. The foundation had been set for a policy that, with slight modifications, continued to be the basis of the mission work in Moru country up until the medical and educational work was taken over by the government in 1957 and 1958. This strategy has led to a number of important effects in the way Moru society has developed and the way the Moru view development.SHARLAND, Roger.W. (1998) \\"Kenneth Grant Fraser: Mission, Evangelism and Development among the Moru.\\" p.146-160 in PIERLI, F., M.T. RATTI & A.C. WHEELER Gateway to the Heart of Africa: Missionary Pioneers in Sudan. o Local Missionary Outreach. Local people were used as missionaries and managed to spread the work throughout the district with no missionaries outside Lui. This helped make it truly Moru. o Self-Reliance. Dr Fraser delegated much of the work from an early stage, making maximum use of those who had been through the school in Lui from an early stage. This helped foster a sense of local ownership and self-reliance. o Cover of the Whole Moru Area. Unlike some other areas of Southern Sudan, one does not find that all the educated Morus come from one part of the area. Education and development spread throughout the area. o Unity of the Moru People. In only a relatively few years the Moru people moved from disunited, fearful groups to being united as Christians and have maintained a cohesiveness ever since. o Reaching the Whole Man. Dr. Fraser's approach of bringing together the church, the school and the hospital has been seen as a strategy reaching out to the whole man. This can be seen as ministering to the body (hospital), mind (school) and spirit (church), in a holistic way. It is probably this factor as much as any other that has influenced the Moru view of development. o Importance of Medicine to the Moru. Medicine has been closely associated with education in the mind of many Morus. The result has been many Moru medical personnel, (as well as other scientific disciplines) and a great respect for medicine as a calling. o Significance of Individual Christians for Local Development. It was the teachers and dressers who were the first animateurs for development in most rural communities, while also bringing the gospel with their work. Key Christian individuals are still important in bringing change and motivation to the various communities. o The Church as an Internalised and Indigenous Structure. Throughout the turmoil that has effected Sudan on and off since the 1950s the church has proved particularly significant as the one structure that is indigenous and continues regardless of what is going on round about. o Social rather than Economic Development. One of the very few criticisms heard of Dr Fraser from any Morus was that his work was devoid of any economic development programme. This however may reasonably be seen as outside the scope of his work. Dr Fraser's Heritage The graves of Dr Fraser and his sister-in-law beside the church in Lui, SudanLooking back at the development of the Moru church, Dr Fraser's strategy was crucial in the way the church spread throughout the Moru people and its effect on the outlook of the whole tribe.LAWIRI, E.B. (1987) The Growth of the Church in Moru Country. Moru Literacy Project, Mundri, Sudan. Many Moru schoolchildren over the years have wanted to follow him and become medical doctors. As a result, they enter the 'science' stream. Those who have not become doctors have become medical professionals at other levels, or entered professions like agriculture as a result of this desire to follow his example. Lui Hospital is still an important hospital is Southern Sudan. Both Kenneth and Fraser are common baptismal names amongst the Morus even today, reflecting the high esteem he is still held in amongst these people. When Morus visit Britain they are keen to visit Edinburgh where Dr Fraser trained.

It is found throughout much of the Euphrates‚ÄìTigris river basin in Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province of Iran. Historically it has also been reported from Israel, but this likely involves confusion with the very similar Trionyx triunguis (the two typically require in-hand examination to be separated). The Euphrates softshell turtle is an endangered species that primarily is threatened by habitat loss and alteration, especially the building of dams, but to lesser extent also pollution and killing by fishermen. History The turtle was originally called Testudo rafcht by Guillaume-Antoine Olivier, who shot a three-foot-long specimen in June 1797 when crossing the Euphrates near AnahVoyageurs et explorateurs proven√ßaux, By Henri Barr√©, Michel Clerc, Paul Gaffarel, G. de Laget, H. Pellissier, Raymond Teisseire. Page 133. The Euphrates softshell turtle became known to the western science when the French naturalist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier shot a specimen while crossing the Euphrates near Anah in June 1797. The local residents told him that the meat of this animal was not good to eat, but its fat was considered an excellent medication for a variety of skin diseases. Olivier named the species Testudo rafcht, because, as he said \\"the Arabs called it rafcht\\".. See also plate 41 in the accompanying atlas. As Olivier wrote in French, his ch more or less corresponds to the English sh, or to ≈° used in the standard transcription of the Arabic. Olivier's book did not explain what the name meant in Arabic; however a number of modern Arabic web pages say that the turtle is known locally as al-raf≈° (ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸÅÿ¥), which is translated in standard dictionaries as \\"the spade\\" or \\"the shovel\\", and perhaps refers to the shape of the creature's carapace.E.g., the leaflet ÿ≥ŸÑÿ≠ŸÅÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸëÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ±ÿ≥ Rafetus euphraticuÿå ÿ£ÿ∫ÿ±ÿ® ÿ≥ŸÑÿßÿ≠ŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑŸà ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ£Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑ from the WME News web site, which also has an English version, Mesopotamian softshell turtle (Rafetus euphraticus), the strangest fresh water turtle of the Middle East. Al-raf≈°(ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸÅÿ¥) is also contained in a number of web page found by a Google search on \\"ÿ≥ŸÑÿ≠ŸÅÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ™\\", which is the Arabic for \\"Euphrates Turtle\\" (as seen in the above WME leaflet). Olivier passed the information about the creature to Fran√ßois Marie Daudin, who described it in his Histoire des reptiles (1801). Later naturalists apparently often misread Olivier's rafcht as rafeht.\\"Rafetus euphraticus\\" in: UWE FRITZ and PETER HAVA≈†, Checklist of Chelonians of the World , pp. 181-182. \\"Tyrse rafeht Gray (ex errore pro Testudo rafcht Olivier, 1807\\", etc.) The name Rafetus euphraticus, and the genus Rafetus itself, were proposed by John Edward Gray in 1864, who mentions in his work that the species had been variously known as Trionyx euphraticus, Testudo euphraticus, Trionyx rafeht, Tyrse rafeht, or Testudo rafeht.The Rafetus section (pp. 81-82) in: Gray, J. E., Revision of the species of Trionychidae found in Asia and Africa, with descriptions of some new species. Proc. Zool. Soc. London 1864, pp. 76-98 Appearance This freshwater turtle can weigh up to , and it has a smooth leathery shell that can reach up to in length. The sexes are apparently alike in size and general appearance. The upperparts are typically dull olive in colour, sometimes with an indistinct spotted pattern, especially on the head. There are some minor variations in the colour pattern, and rarely individuals may be dark brown or even black above. Habitat The Euphrates softshell turtle has been found in a wide range of freshwater habitats such as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and marshlands. It prefers areas with shallow and calm water, sandy banks and many fish (especially cyprinids). Although it mainly resides in shallow calm water, this is typically adjacent to deep fast-flowing water. In the fast-flowing Euphrates it generally avoids the main stem, instead occurring in side-branches or backwaters. In parts of the Tigris River with a slower flow, it occurs even in the main stem. They bask on or at the banks of rivers, with some remaining in shallow water to avoid being on land. They sometimes bury themselves into the bottom. Behavior The Euphrates softshell turtle is mainly active during the day, but some night-activity also occurs. In parts of its range it is infrequently seen during the winter, likely due to the lower temperature. =Feeding= Little is known about its feeding preference, but the species has generally been considered a carnivore. It is sometimes seen feeding on carcasses, is easily attracted by lowering a nylon bags filled with lamb blood into the water and fishermen often complain about it taking fish from their nets. However, it has also been caught on lines baited with watermelon, an individual defecated a partially digested tomato and local farmers claim their crops sometimes are eaten by the species. A fecal analysis of 30 individuals mostly revealed remains of crabs and plants, but also insects, birds, fish, river-bed material and debris, leading to the conclusion that the Euphrates softshell turtle is an opportunistic omnivore. =Breeding= Nesting in this species is seasonal, but exact timing depends on the region. The nest is dug by the female in a bank of a river and it can be up to deep. The site can be bare sand or a sand-soil mix with vegetation. In one case a nest was placed about from the water's edge, in a sand bank with an incline of almost 15¬∞. Each nest can contain up to 32 eggs. The eggs are white, and have a diameter of . When hatching the young have a carapace length of . In some regions a female may nest twice in a season. Adults and sub-adults often have claw or bite marks, indicating frequent aggression between individuals. Endangered status The Euphrates softshell turtle is an endangered species. The primary threats are habitat loss and alterations, but to lesser extent also pollution and killing by fishermen. A major threat is dams, which alter levels of sediment and water temperature, and may flood areas. For example, the population in the Halfeti region disappeared entirely following the construction of the Atat√ºrk Dam, possibly due to colder water, and once completed the Ilƒ±su Dam will flood some known nesting sites of the species. Numerous other dams are planned in the Euphrates-Tigris drainage. Nevertheless, there are indications that they are able to use nesting sites near human and are not particularly vulnerable to general disturbance. When basking on land they are very shy, retreating to water at the slightest hint of danger. It has been reported from man-made habitats such as reservoirs and artificial canals near cities. Despite its endangered status there are no specific conservations projects aimed at this species in most of its range, except one underway in Iran's Khuzestan Province.

Background  Wu Shaocheng was born in 750, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing), and his father served as an officer at Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). As a result of his father's service, Wu Shaocheng became a guard officer for an imperial prince. Later, on an occasion when he was in Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), the military governor (Jiedushi) Yu Zhun () was impressed by Wu and kept Wu as a guard commander at his headquarters.Old Book of Tang, vol. 145.As Yu's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that the chancellor Yang Yan sent Yu to Jingnan Circuit for the purpose of having him manufacture charges against Liu Yan, who had been sent to that circuit to be a prefect ‚Äî and Liu Yan was sent there and killed in 780, and Yu was soon recalled ‚Äî Yu's encounter with Wu must have occurred around that time. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 118 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 226. When Yu was subsequently recalled to the capital Chang'an, Wu followed him. As they went through Xiangyang, Wu saw that the military governor of the circuit headquartered at Xiangyang, Liang Chongyi of Shannan East Circuit (), was not following imperial orders, he secretly drafted strategies on defeating Liang and was planning on offering them to Emperor Dezong. He first offered them to general Li Xilie the military governor of Huaixi Circuit (Ê∑ÆË•ø, the same circuit that would later be renamed Zhangyi). Li Xilie favored them and offered them to Emperor Dezong as his own strategies, and Emperor Dezong put Li in charge of the operations against Liang in 781. Li made Wu his forward commander in the campaign against Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 227. After Li defeated Liang later in the year, leading to Liang's suicide, Wu was rewarded. When Li himself turned against the imperial government and declared himself emperor in 784, Wu continued to serve him. In 786, Li was assassinated by his officer Chen Xianqi, who submitted to imperial authority, and Emperor Dezong made Chen the military governor of Huaixi Circuit. Several months later, however, Wu, avenging Li, assassinated Chen. Emperor Dezong made his son Li Liang () the Prince of Qian the titular military governor, but did not send Li Liang to Huaixi, and made Wu the acting military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232.  Initial service as Jiedushi  During the brief duration that Chen Xianqi served as military governor, he had sent some 5,000 Huaixi troops to the western border of the empire to assist the defense of that border with Tufan. After Wu Shaochen assassinated Chen, he secretly ordered the commander of those troops, Wu Fachao (), to return to Huaixi. Wu Fachao thus mutinied in spring 787, took the troops, and headed back toward Huaixi without permission, and when the general commanding the operations against Tufan, Hun Jian, sent troops to intercept Wu Fachao, Wu Fachao defeated the troops he sent. However, as Wu Fachao went through Shan'guo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), he was crushed by the governor (Guanchashi, ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø) of Shan'guo, Li Mi, with only some 47 soldiers making it back to Huaixi. Wu Shaocheng, as he did not want to damage his relations with the imperial government over this small number of soldiers, executed them and pretended to know nothing of their mutiny. Wu Shaocheng was said to be an effective, diligent, frugal, and fair governor, but was not loyal to the imperial government. Later in 787, he strengthened the walls of Huaixi's capital Cai Prefecture (), intending to be ready to stand against any imperial attacks. Meanwhile, his secretary Zheng Chang () and officer Yang Ji () plotted to expel him and submit to the imperial government, and they had the scribe Liu She () forge a number of imperial edicts, addressed to various Huaixi officers, to try to get them join the plot. Thereafter, when an imperial eunuch messenger arrived at Cai Prefecture, Wu went out of the city to welcome the imperial messenger, and Zheng and Yang were set to carry out their plot. However, someone informed the plot to Wu, and Wu executed Zheng, Yang, and another official involved in the plot, Zhang Boyuan (). Two others, Song Min () and Cao Ji () fled to the imperial capital Chang'an. In 789, Emperor Dezong made him full military governor.New Book of Tang, vol. 214. In 793, when Liu Shi'ning () the military governor of nearby Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) was expelled by his soldiers, and his officer Li Wanrong () took over, Wu took his troops to the borders with Xuanwu and demanded an explanation. Li, however, sent back sarcastic replies, and Wu, judging himself to lack the strength to attack Xuanwu at the time, withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. In 797, without imperial permission, Wu was digging a new canal, Dao Canal (), that would divert from Ru River (Ê±ùÊ∞¥, flowing through modern Zhumadian), claiming that it would be beneficial to the farmers, and when Emperor Dezong sent eunuchs to stop him, he refused to stop. When Emperor Dezong thereafter sent the official Lu Qun () to dissuade him, Lu pointed out that if he openly defied an imperial order, he risked having his subordinates defy him as well. Wu thereafter stopped the Dao Canal project.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235.  Rebellion against Emperor Dezong  In 798, for reasons lost to history, Wu Shaocheng, whose circuit had been renamed Zhangyi by this point, sent troops to pillage Huoshan County (ÈúçÂ±±, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), belonging to Shou Prefecture (Â£ΩÂ∑û, in modern Lu'an) of Huai'nan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), killing Huoshan's defender Xie Xiang () and occupying Huoshan. In 799, he further attacked Tang Prefecture (ÂîêÂ∑û, in modern Zhumadian), belonging to Shannan East Circuit, killing its prefect Zhang Jiayu () and eunuch monitor Shao Guochao () and capturing over 1,000 residents. When Qu Huan () the military governor of Chenxu Circuit (Èô≥Ë®±, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) died in the fall that year, Wu further attacked Chenxu, putting its capital Xu Prefecture under siege, although his attacks were eventually repelled. (Wu had made a secret pact with then-military governor of Xuanwu, Liu Quanliang (), to attack Chenxu together and divide its territory, but Liu died around that time as well, and Liu's successor Han Hong refused to follow the pact and further sent troops to help the defense against Wu's attack.) In response, Emperor Dezong stripped Wu of all of his offices and ordered the circuits around his to attack him. Subsequently, Han, along with Yu Di the military governor of Shannan East Circuit, Yi Shen () the military governor of Anhuang Circuit (ÂÆâÈªÉ, headquartered in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), Chenxu's new military governor Shangguan Shui (), and Shou Prefecture's prefect Wang Zong (), attacked Wu together, initially enjoying some successes. However, as the imperial forces lacked a supreme commander, they did not coordinate their operations and did not look out for each other. Late in 799, for reasons unknown, the imperial forces suddenly collapsed themselves, abandoning their camp site at Little Yin River (Â∞èÊÆ∑Ê∞¥, flowing through Luohe, Henan), and Wu was able to take over their supplies after they abandoned their camp. After forces sent from Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Yiwu (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), Chenxu, and Heyang (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Luoyang, Henan) were also defeated by Wu in spring 800, Emperor Dezong commissioned Han Quanyi () the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (Â§èÁ∂è, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) as the overall commander of the forces against Wu. However, Han Quanyi was also unsuccessful against Wu and later in 800 was defeated at Wulou (‰∫îÊ®ì, in modern Zhumadian). After Wu withdrew back to Cai Prefecture in winter 800, Emperor Dezong, at the advice of the general Wei Gao and the chancellor Jia Dan, considered pardoning Wu. Wu also sent letters to nearby imperial eunuch messengers, requesting exoneration. Emperor Dezong thus pardoned Wu and his soldiers, restoring them to their titles. It was said that Wu, meanwhile, strengthened the resolve of the people of Zhangyi against imperial forces by showing them letters addressed to Han Quanyi that he captured in the Battle of Wulou, falsely claiming that those were requests by imperial officials requesting Han to pillage Zhangyi and seizing women to serve as the officials' concubines. He further had his soldiers' armors be inscribed with magical writing intended to curse the imperial troops.  Resubmission to Tang rule  In 805, Emperor Dezong's son Emperor Shunzong gave Wu Shaocheng the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. When Wu Shaocheng was at Weibo, he had a close relationship with a Weibo officer named Wu Shaoyang.Wu Shaocheng's and Wu Shaoyang's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang appeared to imply an intimate relationship, but do not explicitly state so. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 145 and New Book of Tang, vol. 214. Sometime after he became military governor, he sent gold and silk to Weibo Circuit, requesting that he be allowed to have Wu Shaoyang. Weibo allowed Wu Shaoyang to report to Zhangyi. Wu Shaocheng claimed that Wu Shaoyang was a cousin, and gave him various commissions; Wu Shaoyang was also given access to Wu Shaocheng's mansion. Still, because Wu Shaocheng was cruel and suspicious, Wu Shaoyang requested a position not at headquarters, and Wu Shaocheng made him the prefect of Shen Prefecture (Áî≥Â∑û, in modern Xinyang, Henan). It was said that because Wu Shaoyang was lenient, he became favored by the army. When Wu Shaocheng grew ill in 809 and fell unconscious, his servant Xianyu Xiong'er () forged an order in Wu Shaocheng's name recalling Wu Shaoyang to serve as deputy military governor. Wu Shaoyang put Wu Shaocheng's son Wu Yuanqing () to death and took over the circuit. After Wu Shaocheng died around the new year 810, Wu Shaoyang claimed the title of acting military governor, which was eventually recognized by Emperor Shunzong's son Emperor Xianzong later in 810.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238.

It was directed by Robert Florey and starred Dennis Morgan, Irene Manning and Bruce Cabot. It is based on the 1926 operetta with music by Sigmund Romberg. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Charles Novi, Jack McConaghy). This film version of the operetta was, like the 1929 film version, almost never seen after its original release due to Pre-Code content and copyright issues, which made the film hard to find or view. In 2014, it was remastered, restored and released on DVD by Warner Brothers. The film is more sophisticated technically than the earlier film due to its large budget and advances in both sound and color. This is the first film version to be made in full three-strip Technicolor. It tries to make the operetta topical in terms of World War II, by having the outlaw hero with a dual identity fight the Nazis as well as the Riffs. As in the 1953 film, the hero's name is changed to El Khobar, rather than the Red Shadow. The 1943 Desert Song is perhaps the only instance in which a stage operetta of the 1920s has been updated to reflect topical concerns of the 1940s. In fact, the United States Office of War Information held up release of the film for a year because of the shifting political positions of Vichy France. It did well at the box office nonetheless, and was Warner Brothers' highest grossing film of the year.You Must Remember This: the Warner Brothers story, Richard Schickel and George Perry, pg. 161 Cast * Dennis Morgan as Paul Hudson/El Khobar * Irene Manning as Margot * Bruce Cabot as Col.

While the overall architectural structure is loosely Romanesque Revival, in the absence of any appropriate Celtic models, the lavish decoration in terracotta relief carving and paintings is Celtic Revival, here seen on an unusually large scale. According to the local council, it is \\"a unique concoction of art nouveau, Celtic, Romanesque and Egyptian influence with Mary's own original style\\". Other responses have been less positive. Ian Nairn, in the 1971 Surrey volume of the Buildings of England series, described the interior as \\"one of the most soporific rooms in England\\" and regretted \\"the intolerable torpor and weariness of the motifs\\". It is a Grade I listed building. History When Compton Parish Council created a new cemetery, local resident artist Mary Fraser-Tytler, the wife of Victorian era painter and sculptor George Frederic Watts, offered to design and build a new mortuary chapel. The Wattses had recently build a house, \\"Limnerslease\\", a few hundred yards away, now part of the Watts Gallery. Tytler was a follower of the Home Arts and Industries Association, set up by Earl Brownlow in 1885 to encourage handicrafts among the lower classes, and the chapel was the Wattses' contribution to this characteristically Victorian preoccupation with social improvement through creative enlightenment. A group of local amateurs and enthusiasts, many of whom later went on with Mary Fraser-Tytler to found the Compton Potters' Arts Guild, constructed the chapel from 1896 to 1898; virtually every village resident was involved. The ground plan is essentially circular; from the outside the building has the look of a Roman Italianate chapel. Local villagers were invited to decorate the chapel under Mary's guidance, resulting in an interior that fuses art nouveau and Celtic influences, combined with Mary's own original style. Each member of Fraser- Tytler's evening class, led by Louis Deuchars, had a separate job, with 74 Compton villagers taking part. G.F. Watts paid for the project and also painted a version of The All-Pervading for the altar only three months before he died. The graves display sayings influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, including \\"The Morning Stars Sang Together\\" and, inside the chapel, \\"Their hope is full of immortality but the souls of the righteous are in the hands of God.\\" Both Watts have memorials in the \\"cloister\\" a few yards from the chapel, and a number of the memorials throughout the small cemetery use unglazed terracotta, even from dates after the Compton Pottery closed in the 1950s. Members of the Huxley family, including Julia Huxley and her son Aldous Huxley, are buried within the cemetery. The chapel is open Monday to Friday: 8am ‚Äì 5pm, Saturday to Sunday and bank holidays: 10am ‚Äì 5:30pm and is managed by the nearby Watts Gallery, celebrating the architect and her husband. There is no charge.

Life Pack was born in Manhattan on September 21, 1918. He attended Columbia University, graduating in 1939 with a degree in economics. Pack went into business with his father, who was a furrier. Pack served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II. After his military service, he came back to the family business where he met Joseph Kahn, who also worked in the fur business.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Howard M. Pack, Shipping Magnate, Dies at 90\\", The New York Times, December 18, 2008. Accessed December 19, 2008. Pack and Kahn formed Transeastern Associates in the early 1950s with the purchase of a Liberty ship. By 1965, Transeastern controlled 36 ships, most sailing under the United States flag, including the , a 108,400-ton tanker that was then the largest craft under the US flag. Transeastern used the Manhattan as a bulk carrier, loading it with such cargoes as 101,000 tons of wheat sent to Pakistan.Horne, George. \\"An Innovator Buys Seatrain Lines; Transeastern Begun By a Furrier With a Liberty Ship\\", The New York Times, May 30, 1965. Accessed December 19, 2008. Through Transeastern Associates, Pack and Kahn bought Seatrain Lines in 1965 for $8.5 million. The firm, which had been established in 1931, had six ships in its fleet that it used to carry loaded railroad boxcars between ports, rather than the then-industry standard of loading cargo into the hold of ships using nets, cranes and many longshoremen. At the time of their purchase, Seatrain operated between New York and ports in Savannah, Georgia, Texas City, Texas, New Orleans and Puerto Rico. Transeastern was folded into Seatrain in September 1966; At the time Seatrain had lost more than $500,000 in a four-month period before the merger, while Transeastern's fleet had netted nearly $7 million in a ten-month period.Bamberger, Werner. \\"SEA CARRIER LINES IN CONSOLIDATION; Transeastern Is Absorbed by Seatrain, Ex-Subsidiary\\", The New York Times, September 9, 1966. Accessed December 19, 2008. Under their management, Seatrain purchased ships that could carry shipping containers, which could be transferred between ships and trucks or trains, making them one of the earliest in the industry to make this conversion. Pack and Kahn expanded the business into shipbuilding, using facilities at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Additionally, the firm established a large international container shipping division headquartered in Weehawken, New Jersey. By the 1970s, the firm had 4,000 employees and was earning $250 million annually, but was hurt by the 1973 oil crisis, dockworker strikes and overbuilding in the shipping industry. By 1981, the firm was shut down. A resident of Scarsdale, New York, Pack died at age 90 on December 9, 2008 due to heart failure.

Thacher Island is a small island off Cape Ann on the Massachusetts coast in the United States. It is a part of the Town of Rockport. It was a place where some naval confrontations, both minor and major, took place, which helped secure a victory for the colonists.\\"Dogtown: Location, History, and Legend.\\" http://myweb.northshore.edu/users/ccarlsen/poetry/gloucester/dogtownhistory.html (accessed 04/11/2008). History The island, named after Anthony Thacher, is located in perilous waters, where there have been many shipwrecks. With the large number of shipwrecks around this area, there was a petition sent from sea captains to erect a light on the island. On April 22, 1771, the provincial government authorized construction of two lighthouses on the island. The lights went on December 21, 1771.Babson, p. 11 Although these lights were valuable assistance for the fishermen and sailors of the sea, there was a strong feeling among the townspeople that the lighthouse was helping the British fleet more than it was helping the Patriot cause. This feeling increased after hostilities erupted with the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the Battle of Bunker Hill.Harry L. Walen, \\"The Role of Thacher's Island in the American Revolutionary War\\" (2006), http://www.founderspatriots.org/articles/thachers_island.htm (accessed 04/11/2008). Early in July 1775, Dr. Samuel Rogers of Gloucester led his company of minutemen to the island. There they destroyed the lights, and brought the keeper, one Captain Kirkwood, his family, and his assistants back to the mainland. Both lights were rebuilt and lit in 1861. They are located 900 feet apart and are 124 feet high. In 1967, Joseph Barboza spent a notable period on Thacher Island as part of the Witness Protection Program. The Thacher Island National Wildlife Refuge occupies the northern part of the island.  Film  A film adaptation of Casey Sherman‚Äôs 2013 bestselling book ‚ÄúAnimal‚Äù was announced in August 2018, with the title Thacher Island. It is being developed by Fox 2000 and produced by Berlanti Productions. The writing team behind the film BlacKkKlansman, David Rabinowitz and Charlie Wachtel, has been hired to pen the adaptation. The film will tell the story of notorious Boston hitman Joe Barboza, who agreed to testify against the New England mob in 1967, becoming the first person in American history to be put into a witness protection program. As part of the program, Barboza and his family were transported to Thacher Island, where they would be stationed under the protection of US marshals until the date of the trial.

cabinet minister, in the House of Representatives of Thailand. After the 2008 political crisis and Constitutional Court decision, these MPs defected from the People's Power Party (PPP) to the Bhumjaithai Party.http://www.politicalbase.in.th/index.php/‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏û‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ô The Friends of Newin Group was formed as a faction of the PPP in after the 2007 election in which the pro-Thaksin People's Power Party under Samak Sundaravej won the plurality of seats in the National Assembly. The faction had the highest number of PPP MPs. After the indictment and resignation of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej in September 2008, Somchai Wongsawat gained the faction's votes, and the group voted for Somchai for Prime Minister. Somchai had to resign as the Constitutional court dissolved the People's Power Party and two other coalition partners for election fraud on December 2, 2008. The Friends of Newin Group's MPs were given 60 days to register to a new party or to join an existing one. On 9 December 2008, the group's leader Newin Chidchob caused a breakthrough in Thai politics by announcing his support for Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, of the party that was in opposition to the PPP-led government, as the next Prime Minister of Thailand. He assured Abhisit and Suthep Thaugsuban (General Secretary of the Democrat Party) that he and his group would vote for Abhisit for Prime Minister, thereby crossing the aisle. It is alleged that Army commander and co-leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, coerced the MPs of the Friends of Newin Group to endorse a Democrat Party-led coalition, which would secure enough parliamentary votes to allow Abhisit to be elected Prime Ministerhttp://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/read.php?newsid=30090698&keyword;=newin+aBHISIThttp://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/read.php?newsid=30090340&keyword;=friends+of+newin On December 13, Thaksin Shinawatra, Newin's former boss and benefactor, in a recorded message played at a National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (or UDD) rally, blasted the group as 'traitors and betrayers of the people.'http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/read.php?newsid=30090906&keyword;=friends+of+newinhttp://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/read.php?newsid=30090698&keyword;=newin+aBHISIT On December 15, 235 MPs in the House of Representatives voted for Abhisit versus 198 votes for Pracha Promnok endorsed by the pro-Thaksin party, Pheu Thai Party.

The film stars Ginger Rogers as a magazine editor, who although successful, finds herself on the edge of a breakdown while juggling her feelings for three prospective suitors, played by Ray Milland, Warner Baxter, and Jon Hall. Paramount won the screen rights to the play in February 1941, after a bidding war with Columbia, Warner Bros., and Howard Hughes. The studio initially purchased the play as a vehicle to reunite Rogers with Fred Astaire. However, after negotiations with Astaire failed, the studio cast Milland, who had recently starred with Rogers in Paramount's The Major and the Minor. The film was first released on February 10, 1944, and was a critical and commercial success. It was nominated for three Academy Awards; for Best Cinematography, Best Music, and Best Art Direction (Hans Dreier, Raoul Pene Du Bois, Ray Moyer). Plot Liza Elliott (Ginger Rogers) is the successful editor-in-chief of fashion magazine Allure, being published by Kendall Nesbitt (Warner Baxter). Elliott is a no-nonsense workaholic, who is involved in a relationship with Nesbitt. And while the two wish to marry, they cannot, as Kendall's estranged wife has refused to grant a divorce. Liza has recently developed a series of headaches and strange, bad dreams. On top of all this, she is having to deal at work with marketing manager Charley Johnson (Ray Milland), who annoys her greatly and takes pride in doing so. She reluctantly sees and undergoes psychoanalysis with Dr. Alex Brooks, who suggests that her no-nonsense approach to life is caused by something from her past, which has made her avoid all attempts at ever being as glamorous as the models in her magazine. Liza discounts this theory, and after Kendall announces his wife has finally agreed to a divorce, she dreams of a wedding to him where she is chased to the top of a large wedding cake where Charley questions whether she wishes to marry him. Movie star Randy Curtis (Jon Hall) comes to the Allure offices for a photo shoot, where he corners her into accepting a dinner date with him. Anxious about the date, Liza intends to break it off, and storms out of Dr. Brooks' office when he suggests she is anxious because she is afraid to compete with other women. Charley also informs Liza he will be leaving Allure for another magazine, who has offered more creative rein to him. Kendall confronts Liza about her fears, and she breaks down and confesses she is confused. To try and sort out her feelings, and aware Curtis does not care about her looks, Liza goes on her date with Curtis, changing into a beautiful dress for a change. The date is ruined when they bump into Charley and his date, who aggressively goes after Randy. She goes home, and hallucinates that she is put on trial by Kendall and Charley at a circus (based on a cover earlier designed by Charley). After singing about her troubles, she dreams of her father yelling at her for dressing glamorously. In her story to Dr. Brooks, she tells him of this, and possibly the reason for her devotion to a plain style: following her mother's passing as a young girl, she tried to make him happy by wearing one of her late mother's glamorous dresses, but was instead scolded, and she became detached from him; another incident happened after her high school graduation, where she went to a dance with a boy she liked, who was stolen away by another girl. Dr. Brooks concludes these incidents contributed to her current life, and suggests she allow herself to open herself to her childhood desires. With this new knowledge, Liza decides to quit her job at the magazine and break off her relationship with Kendall, who agrees bitterweetly. Liza is disappointed to find out Curtis was only courting her to be the head of a new production company he has formed. However, when Charley comes to say good-bye to her, Liza realizes that she loves Charley ‚Äì the last person she ever expected to. She proposes to promote him to run the magazine alongside her, and after arguing over fonts, the two share a passionate kiss.

Part of \\"My Ship\\" was hummed by Ginger Rogers, but the song itself was never sung. Radio adaptation \\"Lady in the Dark\\", adapted from the 1944 movie, was broadcast on BBC Home Service, August 14, 1944 (and repeated on September 18, 1944). The radio adaptation was by Rhoderick Walker and produced by Tom Ronald.

It is owned by Mitsui Fudosan. It is one of the ten tallest buildings in Tokyo, and was the tallest building in Tokyo and Japan from September 1974 to March 1978, when Sunshine 60 was completed. It was built in the style of high-rise buildings that were being built in the United States in the 1970s. It is notable for the black diagonal braces on its east and west facades. At the base of the skyscraper is a sunken garden and a surprisingly large plaza. In addition to the sunken garden, there is also a roof-top garden. With its black facades, Shinjuku Mitsui Building stands out among the skyscrapers in Shinjuku. It is located next to the Shinjuku Center Building, which is two meters lower but appears to be taller because its first floor is located on higher ground. It made an appearance in the 1984 film The Return of Godzilla. Structure X-shaped braces on west side The building's height is 212 meters to the top of the roof, and 225 meters to the architectural top. Its entrance lobby is on the second floor. The X-shaped steel braces on the side of the building serve as seismic reinforcement and also as braces for the doors of the machine rooms at each end of every floor. The doors are 4‚Äì5 floors tall, for replacement of equipment such as air-conditioners. As in the older Keio Plaza Hotel, some fire escape exits are exposed outside the building to prevent smoke from accumulating in the case of fire. In 2013, Mitsui Fudosan and Kajima Corporation began installing six massive pendulums on the roof of the building to counter long-period earthquake ground motion. The pendulums will reduce magnitude of building motion by half or more during a major earthquake, such as the Great East Japan earthquake of 2011.

The last reported sightings were in 1924, and the species is believed to be extinct. It was a subspecies of the white-browed crake.  Description  The Iwo Jima rail was coloured dark brown, with black mottles on its back, and a white colouration on its belly. The bird was typically about six inches long.  Ecology  The species cinereus was typically found in both brackish water and fresh water marshes. Iwo Jima, however, lacked these features, and the Iwo Jima subspecies lived in the brush and tall grass along rivulets on the island, as well as damp places within the original forest cover.  Extinction  When humans settled the island of Iwo Jima, they cleared away the existing forest to grow sugarcane. The forest clearance reduced the availability of fresh water, which forced the bird to come into the settlements to find water during the dry season. Here the birds often fell pray to cats. Combined with the introduction of rats to the island, this caused the extinction of the bird. The last specimen of the bird was collected in 1911, and the last reported sightings were by T. T. Moniyama in 1924.

Spring 1943 Under Henry's guidance, the company expanded from a regional business to a studio of national and international renown, with completed projects in all fifty states and fourteen foreign countries.Pazulski, Kristin. \\"Local stained glass firm continues 108-year tradition of craftsmanship\\". Chestnut Hill Local. 9 Nov. 2006 Under Henry Lee's guidance, the studio experimented with new techniques, and in the 1950s, was one of the first American studios to design and fabricate faceted glass windows. Willet Studios also developed the famous sculptured gold window technique and experimented with various methods of laminating stained glass, a technique known as Farbigem.\\"Stained Glass Artist Henry Lee Willet.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 1983. In 1971, the Franklin Institute awarded Henry Lee Willet the Frank P. Brown Medal. In 1965, E. Crosby Willet, the son of Henry Lee Willet, became the third generation president of Willet Studios. Under his leadership, Willet windows were created for many of the major churches and cathedrals in the United States including the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. and the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in San Francisco. = Hauser Art Glass Company = The Hauser Art Glass Company, another long-standing American stained glass studio, was founded in 1946 by James E. Hauser in Winona, Minnesota. It was originally opened as a repair and restoration studio, focused on serving small, remote churches, after Hauser recognized an opportunity to aid many American churches whose stained glass windows had fallen into neglect and disrepair during the Second World War. As the firm's projects became larger and more complex, a number of glass artists specializing in the replication of different design styles joined the studio. The firm eventually began creating moderately priced windows for neighborhood churches as well as windows for hotels, restaurants, and private homes. However, its main specialty remained the repair and restoration of existing stained glass, including those by Connick Studios, Tiffany Studios, John La Farge, Henry Wynd Young, Franz Mayer of Munich, and Innsbruck Studios. = Associated Crafts = In 1973, John Phillips Sr. was living in Pennsylvania and started to work for Hauser Art Glass Co in Winona as a national salesman. In 1980, three years after Hauser merged with Pittsburgh-based Willet Studios to become Willet Hauser Architectural Glass, Phillips Sr. left on friendly terms to start his own stained glass studio in Pennsylvania, in which his son John Phillips Jr. started to work. After 10 years, Phillips Sr. sold the business. John Phillips Jr. and his wife Mary founded the Arizona-based stained-glass business Associated Crafts in 1997. Some of their work including sub-contracting work for Willet Hauser. The business grew rapidly as a national stained glass studio and in Jan 2014, Associated Crafts acquired Willet Hauser Architectural Glass, Inc. combining to become one of the notable global forces in stained glass.Associated Crafts and Willet Hauser. \\"Willet Hauser purchased by competitor with family connection\\". Winona Daily News. 26 Jan, 2014  Innovations  In the 1960s, when the industry began a movement toward contemporary design, Henry and Crosby Willet experimented in new styles and techniques including faceted glass, Farbigem (laminated glass), sculptured gold, mosaics, and sandcarving or sandblasting.Waggoner, Shawn. \\"Crosby Willet and Willet Stained Glass Studios: Three Generations of Glass for the Ages.\\" Glass Art, Jan/Feb 2003:57 = Farbigem = The Willet Studio introduced the Dutch technique of Farbigem to the United States in 1966, after a visit to the Amsterdam glass factory known as Glas-Industrie Van Tetterode. Research and development was carried out at the studio from 1967 into the 1980s. In the process of Farbigem a base plate is made by sandwiching plexiglass between two layers of glass. On this surface, layer upon layer of glass can be built up in all different directions. Designs can be traditional or abstract. The pieces are held together by a crystal clear, flexible adhesive that was developed in the Netherlands which allowed the glass to naturally expand and contract. Entire walls could be designed in decorative thicknesses of glass. The farbigem technique eventually fell out of favor due to the deficient technology of the adhesive which, with time, allowed the multiple layers of glass to separate. Changes in aesthetic taste also contributed to its decline. Today, windows similar to the farbigem technique are fabricated in stained glass studios under the name \\"Laminated Glass\\". = Sculptured gold windows = Henry Willet created the first sculptured gold window between 1948‚Äì49. When first devised, the sculptured gold overlay was based on leaded stained glass windows. Later, faceted glass set in epoxy resin was used. These glasses, about an inch in thickness, but possibly up to two inches for special effects, contribute great brilliance of color under transmitted daylight. The sheet lead overlay is formed in relief by repousse (literally \\"beaten up from the underside\\") to give a sculptured effect, and is also incised with slits of varying widths to let the richly colored glass background shine through in the daytime. The fact that the sculptured lead surface has been \\"flown\\" with 23 carat gold leaf is the secret of the brilliant metallic night effect. The appearance of silver can also be obtained by the use of palladium leaf, which does not tarnish. The first gold window installed in a church, known as the Glory Window, was designed by Henry Lee Willet and Marguerite Gaudin in 1951 for Westwood Community Church in Los Angeles, California.  Notable commissions  Cadet Chapel = Sanctuary Window, Graduate Chapel, West Point, New YorkIn 1910, William Willet was invited to compete for the design and installation of the Great Sanctuary Window in the West Point Cadet Chapel at the United States Military Academy. Ten other designers, including Nicola D'Ascenzo and Tiffany Studios joined Willet in this international competition.Farnsworth, Jean M. Stained Glass in Catholic Philadelphia. Philadelphia: Saint Joseph's University Press, 2002. In 1911, the studio was granted the commission of the Sanctuary window, a memorial to the graduates of the Military Academy.Pappas, George S. The Cadet Chapel: United States Military Academy. West Point, New York: U.S.M.A., 1987. The project for the design and fabrication of the Nave and North windows was awarded to the Willet Studio. The master plan for the nave windows, which were sponsored by individual classes in the hopes that every class would eventually be represented, was devised by Bertram Goodhue, William Willet, Colonel C.W. Larned and Chaplain Edward S. Travers. The window program depicts familiar stories of the Old and New Testament, as well as stories of saints from the early church. The north window, also designed and fabricated by the studio, is a memorial to the alumni who died in World War I. The commission, which spanned three generations of Willets over a period of sixty-six years, remains the longest continuing commission in American history.Parente, Leigh Anne. \\"The St. Martin's Commission. The Willet Stained Glass Studio's Largest Commission (Yet).\\" The Stained Glass Quarterly 101:4 (2006):278. = Grace Episcopal Cathedral, San Francisco, California = In 1965, the studio completed six leaded stained glass windows for Grace Episcopal Church in San Francisco, California.

Harrison modeled the building after the Kaiser Wilhelm Tower in Berlin, Germany - a faceted glass tower composed of deep blue faceted glass. Harrison's cornerless serpentine shaped Hall of Science is made up of 5,400 coffers, each wide and tall. The Willet Studio, under Henry Lee Willet's guidance, was commissioned to construct the 5,400 panels that form the walls in less than one years time.Waggoner, Shawn. \\"Crosby Willet and Willet Stained Glass Sudios: Three Generations of Glass for the Ages.\\" Glass Art, Jan/Feb 2003:58 Each panel is composed of thick chunks of blue faceted glass held together by cement. Twenty to 30 different shades of blue glass, imported from France and the Blenko Glass Company of Milton, West Virginia, were used in the project. The blue light, which engulfs the interior, symbolizes the heavens and carries out the theme, \\"Rendezvous in Space.\\"Long, Tania. \\"Hall of Science Studies Lighting.\\" The New York Times, 7 Oct. 1964. = Metropolitan Transportation Authority = Arts for Transit is a program of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City that encourages the use of public transit by presenting visual and performing arts projects in subway and commuter rail stations. As a part of the overall project, neighborhood artists working in various media are invited to compete for projects in nearby stations. In 1998 Willet Hauser was selected to fabricate faceted stained glass panels based on the winning designs of many of these artists. The project is one of the largest projects in the studio's history. = Saint Martin‚Äôs Episcopal Church, Houston, Texas = In 2001, the studio received the monumental commission to design and create the entire stained glass fenestration for St. Martin‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas. The 36 window project, completed in May 2004, is the studio‚Äôs largest-ever one-time commission. Over 100,000 individual pieces of hand-cut glass make up the clerestory windows alone. The church‚Äôs Rev. Gibson, remarking on the coloration of the different blues within The Great Commission window, compared the work to Chartres stained glass: ‚Äú...the bluest window I have ever seen, next to the Jesse Tree window in Chartres.‚ÄùParente, L.

Stature Similkameen Falls actually resembles a major series of rapids more than a waterfall. Over a stretch of about 0.2 km, the river drops about 25 feet at the bottom of a canyon. Huge walls of igneous rock, some about 250 feet high, rise above the falls on both sides. The first drop of the falls is a small but powerful chute. No more than 3 feet wide, the entire river is forced through it, so it is fairly powerful. At the end of the chute, the river plunges powerfully into a deep pool in a punchbowl form. Remains of an old bridge that used to cross the river directly above the first drop are evident when one looks at that portion of the falls. After exiting the deep pool the first drop plunges into, the falls continue on as a consistent series of major rapids. There are no less than three spots where the river is forced into chaotic state, often as a result of boulders and other rock breaking off the cliffs above and falling into the river. The rapids do not go on for long though, as the river soon emerges from the other end of the canyon where it once again resumes a much calmer state. Access Although only the bottom half of the falls can be seen, quick but good glimpses of the falls can be had for people driving down the section of the highway pictured here. The bottom portions of the falls can be seen quite easily by looking upstream into the canyon from Highway 3.Google Images: Similkameen Falls from Highway 3 The uppermost portions are hidden from that point since the falls bend about 45 degrees shortly below the first drop, and as a result can only be viewed from the edge of the canyon on the north side of the river.

All fruits from the Citranae subtribe, subfamily Aurantioideae, and family Rutaceae have juice vesicles. The vesicles contain the juice of the fruit and appear shiny and baglike. Vesicles come in two shapes: the superior and inferior, and these are distinct. Citrus fruit with more vesicles generally weighs more than those with fewer vesicles. Fruits with many segments, such as the grapefruit or pomelo, have more vesicles per segment than fruits with fewer segments, such as the kumquat and mandarin. Each vesicle in a segment in citrus fruits has approximately the same shape, size, and weight. About 5% of the weight of an average orange is made up of the membranes of the juice vesicles. A single juice vesicle of a grapefruit.Juice vesicles of the endocarp contain the components that provide the aroma typically associated with citrus fruit. These components are also found in the flavedo oil sacs. The vesicles and their inner juices contain many vitamins and minerals as well as the taste and sweet acid fragrance. Pulp cells often have thin membranes, and they are less regular in shape than other plant cells. They are also very large and protect the seeds of the fruit. The color of the pulp is variable, depending on the species and the ripening stage. Usually, it has the color of the outer peel (exocarp). orange that has been opened to show its pulp.  Extraction and Preservation  Juice vesicles hold a lot of juice that can be recovered through various extraction processes. The pulp is usually removed from the juice by filtering it out. The juiciness of the pulp depends on the species, variety, season, and the tree on which it grew. Close to 90% of the citrus fruit juice solids are recovered with extractors. Pectic enzymes can sometimes be added to lessen the thickness of these solids. The juice along with these solids can be combined to increase primary juice yields or sold as bases for fruit beverages. The juice solids become opaque from the pulp washing process, resulting in a less expensive source of fruit solids for food labeling in comparison to regular juice. The juice solids can also be pasteurized, dried, and sold, but appear dark brown in color if they have not been washed properly before drying. The solids can also be stored frozen or sold to beverage manufacturers. They provide fruit beverages that are sold with a higher appeal to a consumer and improved texture in the juice. These opaque juice solids are known as cloud. Drum drying or freezing are two processes for preserving juice solids. When product enzymes are deactivated through heat stabilization, they are frozen. Light and air are used for drum-drying, but this process often decreases the flavor and color of the solids.  Use  Juice vesicles of a finger lime. One of the main uses for juice vesicles is for added substance to animal feed. Residue from juice vesicle extraction, once dried, can be added to cattle feed. Cattle feed often contains citrus pulp. This pulp helps in the long term to preserve nutrition, improve color, and create a more pleasant odor to the feed. Adding juice pulp provides cattle with a richer source of vitamins and minerals in addition to a more palatable taste. The green fodder used for cattle can be supplemented with this feed containing juice vesicles. The other common use for juice vesicles is for enhancing beverages or creating inexpensive beverage bases. Jams and jellies, pulp in juice-based drinks, whole juices, and yogurt products contain extracted juice vesicle residue that was also dried. Some juices, juice concentrates, and drinks containing juice also contain previously-frozen juice vesicles. The cloud resulting from the vesicles have sugar solids containing vitamin C. This cloud from vesicles is a popular alternative to brominated vegetable oil or glycerol ester of wood rosin, which are other clouding agents. The citrus in the vesicles is more often used for cloud especially for shipping products overseas. In Japan, many yogurts and beverages include added enlarged citrus juice vesicles. These vesicles combined with enzymes are removed from fruit. This results from the heat of the enzymes. When eaten, teeth break the vesicles and provide a fresh squirt of citrus juice to the beverage or yogurt which can create a pleasurable drinking or eating experience.

The opposite is offensive patent aggregation (OPA) which is the purchasing of patents in order to assert them against companies that would use the inventions protected by such patents (operating companies) and to grant licenses to these operating companies in return for licensing fees or royalties. OPA can be practiced by operating companies or Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs) Operating companies must often defend themselves against claims of patent infringement. To prevent such litigations, operating companies sometimes purchase patents in technologies which they use or develop. Another motivation for operating companies to acquire patents is the ability to counter-assert such patents in case another operating company files a patent litigation. Operating companies have also pooled their efforts and financial resources to purchase patents. An example of such defensive patent aggregation is Allied Security Trust (AST). In 2008, a new business model emerged with third-party financing doing defensive patent aggregation whereby a third-party ‚Äì the aggregator ‚Äì purchases the patents or patent rights strictly to mitigate the risk and cost of litigation associated with non-practising entities (NPEs) and provides licenses to members against a fixed annual membership fee. This model was introduced by RPX Corporation, a start-up based in San Francisco. RPX received venture funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) and Charles River Ventures (CRV). Rationale In the United States, the cost of defending against a patent infringement suit, as of 2004, is typically $1 million or more before trial, and $4 million or more for a complete defense, even if successful. And, when non-litigation licensing and settlements are factored in, the actual costs of fighting patent lawsuits is much higher. Because the costs and risks are high, defendants may settle even non-meritorious suits they consider frivolous for several hundred thousand dollars. The uncertainty and unpredictability of the outcome of jury trials also encourages settlement. In the first 10 months of 2008, more than 2,300 patent lawsuits were filed the United States.Prof. Paul Janicke, University of Houston Law Center. The majority of these cases are filed by the companies that created the patented invention. But a growing share of the lawsuits is coming from non-practicing entities (NPEs) ‚Äì also called patent trolls ‚Äì which acquire patents for the sole purpose of licensing and asserting their patent rights. In fact, NPE litigation grew from 2.6 percent of filed cases in 2000 to 16.6 percent of filed cases in 2007. And unlike product companies, known as operating companies in the IP commerce world, NPEs are not susceptible to counter-assertion by their licensing targets because they do not make or sell any products or services. The NPE offense includes single inventor assertion firms, patent licensing and enforcement companies, litigation financiers and investors, and patent aggregators, both institutional and strategic. However, NPE offense is ultimately concentrated on asserting patents to the detriment of operating companies. NPE defense methods include defensive patent aggregation from companies including RPX Corporation, cooperative purchasing efforts, such as defensive patent pools and buying consortia, from companies including Allied Security Trust, outright purchasing of patents, settlement and litigation.

The cities mainly affected by the war were Copenhagen in Denmark, Helsinki in Finland, Oslo in Norway, and Helsingborg and Malm√∂ in Sweden. BackgroundThe Copenhagen MC War (1983‚Äì85)= On 30 December 1980, the then \\"United MC\\" was appointed the first Hells Angels (HA) chapter in Scandinavia. Their long-standing opponents \\"Filthy Few\\" were not keen to accept the new chapter at any level. Along with several members of other Copenhagen MC-clubs they formed the hard anti-Hells Angels MC-crew known as Bullshit MC. They settled at Christiania, benefited from the cannabis trade there, and, in September 1983, paid a visit to a well-known Hells Angels pub. This visit instigated a bloodbath that would last for the following two years and four months. The result of this first Scandinavian MC-war was the murder of eight Bullshit members (including three presidents), one Hells Angels member, and two innocent people. In addition, Bullshit MC members were also prime suspects for the murder of two non-bikers during the war. When the police visited the former club house of Bullshit in 1986, they also found the corpse of a man beneath the clubhouse floor.TV-series \\"24 timer vi aldrig glemmer\\" (24 hours we'll never forget), episode \\"Mordet p√• Makrellen\\" (The murder of \\"The Mackerel\\") \\"Makrellen\\" (Henning Norbert Knudsen) was the first Bullshit president, hence the programme focused on his murder, but also on the entire MC-war. Broadcast on DR2 on 2 August 2012. This bikie war had a significant presence not only in the Danish media but also in southern Sweden. The first war was limited to Copenhagen alone, unlike the second, and the number of deaths during the Copenhagen war met or exceeded the number of deaths in the following war. Unlike the second war, the first had a clear winner and no \\"peace treaty\\" was required. =The second MC War in Scandinavia= In 1984 Morticians MC was formed and by the early 1990s, there were many motorcycle clubs across Scandinavia. In 1992, the Morticians and Hells Angels, who had been on good terms until then, became rivals as both clubs transformed from bike enthusiasts into criminal organizations. The Morticians then changed their name to Undertakers MC and became allies of the Bandidos, whose only European chapter was based in Marseille, France at that point. In 1993, the Undertakers merged with the Bandidos to become Bandidos MC Denmark. In 1994 the Hells Angels tried to prevent Morbids MC from growing into an established biker gang and potential rival in Sweden. The Morbids then joined an alliance with the Bandidos, who backed-up their prospect club. Outlaws MC also joined with the Bandidos in Norway. Police and prosecutors described the conflict as a drug-trade war between the two most powerful outlaw biker gangs in Scandinavia, the Hells Angels and the Bandidos, a \\"deadly game\\" to prove \\"who's the toughest\\". Many of the port cities in Scandinavia, particularly Copenhagen, were used to smuggle drugs in from Spain and the Netherlands. However, the criminologist Joi Bay criticised this assumption, saying that the police tactics were ineffective because they were based on the incorrect premise that the motivation of the bikers was profit, while in fact they were driven by values such as honor, style, respect, and brotherhood, and any drug crimes were incidental. In retrospective interviews in 2014, involved bikers rejected the drug-trade war interpretation and said the war started from a purely personal confrontation when the small Morbids club (with only six members) refused to capitulate to the larger Hells Angels. Weaponry Between 1994 and 1997, there were at least thirty-six break-ins at Swedish and Danish Army installations; at least sixteen Bofors anti-tank missiles, ten machine guns, around three-hundred handguns, sixty-seven fully automatic rifles, two-hundred-and-five rifles of various calibres, hundreds of hand grenades and land mines, and seventeen kilograms of explosives plus detonators were stolen. Police believe the Bandidos or their support clubs were responsible for the majority of the thefts. The Hells Angels obtained Russian- and Yugoslavian-made rocket launchers as well as surplus machine guns and rifles from East European countries.The Mammoth Book of Bikers Arthur Veno (2007) The conflict saw the use of the Swedish AT4 eight times, and the Russian RPG-22 three times. Hand grenades were used four times and a booby trap once. Car bombs were utilized three times, while other types of explosives were also used on three occasions. The bombs used scaled in size between one and five kilograms. Open conflict According to a 1997 report by The New York Times, the Bandidos presence in the Nordic countries at the time of the war consisted of around 130 members from at least seven chapters while the Hells Angels contingent was made up of around 290 members in total from 15 chapters, with 85 in Sweden, 110 in Denmark, 70 in Norway and 25 in Finland.Sweden's Courteous Police Spoil A Hell's Angels Clubhouse Party The first incident was a shooting at the clubhouse of Morbids MC, on 26 January 1994 in Helsingborg, Sweden, but no one was injured or killed. In February 1994, there was a shoot-out between Hells Angels and Bandidos members in the same city, resulting in the death of Joakim Boman, a member of Rednecks MC, a Hells Angels support club. Just days later, an anti-tank rocket was fired at the Hells Angels clubhouse. On 22 June 1994, the president of Klan MC, an ally of the Bandidos in Finland, was shot dead by the Hells Angels and on 19 February 1995, the war reached Norway as a shoot-out in Oslo between the Hells Angels and Bandidos ended in one biker being wounded. Michael \\"Joe\\" Ljunggren, the president of Bandidos MC Sweden, was assassinated on 17 July 1995 and the Bandidos retaliated by firing anti-tank rockets at the clubhouses of Hells Angels prospect clubs in Helsinki, Finland and Helsingborg, Sweden nine days later. Two Bandidos members were later sentenced, Kai Tapio Blom was given six years imprisonment and Antti Tauno Tapani was given four years. When Bandidos MC Finland's president arrived at a Helsinki court house for the trial of Blom and Tapani, he was attacked and beaten by Hells Angels and Cannonball MC members. A Hells Angels-owned tattoo parlour in Helsinki was later destroyed in retaliation. Anti-tank weapons were stolen from Swedish Army bases and used to destroy a number of clubhouses. In total 13 anti-tank rockets were fired between 1994-1997. On Christmas Day 1995, two Hells Angels members were beaten up by Bandidos at a nightclub in Copenhagen, signalling the beginning of the war in Denmark. In January 1996, there was a series of bombings in Norway, Hells Angels prospect club, Screwdrivers MC's clubhouse in Hamar and the Hells Angels' clubhouse in Oslo were the targets. A Hells Angels-owned bar in Helsinki, Finland was also bombed a month later. On 1 March 1996, the Hells Angels attacked the Bandidos' Helsinki clubhouse where two Bandidos members suffered gunshot wounds. Jarkko Kokko, the vice-president of Bandidos MC Finland and one of the men shot, died sixteen days later in hospital from his wounds. Two Hells Angels prospects were later arrested for the murder, Ilkka Ukkonen was sentenced to twelve and a half years in prison and Jussi Penttinen was given six years. On 10 March 1996, there were twin attacks on Bandidos members at airports in Denmark and Norway; at Fornebu airport in Oslo, several Bandidos were wounded and at Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen, Bandidos who were returning from a weekend in Helsinki were shot, three wounded and one, Uffe Larsen, was killed. Six Hells Angels members and associates were arrested and sentenced to a total of 53 years in prison, and one was given a life sentence. In April and May 1996, there was another series of bombings as the Hells Angels clubhouses in Helsingborg, Sweden and southern Denmark were attacked and the clubhouse of a Hells Angels prospect club, Avengers MC, was also attacked in Aalborg, Denmark. Jan \\"Face\\" Krogh Jensen, a Danish Bandidos member, was shot and killed in Drammen, Norway on 15 July 1996 and Hells Angels supporter was shot six days later in Oslo. Two Hells Angels were also shot and wounded that month in Malm√∂, Sweden and at Jyderup prison in Denmark. On 28 August, the vice-president of Hells Angels MC Sweden was shot and wounded in Helsingborg. In October 1996, there were three attacks on Hells Angels clubhouses; in the third of these, an explosion in Malm√∂ wounded twelve civilian bystanders and three days later, an anti-tank rocket was fired at a clubhouse in Copenhagen during a party. Hells Angels prospect Louis Linde Nielsen, and guest Janne Krohn were both killed. Bandidos prospect Niels Poulsen was convicted of carrying out the attacks and sentenced to life in prison. On the 30th, a car bomb exploded outside the Hells Angels clubhouse in Oslo. Toward the end of 1996, there were shootings of Bandidos members in Horsens and Aalborg in Denmark. At the beginning of 1997, a member of Hells Angels, Kim Thrys√∂e Svendsen was murdered in Aalborg and the president of the Outlaws, Thore \\"Henki\\" Holm Hansen and a French member were shot and wounded by a member of Untouchables MC, a Hells Angels ally. Bandidos foot-soldiers were also shot in Amager and K√∏ge in Denmark. The Bandidos responded by ordering shootings on Hells Angels members and allies in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen. On 4 June 1997, a car bomb exploded outside a Bandidos clubhouse in Drammen, Norway, killing Irene Astrid B√¶kkevold, a civilian passing by in her car. A Hells Angels member was convicted of the bombing in 2002. Three days later, Bj√∂rn Gudmandsen was killed and three other Bandidos were wounded after a shooting in Liseleje, Denmark. Hells Angels member Vagn Smith was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The last incident happened on 11 April when the Bandidos clubhouse in Dalby, Denmark was bombed. The war ended on 25 September 1997 as \\"Big\\" Jim Tinndahn, the president of all of the Bandidos' European chapters, shook hands with Hells Angels Europe president Bent \\"Blondie\\" Nielsen in front of Danish TV news cameras. Aftermath By the end of the war, 11 murders and 74 attempted murders had been committed and 96 people were wounded. Both clubs signed a treaty saying that no more chapters would be opened up in Scandinavia, but both sides had already broken the treaty by the end of the 1990s. In Denmark, a law that banned motorcycle clubs from owning or renting property for their club activities was passed. The law has subsequently been repealed on constitutional grounds. A spate of bombings in Sweden during the late 2010s and early 2020s has been attributed by Swedish police to a resurgence of drug wars between rival gangs.

It was started in the later part of the nineteenth century and by the early part of the twentieth century was making parts and materials for the Buckeye gasoline buggy automobile as well as for the Union automobile and the Lambert automobile.Indianapolis Star, March 22, 1914; Anderson section, pp. 18-19 The company was organized in 1884 in Union City, Ohio, originally under the name of Lambert Brothers and Company.Forkner, p. 452 One of the subsidiaries was the Pioneer Pole and Shaft Company, which was run by George A. Lambert, the son of John W.

They initially started to manufacture buggy neck yokes and other carriage parts. They had a crew of six men and a few young boys that were helpers. The company name was changed to J. H. Osborne and Company within a few years. They added a line of hardware specialties to the business. Some hand-powered, wood- boring drills have been located bearing this company's name and its Indiana address. By 1890 Mr. Osborne dropped out of the company and the name reverted to the Buckeye Manufacturing Company.Forkner, p. 453 A single Buckeye gasoline buggy was built in 1890, and offered for sale in 1891, though none were produced. The Buckeye Manufacturing Company factory burned in 1891. There was a loss of $15,000 in buildings and materials of which $12,000 was covered by insurance. They constructed new buildings to replace the ones lost. The stationary Buckeye engine designed and invented by John William Lambert was patented in 1894. The company then started manufacturing these stationary engines since at the time there was no market for Lambert's automobile. In that same year the company was reorganized and incorporated with a capital stock of $100,000. John William Lambert became the company's president with his parents taking key positions. His father became the vice president and his mother become the secretary and treasurer. The Buckeye Manufacturing Company then moved to Anderson, Indiana, where it was built in the Evalyn industrial park at Third and Sycamore streets. The company expanded in 1903 with the purchase of on Columbus Ave in Anderson, Indiana. The Anderson Weekly Herald newspaper reported that the new factory would have up to of factory floor space and employ 350 to 400 people. The factory was to have the latest up to date equipment and electric cranes. The cost of the new buildings would be $150,000. A contract for the iron frame steelwork of the buildings was to be signed with the general contractors within a few days of the newspaper article. The factory manufactured gasoline engines and pressed steel articles for Lambert's automobiles.Anderson Weekly Herald. March 20th, 1903 One of the Largest Factories in the city is now promised by the Lambert Brothers The property was known as the Hannah Croak property owned by a Mrs. Hannah Carey and a Mrs. Pfafflin. The transaction was conducted by the Sears Real Estate Company. The Buckeye Manufacturing Company then shared its name with \\"The Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company.\\" The new factory began making Lambert automobile parts and materials in mass production beginning in 1905.Anderson Sunday Herald, November 16, 1958.

One of the objectives of our society's publication, the ANTIQUE AUTOMOBILE, is to unearth undiscovered and unpublished automotive history. The controversial dispute between the Duryea brothers, the myriad of other independent claims by various one-of-a-kind automobile inventors, plus the extreme difficulty of obtaining complete records on some 300 horseless carriages that were constructed up to 1895 makes the road of research almost as impassable as the main street of Ohio City where, in 1891, Lambert drove his first automobile. It has taken almost five years to ferret out substantial evidence in order to enter a claim for America's first automobile on behalf of John William Lambert.\\" History John William Lambert made America's first such automobile in 1891, according to a five-year extensive studyEncyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"The magazine Antique Automobile, after five years of investigation, announced its conviction that the Duryea Brothers had not been the first United States internal combustion automobile, and that this distinction should be assigned to a car built in 1890 and run in 1891 by John William Lambert of Ohio City, Ohio.\\" by L. Scott Bailey, a well-known automobile historian, editor, and publisher.Bailey, p. 341-345 The study found substantial evidence to enter this claim on Lambert's behalf.Scharchburg, p. 22 \\"To L. Scott Bailey, well-known historian, editor, and publisher, belongs the credit for collecting and publishing the evidence that relates to the 1891 Lambert automobile. His findings were published in 1960 \\"Antique Automobile\\" after nearly five years research.\\" The evidence from Bailey's study shows that Lambert designed, built, and ran a gasoline engine automobile in the early part of 1891 that he put on the market.Huffman, Wallace Spencer, Indiana's Place in Automobile History, \\"Indiana History Bulletin\\", vol. 44, no. 2, Feb. 1967, p. 12; Indianapolis, Indiana Historical Bureau. \\"John W.

The experimental car was more a buggy than automobile, but it was propelled by a gasoline engine.\\" It shows that neither Henry Ford nor the Duryea Brothers have the distinction of building the first such practical working internal combustion gasoline engine automobile in the United States.The Daily Chronicle, Centralia, Washington dated Friday, December 24, 1976, page 8. \\"'The heart of free enterprise'. The history of the development of the automobile is the history of business innovators in our society, pioneers on a technological frontier. One of these pioneers, whose story should be more widely known, is John William Lambert of Ohio. Though the Duryea Brothers are usually credited with building the first successful automobile, John Lambert was driving a gasoline-powered automobile on the main street of Ohio City, Ohio -- a year earlier than the Duryeas produced their vehicle.\\"James, p. 6 \\"Ford, in fact, stood well behind in the race to produce the first successful automobile. John W. Lambert of Ohio had already been driving his three- wheeled, gas-powered car back in 1891; Charles and Frank Duryea built their first car in 1893 and won America's first automobile race in Chicago in 1895; Elwood Haynes drove his vehicle in 1894, and Charles B. King of Detroit was seen driving his in 1896, six months before Henry's car was ready.\\" In Europe Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler produced the first gasoline automobiles in 1885/1886. The Duryea brothers made their automobile in 1893 and started the Duryea Motor Wagon Company in 1895 mass-producing cars. Henry Ford started mass-producing cars in 1899 at the Detroit Automobile Company. Lambert initially designed and built his \\"horseless carriage\\" gasoline automobile in 1890.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 1968, Volume 2, p. 867 \\"The magazine \\"Antique Automobile\\", after five years of investigation, announced its conviction that the Duryea Brothers had not been the first United States internal combustion automobile, and that this distinction should be assigned to a car built in 1890 and run in 1891 by John William Lambert of Ohio City, Ohio.\\" He successfully tested it in January 1891 inside an farm implement showroom he owned in Ohio City, Ohio.Madden, p. 2 \\"L. Scott Bailey, the respected former editor of \\"Automobile Quarterly\\", declared in a 1960 article that the Lambert built by John William Lambert in 1891 in Ohio City, Ohio, was the first practical, working automobile built in the United States. While the Lambert effort was not documented prior to its use, it is better documented by other means than most early automobiles.\\" Lambert's three- wheeled surrey-top gasoline-powered buggy was his own design. It had a single cylinder, four-stroke engine. This, the Buckeye gasoline buggy, was a one-seat tricycle with large rear wheels.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.6. Lambert designed a sales brochures advertising its specifications in January 1891. He mailed this brochure out to prospects in the first part of February 1891 with a price of $550.Kimes, p. 835 Later in the month of February 1891 he was running his automobileAnderson Sunday Herald newspaper; Anderson, Indiana; November 16, 1958 \\"In 1891 John Lambert built and operated a gasoline car in Ohio City, Ohio. The experimental car was more a buggy than automobile, but it was propelled by a gasoline engine.\\" on the main street of Ohio City.Bailey, p. 343 \\"Lambert was convinced that he had a workable engine to power his three- wheel carriage and he set forth specifications and a price of $550 in a sales brochure which was mailed during the first part of February of 1891. Later that month, the automobile was running with the new stirrup-type steering on the main street of Ohio City.\\" Bailey points out there are several letters on file dated in the latter part of February and the early part of March 1891 requesting additional information on this \\"horseless carriage\\" that Lambert described in the brochure. Other letters of inquire continued, however Lambert ultimately was not able to sell any.Bailey, p. 343 \\"It is interesting to record that several letters are on file dated in the latter part of February and early March of 1891 requesting additional information on the Lambert car. Although the letters of inquiry continued, no sales contracts were signed for the Lambert. Lambert soon realized that there was no sales potential for his automobile.\\" This first model had a wipe spark ignition and dry cell batteries. The automobile had two speeds forward and none going backwards. A hand steering device was added later when the automobile was used outside on the roads. The weight of the car was 585 pounds. It had wooden wheels with steel rims for extra wear. The carburetor was a surface vaporizer with a flexible diaphragm \\"compensator.\\" This was patented by Lambert on May 17, 1902. The original model cost Lambert $3200. In 1904 it was lost in a fire when a grain elevator building that he was having remodeled burned to the ground.Dolnar, vol.10, Jan. 1906, p. 225 In 1892 Lambert decided to manufacture stationary gasoline engines. He moved to Anderson, Indiana, and there started Buckeye Manufacturing Company. In that same year he announced he would \\"soon have a gasoline vehicle on the market\\" to be called the Buckeye. He sent a picture to the newspapers, which was of the Buckeye gasoline buggy he made in 1891. This endeavor also did not come to fruition. Instead he continued experimentation and devised the friction gearing disk drive transmission. He invented and developed a friction transmission that would be the key feature on all of his future automobiles he would make. Lambert's first model design of 1891 was eventually modified and developed into the Union automobile which first was sold in 1902. Festival Lambert Days is a community celebrating that honors the life of John W. Lambert, the first gasoline-powered single-cylinder vehicle, and the world's first car wreck. This is an annual three-day event that takes place in Ohio City, Ohio on the third weekend of July. Activities and events: Car Show, Art Festival, Flea Market, Sporting Events, Parade, Live Entertainment, and Lambert Automobile Displays. Others before Duryea In the late nineteenth century, there were many individuals in the United States working on a \\"horseless carriage\\", some of which paralleled the time frame of Lambert. Some notable individuals with verifiable primary sources that invented such vehicles before the Duryea brothers were Henry Nadig, Charles H. Black, and Elwood P. Haynes. =Henry Nadig= Henry Nadig of Allentown, Pennsylvania invented a vehicle that history records he built sometime between 1891 and 1893. In 1905, Nadig reports that he began to construct a \\"horseless carriage\\" in 1891 and when he finished it, he then ran it on Fourth Street in Allentown.Scharchburg, p. 18 \\"In 1905 Henry Nadig affirmed that he had begun to build a vehicle in 1891 and that he ran it on Fourth Street in Allentown when it was finished.\\" The original 1891 vehicle was extensively modified in the winter of 1892-93 to the point it could be almost considered a different vehicle.Scharchburg, p. 16 \\"The vehicle was modified in 1892-93 to the point that it could almost be considered a second vehicle.\\" This vehicle was driven \\"for pleasure\\" for the next ten years.Scharchburg, p. 18 \\"The 1891 vehicle was modified in the winter of 1892-93 and driven \\"for pleasure\\" until 1903.\\" As of 1992, this vehicle was owned by a David K. Bausch of Allentown. About 70% of the original vehicle still existed, however it was in \\"rough\\" condition and needed complete restoration. The historical importance of this particular vehicle is that it may be the oldest America-made gasoline-powered automobile that still exists.Scharchburg, p. 19 =Charles H. Black= Charles H. Black reported that he completed and tested his first steam engine \\"chug buggy\\" in 1891. He rejected a steam engine \\"as too cumbersome and hard to manage\\" for use in an automobile.Scharchburg, p. 26 \\"According to his own account published in the Indianapolis News in 1913 and in the American Chauffeur in 1916, he completed and tested his first \\"chug buggy\\" in 1891. Black recalled that, after rejecting a steam engine \\"as too cumbersome and hard to manage\\" for use in an automobile, he continued to search for a suitable engine.\\" He then went about making a gasoline engine vehicle. Later in 1891 he then tried such a \\"horseless carriage\\" out in Indianapolis on the paved streets of Circle and Delaware. He drove this vehicle around Indianapolis for the next twenty years. A business card of C.H. Black Manufacturing Company showed a picture of this vehicle with the writing \\"Estimates furnished for power-equipped vehicles of any style.\\" The business card was dated 1892.Scharchburg, p. 28 =Elwood P. Haynes= Elwood P. Haynes, who successfully made his trial run of his automobile on July 4, 1894, arranged a meeting with Lambert shortly thereafter. He told Lambert, a close friend of his, that he planned on manufacturing the car and wanted to advertise it as \\"America's First Car\\" to be able to promote sales.Kimes, p. 835 \\"Elwood P. Haynes, who had successfully tested his first gasoline car in Kokomo (Indiana) on July 4th, 1894, visited Lambert and announced that he planned to get into manufacture and to bill his product as \\"America's First Car.\\"\\" Lambert agreed not to refute this even though Lambert's three-wheeled automobile is considered to be the first successful gasoline automobile available for sale in the United States.Madden, p. 14 \\"Haynes had heard about another motorcar that was made before his by John W. Lambert in Ohio. Haynes visited the Ohio inventor to tell him that he was planning to market his own automobile and to call it \\"America's first car.\\" He obtained Lambert's promise not to dispute Haynes' claim.\\"G.N. Georgano, p. 853 \\"John William Lambert made a 3-wheeled car in Ohio City in 1891, which is generally considered to be the first petrol-engined car made in the United States. It received little publicity, since, when Elwood Haynes wanted to promote his car in 1894 as \\"America's First Car\\", he extracted a promise from John Lambert that he would not challenge the Haynes claim. Lambert agreed as at that time he was not interested in car manufacture.\\" He let his friend Haynes take the honors.Huhti, p. 59 \\"Locals claim that one John Lambert of Union City actually built the first functional automobile; apparently he was such a good friend of Kokomo's Elwood Haynes that he let his friend take credit.\\" A mistake Haynes made was that the Duryea brothers and others predated him. Lambert never broke his promise to his friend, however when he went into production he often made reference to his \\"1891\\" gasoline engine horseless carriage buggy but never said it was \\"America's First Car\\" made.Kimes, p. 835 \\"And he never did, though when Lambert did get into manufacture, frequent reference was made by him to the fact of the 1891 gasoline car; he simply did not say he was the first.\\" The Smithsonian Institution has not declared Lambert the inventor of the first commercially available self-powered gasoline engine automobile because he himself never made this claim. Others with prior patents Selden 1895 \\"road-engine\\" invention =George B. Selden= George B. Selden applied for a patent on a vehicle in 1879 of an \\"improved road engine\\" based on a compression engine that used liquid-hydrocarbon fuel (i.e. gasoline). The patent covered the basics of constructing a horseless carriage of a self-propelled automobile, however he had not actually built such a vehicle. Selden worked off the principles of George Brayton's two-cycle gasoline engine patented in 1872.Brayton Patent number: 125166 Improvement in gas-engines Blayton had exhibited his engine at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 and Selden then decided to use that engine or a modified version of it as the basis for a patent. He went about drawing up a model of a vehicle and applied for a patent strictly based on the drawing alone.Rubenstein, p. 11 Selden then used legal evasive tactics to stall the patent's acceptance each year making minor amendments until he felt it was favorable for commercial production of the American automobile. The idea behind this was that he wanted to secure the claim of being the first to have invented the automobile and get the seventeen-year legal rights to all the automobile royalties.Flink, p. 51 \\"Probably the most absurb action in the history of patent law was the granting of United States patent number 549,160 on November 5, 1895, to George B. Selden. a Rockester, New York, patent lawyer and inventor, for an \\"improved road engine\\" powered by \\"a liguid-hydrocarbon engine of the compression type.\\"\\"Flink, p. 51 \\"His own patent application was filed in 1879. He then used evasive legal tactics to delay the patent's acceptance until conditions seemed favorable for commercial exploitation.\\" He legally stalled the process until he was forced to complete the application process. This was sixteen years after he first applied for the patentFlink, p. 52 \\"His hand was forced in 1895 - in part because the patent office was tightening its rules on delayed applications, but more because events indicated that the time was now ripe for implementing the automobile idea.\\" and a few months before the actual mass-production of automobiles by car manufactures.Rubenstein, p. 11 \\"Because a patent is issued for only seventeen years, Selden made minor changes and amendments to his application every year to delay its formal registration until November 5, 1895, a few months before the start of commercial motor vehicle production in the United States. History records of automobile technology do not support his claim as being the first to have invented the automobile because at the time he was issued the patent Selden had not been able to make a working model.\\"Flink, p. 52 \\"Selden had not yet built an operational model of his design when the patent was issued; and, as we have seen, the state of the prior technological art in no sense supported his allegation of priority.\\" This evasion and stalling of finalizing a patent then had much influence as to how future automobile patents were handled from then on.Flink, p. 10 \\"The Selden patent engendered a bitter organizational conflict in the early American automobile industry and profoundly influenced the industry's subsequent patent policy.\\" =Frank A. Huntington= Huntington \\"vehicle\\" 1889 invention A \\"vehicle\\" was patented by a F. A. Huntington of San Francisco on January 11, 1889.Frank A. Huntington \\"Vehicle\\" This was about six months after Carl Benz received a patent in the United States for a \\"self- propelling vehicle.\\"Carl Benz \\"Self-propelling vehicle\\" There seems to be no further record if Huntington built his 1889 gasoline engine vehicle or if there was a west coast sales distribution of the vehicle before 1891.Scharchburg, p. 30 Huntington's 1889 patent was four years before the Duryea brothers built their first car in 1893.

In 1915, he was the first to describe onchocerciasis in Latin America, which was known and widespread on the African continent and first described in 1890 by Sir Patrick Manson.Who named it Robles was the first person to describe the etiology of the disease, correctly attributing it to infection with Onchocerca volvulus parasites. He discerned the etiology from clinical observations among coffee plantation workers in Guatemala, extracting the parasitic worm from a nodule on a child's face. The disease was later referred to as \\"Roble's disease\\" in his honor. In the 1930s, Robles also played a role in establishing the first public health campaigns to address onchocerciasis in the Central Endemic Zone of Guatemala, which involved sending teams to endemic areas to provide surgical services and perform nodulectomies.

Lambert The Union Automobile Company began to make automobiles in Union City, Indiana in 1902. It built the Union automobile from 1902 through 1905. The company was located in Union City, Indiana from 1902 to 1905. In 1905 it moved to Anderson, Indiana. Kimes, p. 835 History John William Lambert's first automobile marketing success was with the model called the \\"Union.\\" The reason it was called the Union automobile was because of favorable agreements and concessions from Union City chamber of commerce. Most of the automobile components for the Union automobile were made at the Buckeye Manufacturing Company in Anderson, Indiana, owned and operated by Lambert. The Union automobile was initially released in 1902. The first friction disk-drive gearless transmission automobile, as designed by Lambert, was on the road in 1901 as an experimental vehicle. The motor for the automobile was a pair of opposed 6 by cylinders, far in front, crosswise, side chains to rear drivers. One model was a single seater that weighed 1,400 pounds (640 kg) and was equipped with a motor. Another model was 1,800 pounds with a motor. The motors were built by the Buckeye Manufacturing Company. The motors ran up to 1,500 revolutions per minute and as low as 150 rpm. They had a make and break ignition with current furnished by a magneto. The first model was quickly followed by a second friction driven model, same motor placed crosswise in extreme rear of the car. \\"Union Automobile Company.\\" Horseless Age, December 11, 1901, p 802. Union Automobile Company built in 1904 through 1905 a 5-seater tonneau model. This automobile came with a ten horsepower engine in 1904. In 1905 it was available in a model or a model. In 1905 the majority of the factory production was done in the Anderson plant. That plant had always made the engines and transmissions for the Union automobile from the start. In that same year the name of the automobile changed from the Union automobile to the Lambert automobile.G.N. Georgano, p. 1642 Union Automobile Company manufactured a medium weight gasoline automobile for business purposes and for personal use. The stock of this company was principally owned by the Buckeye Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of parts of carriages and buggies, and the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company of Anderson, Indiana -- both of which were owned by the Lambert family.

In the later part of 1891 he moved to Union City, Ohio after failing in his initial attempt to make and sell \\"horseless carriages.\\" There he ran an agricultural implement store, a grain elevator and a lumber yard. In 1893 Lambert came to Anderson, Indiana moving some of his machinery there. This was the nucleus for the factory plant he made in Anderson. The factory covered of brick construction and was equipped with modern machinery of the day. The company Lambert ran made farm implement equipment and stationary gasoline engines for farms and other commercial uses. In 1893 the company was incorporated under the firm name of the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company and the Buckeye Manufacturing Company. He employed about 250 people at the time.Forkner, p. 453 Lambert gasoline stationary engine, 1895 The factory tooled up with equipment for the manufacture of automobiles in 1900 with the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company making the automobile engines and the Buckeye Manufacturing Company making the other automobile parts. The officers of the companies were B. F. Lambert as the president, George A. Lambert as the secretary, and John Lambert the treasurer and general manager. The capital stock of the companies was $100,000,Forkner, p. 452 which would be millions in 2008 dollars. Before the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company built automobile motors they manufactured stationary engines. A partial description of the Lambert gasoline stationary engines were described in Gas, Gasoline and Oil-engines written by Gardner Dexter Hiscox in 1910 as: There was a \\"Leaflet\\" given out by the Lambert Gas and Gasoline Engine Company on their engines giving directions to the operator. It was a guide to their gasoline engines giving special instructions for how the internal action of the engine was performing by just the sound of how it was operating.

It was written and directed by Tom DiCillo and narrated by Johnny Depp. The film begins with the band's formation in 1965, its development over the next two years, the release of their debut album and subsequent albums and Jim Morrison's use of alcohol and drugs and subsequent death in Paris in July 1971. The film features archival footage of rehearsals, TV and concert performances, private cine-film and the background to Morrison's arrest at a 1969 Miami concert and later trial. The film also includes the first public release of material from Morrison's 1969 film HWY: An American Pastoral. Doors' keyboardist Ray Manzarek stated that \\"This will be the true story of the Doors,\\" and that the film will be \\"the anti-Oliver Stone,\\" referring to the 1991 film about the group that Stone directed, and which drew criticism from many Doors fans and several people who knew Morrison. Production The documentary was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival on January 17, 2009. It received somewhat favorable reviews from that showing, but the narration (by director DiCillo) was singled out by most viewers as very seriously flawed for its monotonous delivery. Due to the rash of complaints about the narration, Johnny Depp was hired to redub it. A few months later, DiCillo pronounced the film \\"just about locked\\" and announced that there would be a showing of the new \\"redux\\" version. It debuted at the Los Angeles Film Festival on Sunday, June 21, 2009. The completed film was also shown at the London Film Festival on October 16‚Äì18, 2009. The film was released in theaters on April 9, 2010,Welcome to When You're Strange  When You're Strange with a soundtrack release on April 6, 2010. It was released in Canada on April 15, 2010. PBS showed this film as part of its series American Masters on May 12, 2010. The film was released on DVD on June 29, 2010. In France the film, distributed by MK2, was released under its original title and received an excellent reception.When you're strange, l'hymne √† la gloire des Doors Reception Doors guitarist Robby Krieger believes that the film puts together a more accurate portrayal of Morrison than the 1991 biopic: \\"I think when you see the Oliver Stone movie ‚Äì I'm amazed how good Val Kilmer did ‚Äì but, you know, the problem with that movie is that the script was kind of stupid. It doesn't really capture how Jim was at all. This gives you a much better insight into how his mind worked, I think.\\" Overall Krieger felt \\"really happy\\" about how the film has turned out, crediting in particular the editing work. The surviving members of the band decided not to get too involved in the project to try to get the right neutral balance that an outsider would try to achieve. The film was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Series following its airing on American Masters on PBS.Welcome to When You're Strange  When You're Strange In December 2010 the film was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video and subsequently won the award in February 2011.

The invention relates to a friction disk drive transmission for automobiles that is gearless.Dolnar, p. 106 The Lambert car is a good automobile at a low price -- not for one moment to be confused with cheap gear-driven cars. The lower cost of the more efficient, simple Lambert friction transmission is what enables us to make a far better car than any manufacturer of gear-transmission cars can make for the same money.Indianapolis Star, March 22, 1914. page 18 J. W. Lambert's mechanical mind early grasped the idea that the tendency in automobile construction should be toward simplicity.... He decided to do the experimental work that has since resulted in the Lambert friction or gearless transmission. The greatest difficulties encountered in attaining success for his product lay more on convincing the public of its value than in perfecting it mechanically. He saw the need for a simple transmission of engine power to an automobile's drive wheels.Forknerm p. 383 Lambert patented friction transmission: J. W. Lambert wanted a simpler form than the usual gear transmission for transmitting power from the engine to the driving mechanism. He foresaw that universal use of power-driven vehicles depended upon a reduction of upkeep and maintenance costs, rather than upon a lowered cost of first production selling prices. He developed a simple friction device. Description The main or driving disk is faced with a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In practice I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of a high degree of efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum.The Horseless Age, p. 48 Lambert 1904 friction-gearing transmission patent 761,384 The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving. The aluminum disk was twenty-two inches in diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just over a quarter of an inch in thickness. The traversing wheel was eighteen inches in diameter with a working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was clamped between cast iron members supporting the strawboard rings inside and clamping them sideways. This fibrous friction wheel is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in swinging boxes so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum- faced driving disk, which is motor driven.Dolnar, p. 226a The speed regulation was done by a steel bell crank, forked and carrying a U-shaped shoe to engage the grooved hub on the driving wheel at one end, and having the other end linked to the speed change and reversing lever. The wheel slid freely on the sleeve when moved away from the disk. All the speeds, from the highest to the lowest, could be done in either direction. The Lambert transmission always used side chains to the rear wheels and a balance gear connected to the splined sleeve on which the wheel slide and a steel shaft which supported the sleeve. The key feature of the Lambert automobile was the friction disk drive carried over from the Union automobile.Dolnar, p. 225 Lambert applied for a patent on this transmission which became No. 761,384 finalized May 31, 1904. The patent has six claims: 1\\\\. In a power-transmitting mechanism, the combination, of a pair of shafts, a friction-disk carried by each shaft, one disk having a bearing part of aluminium and the other a fiber part bearing upon said aluminium bearing part. 2\\\\.

Despite numerous practical and theological similarities to other forms of modern witchcraft, such as Gardnerian Wicca, Cochrane's Craft sets itself apart from other traditions in many notable ways, such as its emphasis on the pursuit of wisdom as the highest goal of witchcraft and Cochrane's insistence that witchcraft is not Pagan and, in fact, has no more in common with Paganism than does Qabbalah. History Around the time that the British 1735 Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, and it became legal to practice witchcraft in the United Kingdom, Cochrane, who was in his early twenties, founded a coven, and named it the Clan of Tubal Cain after the biblical figure Tubal-cain (the first blacksmith), as a reference to his work in that profession. Cochrane initiated his wife Jane and several others into the craft, and they then joined the coven. Among these was Evan John Jones, who would one day replace Robert Cochrane as the Magister of the Clan of Tubal Cain. Jones had met Cochrane through his wife Jane, as they both worked for the same company. The group performed their rituals either at Cochrane's house, or, more often, at Burnham Beeches, though they also performed rituals at the South Downs, after which they would stay the night at Doreen Valiente's flat in Brighton. In 1966, Robert Cochrane died. Jane, Robert's widow, then named Jones as the Magister of the Clan of Tubal Cain. In 1982, two Americans named Dave & Ann Finnin reached out to Gray and Jones. In 1986, after four years of correspondence, Jones adopted the Finnins into the Clan of Tubal Cain and named them Magister and Maid of a satellite group called The Roebuck. Conflicts later arose between Jones and the Finnians, and he ceased communications with the couple In 1996, Mike Howard, editor of The Cauldron, introduced Jones to a woman named Shani Oates. In 1998, Jones felt Oates to be the best person to lead the Clan of Tubal Cain and formally named her its Maid, giving her \\"supreme and undivided authority over the whole Clan\\". Oates then named as her Magister Robin the Dart. On the Winter Solstice 2017, Oates appointed Ulric Goding as Magister of the Clan, as the successor to lead the Clan to future generations. Describing Cochrane's creation of his Witchcraft tradition, Oates remarked that \\"Like any true craftsman, he was able to mold raw material into a magical synthesis, creating a marvelous working system, at once instinctively true and intrinsically beautiful.\\"Oates 2010. p. 228. BeliefsTheology= As in most forms of Neopagan Witchcraft, Cochranians worship both a Horned God and a Triple Goddess. The Goddess is viewed as the White Goddess, a term taken from Robert Graves' poem, The White Goddess. She is also viewed as a triad of three mothers or three sisters, which both Cochrane and Evan John Jones noted as having similarities with the weird sisters or Norns of Germanic paganism. In Cochrane's Craft, the God is associated with fire, the underworld and time, and has been described as \\"the goat-god of fire, craft, lower magics, fertility and death\\". The God was known by several names, most notable Tubal Cain, Br√¢n, Wayland and Herne. Cochrane's tradition held that these two deities had a son, the Horn Child, who was a young sun god. Cochrane, like Gardner, believed that there was a being beyond the God and the Goddess; the Godhead, although he referred to this deity as \\"the Hidden Goddess\\". He also referred to it as \\"Truth\\". Cochrane told of a cosmogony myth, which involved Night, \\"a feminine being with force, but without form, giving birth to man and with him she discovered love, and so all things began\\". He said that the Elder Gods had seven children who each created a realm to rule over from a castle, as well as creating the elements of earth, air, fire and water, each of which had a god ruling over it. =Ethics and morality= No mention is made in Cochrane's writings to the Wiccan Rede or \\"Threefold Law\\". Cochrane instead offers an \\"old witch 'law'\\" that reads: In a letter to occultist William G. Gray, Cochrane said: Practices Cochranians wear robes whilst performing rituals and adhere to the traditional Great Rite. =Tools= An iconic part of Cochrane's Craft is the tool known as the stang. A stang is a forked staff used, primarily, as a portable altar. In The Roebuck in the Thicket, Evan John Johns describes the acquisition and adornment of a stang intended for use by a coven. According to Jones, the shaft of the stang should be made from ash; the fork of the stang should be made of iron; the base should be shod in iron; two upward-facing crossed arrows should adorn the shaft below the fork; and, on the four \\"Great Sabbats\\" (i.e. Candlemas, May Eve, Lammas, and Halloween), the arrows should be garlanded as fits the season. Media In 2015 a feature film, The Coven was released based on the premise that \\"Robbie Cochrane founded a Wicca coven as recently as the 1960s\\" and that followers were meeting in Queen's Wood in Highgate. A Cochranian devotee, Uri Clef, is killed and the film's plot reveals the killer in a subtle and complex story line.

The native of Zebulon, North Carolina, was listed as tall and . Pearce's lone full season came with Washington in . He worked in 20 games, including three starting pitcher assignments, and won two of three decisions, including his first MLB complete game, a 9‚Äì3 triumph against the St. Louis Browns on August 28 at Griffith Stadium.Retrosheet box score: 1950-08-28 But he posted an abysmal 6.04 earned run average over the season in 56 innings pitched, didn't get another trial with the Senators until April 1953, and would work in only eight more big- league games in his career. Acquired by Cincinnati after an outstanding season in the Double-A Southern Association, Pearce was highly effective in two September 1954 appearances. He held the Brooklyn Dodgers scoreless in a two- inning relief stint at Ebbets Field on September 14. Then, six days later, he was selected to start against another first-division team, the Milwaukee Braves, at County Stadium. Pearce threw a complete game, 3‚Äì1 victory, with Milwaukee's only run scoring unearned when the Redlegs made two errors in the field in the seventh inning.Retrosheet box score: 1954-09-20 (2) The following April 16, Pearce tried to duplicate his success against the Braves, starting against them at Cincinnati's Crosley Field. He allowed an unearned run in the second inning, and then was driven from the mound in the third when Milwaukee strung together four straight hits, good for three runs. Pearce was charged with the 9‚Äì5 loss.Retrosheet box score: 1955-04-16 He made one final appearance in the majors as a relief pitcher over two weeks later, allowing one earned run in one inning pitched against the Philadelphia Phillies. He spent the rest of his career in the minor leagues, retiring after the 1959 season.

City The city of Sirsukh was founded by the Kushan king Kanishka after 80 CE, and is the last of the great ancient cities of Taxila. The invaders decided to abandon the older city of Sirkap and build a newer city on the other side of the Lundi-nala. The wall of the city is about 5 kilometers long and about 5.4 meters thick. The city wall covers an area of around 2300 x 1000 meters seen along the east-west direction, and is laid out in a typical Central Asian style, complete with suburbs. Sirsukh was left uninhabited when the White Huns invaded the Punjab at the end of the fifth century CE. To the north-east of the city flows the Harro river whereas to the south the Lundi-ravine is present. The ancient city was excavated only on a very small scale in 1915-16 CE, and further excavation work has been impeded by a high water table which threatens the integrity of ancient structures. It was included in the World Heritage List of the UNO in 1980 as part of Taxila. Wall File:Wall bastion - Sirkap.jpgBastion in the wall of Sirsukh with hole for the archers, Taxila.

At the age of 18 he moved to San Antonio, Texas to train at the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy (later Texas Wrestling Academy) under Shawn Michaels.VPW Wrestling presents the Summer Superstar Tour He later went on to train at the Dory Funk's Funking Conservatory. Following his training he went on to make his professional wrestling debut in August 1999, and later would make his debut in the United States against Kris Krugar in San Antonio, Texas. =Varsity Pro Wrestling= In 2006, Jones began running the Varsity Pro Wrestling (VPW) promotion and School of Excellence, performing throughout England as he trained future British stars Chris Andrews, Rob Holte, Robbie Everest, Sam Andrews and others. He also began the training process for Sheamus.http://www.varsityprowrestling.com/sheamus_wwe.html The school runs regular sessions several times per week and features guest trainers such as Bob Holly, Kip James and The Road Dogg several times per year. In 2007, Jones made an unsuccessful pitch for investment in VPW on the BBC Two show Dragon's Den. In February 2008, Jones, as the UK Kid, worked an angle on a VPW event in Portsmouth with Billy Gunn, interfering after Gunn's match, beating him with a chair and leaving him bleeding. Gunn vowed revenge on the next VPW Portsmouth show, though it came at the hands of another individual. When a change to Gunn's contractual status with TNA made him incapable of attending the VPW show in May, he sent long-time friend Bob Holly to \\"teach the UK Kid a lesson\\", something that Holly accomplished in a tables, ladders and chairs match held in front of over 600 rabid fans.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPZ_l_s06_k This highly successful event was followed up with a return to the Portsmouth Guildhall in August, an event that began with the UK Kid revealing that he had arranged for a 15-foot steel cage to be provided and challenged Holly to a rematch. Holly declined, saying that he had already beaten the Kid in a TLC match, so felt it would be unfair to prevent others on the roster getting a chance to humble Jones's arrogant alter-ego. Holly backed \\"The Devon Powerhouse\\" Chris Andrews for the match and offered him support in a backstage interview before the match. In the main event of the show, the UK Kid and Andrews wrestled in the cage for over 20 minutes with Andrews obtaining a large gash on his forehead as a result of the intense action. The resourceful UK Kid eventually managed to fight off Andrews's onslaught long enough to retrieve a roll of electrical tape he had sneaked into the cage before the match, and used it to secure Andrews to the ring ropes. With Andrews immobilised, the UK Kid brought a chair into the ring and began pounding his opponent. Bob Holly, who had defeated Matt Vaughn earlier in the evening and was watching backstage, returned to ringside, entered the cage and snatched the chair away from the UK Kid. A tense moment followed before Holly, to the shock of the audience, began beating the defenceless Andrews. Andy Boy Simmonz, Jason Dunce, Jake McCluskey and a host of VPW officials all attempted to come to Andrews's rescue but were prevented from entering the cage by both Holly and the UK Kid. Eventually the beat-down subsided and Andrews ‚Äî now a bloody mess ‚Äî was helped backstage and to a local medical facility.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8nhxHCWt-U In October, on the next VPW Guildhall show, The UK Kid and Holly revealed their \\"International Alliance\\", explaining that Chris Andrews needed to be put in his place. Andrews brought backup in the form of Billy Gunn's long time tag team partner, The Road Dogghttp://www.portsmouth.co.uk/daysout/Globetrotting- Road-Dogg-is-coming.5761586.jp and they issued challenges to Holly and the UK Kid respectively. Later that night, UK Kid defeated The Road Dogg by pinfall, following interference by Bob Holly.http://www.varsityprowrestling.com/VPW_saviour.html Come February 2010 and the promotion's return to Portsmouth, the evening started badly and just got worse for the UK Kid. During an interview segment, he and Bob Holly belittled teenage sensation \\"Mr. Moonsault\\" Jake McCluskey, who had just picked up first VPW victory. An impromptu match followed where McCluskey took advantage of the UK Kid's overconfidence, wrapping him up in a small package for his second victory of the night. In the main event of the evening, Holly and the Kid teamed up in a losing effort against Chris Andrews and Billy Gunn. The following evening in Basingstoke saw the UK Kid gain a measure of revenge, pinning Billy Gunn in a singles match but later being on the losing team in a six-man tag match between himself, Bob Holly and Rob Holte facing Gunn, Jake McCluskey and Chris Andrews. =Work for other promotions= In August 2006 The UK Kid teamed with Charlie Rage to lose to The Big Show in a handicap match at Wembley Arena, London for WWE.

Though considered by many as a Christmas carol, it is found in the Epiphany section of many hymnals and still used by many churches. The music was adapted by William Henry Monk in 1861 from a tune written by Conrad Kocher in 1838. The hymn is based on the visit of the Biblical magi in the Nativity of Jesus.  History  Dix, as the son of poet John Ross Dix and named after Thomas Chatterton, would regularly write Christian poetry in his spare time. Dix wrote \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\" on 6 January 1859 during a months-long recovery from an extended illness, unable to attend that morning's Epiphany service at church. As he read the Gospel of Matthew's account of Epiphany in The Bible, he was inspired and started to reflect on the text. He then started to write about his thoughts and did so for the whole day with the eventual result being \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\". Dix kept the text private until a year later when it was published in Hymns for Public Worship and Private Devotion, which was written for St Raphael‚Äôs Church in Dix's hometown of Bristol. It was also added to the trial version of Hymns Ancient and Modern before being included in the original publication of that hymnal in 1861. Most hymn writers in the Church of England at the time were clergymen, so Dix, a layman and marine insurance agent living in Glasgow, Scotland, was delighted that his carol was included. It was also self-published by Dix in his own Hymns of Joy and Love hymnal. The editor of Hymns Ancient and Modern, William Henry Monk, adapted a tune by Stuttgart organist Conrad Kocher as the music for \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\". The tune originally consisted of a 7.6.7.6.7.7.6 metre, but Monk removed the fifth phrase to create a more balanced tune. Dix personally did not like the tune, which was ironic as it was later titled \\"Dix\\" as a tribute to him. Despite Dix's opinion of it, the tune became popular and is used for the majority of performances of the hymn. The same melody is also used in the hymn \\"For the Beauty of the Earth\\", an example of what is often considered to be a seasonal hymn melody given to a more general hymn text for use in Ordinary Time. Publication and use After publication, the hymn proved popular in both the Church of England and in other Anglican churches throughout the British Empire. This rise in popularity is attributed to the future Lord Chancellor, Sir Roundell Palmer praising it in his \\"English Church Hymnody\\" academic paper published and read at the Church Congress in York in 1866. The lyrics of the hymn would be included in pieces of artwork that would adorn Anglican churches around the world. Though by the 1950s to 1970s, the hymn lost popularity as a Christmas carol, it was still held in high regard as a hymn with a pleasing positive message. The hymn eventually regained popularity as a carol and continued to be published in hymnals as well as in Christmas chapters of them. It has continued to be used in the Church of England. \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\" has also been performed in concerts outside of a church setting. In 1871, the hymn was first published in the United States in the Episcopal Church of the United States' hymnal. It was later included in The Hymnal 1982 with amended lyrics for the fourth verse. By 1875, the Baptist Church's Triennial Convention in the United States had started publishing \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\" in The Service of Song for Baptist Churches hymnal. When the hymn is used in the United Methodist Church, it can be presented as a church reading for Epiphany as well as in its regular musical setting. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints use the hymn, though set to a piece of music by Dan Carter instead of \\"Dix\\". It has also been published in The Harvard University Hymn Book.  Analysis  \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\" used Matthew 2:1‚Äì12 as a theme to compare the journey of the Biblical magi to visit the baby Jesus to each Christian's personal pilgrimage and as a reminder that it is not the value of the gifts, it is the value of giving and adoration to Jesus that is what Christians should seek. It is the only well-known Epiphany hymn or carol about the Biblical magi that avoids referring to them as either \\"magi\\" or \\"kings\\" and does not state how many there were.  Lyrics  As with gladness men of old Did the guiding star behold As with joy they hailed its light Leading onward, beaming bright So, most gracious God, may we Evermore be led to Thee As with joyful steps they sped To that lowly manger bed There to bend the knee before Thee whom heaven and earth adore So may we with willing feet Ever seek Thy mercy-seat As they offered gifts most rare At that manger rude and bare So may we with holy joy Pure, and free from sin's alloy All our costliest treasures bring Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King Holy Jesus, every day Keep us in the narrow way And, when earthly things are past Bring our ransomed souls at last Where they need no star to guide Where no clouds Thy glory hide. In the heavenly country bright Need they no created light Thou its light, its joy, its crown Thou its sun, which goes not down.

Plot  Ubaldo Impallato is a precarious elementary music teacher, for years in vain in search of a steady job, who to make ends meet with after school. Among the children entrusted to him there is also Gigetto, who unlike the other companions has a singular characteristic: at the age of six he can sing with a wonderful baritone voice. The teacher, who in the meantime has become his tutor in spite of himself since his father ended up in prison, accidentally realizes this extraordinary gift of the little one hearing him interpret The barber of Seville (Ubaldo at first thinks he hears a singer on the radio) and decides to seize the opportunity. Thanks to an excellent performance in a television program for young talents, Gigetto is an immediate success and promises to become a real gold mine. With the help of a theatrical impresario, he is even offered Verdi's Rigoletto, in the role of the hunchbacked buffoon, always in the role of baritone. But at this point the greedy uncles of the child, who previously had refused to take care of him, show up in order to steal him from his guardian and be able to exploit him in his place. Ubaldo is determined to defend the child prodigy and thwarts their maneuvers, not only for his own gain (with the notoriety acquired he is finally offered the longed-for job as a teacher, but with a letteraccia full of insults he rejects the offer to the sender) but also because she began to grow fond of him. The little one, however, is tired of a life without games and children of his age, he is tired of the greed of adults and fate gives him a hand in putting things right: Gigetto first escapes, then gets sick and has to be operated on at tonsils. However, his tonsils of extraordinary size were the secret of the formidable voice. When later, during the rehearsal of the work, it is discovered that his voice has returned to normal, the impresario is accused of fraud, and no one wants to keep Gigetto anymore, much less his uncles. Ubaldo, having vanished every dream of glory, decides to accept that last opportunity of the post as a teacher (which he had sent back to the sender by letter) managing to block the fatal letter in time before it reaches its destination. When Gigetto's father, finally released from prison, goes to retrieve the child, Impallato protests wanting to keep the child for the whole school year. But just at that moment, he reveals another extraordinary ability: he knows how to play the piano with incredible skill. But Ubaldo can no longer stand it and invites, indeed, orders his father to take the \\"monster\\" back with him before he can really go mad.

Wright was born in 1940 in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania and was a race car driver and mechanic for, among other teams, Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR), the first African American auto racing team to acquire national sponsorship in the United States.Ken Wright in 1970 with Mr. Diplomat, the Miller Brothers 1955 Chevy station wagon drag racer  Early years  Wright's friendship with the Miller brothers - Dexter G. and Leonard W. - began at age five. His love of hot rods and race cars began in earnest at age 13, when Leonard W. Miller would visit his community in a 1940 Ford hot rod convertible. Riding in the car, and watching the advanced modifications made to the motor, sparked Wright's interest in becoming a full-time automotive technician after graduating from Conestoga High School in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. He took every auto class offered in the school. In 1956, Wright co-founded the Black Hawk Auto Club, with Horace ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Sparrow and other African American youth living in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood of Wayne, Pennsylvania. In 1957, a trip with the club to the York Dragway in York, Pennsylvania piqued his interest in becoming a drag racer. After high school, he began his apprenticeship training at Sharpless Auto Body in Devon, Pennsylvania, where he learned all aspects of automotive collision repair. After learning the basics, he attended the Spring Garden Institute of Technology in Philadelphia, along with Dexter Miller. He graduated in 1962. After graduation he was employed at Horsiey‚Äôs Automotive Service Center in Narberth, Pennsylvania. In the midst of the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, Wright‚Äôs skills were extremely rare among African Americans. He was one of only a few to hold jobs in the auto body trade at a mainstream facility in one of the wealthiest regions of America. Citizens in the community, including African Americans, would note Wright‚Äôs capacity at every pass.  Educator  In 1966 Wright joined the School District of Philadelphia, where he taught automotive collision repair to adults aged 18‚Äì35 at the John F. Kennedy Center for Vocational Education. While employed by the district, he obtained a B.S. in education from Temple University in 1979. He retired from the district in 2002.  Race car driver  In 1969-70, Wright drove a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) 1955 Chevrolet station wagon to dozens of track victories for Miller Brothers Racing at Atco Dragway in Atco, New Jersey, Englishtown Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base drag strip in Burlington County, New Jersey, and the Maple Grove Raceway in Mohnton, Pennsylvania.  Black American Racers Association (BARA)  When Leonard W. Miller helped launch the Black American Racers Association (BARA) in 1972, Wright became a charter member. Through this unique group, which comprised 5,000 African American auto racers from coast to coast and encompassed drag racing teams, mechanics, car collectors, and participants in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) sports car competition, Wright met Ron Hines, a founding member of BARA, and African American NASCAR legend Wendell Scott.  Road racing mechanic  In 1973, Wright and Hines joined forces with Miller‚Äôs Brown & Williamson Tobacco (Viceroy Cigarettes)-sponsored Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR) team that fielded second-generation African American driver Benny Scott in Formula Super Vee (FSV) road racing on circuits such as Pocono Raceway, Lime Rock Park, Watkins Glen International, and Road Atlanta. Ken Wright‚Äôs broad base of other technical skills, including painting, welding, tuning motors, rebuilding transmissions and rear ends, and complete suspension work, transferred readily to BAR‚Äôs initiatives. Wright prepared the Lola T-324 and T-620. He became a loyalist of the team and was critical to its extraordinary milestones through the 1970s - a period some call ‚Äúthe last decade of the golden era of American road racing.‚Äù Wright remained on the BAR team after Viceroy‚Äôs unmatched sponsorship expired in late 1975. He was a VIP guest for Benny Scott‚Äôs and Leonard W. Miller‚Äôs induction into the Black Athletes Hall of Fame at the New York Hilton in Manhattan in 1976. The event‚Äôs master of ceremonies was actor Bill Cosby. Celebrities among the more than 1000 attendees at the formal extravaganza included African American female track star Wilma Rudolph, legendary soul singer James Brown, boxing promoter Don King, ABC television sports commentator Howard Cosell, and boxing legend Jersey Joe Walcott. Leonard W. Miller started an independent effort in FSV racing after African American driver Tommy Thompson persuaded him to continue the BAR concept in 1977. Ken Wright was a critical component of that team, helping it advance to an SCCA Northeast Championship at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania. The team, including Ken Wright, traveled to the Milwaukee Mile to race on the famed one-mile oval. FSV racing transitioned into the Mini-Indy series, where select races were paired with Indy Car events held on popular oval courses under the United States Auto Club (USAC). Wright also traveled to Texas World Speedway in College Station, Texas and other FSV races around the country that BAR entered. At a Mini-Indy event on September 27, 1978, Tommy Thompson was killed in a crash coming off the fourth turn at the 1.5-mile kidney bean-shaped Trenton Speedway, when a competitor abruptly stopped in front of him, due to a catastrophic mechanical failure.  Retirement  Ken Wright retired from hands-on mechanical race car preparation after Thompson‚Äôs death, working instead with recreational motor boats and restoring his 1961 Chevrolet Corvette. For two years BAR did not compete in auto racing, then it started afresh in grassroots competition under other names. Ken Wright remained a booster for the team, but Ron Hines emerged from retirement in 1980 to catapult BAR into several dirt track victories with his superior engine knowledge at the Flemington Speedway in Flemington, New Jersey with 19-year-old African American driver Bruce Driver. In later years Miller Racing Group, Inc. became the solid outgrowth of BAR, recruiting African American grassroots stock car drivers for NASCAR competition in the Southeast and a Jamaican driver for Formula BMW Americas from 1990 to the present. Leonard W. Miller‚Äôs son, Leonard T. Miller, has been a significant element in those efforts. Ken Wright, Ron Hines, and Leonard W. Miller remain in close contact, attending and entering classic car shows and competitions around the United States.  References  * Miller, Leonard W.

After 1991 he still contributed regularly to Motor Sport magazine, continuing a career that lasted eighty-one years. He also co-founded the Vintage Sports Car Club, and founded the Brooklands Society in 1967 among numerous contributions to the emerging vintage car scene. At his death he was considered the longest-serving journalist in the UK, having submitted his first article in 1930 and his last one just a week before his death. Early years and racing career Boddy was born in Wandsworth, London in 1913, to a Welsh mother and an English father who would shortly be killed in World War I. He became interested in cars from an early age and began to build up an encyclopaedic knowledge of motoring, leaving school in 1928 and immersing himself in automotive publications and the Brooklands racing scene. In tandem with his journalistic work, Boddy drove the original HRG sports car at the Lewes Speed Trials on 4 September 1937 with a best time of 27.4 sec, finishing third in the novices class.Motor Sport, October 1937, Pages 433-434; Bugatti Owners' Club Lewes Speed Trials, Saturday, 4 September 1937, Results. Boddy entered his Lancia at the Prescott opening rally on 10 April 1938; his 1924 Aston Martin being commended by the judges in the Best Kept Car Competition.Bugantics, Vol 7, No. 3, May 1938, Page 9. He also entered the Lancia at the first Prescott speed hillclimb on 15 May 1938.Prescott Speed Hillclimb, 15 May 1938, Official Programme. Boddy was riding as passenger when Sydney Allard won the last speed event to be held in England prior to World War Two. Having set the fastest time at the Horndean Speed Trials, their car overturned past the finish line and both occupants were thrown clear and uninjured.Motor Sport, November 1946, Page 247. Journalism Boddy's first published article, in Motor Sport in 1930, was on the history of the Brooklands track, where he had first gone in 1927. He worked with Brooklands Track & Air for two and half years from 1931, and was appointed editor of the struggling Motor Sport in 1936. He wrote under the initials W.B., as company policy insisted that full names could not be used as bylines, though his identity was common knowledge. Throughout World War II he was employed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Farnborough working on Air Publications, but he kept Motor Sport going in his spare time for the duration. After the war, he recruited Denis Jenkinson for Motor Sport to provide race reports. In February 1946 Motor Sport published a four-page \\"Obituary\\" for the Brooklands circuit, with the headline: \\"Built at his own expense for the nation's good, by the late Mr. H. F. Locke King - 1906. Betrayed by bureaucracy and declared an industrial area - 1946.\\"Motor Sport, February 1946, Pages 31‚Äì34. A Brooklands expert, he wrote the authoritative histories of the track and in 1967 founded the Brooklands Society, later the Brooklands Trust Members, to preserve the remains of the track and its facilities. He also made a reputation for road tests that pulled no punches, often incurring the wrath of manufacturers and advertisers. He is considered a driving force behind the creation of the vintage car movement, each edition of Motor Sport providing unique coverage of vintage cars and events. He was a veteran of 39 London to Brighton Runs. His editorship was also notable for his campaigns on motoring issues, such as against the 70 mph speed limit. Boddy retired as editor in 1991, though he continued to contribute to the magazine until his death in Powys, Wales in 2011, having been awarded an MBE in 1997 for his contributions to journalism. He was survived by three daughters and had lived alone after the 1998 death of his wife Winifred Holbrook, whom he had married in 1948.

species Herpyllus ecclesiasticus is commonly called the eastern parson spider, after the abdominal markings resembling an old-style cravat worn by clergy in the 18th century. It is mainly found in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, i.e., Alberta, Canada east to Nova Scotia, Canada and south to Tamaulipas, Mexico and Florida, USA. Individuals can be found throughout the year. They can be found in homes and under rocks or logs in deciduous forests. Description Individuals are covered with black hairs on the cephalothorax and gray hairs on the abdomen.

By her marriage to Louis Fran√ßois Joseph, Prince of Conti, her first cousin, she became the Countess of La Marche and later the Princess of Conti; and was a member of the French court of King Louis XV and King Louis XVI. She was the last Princess of Conti, and died without issue. Biography She was born at the Ducal Palace of Modena, the fourth daughter and eighth child of Francesco III d'Este, Duke of Modena, the Sovereign Duke of Modena and his young wife Charlotte Agla√© d'Orl√©ans, Mademoiselle de Valois ‚Äî granddaughter of Louis XIV of France and Madame de Montespan. Her older sister Maria Teresa was her eldest surviving sibling followed by her brother the future Ercole III d'Este, Duke of Modena. The rest of her siblings would die unmarried. Maria Fortunata was known to have been very pious and at the same time rather timid but charming. Her mother separated from her father in the 1740s after an affair with the Duke of Richelieu was discovered at the Modenese court. Exiled to France, Charlotte Agla√© still managed to help arrange the marriages of two of her daughters. The eldest Maria Teresa Felicitas married her second cousin, the Duke of Penthi√®vre, the wealthiest man in France and the future in laws of Philippe √âgalit√©. Maria Fortunata also married a cousin, Louis Fran√ßois Joseph de Bourbon, the heir to the Prince of Conti. Marriage As the heir of his father, her husband was known by the courtesy title of comte de La Marche at court. The marriage contract was signed in Milan on 3 January 1759 by the French ambassador to the court of Turin. A wedding by proxy took place in Milan on 7 February of the same year. It was celebrated in person on the 27th of February at Nangis-en-Brie in France. Maria Fortunata's father settled upon her a dowry of one million livres. In addition, upon her arrival in France, her husband was given a gift of 150,000 livres from King Louis XV. The young comtesse de La Marche was presented to the King, the Queen and the rest of the royal family on 5 March 1759 by the Dowager Princess of Conti, her husbands widowed grandmother as well as her mothers own first cousin. The couple did not get along and never had any children. Many at court said this state of affairs was due to the influence of her husband's mistress, Marie Anne V√©ron√®se, known as Mademoiselle Coraline. V√©ron√®se had been a dancer at an Italian theatre. Louis Fran√ßois and his mistress had two illegitimate children together, born in 1761 and 1767. In 1768, Maria Fortunata was asked to present her niece Louise Marie Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Penthi√®vre, to the King and the court. Her niece would eventually marry Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Chartres, the future Philipe √âgalit√©, in April 1769. In 1770, the marriage of the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XVI, and the Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria took place. Marie Fortun√©e, as she was known in France, and her husband were one of twelve couples invited to dine with the newlyweds in the Op√©ra of the Palace of Versailles, which had been constructed for the royal wedding. Princess of Conti Carmontelle Maria Fortunata's arms as Princess of Conti In 1776, Marie Fortun√©e's father-in-law died making her husband the head of the House of Conti. Pious, discreet and very cultured, Marie Fortun√©e was not destined to be part of the new Queen's inner circle at Versailles. She maintained very good relations with her brother-in-law, the Duke of Penthi√®vre, who had lost his wife in 1754. She also got on well with her two nieces, the Princess of Lamballe and the future Duchess of Orl√©ans. While at the French court, in 1784 she met Gustav III of Sweden, styled incognito as the Count of Haga who was a guest at the H√¥tel de Toulouse and later on she met Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great. She also met her niece Maria Beatrice d'Este and her husband Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in 1786. The latter pair were styled as the Count and Countess of Nettembourg. Ferdinand was a son of Empress Maria Theresa. =Exile= The Conti couple officially separated in 1777 even though they had lived apart since 1775. In 1780, Marie Fortun√©e acquired the Ch√¢teau de Triel, a place which would become her favourite haunt. During the crisis of 1789, when the Estates General was called at Versailles, Marie Fortun√©e supported the royal family and even took part in a march to the Church of Saint Louis. She later escaped revolutionary France under the name of the comtesse de Triel. After first taking refuge in Brussels, Marie Fortun√©e eventually settled in Chamb√©ry, then a part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1791, she moved, this time to Fribourg which was a small village in Switzerland known for its large settlement of √©migr√©s. The town also had strong religious ties, another attraction for the pious princess. In 1794, she let her great-niece Ad√©la√Øde d'Orl√©ans stay with her after her escape from France. Ad√©la√Øde's mother, the duchesse d'Orl√©ans, had been imprisoned in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. The elderly Marie Fortun√©e and Ad√©la√Øde d'Orl√©ans set up a new home in Bavaria. During the spring of 1800, the pair and their household were forced to flee again to Hungary in oder to avoid the hostilities of Napoleon. It was while in Hungary that she received another visit from her niece, Maria Beatrice. The princess was the heiress of Marie Fortun√©e's elder brother, who had lost the duchies of Modena and Reggio in 1796 as a result of the Napoleonic creation of the Cispadane Republic. =Death= 1801 saw the reunion of Ad√©la√Øde d'Orl√©ans and her mother, the now dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans, in Barcelona after her release from prison and exile from France. Later, Marie Fortun√©e decided to retire to the Convent of the Visitation in Venice. She moved to the convent on 19 October with three of her maids and her faithful friend, the comtesse des Roches, who had accompanied the princess all throughout her exile in Europe. A victim of pleurisy, the princess died on 21 September 1803 at the age of seventy-one. She was buried in the chapel of the convent. Her brother, Ercole III of Modena, and her sister, Matilde d'Este, are also buried there. The comtesse des Roches died some time after Marie Fortun√©e and was also buried there. Marie Fortun√©e's husband died in 1814.

Chopin's last piano made by the Pleyel company (no 14810) displayed in the Fryderyk Chopin Museum in Warsaw; Chopin played and composed on this instrument in 1848‚Äì49 Pleyel et Cie (\\"Pleyel and Company\\") was a French piano manufacturing firm founded by the composer Ignace Pleyel in 1807. In 1815, Pleyel's son Camille joined him as a business partner. The firm provided pianos to Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and also ran a concert hall, the Salle Pleyel, where Chopin performed his first ‚Äì and last ‚Äì Paris concerts. Pleyel's major contribution to piano development was the first use of a metal frame in a piano. Pleyel pianos were the choice of composers such as Debussy, Saint- Sa√´ns, Ravel, de Falla and Stravinsky and of pianists and teachers Alfred Cortot, Philip Manuel and Gavin Williamson. Nineteenth-century musicians involved in the company's management included Joseph O'Kelly and Georges Pfeiffer. History Around 1815, Pleyel was the first to introduce the short, vertically strung cottage upright piano, or \\"pianino\\" to France, adapting the design made popular in Britain by Robert Wornum.Margaret Cranmer, \\"Pleyel (ii)\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). Their pianos were such a success that in 1834 the company employed 250 workers and produced 1000 pianos annually. The company's success led them to invest in experiments, resulting in the double piano in 1890, invented by Hungarian composer Em√°nuel Mo√≥r. Although not the first company to experiment with building two pianos into the same frame, Pleyel's instrument, patented as the \\"Duo-Clave\\", was by far the most successful and produced the largest instruments. The company manufactured a very small number of double pianos in the 1890s and continued to make them until the 1920s. CDs can be bought today of performances on some of these pianos. In 1913, Pleyel built the \\"Jungle Piano\\" for use by Albert Schweitzer in his hospital in Lambar√©n√© (French Equatorial Africa ‚Äì now Gabon). It was fitted with pedal attachments (to operate like an organ pedal-keyboard) and built with tropical woods that would acclimate to conditions there. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Pleyel firm produced the first chromatic harp. In the early 20th century, at the behest of Wanda Landowska, it helped to revive the harpsichord. Pleyel also pioneered the player piano with the Pleyela line of pianos. These were often small pianos of an unusual design. Today Pleyel continued to manufacture pianos through 2013, under the corporate auspices of the Manufacture Fran√ßaise de Pianos company. In the 1980s, the Pleyel company bought out the Erard and Gaveau piano companies which also manufactured pianos in France. The Pleyel pianos of today incorporated improvements of these companies and others. In the last two decades, Pleyel Piano was bought by the same family which had bought the Salle Pleyel concert hall in order to revive the name and quality of Pleyel pianos. They built a new factory in the south of France and started making a line of newly designed and improved pianos. Then, in 2008, they decided to downsize the factory and lines of pianos. They moved the factory back to Paris and opened a new factory where they began introducing new pianos designed by famous designers. The red spruce used by Pleyel comes from the Fiemme Valley in Trentino, Italy. After full assembly of a piano, the instrument receives a further 30‚Äì40 hours of fine-tuning. In 2010 fortepiano maker Paul McNulty made the first in modern time copy of Pleyel 1830 (original in Paris Museum of Music), now at the Fryderyk Chopin Institute being used for International Chopin Competition on Period Instruments, as well as for concerts and recordings At the end of 2013, the company announced it would cease manufacturing pianos in France.

In 1982, \\"The Gunslinger\\" was collected with four other stories King published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction as The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. \\"The Gunslinger\\" formed the first chapter of the book, and was slightly revised for the inclusion. Plot summary The story begins with the sentence, \\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\" The gunslinger comes across a hut in the desert owned by a farmer named Brown, who has a pet raven named Zoltan. The gunslinger stays the night and, at Brown's urging, tells him the story of what happened to him the last time he came across people. He had been traveling through Tull, the last town before the desert began. He made his way to the local saloon and learned from Allie, its bartender, that the town drunk Nort had died from eating narcotic devil-grass. The man in black (calling himself \\"Walter O'Dim\\") brought Nort back to life and told Allie that if she said a particular word to Nort, he would tell her everything he saw and heard during his time in the afterlife. Sensing that Walter had laid a trap for both him and Allie, the gunslinger warned her never to say the trigger word in Nort's hearing. He next met and interrogated Sylvia Pittston, a fanatical preacher who believed that the man in black had impregnated her with the offspring of the Crimson King. She warned her congregation to beware of the gunslinger, referring to him as a malicious \\"Interloper,\\" and eventually stirred the entire town to attack him. Even Allie joined the mob, having fallen into Walter's trap and gone insane from Nort's revelations. The gunslinger killed all 58 residents of Tull, then headed out into the desert. After telling Brown his story, the gunslinger fills his water skins and continues across the desert, in pursuit of his quarry. Among other minor additions and deletions made by King for the 2003 revised version of the novella, the word \\"parsecs\\" in the opening paragraph was changed to \\"eternity,\\" and the story of Tull is expanded by King to include an additional exchange between Allie and Walter.

The Teacher's Highland Cream brand was registered in 1884.

Teacher's states that it uses \\"fully smoked peat single malt whisky from The Ardmore distillery as its fingerprint whisky\\" along with about 30 other single malt whiskies. Most of the output of the Ardmore distillery is used to produce the Teacher's brand. Brand history In 1830, William Teacher took advantage of the new \\"Excise Act\\" and began selling whisky. From 1832 he was selling it from his wife's grocery shop in Glasgow. By 1856, with help from his sons, he was granted a licence for consumption and opened his own dram shop. He died in 1876, leaving his two sons William Jr and Adam in charge of the company, known as William Teacher & Sons Ltd. They moved the business to St. Enoch Square, where it remained until 1991. The company opened its Ardmore distillery in 1898, ensuring a guaranteed supply of Scotch for its Teacher's Highland Cream blend. The brand entered the US market after the end of Prohibition in the United States; the first shipment of Teacher's was sent on the Cunard steamer Scythia. Teacher & Sons acquired the Glendronach distillery in 1960 and built a modern blending and bottling plant in Glasgow in 1962. In 1976, Teacher & Sons was bought by Allied Breweries, which became part of Allied Lyons in 1978 and then Allied Domecq in 1994. The Glendronach distillery was shut down in 1996 and was later sold off to Chivas Brothers after being reopened in 2002. In 2005, Allied Domecq was taken over by Pernod Ricard.

London: Printed for E. Davis, 1662 which compared his humble beginnings to his ultimate fortune. Life The first recorded date of Audley's life is his baptism in January 1577. He was the tenth of eleven children of John Audley, a mercer, and his wife Maudlin or Margaret Hare, daughter of a wealthy Cheapside mercer named John Hare. His father died in 1579, and left \\"considerable property, both real and personal\\". After being admitted to the Inner Temple in 1603, he became a clerk of the Court of Wards and Liveries, a position for which he allegedly paid ¬£3000, until it was abolished in 1660. In his position, he became extremely rich, and survived a ¬£100,000 loss after the court's suppression in 1646. However, all the money and records remained in his possession long after this event. Estates Through his wealth, Audley was able to buy and invest in land. He bought the manor of Ebury, in Westminster, from Lionel Cranfield, the first Earl of Middlesex. Deeply in debt, the Earl sold it cheaply, but had a negative opinion of Audley himself, whom he described as \\"barbarous\\", with \\"looks [that] show his disposition\\", and one who bore himself \\"loftily respectless and peremptory\\". The property later passed through his great- grandniece, Mary Davies, wife of Sir Thomas Grosvenor. Her inheritance enriched the Grosvenor family through one of Audley's legacies, which still present today: Audley Street, running through the old Ebury estate in Mayfair, is named after Hugh. On another occasion, when he bought land in Buckenham, Norfolk, Audley withheld the payments promised and harassed the creditors with law suits. His cunning was revealed and condemned by William Hone, who described an incident with a draper with a ¬£200 debt. Audley bought the debt, for which the draper offered him ¬£50; but Audley refused. Instead, he forced the draper to sign a contract ordering him to pay a penny, doubled every month, for twenty years, which gradually accumulated into more than the actual debt. According to the anonymous and posthumous pamphlet, Audley had \\"the clue of a resolved mind, which made plaine to him all the rough passages he met with\\". Death Audley died in his 86th year, at the home of the rector of St. Clement Danes, London, on 15 November 1662. On 21 November, his body was interred in the Temple Church in London.

Formally opened in 1991, the museum is operated by the independent Brooklands Museum Trust Ltd, a private limited company (No.02109945) and a registered UK charity (No.296661); its aim is to conserve, protect and interpret the unique heritage of the Brooklands site. History of Brooklands Brooklands was the birthplace of British motorsport and aviation and the site of many engineering and technological achievements throughout eight decades of the 20th century. The racing circuit was constructed by local landowner Hugh F. Locke King in 1907 and was the first purpose-built racing circuit in the world. Many records were set there. Many aviation firsts are also associated with Brooklands, which soon became one of Britain's first aerodromes. It attracted many aviation pioneers prior to World War I, and was also a leading aircraft design and manufacturing centre in the 20th century, producing a remarkable total of some 18,600 new aircraft of nearly 260 types between 1908 and 1987 (see McSwein, D R). Brooklands-based aircraft companies such as Bleriot, Hawker, Sopwith, Martinsyde, and Vickers were key players in the early years of aviation and were crucial to its early development. The 'Daily Mail Round Britain Air Race' of 1911 started and finished at Brooklands, and both the event and the location later influenced the theme of the classic 1965 Twentieth Century Fox British film comedy 'Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines' (based at the fictitious but remarkably similar 'Brookley'). Flying training was an important function of the aerodrome both before World War I and between the wars. Visitors can see many displays and exhibits portraying the contribution made by Brooklands to the British aircraft industry in both world wars, and also in the post-war years with Vickers and later the British Aircraft Corporation and British Aerospace. Vickers purchased the site in 1946 for ¬£330,000, which allowed them to produce civilian aircraft. The most notable of these was the Vickers Viscount, of which 444 were built between Brooklands and Bournemouth. In 1959 the Vanguard was test flown from Brooklands. In 1962 the test flight for the prototype VC10 also took place at Brooklands, and subsequently all 53 production VC10s were flown out as well before being completed and test flown at Wisley.  Museum history  Events leading to the establishment of the Museum = Outbreak of World War II  The last race meeting ever held at Brooklands took place on 7 August 1939. On 3 September 1939 Britain declared war on Germany and the remaining scheduled motor racing and motorcycling meetings were cancelled. Brooklands, under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, was turned over exclusively to aircraft production for the duration of the War, Vickers continuing to produce Wellington bombers and Hawker assembling its Hurricane fighters at their respective facilities, with some of the smaller engineering companies located at Brooklands also taking on war contracts.  Aftermath of War  Six years of war, including several air raids, and the expansion of aircraft production across the site, had caused a great deal of damage to the Brooklands track. The British Government was also in favour of extending the use of the site for aircraft production and early in 1946 implied that the choice for the owner of the property, Brooklands (Weybridge) Limited, was either to sell the land or wait for it to be compulsorily purchased. A sale to Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd for ¬£330,000 was duly completed on 1 July 1946.  Jubilee events and foundation of the Brooklands Society  On 6 July 1957 the Brooklands Memorial was unveiled by Lord Brabazon of Tara, at an event organised by Vickers-Armstrongs to mark the 50th anniversary of the opening of Brooklands motor course. June 1967 saw a rally take place on the site, organised by Godalming & District Round Table, marking the track's diamond jubilee. The latter event was a catalyst for the formation of the Brooklands Society, whose objects were to promote interest in Brooklands (for both its motoring and aviation influences) and to preserve what remained of the track and infrastructure.Memorandum of Association, The Brooklands Society Limited In 1977, Weybridge Museum held a temporary exhibition on the site, 'Wings over Brooklands', curated by Morag Barton and supported by (among others) British Aerospace Weybridge and the Brooklands Society. The same year, the Brooklands Society obtained outline planning consent for a museum on a 40-acre portion of the site, but lacked the funds to acquire the land and pursue its plans. Nevertheless, Society members worked hard throughout this time to clear the track of the trees, vegetation and debris that had been allowed to build up since the track closed in 1939.  Acquisition of the site and opening of the Museum  In 1982, the 40-acre site was bought by a tobacco company, Gallaher Ltd, which retained 10 acres for an office building but, in 1984, leased the remaining 30 acres to Elmbridge Borough Council for the purpose of founding a museum. Restoration of the Clubhouse and part of the track on the site began and Brooklands Museum Trust Ltd was incorporated on 12 March 1987, with Sir Peter Masefield as chairman and Morag Barton as the first Museum Director. In April 1989 HRH Prince Michael of Kent became Royal Patron. The Museum was formally opened in 1991. In the 2002 New Year's Honours List, Morag Barton was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of her services to the Brooklands Museum Trust.  Museum site  The museum is located on of the original 1907 motor-racing circuit. It includes four Listed buildings: the 1907 Brooklands Automobile Racing Club Clubhouse and Members' Hill Restaurant buildings, the 1911 Flight Ticket Office, and a 1940 Bellman aircraft hangar. Surviving sections of the 1937 Campbell Circuit, the 1907 Finishing Straight and Members' Banking (the steepest section of the former racing circuit), the 1909 Test Hill, and a WW2 'Bofors' gun tower are all important parts of the Brooklands Scheduled Monument which was extended in 2002. The entire Brooklands site was designated a Conservation Area by Surrey County Council in 1989. Collection The museum is open daily and displays a wide range of Brooklands-related motoring and aviation exhibits ranging from giant racing cars such as the 24-litre Napier-Railton, motorcycles, and bicycles to a unique collection of Hawker and Vickers/British Aircraft Corporation-built aircraft including Concorde (G-BBDG). Concorde, G-BBDG, on display Other museum exhibits include flyable Bleriot XI and Sopwith Camel replicas built by Mike Beach and Viv Bellamy, respectively. The Camel is maintained in 'live' condition and performs regular engine running demonstrations at museum events during the year. A Grand Prix motor racing exhibition which features a Formula One simulator can also be seen. A major new visitor attraction, 'The Concorde Experience', opened in August 2006, centenary celebrations occurred in 2007 and a full-size modern working replica of Alliott Verdon Roe's 1908 'Avroplane' was completed and unveiled on 7 June 2008. The museum also owns and, until late 2009, operated an airworthy Vickers Vimy replica which was built in America in 1994 to re-enact the design's three record-breaking long distance flights of 1919‚Äì20. Having helped commemorate the 90th anniversaries of the world's first Transatlantic flight and the first flight from England to Australia, the aeroplane was finally retired and flown into Brooklands on 15 November 2009. Less than a week later it was on display with a supporting exhibition in the museum's main hangar and in 2016 it was relocated to a purpose-built Vimy Pavilion where it is now kept maintained 'live' condition and performs occasional engine running demonstrations on the nearby Race Track. In early 2011 the museum received (on loan from its owners) the historic fuselage of the Supermarine Swift F.4 prototype, WK198, which held the World Absolute Air Speed Record when flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow in Libya on 26 September 1953. The museum celebrated the centenary of the opening of the Brooklands Circuit in 2007, 100 years of aviation at Brooklands in 2008 and the Test Hill's centenary in 2009. Centred on a restored Hawker Hurricane, a temporary exhibition about Brooklands in the Battle of Britain was unveiled on 15 September 2010 and explained how the aircraft factories here made the site a prime target for the Luftwaffe in 1940 and listed the names of almost 90 people killed when Vickers was badly bombed on 4 September and also the names of Luftwaffe aircrew casualties that day. Another new temporary exhibition about the Vickers Wellington was centred on the Loch Ness Wellington and was opened by Robin Holmes, Penelope Keith, Norman Parker and Ken Wallis on 15 June 2011 ‚Äì the 75th anniversary of the first flight of the type's forerunner, prototype Vickers B.9/32. In 2012, a significant Brooklands aviation anniversary ‚Äì 50 years of the Vickers VC10 airliner ‚Äì was marked by the staging of a VC10 Symposium and the official opening of a new VC10 exhibition by the late Sir George Edwards' daughter Angela Newton on 29 June ‚Äì half a century after this remarkable aeroplane was first flown here by 'Jock' Bryce, Brian Trubshaw and Bill Cairns. On the evening of 29 September 2012, with help from museum volunteers, contractors moved the ex-British Airways/Heathrow Airport 40% scale Concorde model G-CONC to a new location at the south end of Brooklands Drive, where it now marks the main entrance to Brooklands Museum. The Brooklands contribution to the Royal Air Force's legendary 617 Squadron 'Dambusters' attack on Germany's Ruhr Valley reservoirs on 16‚Äì17 May 1943 was commemorated on 12 May 2013 by three impressive flypasts of Brooklands Museum given by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Avro Lancaster ‚Äì as a special 70th anniversary tribute to Barnes Wallis and the Vickers-Armstrongs design and experimental department engineers who made the 'Upkeep' mine such a successful weapon. The museum's aviation exhibits include a 1914 Sopwith Schneider floatplane replica, built by volunteers at Brooklands and funded by the Kingston Aviation Heritage Trust who donated it to the museum on 27 November 2013 and a 1961 BAC/Hunting Percival Jet Provost T.3A which arrived on loan from nearby Brooklands College on 22 May 2014. Prototype Beagle 206X G-ARRM recently returned to Brooklands for the first time since 1994 having been loaned to Farnborough Aviation Museum from 2011 to 2017. In February 2015, the museum secured a ¬£4.681 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards a ¬£7 million Brooklands Aircraft Factory and Race-Track Revival Project. This major scheme involved dismantling, fully restoring and relocating the 1940 Bellman Hangar away from the Race Track, building an adjacent two-storey Flight Shed with stores and workshop on the ground floor and restoring the north end of Finishing Straight. The latter was completed in time for the 110th anniversary of the Track opening in June 2017 and the rest of the project was finished and officially opened as the Brooklands Aircraft Factory by HRH Prince Michael of Kent on 13 November 2017.  Supporters' organisation  The Brooklands Trust Members, formed in 2008 after the Friends of Brooklands Museum and the Brooklands Club amalgamated, is the official supporters' organisation for the museum. London Bus Museum In August 2011, the new London Bus Museum opened in new premises on land at Brooklands Museum. Formerly the private Cobham Bus Museum from 1972 to 2011, LBM is itself an Accredited Museum (provisional), displaying some 35 historic London buses dating back to the 1870s, together with associated artefacts, and is run by the London Bus Preservation Trust, a Registered Charity. Entry to London Bus Museum is on a joint ticket with Brooklands Museum with one admission charge covering both museums.

Plot summary Roland and Jake manage to make their way out of the desert, into lusher territory. They come across a Speaking Ring. At night, Jake is drawn to the ring by the Oracle contained within, but Roland saves the boy before the Oracle can drain him to death via sexual intercourse. Roland restrains Jake at their campsite and gives him the jawbone taken from the skeleton in the way station, as a means of warding off the Oracle's influence. He then goes down to the Speaking Ring, taking mescaline to fortify himself. When he reaches the ring, he has a powerful psychosexual exchange with the Oracle, who tells him of Eddie Dean and Susannah Dean. The next day they leave the campsite and eventually come to a mountain. The man in black is there, and taunts Roland, telling him they will speak on the other side. Roland asks Jake to make his choice as to whether he wishes to leave the gunslinger or accompany him, and Jake agrees to come with him, knowing that Roland plans to sacrifice him in order to reach the man in black.

The year 2019 marks the RFF‚Äôs 50th anniversary; the festival is scheduled for August 9 to 11, 2019. In addition to the summer festival, the RFF hosts a concert series throughout the year.

Its objectives were ‚Äúto preserve and to promote the folk arts in its traditional and modern definition primarily in Regina, Saskatchewan,‚Äù and ‚Äúto educate the people of Regina as to folk traditions in the arts upon which their lifestyles are based by means deemed by the directors.‚Äù Richard Wegrzyn, Peter Sawchyn, Peter Hilsden, Gayle Warren (now Bryanton) and Craig Mahood applied for incorporation and were its first directors.‚ÄúProvince of Saskatchewan The Societies Act Application for Incorporation.‚Äù Registered Feb. 7, 1975.

In 1975, the fee for an annual membership was $10. In 2018, it was $15 or 15 hours of volunteerism. In its first two decades, the festival changed venues numerous times. It was hosted at the University of Regina in various locations: the Newman Centre at the year-old Campion College in 1969 and the Education Auditorium (1970, 1973, 1975, 1981-84) on the newer south Regina campus; and the Fine Arts Building (1976-80) on the old campus (the former Normal School, and the current Canada Saskatchewan Production Studios or Soundstage). In 1971 and 1972, it was held in the Jubilee Theatre at the Centre of the Arts, now known as the Conexus Arts Centre. In 1974, it took place at the Globe Theatre, then located at 2124 11th Ave. =Moving outdoors= In its first seven years, the Regina Folk Festival took place in March. It was scheduled in later months as the years progressed ‚Äî four years in a row in April, then four in May.

The daytime concerts are free to attend. When the first festival was held in 1969, it was $1 for a single night ticket or $2.50 for all three nights. From 1985 to 1993, this wasn‚Äôt the case. To draw a larger audience, organizers opted to offer free admission to the festival, now located in Victoria Park.

In 1994, with an accumulated deficit of $14,000, organizers decided to cancel the festival. Part of that was due to a failed fundraising initiative, a lottery calendar that lost $8,000. Despite successful fundraising efforts, the 1993 festival lost $9,000. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been paying last year‚Äôs bills with this year‚Äôs money for the past three years,‚Äù Haggman told the Leader-Post. ‚Äú(Cancelling) gives us the chance to clear up this situation and go into 1995 with a good, workable plan.‚Äù A donation from ticket sales to the musical Hair, which toured to the Centre of the Arts in late April 1994, helped pay down more than $5,000 of its debt, and organizers felt confident they would return in 1995.Pilon, Bernard. ‚ÄúFolk festival debt trimmed.‚Äù May 2, 1994.

From RFF organization archives. Modern era (1995 - present) Since 1995, the Regina Folk Festival has taken place ‚Äî and grown ‚Äî in Victoria Park. With the mainstage set up in the northwest corner, there are three smaller stages spread throughout the park (including a children‚Äôs stage), and one on the F.W. Hill Mall. Much of that growth has been due to Sandra Butel, artistic director who began working with the festival in 1999. When she began, she was the only paid staff member of the festival with a $100,000 budget. In 2012, the RFF had a $1-million budget, four full-time staff and contract employees. With a passion for accessibility, she has tried to build a festival that is appealing to varied age groups and demographics. =Daytime entertainment= The free daytime concert stages ‚Äî which first became part of the festival in 19761976 Regina Folk Festival program. From RFF organization archives. ‚Äî are a priority for Butel and the RFF. Butel told the Leader-Post prior to the 2018 festival, ‚ÄúThe diversity of the audience we see during the day is much greater than what we see at night. The free day time allows us to make it a welcoming place for everybody and that‚Äôs very important to us. We‚Äôve been working really hard to find new sources of funding. We started a donor campaign, for those who actually afford it, they can contribute to that and make sure that it still exists for people that can‚Äôt afford a ticket.‚Äù During the day, patrons can also partake in activities, thanks to the RFF‚Äôs partnerships with Common Weal and MacKenzie Art Gallery. A children‚Äôs area offers a stage with child-specific entertainment, crafts, face-painting and a parade. =Food and arts vendors= With the official opening of the City Square Plaza (adjacent to Victoria Park‚Äôs north side) in 2012, the arts‚Äô and vendor markets had room to expand. The 2018 festival had 18 food vendors ‚Äî including Afghan Cuisine, Bon Burger, Michael‚Äôs Coffee Shop & Bakery, Selam Ethiopian Restaurant, and Malinche ‚Äî and more than 29 arts vendors‚Äî including Mortise and Tenon, Kat Cadegan Jewellery, and Naked Kitty Naturals. =Other details= Since as early as 1997, Calgary-based Big Rock Brewery has sponsored the beer garden.1997 Regina Folk Festival program. From RFF organization archives. In 2016, the RFF implemented a new greening initiative, with volunteers specifically overseeing recycling, composting and waste. This was in hopes of diverting 90 per cent or more of the festival‚Äôs waste from the landfill. Year-round, the RFF relies on some 800 volunteers to help run concert series and the festival weekend. Concert series and Winterruption As long as it has existed, the Regina Folk Festival (and its predecessor, the Folk Guild) has presented concerts outside of the festival weekend. In the early days, these were known as ‚Äúcoffeehouses‚Äù and were initially held on a weekly basis.1970 Regina Folk Festival pamphlet. From RFF organization archives. In the 1980s, this led to a concert series. In 2015, the RFF announced it would add a winter festival. The first Winterruption ran from January 21 to 23, 2016, in Regina, in partnership with the Broadway Theatre in Saskatoon, which also had a festival. There were four shows. Winterruption has become an annual event. In 2017 and 2018, the festivals ran three nights with two shows per night. In 2019, Winterruption‚Äôs five-night series had one show per night, including an evening devoted to spoken-word poetry, featuring Word Up Regina performers, Zoey Roy and Shane Koyczan.

For example, applied to file systems, it can identify that a folder labeled ‚Äúcar‚Äù is semantically equivalent to another folder ‚Äúautomobile‚Äù because they are synonyms in English. The proposed technique works on lightweight ontologies, namely, tree structures where each node is labeled by a natural language sentence, for example in English.lightweight ontologies These sentences are translated into a formal logical formula (according to an unambiguous, artificial language). The formula codifies the meaning of the node, accounting for its position in the graph. For example, in case the folder ‚Äúcar‚Äù is under another folder ‚Äúred‚Äù we can say that the meaning of the folder ‚Äúcar‚Äù is ‚Äúred car‚Äù in this case. This is translated into the logical formula ‚Äúred AND car‚Äù. The output of matching is a mapping, namely a set of semantic correspondences between the two graphs. Each mapping element is attached with a semantic relation, for example equivalence. Among all possible mappings, the minimal mapping is such that all other mapping elements can be computed from the minimal set in an amount of time proportional to the size of the input graphs (linear time) and none of the elements in the minimal set can be dropped without preventing such a computation. The main advantage of minimal mappings is that they minimize the number of nodes for subsequent processing. Notice that this is a rather important feature because the number of possible mappings can reach n √ó m with n and m the size of the two input ontologies. In particular, minimal mappings become crucial with large ontologies, e.g. DMOZ, where even relatively small (non-minimal) subsets of the number of possible mapping elements, potentially millions of them, are unmanageable. Minimal mappings provide usability advantages. Many systems and corresponding interfaces, mostly graphical, have been provided for the management of mappings but all of them scale poorly with the number of nodes. Visualizations of large graphs are rather messy.http://eprints.biblio.unitn.it/archive/00001461/01/042.pdf Maintenance of smaller mappings is much easier, faster and less error prone.

The experiment lasted from 1869-1879\\\\. It was not considered as part of the larger eugenics history because of its radical religious context. The term \\"stirpiculture\\" was used by John Humphrey Noyes, founder of the Oneida Community, to refer to his system of eugenics, or the breeding of humans to achieve desired perfections within the species. Noyes derived stirpiculture from the Latin word \\"stirps\\", which means \\"stock, stem, or root\\" (Carden). It has been claimed that Noyes coined the term two decades before Francis Galton created the term \\"eugenics\\". In 1904, Galton claimed that he had first come up with the term and \\"deliberately changed it for eugenics,\\" a claim supported in print by George Willis Cooke. In his 1883 book Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development, Galton noted that his new term \\"eugenics\\" was a suitable replacement for the older term \\"viriculture\\" that he had invented, suggesting that he had confused the two terms \\"viriculture\\" and \\"stirpiculture.\\" Origins of the Oneida stirpiculture experiment Until the late 1860s, John Humphrey Noyes and his community prevented the unintentional conception of children through their practice of male continence (a type of coitus reservatus). Instead, Noyes and the community believed in only having children with purpose and preparation. In this communal society, it was not simply about the preparedness of the parents, but rather the preparedness of the community to support a new generation. \\"A mistake was considered a serious detriment to the society\\" (Kinsley 13). In the early years of the community, when poverty was an issue, the community did not feel adequately prepared to take on the raising and support of children. Therefore, procreation was discouraged in these early days before the financial successes of the community's trap-building manufacturing. An \\"accidental\\" conception was thought to be a failure in male continence, the act that was meant to prevent unwanted pregnancies through the withholding of male ejaculation during intercourse. However, accidental conceptions did occur. Noyes developed the stirpiculture experiment through his reading and interpretations of Plato, Charles Darwin, Francis Galton and agricultural breeders. Noyes had begun to read Darwin's Principles of Breeding and Sir Francis Galton's papers and books on subjects ranging from anthropology, meteorology, horticulture, and eugenics (Circular, Vol II, No. 3, March 27, 1865). Intrigued by these readings, Noyes expanded upon these ideas and considered the potential benefits in the use of scientific propagation to create humans through intentional reproduction rather than haphazard sex. The experiment In 1869, the Oneida Community began its experiment with stirpiculture, which Noyes governed in tandem with a committee. Community men and women were paired owing to their exhibition of superior mental and spiritual qualities. The Circular, a newspaper run by the Oneida Community for the Community, printed several articles outlining Noyes' idea of what the Oneida Community should strive to achieve in its experiment: all of the qualities of Christianity's patriarchs' (Abraham's obedience, Jesus as the Son of God).Circular Vol II, No. 3, April 3, 1865 =Participants= Noyes was the main judge of the men and women selected to parent children in the experiment, but he also sought the aid of a committee. This committee approved and denied requests of community members to have a child. Many members applied as couples, and some of the couples were actually encouraged by the committee itself. There was a set of standards by which each candidate should meet; older men in the Community were especially sought after according to the community's idea of Ascending Fellowship, as Noyes believed they were much wiser and spiritually sound. Women, on the other hand, were typically between the ages of 20 and 42. Both men and women were chosen based on spiritual and virtuous qualities, as opposed to physical ones. Each potential parent was required to sign a contract committing themselves to the experiment, and most importantly to God and his human representative Noyes (Carden 62). Most important in these pledges were the promises to avoid any \\"personal feelings in regard to child-bearing\\" because it was believed that this quality would help them to better serve the experiment and most importantly, the Community. =Raising the children= Children at Oneida were raised communally, not specifically by their biological parents. They were brought up under the supervision of community \\"Mothers\\" and \\"Fathers\\" who were assigned the job of child care in a separate wing of the Oneida Community's Mansion House. Many community members helped out with this, and therefore the children were surrounded with guidance and support from multiple sources. The stirpcults were brought up in a healthy country environment with plenty of fresh air, good food, and attention, and Oneida was isolated from chronic diseases that might have affected children in more crowded areas. As they grew up in the years following the breakup, their families and friends encouraged them to go to college and to achieve worldly success; The Practice of Perfection. In part, this push toward outside education, especially scientific education, would contribute to the breakup of the Oneida Community. The first 15 months Once a child was born, he or she stayed with the mother for the first 15 months of life. During this period the mother was allowed and even encouraged to breastfeed the child. Breastfeeding was one of the only instances in which a strong attachment between mother and child was encouraged. This was due to its ability to encompass both scientific and natural views of life. Socially, this attachment is not important because it is a bond between child and mother, but rather that it is an establishment of a relationship between child and caretaker. The Children's House Once weaned from breastfeeding, the child was sent to live in the Children's House. In the early days of the community, this \\"house\\" was actually a succession of rooms in the \\"Middle House\\" (Kinsley 14). For a period of time after being weaned, children still slept with their mothers at night. Once they reached a certain age, they were discouraged from sleeping in their mothers' rooms. Still concerned with creating a bond between the child and the community, he/she would often sleep in the bed of a community member. This member changed periodically so no special attachments could be formed, and thus detract from the overall communal commitment. Values of non-attachment Guidelines were established by the community to help direct parents in establishing an appropriate relationship with their child. Most of these guidelines were an extension of the principles of non-attachment and commitment to the communal ideal. The concern was that an excessive relationship would fail to appropriately teach the child the communal fundamentals of the community. It was acceptable to be attached, as long as this was a general emotion of love and trust to the community rather than to a particular individual (Youcha). A mother's excessive attachment to her child was a potential cause for illness or suffering on the child's part. In cases like this, it was often prescribed that the mother or child be moved to another community site for a temporary amount of time (Kinsley). =Results= The experiment with stirpiculture in the Oneida Community lasted from 1869 to 1879. Fifty-eight live children were produced as a result of the experiment. Most women and men only produced one child. Some produced two or three, and 13 of those were recorded as \\"accidental conceptions\\". To prove his religious and social prowess, as well as that of his bloodline, John H. Noyes and his son Theodore produced 12 children between them, 11 of whom survived (Carden 64). The development and nourishment of these children were very diligently attended to, and values such as non-attachment were impressed on children, even at a very young age. Many of the children lived long and were very well-educated; however, it has been offered that perhaps the children's environment lent them these abilities. Each child at Oneida was well supported and cared for within the community. They were given a lot of play time and rooms to do it in, as the Oneidans believed in the importance of exercise. Both girls and boys were provided an education, and some of the children even went on to college, and were encouraged to do so. They were under the constant guidance of older community members. Theodore Noyes, son of John H. Noyes, kept detailed records of the growth and development of the children produced and raised in the Stirpiculture experiment. Only one was reported to have physical disabilities (Ellis). The children learned the importance of non-attachment and commitment to the community; however, it is apparent that some special relationships did occur. The experiment ended in 1879, as the community began to break up. References Sources  *Carden, Maren Lockwood. Oneida: Utopian Community to Modern Corporation.

It is also the first-ever record Fish did outside Marillion except for his 1986 collaboration with Tony Banks on the single \\"Shortcut to Somewhere\\" from the Banks album Soundtracks. Song information The a-side track is a slow to mid-tempo rock song with strong bass and percussion elements and some Celtic folk elements. Lyrically, the song articulates the general political discontent in the late Thatcher years. In terms of music, lyrics and general mood, it is perhaps closest to the Marillion song \\"Sugar Mice\\" (1987). The b-side \\"The Voyeur (I Like To Watch)\\" is a harder, although mainly keyboard-based rock song, somewhat similar to Peter Gabriel's \\"Shock the Monkey\\"; and \\"Intruder\\", the lyrics criticise \\"TV voyeurism\\". \\"The Voyeur\\" was also included as a bonus track on the CD version of Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors. Fish co-wrote both tracks with keyboardist Mickey Simmonds, the dominant musical composer on his debut solo album. Guitarist Hal Lindes has additional credits on \\"State of Mind\\". Drums are played by John Keeble, best known for his membership of 1980s pop group Spandau Ballet.

Plot Roland and Jake make their way through a railway tunnel using a hand car cart created by the Great Old Ones. During this time, to distract the boy, Roland tells him a story of his childhood (which is also told in Wizard and Glass and The Gunslinger Born). At age fourteen, Roland discovered his mother having an affair with his father's court magician, Marten Broadcloak. Marten taunted Roland in order to spur him into an early trial to prove his worth as a gunslinger, in order that he would fail and be sent into exile, therefore ending potential trouble for the Good Man and Crimson King to whom Marten secretly swore allegiance. Roland faced his teacher Cort, using his hawk David as his weapon and deliberately sacrificing him in order to gain the upper hand, and passed the trial. While traveling through the mountain, Roland and Jake are attacked by a pack of slow mutants, who block the track in an attempt to catch them. Jake clears the obstruction just in time for them to escape, and they travel on to the edge of a deep chasm spanned by a dilapidated trestle. They abandon the hand car and start crossing on foot. Nearing the other end, Jake slips and Roland catches him, but the man in black arrives to offer Roland a choice: let the boy die or never catch him.

Construction of the bridge was completed in December 1965. After its completion, the bridge was eight by four hundred and twenty feet (8√ó420 ft.) with a carriageway of 36 feet centre-truss and a pedestrian walkway on both sides of the carriageway. It was commissioned by the then Prime Minister late Alhaji Tafawa Balewa and opened for traffic in December 1965. The commissioning of the bridge was the last public function of the Prime Minister before his assassination on January 15, 1966. During the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 - 1970, in an attempt to halt the Nigerian military advance, retreating Biafran soldiers destroyed the River Niger Bridge at Onitsha, trapping the Nigerians on the other side of the river. During President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan administration, the bridge was rehabilitated by replacing two spans on the Onitsha end of the Bridge that was damaged during the civil war with a fourteen-foot wide bailey, at an estimated cost of 1.5million pound.

In that job, which involved him in the early electrical recording process, he met Jay Wilbur (James Edward Wilbur), a dance bandleader who interested him in the technical side of recording.Wimbush, Roger, \\"Kenneth Wilkinson\\", The Gramophone, June 1968, p. 26 The company folded, and Wilkinson took a job in charge of the recorded music at an ice rink in Brighton. =Decca= Wilbur had joined Crystalate, another record company, and invited Wilkinson to join him at its studios in Hampstead. Wilkinson's job as a junior there included shaving waxes, removing the surface of used recording waxes to make them blank for re-recording. At Crystalate he met the recording engineer Arthur Haddy (1906‚Äì1989). When Decca acquired Crystalate in 1937, Wilkinson and Haddy (who would become the technical director at Decca) now worked for the new company. ffrr brought Decca to the forefront of recording companies after World War II. An attempt to volunteer for the Royal Air Force during World War II was refused because Decca was involved in top secret government research. Wilkinson would work on submarine navigation, recording Luftwaffe night fighter signals, and on navigation aspects of the dam buster operations of Barnes Wallace. With Haddy, he also worked on Decca's recording equipment, disc cutters, and recording techniques including \\"ffrr\\" (full frequency range recording). He was also involved in recording two of Decca's most popular artists: Vera Lynn and Mantovani. Wilkinson's early recordings as an engineer were for monaural 78 rpm releases. With Charles Munch bringing the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra to record in London for the first time, Wilkinson had to find a new recording location as Kingsway Hall was already booked. He found an outstanding acoustic in Walthamstow Town Hall, which was booked for the sessions for 8‚Äì11 October 1946. For these sessions, he also served as producer. On 19 November, he was back at Walthamstow recording the London Symphony Orchestra in that venue for the first time. Victor Olof (1898‚Äì1976) was the producer for this session and many future ones with Wilkinson as engineer. Their collaboration included a complete set of Sibelius's symphonies recorded between 1952 and 1955 in Kingsway Hall. =LP and stereo= Decca was an early adopter of the LP album, which put it ahead of its direct competitor EMI. The company was also an early exponent of stereophonic recording. Wilkinson would make the move to stereo recordings for Decca in April 1958, but until then he remained the engineer with the monaural recording team (for a time there were parallel recording teams) because mono was considered the more important release. In the early 1950s, together with Roy Wallace (1927‚Äì2007) and Haddy, he developed the Decca tree spaced microphone array used for stereo orchestral recordings. Decca began to use this for recordings in May 1954 at Victoria Hall in Geneva, a venue Wilkinson did not record in. He preferred recording in London and Paris although he also recorded in Amsterdam, Bayreuth, Chicago, Copenhagen, Rome, and Vienna. Wilkinson discussed the use of the Decca tree in an interview with Michael H. Gray in 1987. > You set up the Tree just slightly in front of the orchestra. The two > outriggers, again, one in front of the first violins, that's facing the > whole orchestra, and one over the cellos. We used to have two mikes on the > woodwind section ‚Äì they were directional mikes, 56's in the early days. > You'd see a mike on the tympani, just to give it that little bit of clarity, > and one behind the horns. If we had a harp, we'd have a mike trained on the > harp. Basically, we never used too many microphones. I think they're using > too many these days. Wilkinson's method of selecting recording venues was recounted in an article on concert hall orchestral sound written by the conductor Denis Vaughan in 1981: > I have recorded in many halls throughout Europe and America and have found > that halls built mainly of brick, wood and soft plaster, which are usually > older halls, always produce a good natural warm sound. Halls built with > concrete and hard plaster seem to produce a thin hard sound and always a > lack of warmth and bass. Consequently when looking for halls to record in I > always avoid modern concrete structures. =Legacy= Wilkinson went on to engineer at hundreds of recording sessions. He was said to have worked with more than 150 conductors. He was the engineer most responsible for Richard Itter's Lyrita recordings (which Decca produced). Itter always requested Wilkinson as engineer, calling him \\"a wizard with mikes\\".

Kenneth E Wilkinson ‚Äì the art of the balance engineer. International Classical Record Collector, Winter edition 1997, p46-51. and the producer John Culshaw made his name and reputation known to record reviewers and audiophiles. His legacy was extended by the fact that he trained every Decca engineer from 1937 onwards. Wilkinson, always called \\"Wilkie\\" in the music business, was known as a straight-talking man, interested only in the quality of the work. The Decca producer Ray Minshull (1934‚Äì2007) recalled Wilkinson's methods in an interview with Jonathan Valin in March 1993: > Everyone loved and respected Wilkie, but during a session he could be > exacting when it came to small details. He would prowl the recording stage > with a cigarette ‚Äì half-ash ‚Äì between his lips, making minute adjustments in > the mike set-up and in the orchestral seating. Seating arrangement was > really one of the keys to Wilkie's approach and he would spend a great deal > of time making sure that everyone was located just where he wanted them to > be, in order for the mikes to reflect the proper balances. Of course, most > musicians had a natural tendency to bend toward the conductor as they > played. If such movement became excessive, Wilkie would shoot out onto the > stage and chew the erring musician out before reseating him properly. He > wanted the musicians to stay exactly where he had put them. He was the > steadiest of engineers, the most painstaking and the most imaginative. In > all of his sessions, he never did the same thing twice, making small > adjustments in mike placement and balances to accord with his sense of the > sonic requirements of the piece being played. Among Wilkinson's favourite recordings was Britten's War Requiem. This was recorded in January 1963 at one of Wilkinson's favourite venues, Kingsway Hall, with Culshaw as the producer.This was also among Culshaw's favourite recordings: see Greenfield, Edward, \\"The Art of Culshaw\\", Gramophone, July 1980, p. 25 Among other recordings engineered by Wilkinson were Wagner's Parsifal recorded live at Bayreuth in 1951, of which the critic Andrew Porter wrote, \\"...the most moving and profound of spiritual experiences ... Decca have recorded, superbly, a superb performance\\",Porter, Andrew, \\"Wagner on Records\\", The Manchester Guardian, 23 January 1954, p. 3 and Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique with Sir Georg Solti conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in May 1972 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Krannert Center. Wilkinson retired from Decca when the company was taken over by the PolyGram group in 1980. He made no free-lance recordings. His work was released on Lyrita and Reader's Digest records (as mentioned above) and RCA Records with recordings licensed through Decca. His recordings were characterised by the producer Tam Henderson in an appreciation: \\"The most remarkable sonic aspect of a Wilkinson orchestral recording is its rich balance, which gives full measure to the bottom octaves, and a palpable sense of the superior acoustics of the venues he favored, among them the Assembly Hall at Waltham Forest Town Hall, Walthamstow in London and The Kingsway Hall of revered memory\\".\\"Classical Hall of Fame 2003 Award List\\", Audiophile Edition, accessed 20 January 2013 Among the popular performers whom he recorded over years were Mantovani, the Ted Heath Band, Vera Lynn, Edmundo Ros, Jo Stafford and Rosemary Squires. Personal life and awards Wilkinson married Miriam Tombs in 1938, and they had four children (two sons, two daughters). On retiring, Wilkinson received a special gold disc produced by Decca with extracts of his recordings. He received three Grammys for engineering: 1973, 1975, and 1978. He also received an audio award from Hi-Fi magazine in 1981 and the Walter Legge Award in 2003 \\"‚Ä¶for extraordinary contribution to the field of recording classical music\\".

Description The flasher scorpionfish has a broad, spiny head with a wide space between the eyes, a highly arched back, and a divided upper opercular spine. It has 12 spines in its dorsal fin and nine soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and five soft rays. The general color of this fish is brown mottled with white, and it can grow to a length of . The large pectoral fin is flushed with yellow and orange on its inside and has a complete, broad black band near its margin and no large back spots. This fish is one of five very similar species of humpback scorpionfish and can be distinguished from S. diabolus, S. gibbosa, and S. obtusa by the markings on the inside of the pectoral fin. From S. neglecta it can also be differentiated by the presence of two to six points on the nasal spine. Distribution and habitat It is indigenous to the tropical and subtropical waters of western and northwest Australia, the Moluccas, and the Philippines to the Marquesan and Society Islands, north to Ryukyu Islands, south to Rowley Shoals, Tonga, and the Mariana and Caroline Islands in Micronesia. S. macrochir is typically found on soft substrates, where it sometimes buries itself, camouflaged among rubble where it lies in wait for passing prey. In aquaria This fish occasionally is found in the aquarium trade, and is often confused with its larger relative Scorpaena diabolus (the devil scorpionfish). Like other Scorpaenifomes, it possesses venomous dorsal spines which deliver its venom. Although it is venomous, these spines are never used to attack other organisms, but are solely for defensive purposes. As its common name suggests, this fish possesses bright orange and yellow \\"flash colors\\" on the inner surfaces of its pectoral fins to ward off and confuse would-be attackers. These bright colors also serve as a warning that this fish is venomous.

Early and family life Lockwood was born in Poundridge, New York. His father, Joseph Lockwood (1764-1799), was an innkeeper who died of yellow fever (as did his infant son Cornelius) when Samuel was ten.Frederick Holden and E. Dunbar Lockwood, Colonial and Revolutionary History of the Lockwood Family in America from A.D. 1630: Descendants of Robert Lockwood, Philadelphia (privately published) 1889 at p. 293, in ancestry.com North America Family Histories database His mother, Mary (1765-1819), was the daughter of Col. Samuel Drake and would remarry after about a year, to Duncan McCall. Samuel was the oldest of Lockwood's four children, and would be sent to boarding school in New Jersey with his brother Jesse Close Lockwood (b.1791), when his mother moved to Canada with her new husband and young daughter Rebecca (1792-1827; who would marry Jacob Potts in Canada). The Lockwood boys only remained in that school for a few months before their uncle, Francis Drake, assumed responsibility for them. Samuel studied law with Drake and was admitted to the bar in Batavia, New York in 1811. He had a daughter, Susan (1831- ) by his first wife. On October 13, 1836, in Hamilton County, in Illinois' \\"Little Egypt\\" region, Lockwood married Virginia-born Mary Margaret Garner (1800-1875), who would survive him by less than a year. They had a daughter, Ann (1838- ). By 1850, Lockwood also had two 20-year-old male clerks living with his family and sharing his last name (R.A. Lockwood and J. Lockwood), so he may have repaid his uncle's tutelage of himself and his brother by raising other young relatives.1850 U.S. Federal Census for Jacksonville, Morgan County, Illinois family 395During the American Civil War, James B. Lockwood enlisted as a corporal in the 132nd Illinois Regiment, from Kendall County, Illinois, which was formed in 1841 from LaSalle and Kane Counties. Law career Lockwood had practiced law in Batavia, the seat of Genesee County, New York for a year before relocating his practice somewhat eastward. He then practiced in Sempronius, Cayuga County, New York for about a year and a half. From 1815 until August 1818, he had a law partnership in nearby Auburn, New York with George B. Throop. Lockwood ended that practice when he decided to move westward to the new state of Illinois. In 1818, he and a friend, William H. Brown, took a flatboat and descended the Allegheny River into the Ohio River before disembarking at Shawneetown, Gallatin County, Illinois. They walked across the new state to Kaskaskia, the first capital, but Lockwood returned to the \\"Little Egypt\\" region and settled in Carmi, White County, Illinois. He moved to Edwardsville around 1823, when he accepted the federal revenue collector job discussed below. Lockwood purchased land further north in Morgan County in central Illinois in 1828,http://alplm-cdi.com/chroniclingillinois/items/show/409 and further land when such became available in the 1830s. He lived in Morgan County for more than two decades.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Morgan County, Illinois indicates his five-person household also included two young white females and a white male aged between 10 and 14 years old.1840 U.S. Federal Census for Morgan County, Illinois indicates Lockwood was the only male in the 6-person household Lockwood would move further north following his judicial retirement, and finally settled with his family in Batavia, Kane County, Illinois in 1853.John Gustafson Historic Batavia p. 451860 U.S. Federal Census for Kane County, Illinois characterizes Lockwood as a farmer, and may characterize both his 22 and 29-year-old daughters living with him as schoolteachers; the family also had two female servants. Political career In 1821, Illinois voters elected Lockwood the young state's third Attorney General. During his brief tenure in that office, Lockwood successfully prosecuted the only known duel to come to trial in Illinois. He resigned after only a year when Governor Edward Coles appointed him as Secretary of State after Illinois' first Secretary of State, Elias Kane, was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. Three months later, Lockwood received an appointment as the Receiver of Public Moneys from President James Monroe; the job involved receiving money for settlers buying public lands from the federal government, and Coles had previously held the job. One of the reasons Lockwood accepted continued appointment from Madison was that it would afford him the time and money to ensure that Illinois would remain a free state, although both Presidents were slave owners. Like Governor Coles, Lockwood resisted slavery advocates (particularly from \\"Little Egypt\\") who wanted another Constitutional Convention to adopt a pro-slavery Constitution for the state; voters rejected the proposed convention in April 1824. Meanwhile, after various native American tribes ceded land in the 1821 Treaty of Chicago, northern Illinois was developing. In 1824, Lockwood was appointed to the First Board of Canal Commissioners, and became responsible for contracting with engineers to survey the route of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Planned since 1818, it would connect the Great Lakes (through the soon-to-be-incorporated town of Chicago at the confluence of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River) to the Mississippi River (and the transportation hubs of St. Louis, Missouri and New Orleans, Louisiana) via the Illinois River in the state's central section. The route was surveyed in the following years, and the first land grants delivered (or bought) in 1827. Judicial and later career In late 1824, the state legislature reorganized the Illinois Supreme Court and the outgoing Governor Coles appointed Lockwood a judge on that Court, with the legislature's approval.Ress, David (2006). Gov. Edward Coles and the Vote to Forbid Slavery in Illinois, 1823‚Äì1824. McFarland Publishers. Jefferson, N.C. pp. 123, 162. . Judge Lockwood took office on January 19, 1825 (as perhaps its only anti- slavery member) and served until December 1848.History of the English Settlement in Edwards County, Illinois, p. 157n, available on ancestry.com Early on, Lockwood revised the Illinois Criminal Code, and he resigned after the 1848 Constitution (which he helped draft and supported) reduced the Court's membership to three judges. The Court had also reorganized in 1841, after which Lockwood became responsible for the first judicial circuit. In 1837, Lockwood was the only dissenting judge in a case concerning the pre- emption homestead rights of trader Jean Baptiste Beaubien (brought by then fellow Morgan County lawyer Murray McConnell) shortly before the formal closing of Fort Dearborn following the 1833 Treaty of Chicago.John Jackson, ex dem. Murray McConnell v. dela Fayette Wilcox, 2 Ill. 344 (1837) The United States Supreme Court would overrule the other Illinois justices in Wilcox v. Jackson in 1839, before the federal government sold the contested land as the \\"Fort Dearborn Addition\\" to the town (which had incorporated as a city in 1837). Several times, Lockwood adjudicated cases involving slaves who claimed freedom based on being brought and/or living in Illinois, as well as to Illinois residents who assisted. He upheld slave status on several occasions, both as a trial and appellate judge, citing \\"comity\\" with laws of southern states that permitted slavery, and that the slaves were only traveling through the free state. In Phoebe v Jay, Lockwood, despite his previous anti- convention and abolitionist views, held that the 40 year indenture of Phoebe (entered into in 1814) could be transferred to Joseph Jay's heir, his son William Jay, reasoning that the new state's Constitution superseded the anti- slavery provisions of the Northwest Ordinance.Ress p. 162 However, Illinois courts began chipping away at the state's Black Code and indenture laws around 1843, led by Judge John D. Caton, who threw out a charge against Owen Lovejoy for harboring \\"Nancy\\", a black woman without freedom papers.Ress p. 163 In 1844, Lockwood was the only dissenter in the case of abolitionist William Hayes for assisting \\"Sukey\\", slave of Andrew Borders who moved to Galesburg, kidnapped her two sons from jail and sold them southward, the remaining judges upholding the transaction.Carol Pirtle, Andrew Borders v. William Hayes: Indentured Servitude and the Underground Railroad in Illinois, Illinois Historical Journal, Vol. 89, No. 3 (Autumn, 1996), pp. 147-160 (14 pages) In 1845, the Court found Joseph Jarrott not a slave, although his mother Pelagie had been since her purchase in 1798 when she was four years old; it thereafter held that slaves born in Illinois after the Northwest Ordinance were born free (overruling Phoebe v. Jay.Ress p. 163, although cited footnote contains no legal citation Nonetheless, the road to abolition was slow. Lockwood participated in two other underground railroad conductor convictions, of Jacksonville's perhaps most visible abolitionist, Julius Willard and his son Samuel Willard (Illinois' governor Pat Quinn pardoned both posthumously in 2014).Mark E. Steiner and Samuel Willard, Abolitionists and Escaped Slaves in Jacksonville: Samuel Willard's \\"My First Adventure with a Fugitive Slave: The Story of It and How It Failed,\\" Illinois Historical Journal, Vol. 89, No. 4 (Winter, 1996), pp. 213-232 Lockwood became one of the framers of Illinois' second Constitution in 1848, representing Morgan County at that assembly. He also served as a trustee of Illinois College and the state insane asylum, also in Jacksonville for several years. In 1851 Lockwood was appointed the state's trustee on the board of the Illinois Central Railroad. That caused him to move his family to Batavia, Kane County, Illinois (an abolitionist hotpot in Illinois, especially compared to Jacksonville, much less Little Egypt), so he could catch a train to attend board and other meetings in Chicago. Lockwood continued to serve on that board for the rest of his life.http://www.bataviaartscouncil.org/cemetery-walk.html With the demise of the Whig Party, and because he remained anti-slavery, Lockwood joined the new Republican Party, whose Presidential candidate in 1860 he knew well from his days in Morgan County and tenure on the Illinois Supreme Court, Abraham Lincoln. In both the 1860 and 1870 federal censuses, Lockwood characterized himself as a farmer in Batavia. President Lincoln characterized Lockwood as \\"one of the best men in the world\\" upon receiving a letter from him in December 1864.http://bataviahistory.com/historian-vol-26-57/the-batavia- historian-vol-41/volume-41---number-3.aspx After the American Civil War, Lockwood also accepted an appointment by Governor Palmer and served on a committee to find a site for an insane asylum in northern Illinois in 1869 (perhaps in part because he was a trustee of the asylum at Jacksonville), at which Mary Todd Lincoln would briefly reside in 1874.,The Past and Present of Kane County, Illinois p. 392 Retirement and death Lockwood died at his home in Batavia in 1874, at age 85. After a funeral at the Congregational Church, he was interred in the West Batavia cemetery across from his home (and to which he had donated some land to enable a stone fence). His wife Mary, who died the following year, and 26 descendants would ultimately be buried at that family plot. Some of his family's papers are held by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library. Batavia named a street after Lockwood.

History New America Media represents the third generation of ethnic news coalitions descending from the nonprofit Pacific News Service (PNS), founded in 1969. PNS was created by historian Franz Schurmann and journalist Orville Schell as an alternative news source on the United States‚Äô role in Indochina during the Vietnam War. After the war ended in 1974, PNS shifted its lens from the Far East to the American West under the guidance of executive editor Sandy Close, who would become the organization‚Äôs executive director. In 1991, PNS created its first youth media project, YO! Youth Outlook, a multimedia collective of youth-centric news content. YO! published a monthly print magazine, hosted youth forums, speakouts, and blog-a-thons, offered youth journalism internships, and produced live radio and YO!TV broadcasts. YO! Magazine and YO!TV disbanded in 2015. In 1996, PNS became New California Media. NCM maintained PNS‚Äôs status as an alternative news source providing support for ethnic media voices, and expanded it with editorial and marketing workshops for ethnic media at the organization‚Äôs annual Expo & Awards, dubbed the ‚Äúethnic Pulitzers‚Äù by The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. NCM also initiated multilingual polling on issues affecting ethnic Californians: the role of ethnic media in their daily lives, the impact of the September 11 attacks, the progress of American race relations. Also in 1996, Sandy Close co-founded The Beat Within with social worker David Inocencio. The Beat provides a weekly writing and discussion program in Bay Area juvenile detention centers, and from those programs, compiles material into a weekly magazine of written and visual work by incarcerated youth.

Biography  Furst was born in Baltimore, Maryland.1910 United States Federal Census, available at Ancestry.com. He studied music in Baltimore, and was a church organist at the age of 14. = Career = Furst's comic opera Electric Light was produced and conducted by him in 1878, and for the five seasons following he received engagements as conductor of opera. By the 1880s, he was composing theatrical music for productions starring Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Maude Adams, Otis Skinner, William Faversham, Viola Allen and Mrs. Leslie Carter. He composed the music for five Shakespeare productions by Margaret Anglin at the Berkeley Stadium in California, as well as her production of Electra.\\"Veteran Composer Wm.

He composed his only opera, Theodora, for the Tivoli. In 1892, he composed the successful operetta The Isle of Champagne. In 1893, he published \\"The Girl I Left Behind Me\\" and moved to New York City, becoming the music director at the now-demolished Empire Theater. The same year, he composed the music (along with Charles Alfred Byrne and Louis Harrison) for the musical Miss Nicotine with Lillian RussellNotes on Music, The New York Times, November 5, 1893, p. 10 and Marie DresslerInformation about Miss Nicotine and Marie Dressler Another such Empire piece was The Little Trooper, starring Della Fox (1894) followed by The Little Minister (1897). In 1898, he composed another such piece for the Empire, A Normandy Wedding (an adaptation of the French Papa Gougon), which received an enthusiastic reception in New York at the Herald Square Theatre.\\"A Normandy Wedding\\", The New York Times, February 22, 1898 By 1900, Furst also had fairly steady work as a composer/arranger of incidental music to accompany theatrical productions. He produced music for, or was music director for numerous plays, including a steady stream of dramas produced by David Belasco and Charles Frohman. Two plays by Belasco which had Furst's musical accompaniments, Madame Butterfly and The Girl of the Golden West, were made into operas by Giacomo Puccini who attended their New York productions. Musicologist Allan W. Atlas has shown that Puccini modeled some music heard in his opera La fanciulla del West on Furst's music.Allan W. Atlas, \\"Belasco and Puccini: 'Old Dog Tray' and the Zuni Indians\\", Musical Quarterly 75, no. 3 (Autumn 1991), 362-98. His last theatrical composition was music for Joan the Woman, starring Geraldine Farrar. = Death = Furst died in 1917 at his home in Freeport Long Island, New York at the age of 66. An enthusiastic gardener, Furst tripped in his garden, injuring his foot, which led to a brain clot. He was survived by his widow Charlotte and his daughter, Mrs. Lillian Martin.

Kahn enlisted in the United States Army at the beginning of World War II, ascending through the ranks from private to first lieutenant. Family business He had worked for Kahn Brother and Pinto, the family fur business, which he left in 1950 to start Transeastern Associates, which started with the purchase of a surplus World War II-era Liberty ship and had expanded into ownership of 36 bulk cargo carriers.Waggoner, Walter H. \\"JOSEPH KAHN DEAD; SEATRAIN CHAIRMAN; Leader of Bulk Cargo Line Was 63 --Advocated a Competitive U.S. Merchant Fleet Raised Question of Loyalty\\", The New York Times, December 4, 1979.

Accessed December 19, 2008. In an April 1967 speech to the United States Merchant Marine Academy alumni association, Kahn advocated for rules to benefit the domestic shipping industry, including retention of cabotage laws that require domestic shipping be by ships owned and built in the United States and manned by American crews. He also pushed for a requirement that all foreign aid shipments be on American ships. that the United States Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service use American-flagged vessels exclusively and that at least half of oil imported into the United States be on American- flagged ships.Bamberger, Werner. \\"U.S. SHIPS BACKED FOR DOMESTIC USE; Seatrain Chairman Stresses Need for Viable Industry\\", The New York Times, April 28, 1967.

Kahn served on the American Bureau of Shipping's board of managers and was president of the American Maritime Association. Kahn was a longtime critic of what he felt was a failure of the United States government to create a competitive merchant fleet sailing under the US flag. Kahn stated that the United States Navy was mistaken in counting on the loyalty of foreign-owned ships to be available in case of an emergency. Kahn stated that the \\"United States is too big, too strong, too powerful not to have its own capability in the construction and manning of ships\\".
