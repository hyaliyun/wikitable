It is part of the New Order series, which details the adventures of one of Lone Wolf's disciples in the New Kai Order and not Lone Wolf himself. The book is set in MS 5102, 18 years after the ending of book 28, The Hunger of Sejanoz. After encountering problems with a number of publishers, author Joe Dever announced on 1 April 2016 that he would self-publish the book. It was published on 13 May 2016, 18 years after the publication of book 28. It was the last Lone Wolf gamebook published by Dever before his death. Plot The Claw of Naar is the evil wand of power used by Agarash the Damned during his ancient conquest of Magnamund. After retrieving it in Vampirium, the reader handed it over to the Elder Magi who tried to destroy it. That was 18 years ago, but Elder Magi are still trying to figure out how to annihilate it. The reader is now living in the new Kai Monastery on the Isle of Lorn and receives grim news: several hordes of Agarashi have been spotted all over Magnamund. Lone Wolf, the Supreme Grand Master of the Kai Order, dispatches his six Grand Masters to missions across the world to investigate and stop the menaces. One of those hordes of Agarashi is marching towards the country of Chai, ruled by the young Khea-khan Lao Tin. The reason: one of the gems that embellish the Khea-khan's throne is the Eye of Agarash, a stone that can be coupled with the Claw of Naar to increase its destructive power. The reader's mission is to retrieve the Eye of Agarash before their enemies. But that is the easy part: bringing back the gem to the Elder Magi, with Agarashi roaming the land of Chai, is where the real challenge resides for the reader. Publication history In its December 2010 issue of Signs & Portents, Mongoose published the timeline of the events that took place in Magnamund between the end of book 28 and the beginning of book 29. In the same issue, the first section of the book, the Story so Far, was also published, revealing the mission that the reader had to undertake, as it is a \\"game book\\", a book where the reader must make choices to determine the outcome. Mongoose Publishing had the rights to publish this book but in February 2013, it was announced that the publisher had lost its publishing rights of the series. German publisher Mantikore- Verlag picked up the rights to publish books 18 to 28 shortly after that, and on April 1, 2015, it was announced that it would also publish book 29. English publisher Cubicle 7 picked up the rights for this book from Mantikore-Verlang in December 2015, but came back on its decision the following month. On April 1, 2016, Joe Dever announced that he would published the remaining Lone Wolf's books himself with his own imprint, Holmgard Press, starting with the publication of book 29, which was released on May 13, 2016. However, The Storms of Chai was first published in Italian by Vincent Books in November 2015. Alberto Dal Lago did provide the cover artwork while Marvel artist Giuseppe Camuncoli did the interior illustrations. The French version was published in June 2017.

In 1997 he also represented South Australia in a State of Origin game against Victoria at Football Park and won the Fos Williams Medal. With development of Port's depth in midfield he struggled in 2001 as younger, quicker players overtook Lyle and he was delisted at the end of the year.

Kevorkian was called up for Belgium in 1908, for a match against Sweden. Kevorkian scored the 1‚Äì0 in the 30th minute. Belgium won the match 2‚Äì1. Even though Kevorkian did not have the Belgian nationality, he was allowed to appear in the match. Because when the rule started counting that players had to have the nationality of the country they were playing for, Kevorkian was already playing in Belgium. Such players were still allowed too. He played the last match of his career with Beerschot against his former team Cercle Brugge. The match ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw.

Apart from this the Museum also exhibits items connected with firefighting, printing and metal machine industry. The Museum occupies some parts of the B√ºttners‚Äô former cloth factory, which used to be one of the biggest textile factories in Bielsko. History of the Museum The Museum of Technology and Textile Industry in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. The Museum of Textile Technology took over the exhibits connected with weaver‚Äôs craft from the main seat of the Museum in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, and then gradually it enriched its collection with machines and devices taken from the local textile factories. At first the branch occupied the buildings of ZPW Rytex (Wool Industry Works), but in 1983 the museum was relocated in the part of the ZPW Bawelana buildings. The renovation works in the buildings started in 1992, and the first part of the exhibition was open for public on 2 December 1996. The exhibition on the first floor was opened a year later. Till 1995 the branch was called The Museum of Textile Technology. However it received lots of items connected with other kinds of technology so its name was changed into the present one. Along with the machines and devices connected with textile industry, which take up most of the exhibition, there are also items devoted to the history of Bielsko-Bia≈Ça fire-brigade and waterworks, a small printing room and a so-called museum storage. Even the traditions of the local metal processing industry were not omitted. Depending on the financial means a restoration of the further rooms and the extension of the exhibitions are planned. The Museum occupies some of the buildings of the old cloth factory which used to belong to the B√ºttners family. The factory was one of the biggest textile factories at the time. In 1868 the local clothier master Karol Traugott B√ºttner bought a garden in the ≈ªywiec Suburb, where he put up a two- storey building with annexes. In 1884 the company was inherited by his sons Karol Teodor and Gustaw Adolf who ran it as Karl B√ºttners S√∂hne (Karl B√ºttners Sons). They expanded the company. In 1889 the factory hall was put up on Sukinnicza Street, a boiler room was built and steam drive was introduced. In the first decade of the 20th century a storied factory hall with a vast garret was built, now housing the main part of the museum exhibition. In the 1930s the company was taken over K.T. B√ºttner‚Äôs sons: Karol August, Pawe≈Ç Maurycy and Herbert Oskar, and G. A. B√ºttner‚Äôs sons: Jan Karol and Kurt Ernest, and their brother-in-law, Erwin Kerger. With starting the carpet weaving mill they offered more products. The company owned the main factory and its branch in Bia≈Ça which until 1910 was Krebok & Then cloth factory belonging to the B√ºttners. It burned down completely in the 1930s. Also a Kerger‚Äôs dyeing house in Bia≈Ça was in use. After the World War II the nationalized factory in Bielsko was a part of the L. Lasek Textile Industry Works, later known as Bawelana factory B. After stopping the production in 1983 some of the factory objects were given to the Museum of Technology and Textile Industry. Exhibits There are many kinds of textile products made from various raw materials. The museum exhibits mostly machines and devices used for producing woolen coarse textile including the famous Bielsko cloth. The exhibits are gathered in four rooms corresponding particular mills of the old factory. In the Spinning Mill the sheep wool was turned into yarn. In this mill we can see a spinning waste cleaner, open raw material beater, willow used for opening and mixing the raw material, two carding machine sets (double- and triple- component, which turned the wool into roving, and finally the self-actor mule (spinning frame), where the roving changed into yarn. The last two machines produced by Bielsko machine factory G. Josephy‚Äôs Erben at the end of the 19th century, belong to the unique monuments of the old textile technology. We also have here a tearing machine used for woolen rags, from which reclaimed fibers to produce low-quality yarn were obtained. Next the yarn went to the Preliminary Treatment Mill. In here it was wound on the winding machines, the warp threads were prepared on the warping machines, while the weft threads on the weft-winders. The interesting objects here are mechanical warping machine produced in Bielsko Georg Schwabe machine factory in the 1930s, and the weft- winder by G.Josephy‚Äôs Erben dating back to the beginnings of the 20th century. By the preliminary treatment mill one can also visit Master‚Äôs office who supervised his workers. In the Weaving Mill the warp and the weft were turned into textile by means of looms. The Museum presents a varied collection: manual vertical looms dating back to the Lusatian Culture (700-400 B.C.), wooden manual harness looms, and shuttleless pneumatic and rapier looms (1960s). On one of them we have a weaving process demonstrated. The exhibition is completed by rich collection of the pattern cards punching machines which controlled the Jacquard and harness looms. Textiles, before taken to a warehouse, undergone many chemical and mechanical treatments, which took place in the Finishing Mill. In this part of the exhibition we can see a boiler used for dyeing wool and yarn, cylinder fulling mill for coarse textile, two power gig-mills (one with metal needles, the other with thistle) hand shears, and automatic shearing machine, and finally a textile folding machine. This exhibition is completed by laboratory devices, the collections of various shuttles, a catalogue of sample textiles produced in Bielsko and Bia≈Ça (1928‚Äì1940), lithographies presenting local factories (ca.1870), as well as paintings and graphic arts connected with textile industry. The Museum also presents many machines used to produce hats: cone carding machine, felting machines, hammer fulling mill, dyeing apparatus, drawing frame, sand press and others. Fire and water The exceptional exhibitions are devoted to fire- fighting and the city waterworks. The former was prepared in the Spring 2004 on the occasion of 140th anniversary of the Bielsko-Bia≈Ça Volunteer Fire Department. The Museum presents its own collection as well as souvenirs belonging to local headquarters of the National Fire Service, to Volunteer Fire Department from different city districts, as well as to private individuals. The largest exhibits are two horse-drawn carriages and the interwar sleighs equipped with fire hoses. In two showcases there are archival photographs (originals and replicas) showing fire stations in Bielsko and Bia≈Ça, portraits of fire chiefs, a group of fire-fighters, emblems and badges, documents etc. Next, there are souvenirs connected with fire stations in Komorowice, Bystra, Lipnik, Leszczyny, Ha≈Çcn√≥w and Straconka. The Exhibition is completed by OSP (Volunteer Fire Department) units‚Äô banners, fire-fighting and life-saving equipment, a collection of nozzles, helmets and belts. The exhibition devoted to the history of water supply to Bielsko-Bia≈Ça is the most recent one (November 2005). It was prepared on the occasion of the 110th anniversary of Bielsko waterworks launch. One can find here many original technical drawings dating back to the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Kept in the AQUA S.A. Company in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça this is the first time they have been presented to the public. The drawings are: never executed Bielsko-Bia≈Ça waterworks project by engineer Grahn (1887) with the aim to build water intake on the River So≈Ça in Kƒôty-Podlasie, the project of waterworks for the City of Bia≈Ça with water intake in Straconka by engineer Pfister (1898), and the project of the dam in Wapienica by Dyckerhoff & Widmann company (1927). The technical drawings are complemented by various postcards, photos and archives available thanks to National Archives in Katowice, Bielsko-Bia≈Ça branch as well as a few old water meters. Metal machine industry The rapid development of the textile industry resulted in the appearance of the metal machine industry in Bielsko and Bia≈Ça. It provided the local factories with machines and devices. The next part of the exhibition is devoted to that industry. The Museum holds an antique lathe (the beginning of the 20th century), various drills, a collection of manual blacksmith tools. The exhibit includes a 22-kilo album containing photos depicting the board of directors and the employers working in the textile machinery factory, Gustav Josephy's Erben. The exhibition is completed by photographs and paintings connected with the metal machine industry. Printing room A separate room is occupied by the exhibition devoted to printing techniques. There are two machine presses (19th/20th century) and two printing machines. The new generation devices are English monotype with a taster i.e. a machine used for programming and casting single types (1960) and a Russian built typesetting machine (copy of the Linotype) used for casting whole lines of text (1982). The exhibition is completed by various printing types as well as printing blocks decorated with Secession elements used for printing posters and placards. Museum storage Opened in 1996 the exhibition presented only machines and devices connected with the textile industry. However, the Museum also received objects connected with other fields of technology, so in 2002 a new separate exhibition was opened. The storage holds radios, TV sets, tape recorders, gramophones, counting machines and typewriters. There is also a large collection of household supplies such as irons (with heaters, coal irons, gas iron] and others), sewing machines, manual wooden washing machines, one of the oldest electric drum washing machines (1930s), mangles, wringers, vacuum cleaners, scales, paraffin lamps, meat cutting machines, bread cutters and many others.

Energy market may refer to an electricity market, but can also refer to other sources of energy. Typically energy development is the result of a government creating an energy policy that encourages the development of an energy industry in a competitive manner. Until the 1970s when energy markets underwent dramatic changes, they were characterised by monopoly-based organisational structures. Most of the world's petroleum reserves were controlled by the Seven Sisters. Circumstances changed considerably in 1973 as the influence of OPEC grew and the repercussions of the 1973 oil crisis affected global energy markets. Liberalization and regulation Energy markets have been liberalized in some countries; they are regulated by national and international authorities (including liberalized markets) to protect consumer rights and avoid oligopolies. Regulators includes the Australian Energy Market Commission in Australia, the Energy Market Authority in Singapore, the Energy Community in Europe, replacing the South- East Europe Regional Energy Market and the Nordic energy market for Nordic countries. Members of the European Union are required to liberalize their energy markets. Regulators seek to discourage volatility of prices, reform markets if needed, and search for evidence of anti-competitive behavior such as the formation of a monopoly. Due to the increase in oil price since 2003 and the increase of speculation, energy markets are being reviewed and by 2008, several conferences were organized to address the energy market sentiments of petroleum importing nations. In Russia, the markets are being reformed by the introduction of harmonized and all-Russian consumer prices. Current and past energy usage in the United States US energy market trading room, 2004 The United States currently uses over four trillion kilowatt-hours per year in order to fulfill its energy needs. Data given by the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows a steady growth in energy usage dating back to 1990, which showed the United States used around 3 trillion kilowatt hours of energy that year. Traditionally, the energy sources used to fulfill the United States energy needs have been oil, coal, nuclear, renewable energy, and natural gas. The breakdown of each of these fuels as a percentage of the overall consumption in the year 1993, according to the data given by the EIA is as follows; coal was 53%, nuclear energy was 19%, natural gas was 13%, renewable energy was 11%, and oil provided 4% of the overall energy needs. In 2011, the breakdown was as follows; coal was 42%, nuclear was 19%, natural gas was 25%, renewable energy was 13% and oil dropped down to 1%. These figures show a dramatic drop in energy from coal, and a significant increase in both natural gas as well as renewable energy.Electricity Generation. (Dec. 5, 2012). Retrieved from www.eia.gov/forecasts. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) data from 2006, hydroelectric power accounted for most of the renewable energy production in the United States. However, increasing government funding, grants, and incentives have been drawing many companies towards the biofuel, wind, and solar energy production industries. Moving towards renewable energy In recent years, there has been a movement towards renewable and sustainable energy in the United States. This has been caused by many factors, including the threat of climate change, cost, government funding, tax incentives, and potential profits in the energy market of the United States. According to the most recent projections by the EIA out to the year 2040, the renewable energy industry will be growing from providing 13% of the power in the year 2011 to 16% in 2040. This is equivalent to 32% of the overall growth during this time period. This large increase has the potential to be very lucrative for companies wishing to tap into the renewable energy market in the United States. This movement towards renewable energy has also been affected by the stability of the global market. Recent economic instability in countries in the Middle East and elsewhere has driven American companies to further develop American dependence on foreign sources of energy, such as oil. The long term projections by the United States Energy Information Administration for renewable energy capacity in the United States is also sensitive to factors such as the cost of domestic oil and natural gas production, prices, and availability. Renewable energy sources Currently, the majority of the United States‚Äô renewable energy production comes from hydroelectric power, solar power, and wind power. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the cost of wind power doubled between the years of 2002 to 2008. However, since then, the prices of wind power have declined by 1/3, on average. Various factors have been contributing to the decline in the cost of wind power, such as government subsidies, tax breaks, technological advancement, and the cost of oil and natural gas.Wind Power Economics: Past, Present, and Future Trends. (Nov. 23, 2011). Retrieved from energy.gov Hydroelectric power has been the most predominant source of renewable energy for quite some time due to the fact that it has been proven to be reliable and has been in use for quite some time. This source of energy has provided the majority of renewable energy and has been a significant source of overall energy production in the United States. The problem with traditional hydroelectric power has been the requirement of damming rivers and other sources of water. The problem created by damming is that the natural environment of the area is disrupted due to the formation of a lake caused by the damming of the water source. This creates uproar by environmentalists and a large obstacle to clear before being able to build a hydroelectric plant. However, new forms of hydroelectric power that harness wave energy from the oceans have been in development in recent years. Although these power sources still need much development before they become economically viable, they do have potential to become significant sources of energy.Hydroelectric Power Water Use. (Feb 14, 2013). Retrieved from www.ga.water.usgs.gov. In recent years, wind energy and solar energy have made the largest steps towards significant energy production in the United States. These sources have little impact on the environment and have the highest potential of renewable energy sources used today. Advances in technology, government tax rebates, subsidies, grants, and economic need have all lead to huge steps towards the usage of sustainable wind and solar energy today. Energy market in the U.S. The energy industry is the third-largest industry in the United States. This market is expected to have an investment of over $700 billion over the next two decades according to selectusa. This allows for large amount of advancement in technological development in the near future. There are also many federal resources enticing both domestic and foreign companies to send investments towards the renewable energy industry in the United States. These federal resources include the Department of Energy Loan Guarantee, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, the Smart Grid Stimulus Program, as well as an Executive Order on Industrial Energy Efficiency. All these programs allow for a very lucrative investment for companies wishing to compete in the energy industry in the United States. With the advancement of technology in recent years, harnessing the power of wind, solar, and hydroelectric resources in the United States will become the focus of the United States‚Äô shift towards alternative energy. This should also drive down the prices of oil due to a decrease in demand. There are more incentives now than ever before to develop these technologies and bring them into greater use.Energy Industry in the United States.

Life Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn, by Ludwig Angerer, 1860 Wallmoden was the son of Johann Ludwig Reichsgraf von Wallmoden-Gimborn (1736‚Äì1811), an illegitimate son of George II. At the time of Ludwig's birth, Johann was British ambassador in Austria. Wallmoden was an illegitimate son of George II of Great Britain by his mistress Amalie von Wallmoden. She was married to Adam Gottlieb, Count Wallmoden (1704‚àí1752), but for a payment of 1000 Ducats the Count was prepared to defer his claims on his wife to George, and was finally separated from her in 1740. Wallmoden first entered the Hanoverian army, and then in 1790 the Prussian Army. While serving in the Prussian army as a captain in Wolfradt's hussars he distinguished himself at the battle of Kaiserslautern winning the Pour le M√©rite (Blue Max) but was simultaneously bayoneted in the chest. After the Peace of Basel (5 April 1795) Wallmoden joined the Austrian army as second captain in Vecsey's Hussars.on 1 January 1797 he was promoted to first captain and joined Karaczay-Chevaulegers. On the 16 April that year he was promoted to major and joined the quartermaster service. On 7 June 1798 he was transferred to the Dragoon Regiment No. 2. On 3 August of the same year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in Ulanenregimente No. 1 and to colonel of the same regiment on 16 August 1800. In 1809 Wallmoden completed the negotiations in London as to the \\"Subsidienvertrag\\" between Austria and Great Britain. On his return to Vienna, he distinguished himself a brigadier-general at the Battle of Wagram. On 6 July, the second day of battle, Wallmoden was responsible for the left flank of the III Corps. He ordered an attack by the Liechtenstein Hussars who on the enemy's right flank, which succeeded in disrupting the enemy and in the capture of nine guns. During the withdrawal of the Austrian army to Moravia, the VI Corps formed the rearguard. Wallmoden led the Liechtenstein and Blankenstein Hussars in a successful delaying action at Hollabrunn (9 July) and on several other occasions. During these regard actions he was lightly wounded and for his achievements at Wagram and in the latter actions he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresia and army Command from 13 July 1809. After the Treaty of Vienna, Wallmode was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant on 21 August 1809 and lived in Prague. In 1812 he was given permission by the Austrian Emperor to transfer first to the British Army, and then at the bequest of the British to the Imperial Russian Army, becoming overall commander of the Russian light troops under the commanders D√∂rnberg and Tettenborn and Chernichev, which became known as the Russian- German Legion, which he merged into the Allied \\"army of the north\\". During the Battle of the G√∂hrde, he and his corps held out against not only General Davout's force but also the French division under P√©cheux, later penetrating into Schleswig and forcing the Danes to make peace.. The corps was disbanded upon the fall of Paris in 1814 and on 24 May 1815, Wallmoden rejoined the Austrian army, just in time for the Hundred Days in which he led a column of the Austrian III Corps (W√ºrttemberg's) which fought the action at Seltz against the French General Rottembourg, after which his column combined with the other column of the III Corps and fought the Battle of La Suffel before besieging General Jean Rapp in Strasbourg. In August 1816 he was made Oberbefehlshaber (supreme commander) of the Austrian troops sent to the kingdom of Naples for the Neapolitan War. In 1821 he left the majority of the Austrian force in Naples and in June occupied Sicily, where he remained until 1823. When in 1827 Naples was completely evacuated by the Austrian troops, Wallmode became on 21 March 1827 Milit√§rcommandant to Milan and he was made a secret counsel on 20 January 1831. On 18 September 1838, he was promoted to General of the Cavalry. On 1 March 1848, he was appointed deputy to Field Marshal Count Radetzky and on 19 October 1848 he was awarder the Grand Cross of the Austrian Order of Leopold in retirement. After his retirement he lived in Vienna and, after falling and breaking his leg, he died there in his 94th year on 20 March 1862, leaving no Legitimate issue.

History The Baj Pomorski Theatre was started thanks to Irena Pikiel-Samorewiczowa ‚Äì an artist, painter, and repatriate from Vilnius who had come to Bydgoszcz in April 1945 possessing a document from The Ministry of Arts and Culture (dated April 1, 1945), entitling her to organize the first puppet theatre in Pomerania. It was supposed to be a younger brother of Warsaw's Baj Theater, hence the name Baj Pomorski. The Bydgoszcz theatre was situated in the city's slaughterhouse, which had functioned as a German marionette theatre during Nazi occupation. On October 28, 1945 it performed its premiere for children ‚Äì Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina's Little Wandering Taylor. The conditions of Bydgoszcz's stage did not, however, meet the needs of the young puppet theatre. Therefore, I. Pikiel very willingly accepted the proposal for moving the headquarters of Baj Pomorski to Toru≈Ñ. As early as April 1946 the Theatre had been granted a building at 9 Piernikarska Street, which had previously belonged to the German Castle Theatre during the war. It is in this beautiful location near the ruins of the Castle of The Teutonic Knights that the Theatre has been performing till today ‚Äì extending to the past sixty years. The first actors of Baj Pomorski were students from The University of Nicholas Copernicus who, under the guidance of experienced actors and directors, took part in theatrical clinics and thereby unearthed the arcana of puppet animation. Work conditions were not easy. The theatre had humble equipment at its disposal, yet it was actively involved in on-the-road performances not only in Pomerania, but also throughout nearly all over Poland. By then Baj Pomorski had already achieved its first success. In 1947, Joanna Piekarska, an artist and director, became the theatre's artistic manager. She directed the performance entitled She-Cat's House which received 3rd prize at the 1st Festival of Russian and Soviet Plays in Warsaw in 1950. This achievement, as well as the theatre's extensive activity, contributed to the nationalization of Toru≈Ñ's puppet stage. At that time this meant that, on one hand, the institution would gain financial stability, while on the other, certain liberties for creativity, so inherent in pioneering activities, would have to cease. Directors From then on the rules of play planning and selection, mandated within a cultural policy, had to be consistently obeyed. The following directors of the theatre were *Stanis≈Çaw Stapf (1950‚Äì1960), *Leszek ≈ömigielski (1960‚Äì1972), *Tadeusz Petrykowski (1972‚Äì1979), *Konrad Szachnowski (1979‚Äì1980), *Antoni S≈Çoci≈Ñski (1980‚Äì1988), *Krzysztof Arciszewski (1988‚Äì1992), *Wojciech Olejnik (1992‚Äì1993), *Czes≈Çaw Sie≈Ñko (1993‚Äì2003). *Zbigniew Lisowski has been Baj Pomorski's director since August 1, 2003. Theatre in 1960‚Äì90 All the directors have left their ineffaceable expressions upon Toru≈Ñ's puppet stage. It was when Stapf was the theatre's acting director that the days of Baj Pomorski's artistic adolescence occurred. He was the one responsible for helping modernize the theatre, making it into one of the best equipped stages in Poland; he displayed a premiere for adults (the first of its kind for the theatre ‚Äì a Polish preview puppet show of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream; he initiated the North Poland Puppet Theater Festival held in Toru≈Ñ ‚Äì Pomerania's first event of this caliber. During the Sixties, under ≈ömigielski's management, a further change was brought about in Baj Pomorski's image, from that of a traditional puppet stage to one of a theatre seeking new forms of expression, open to Toru≈Ñ's artistic life. It was during this time that the largest numbers of preview shows within the history of the theatre were staged; ambitious spectacles (influenced by traditional folk theatre) were created, and innovatory stage productions by contemporary regional authors were shown. The Club of Creative Circles Azyl, formed during that time, was a unique artistic phenomenon in Poland, making Baj Pomorski the center of cultural life and the venue for many a theatrical initiative. Thanks to Tadeusz Petrykowski the theatre reanimated its cooperation with theatre groups abroad, including those from the Czech Republic and Romania; it also increased its participation in Polish puppet festivals. Konrad Szachnowski made his name in Baj's past by coming up with a modern concept for staging theatrical classics. His preview puppet show of Fernando de Rojas‚Äô Celestine found its place in Polish puppet theatre's historic lore by using an amazingly creative theatrical idea involving supermarionnette and trashy theatre. The eight years of Antoni S≈Çoci≈Ñski's management resulted in the development of theatrical education programs for children; besides this the theatre began to mark its presence at international festivals, with cooperation with German (mainly in G√∂ttingen ‚Äì one of Toru≈Ñ's partner cities) and Czech theatres, growing stronger in the process. The following directors ‚Äì Krzysztof Arciszewski and Wojciech Olejnik ‚Äì presumably continued to expand upon programs based upon previously developed images of the theatre. An important modification introduced during that time was the transformation of the theatre into an institution financed by the City of Toru≈Ñ. Theatre after 1990 Further development of Baj Pomorski occurred under the management of Czes≈Çaw Sie≈Ñko. This was the era democracy being stabilized in Poland, the executive branch of the government undergoing structural changes, and transformation sweeping throughout all areas of economy, culture and social life. The repertoire included stage productions of the most interesting novels for children and teenagers which had up until then been absent from thespian arts. The theatre took its first steps in promoting new European literature for children. Innovatory scenographic suggestions taught audiences based on one's involvement in the performance. Never before in its history had Baj Pomorski spectacles received so many awards and honors. In 1994 Sie≈Ñko initiated Toru≈Ñ's Meetings of Puppet Theaters. In 1999 this evolved to become Toru≈Ñ's International Meetings of Puppet Theaters which has become a perpetual event in Toru≈Ñ's puppet stage activity. Toru≈Ñ's International Meetings of Puppet Theatres is one of the few events of this type and size in Poland. It is held in October on a yearly basis. Throughout this week of contests and challenges one can see the most interesting theatres from around the world ‚Äìmasters of puppetry, artists nurturing the tradition of the puppet theatre, and groups searching and experimenting within the nature of the loosely termed animation theatre. Eleven events have been held thus far, confirming the high rank of the festival from a list of theatrical events both within and beyond Poland. The present director of Baj Pomorski has since made Toru≈Ñ's puppet stage into an open theatre, vividly responding to the city's needs and present-day trends. Its message, though targeted mostly at children and teenagers, is intended to reach every student and adult. Hopes for the coming years are for the modernization and development of the theatre's main building. Planned on a wide scale it will change its look, making it one of Poland's most modern and interesting stages, and not only from the architectural point of view. By giving the building the characteristics of an enormous, magical, theatrical wardrobe it will be transformed into a place where, for both Toru≈Ñ's residents and tourists alike, it can serve as the locale for interplay, wherein the mysteries of its theatre and the beauty of its architecture enwrap together the Old and New Town settings.

Located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, approximately from the Pacific Highway and from Sydney, it stretches southwards from just south of the mouth of the Nambucca River to the town of Scotts Head in the south. The town, which had a population of 899 at the is named after the area's first white settler, William Scott; the area's original inhabitants are the Gumbaynggirr people. It has a shopping complex called Scotts Head Central, a bakery, a butchery, a bottle shop, a local fish monger and coffee shop, and a real estate agent. It also has a caravan park with cabins that line the main beach. For recreation, there is a surf-lifesaving club and a bowling club. Scotts Head is the site of a small public school which is attended by around 110 students. Tourism Scotts Head is popular with surfers because of the headlands projecting into the ocean in three directions, and the choice of three beaches. Scotts Head is known for right handed surf breaks, it is occasionally visited by turtles, and offshore is part of the whale migratory route. The beach areas were the traditional home of the local indigenous tribe, due to once abundant fish stocks and the availability of fresh water from two natural fresh water pools that were located close to the main headland, which is known locally as \\"the point\\". According to the 'Guinness Book of Records', Scotts Head boasts the largest variety of reptiles available anywhere in the world in one place, including several varieties of lizards and many of Australia's most poisonous snakes. Brown snakes and Red-bellied black snakes can be spotted travelling through the open spaces and parks near to the beaches during their Summer breeding season.

It was founded by Red Hat as a community project on which Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization is based. It allows centralized management of virtual machines, compute, storage and networking resources, from an easy-to-use web-based front-end with platform independent access. KVM on x86-64 and PowerPC64 architecture are the only hypervisors supported, but there is an ongoing effort to support ARM architecture in the future releases.  Architecture  oVirt consists of two basic components, oVirt engine and oVirt node. The oVirt engine backend is written in Java, while the frontend is developed with GWT web toolkit. The oVirt engine runs on top of the WildFly (former JBoss) application server. The frontend can be accessed through a webadmin portal for administration, or a user portal with privileges, and features that can be fine tuned. User administration can be managed locally or by integrating oVirt with LDAP or AD services. The oVirt engine stores data in a PostgreSQL database. Data warehousing and reporting capabilities depend on additional history and reports databases that can be optionally instantiated during the setup procedure. RESTful API is available for customizing or adding engine features. An oVirt node is a server running RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, or experimentally Debian, with KVM hypervisor enabled and a VDSM (Virtual Desktop and Server Manager) daemon written in Python. Management of resources initiated from a webadmin portal are sent through the engine backend that issues appropriate calls to the VDSM daemon. VDSM controls all resources available to the node (compute, storage, networking) and virtual machines running on it and is also responsible for providing feedback to the engine about all initiated operations. Multiple nodes can be clustered from the oVirt engine webadmin portal to enhance RAS. The oVirt engine can be installed on a standalone server, or can be hosted on a cluster of nodes themselves inside a virtual machine (self-hosted engine). The self-hosted engine can be manually installed or automatically deployed via a virtual appliance. oVirt is built upon several other projects including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.  Features  Virtual datacenters, managed by oVirt, are categorized into storage, networking and clusters that consist of one or more oVirt nodes. Data integrity is ensured by fencing, with agents that can use various resources such as baseboard management controllers or uninterruptible power supplies. Storage is organized within entities called storage domains and can be local or shared. Storage domains can be created using the following storage solutions or protocols: * NFS * iSCSI * Fibre Channel * POSIX compliant filesystem * GlusterFS Network management allows defining multiple VLANs that can be bridged to the network interfaces available on the nodes. Configuration of bonded interfaces, IP addresses, subnet masks and gateways on managed nodes are all supported within webadmin portal interface, as is SR-IOV on hardware configurations that support this feature. Management features for compute resources include CPU pinning, defining NUMA topology, enabling kernel same- page merging, memory over-provisioning, HA VM reservation etc. Virtual machine management enables selecting high availability priority, live migration, live snapshots, cloning virtual machines from snapshots, creating virtual machine templates, using cloud-init for automated configuration during provisioning and deployment of virtual machines. Supported guest operating systems include GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and FreeBSD. Access to virtual machines can be achieved from webadmin portal using SPICE, VNC and RDP protocols. oVirt can be integrated with many open source projects, including OpenStack Glance and Neutron for disk and network provisioning, Foreman/Katello for VM/node provisioning or pulling relevant errata information into webadmin portal and can be further integrated with ManageIQ for a complete virtual infrastructure lifecycle management. Disaster recovery features include the ability to import any storage domain into different oVirt engine instances and replication can be managed from oVirt with GlusterFS geo-replication feature, or by utilizing synchronous/asynchronous block level replication provided by storage hardware vendors. oVirt engine backups can be automated and periodically transferred to a remote location. oVirt supports hyper-converged infrastructure deployment scenarios. Self-hosted engine and Gluster-based storage domains allow centralized management of all resources that can be seamlessly expanded, simply by adding an appropriate number of nodes to the cluster, without having any single points of failure. oVirt provides deep integration with Gluster, including Gluster specific performance improvements.

It is located off Schastya Bay, between the shorebound lagoon and the sea. Baydukov Island lies only 2 km off its east-southeast tip. Chkalov Island is long and narrow. It is 20.5 km long and has an average width of 1 km. This island is a natural habitat for many birds, like the great knot, red-necked stint, dunlin, whimbrel, bar-tailed godwit and the common sandpiper. Beluga whales are common off its northern waters. Administratively Chkalov Island belongs to the Khabarovsk Krai of the Russian Federation. History Chkalov Island is named after Soviet pilot Valery Pavlovich Chkalov (1904‚Äì1938), the commander on the Antonov ANT-25 plane that flew on July 20, 1936 from Moscow through Franz Joseph Land, Severnaya Zemlya, Petropavlovsk and Khabarovsk. The plane landed 56 hours and 20 minutes later in the evening twilight, in thick fog, on a coastal strip in Udd Island after having covered . The three-man crew remained overnight on this island at the home of a local resident, Fetin'ya Andreevna Smirnova. In order to take off a wooden runway had to be built. Udd Island was renamed Chkalov Island by Stalin in commemoration of the record-breaking event.History In 2006, this historical flight was recreated on a Sukhoi Su-30 to mark the 70th anniversary of Chkalov's prowess.Anatoliy Kvochur's Su-30 Airplane Lands at Zhukovskiy References * Avian flu bird data for Chkalov Island External links * Location map of Chkalov Island * Photos of Chkalov Island Category:Islands of the Sea of Okhotsk Category:Islands of the Russian Far East Category:Islands of Khabarovsk Krai Category:Uninhabited islands of Russia Category:Uninhabited islands of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Chkalov Island"},{"id":"18038616","text":"Taghir Pata is a village in Balkh Province in northern Afghanistan.

According to the Archaeological Gazetteer of Afghanistan, the minaret was built in 1108‚Äì09. However, some archaeological studies suggest that the date of the construction of the minaret is approximately around the year 760. As the minaret is climbable, local citizens have scaled the tower and some have fallen to their deaths in attempts. Near the minaret is the Shrine of Hazrat Saleh, which is an Islamic pilgrim site. In the 12th century, the village was missed by Genghis Khan and the invading Mongols. Archaeology has taken place in the village, including works by the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA).

McGinley, and Steve Buscemi, along with a variety of other known actors, which has since become a cult classic among western genre fans. It was directed by Geoff Murphy and written by Eric Red. It was initially broadcast on HBO on October 30, 1993.https://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-24/news/tv-49010_1_hbo-shoots Introduction The story follows a band of former Confederate soldiers who were part of a cavalry unit that had fought during the American Civil War, with few surviving to its end. Their commander, Graff (Rourke) had once been a heroic and staunch supporter of the southern cause, but after losing his family he became cold hearted and ruthless. His second in command is Eustis (Mulroney), whom Graff has trained since 1861 on the strategies of leadership and combat command, right down to knowing exactly how many rounds of ammunition each of his soldiers has. The film centers around the relationship between Graff and Eustis, and the irony of Eustis turning on Graff due to Graff making a decision that Eustis disagrees with, and which mirrors a decision Eustis is also forced to make himself as a commander later. Plot When the war ends, the cavalry unit commanded by Graff makes the decision to stay together, and turn outlaw. They begin committing bank robberies, and are successful due to their experience and tactics. Local citizens and lawmen are no match for them. However, when a robbery goes horribly wrong, resulting in the unit being shot up badly, with Loomis (Quinn) badly wounded, they find themselves pursued by Marshal Sharp, who is capable and respected. Graff makes the command decision to kill the injured Loomis so that he won't delay their escape. Eustis objects, and when Graff strikes Eustis then moves to shoot Loomis, Eustis instead shoots Graff. Graff falls out of his saddle and rolls down a hillside; thinking he is dead, Eustis takes command and leads the band toward Mexico, with the posse still in pursuit. Marshal Sharp and the posse come upon the slightly wounded Graff, and take him prisoner. With Graff in chains, they continue their chase. Eustis sets up an ambush and several posse members are killed. During the chaos Graff kills Marshal Sharp. Now leaderless, the remaining men decide to return home. Banker McClintock reminds them that they will receive no reward money if they leave. Graff suggests that anyone who stays should take the reward share of those who leave; the men ask if that includes the share of those who were just killed. McClintock reluctantly says yes. With Graff now their leader, they set up an ambush. Graff shoots and kills Philo (Buscemi). A member of the posse tries to cut off Philo's trigger finger for a trophy. Graff puts his gun to the man's lips and tells him that because Philo was one of his (Graff's) men, everyone will show the proper respect. Wills (McGinley) grabs the stolen money off Eustis' horse and rides back to leave it for the posse, believing this gesture will end the chase. When McClintock rides up to the spot on the hill where Wills leaves the money, Graff follows and throws both the money and the banker off the cliff. He then fires his guns to make it seem like there has been a shootout with the outlaws, and he tells the posse the situation had been a trap. Graff stands by as the posse engages in an internal shootout over what to do next. While Potts (Levine) is giving Wills a beating for his action concerning the money, it becomes clear that the deed did not 'save their skins', as Lovecraft (David) spots Graff and his remaining riders coming toward them. Eustace and Graff meet in an isolated saloon, but no peace is brokered. Graff says that Eustace owes him 'everything.' Potts challenges Eustis' ability as a commander, but Eustis beats him in a fist fight. As the outlaws continue trekking to Mexico, Graff shoots Loomis from a hilltop. The others take cover behind rocks, but Loomis is left in the open; Graff tortures him, shooting him in different parts of the body every few seconds. Finally, Eustace is forced to put Loomis out of his misery. Later, the remaining outlaws encounter Graff almost as if he is a ghost, keeping them off-balance and nervous. During one of these encounters, Graff shoots Wills' horse. Wills rides with Lovecraft, but the horse cannot take the weight. Eustis decides it is necessary to leave Wills behind. Wills waits for the posse and stands his ground as long as he can, killing a couple of them before he is killed. The three left briefly split up to investigate the whereabouts of Graff and his gang. Lovecraft chances upon Graff, who gives him extra ammunition, telling him he will be spared if he kills Eustis. When they reunite and Eustis gives Lovecraft ammunition to load his pistol, he finds that Lovecraft already has a full chamber. Eustis, knowing that Lovecraft did not have a full six rounds left, realizes that Lovecraft has betrayed him. However, when Eustis presses for Lovecraft to do what Graff sent him to do, Lovecraft is overwhelmed with fear and guilt, and commits suicide. Eustis and Potts make for the Rio Grande, but as they are about to cross, Graff shoots Potts through the gut. Eustis makes a lone, final stand against the posse. He gets hit, but kills all of them except Graff. The two draw, and Eustis is faster, but his gun is empty. As Graff approaches, Eustis shoots him with a pocket derringer, which Graff had not counted on. Eustis crosses into Mexico, the last outlaw.

It was first published in a private edition of eleven volumes, at the expense of the author, including an imperfect index, which appeared over seven years beginning around 1888. The work itself is enormous, amounting to over one million words, the eleven original volumes amounting to over 4,000 pages. The text is repetitive and highly disorganised,For an analysis of the original edition's production and Walter's methods of composition, see Steven Marcus, The Other Victorians. but its frank discussion of sexual matters and other hidden aspects of Victorian life make it a rare and valuable social document. According to Steven Marcus, it is virtually the only source for information on London's houses of prostitution, in which Walter spent many hours. It has been described as \\"one of the strangest and most obsessive books ever written\\".Patrick J. Kearney (1982) A History of Erotic Literature. Parragon: 127 Publishing and bans The first edition was probably printed by Auguste Brancart, in an impression of only 25 copies. In the twentieth century My Secret Life was pirated and reprinted in a number of abridged versions that were frequently suppressed for obscenity. In 1932, for example, a New York publisher was arrested for issuing the first three volumes. In the USA it was finally published without censorship in 1966 by Grove Press, but in 1969 a British printer, Arthur Dobson, was sentenced to two years' prison for producing a UK reprint. It was not until 1995 that the work in its entirety was published openly in the UK, by Arrow Books. Authorship The identity of \\"Walter\\" is unknown. There is no scholarly consensus in favour of any of the candidates proposed. The most commonly suggested author is Henry Spencer Ashbee (1834‚Äì1900). He was a book collector, writer, and bibliographer and, from the three volumes he published under his pseudonym Pisanus Fraxi, the expert on erotic books in his day. Gershon Legman was the first to link \\"Walter\\" and Ashbee, in his introduction to the 1962 reprints of Ashbee's bibliographies, and the 1966 Grove Press edition of My Secret Life included an expanded version of that essay. Ashbee was also identified as Walter by a May 2000, Channel 4 documentary on British TV, Walter: The Secret Life of a Victorian Pornographer - and in 2001 Ian Gibson's The Erotomaniac: the secret life of Henry Spencer Ashbee (2001, ) provided a detailed review of circumstantial evidence arguing that Ashbee wrote My Secret Life, presumably weaving fantasy and anecdotes from friends in with his own real-life experiences. If Ashbee was not the actual author, it is suggested that he may well have been the compiler of the work's lengthy, detailed, and very imperfect index, and have provided other editorial assistance and help in getting the book into print. On the other hand, Steven Marcus, in his influential The Other Victorians (1966), concluded that the balance of known facts was against Legman's \\"shrewd and ingenious guess.\\" Also unconvinced were Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen in their detailed study of My Secret Life, Walter, the English Casanova (1967). A number of other men have been suggested as more likely to be the author, including: * William Simpson Potter (1805-1879), a known associate of Ashbee, was put forward by Gordon Grimley in his introduction to the 1972 edition of My Secret Life. Grimley is sceptical of Ashbee's candidacy as the main author. According to Ashbee, Potter was involved in authoring The Romance of Lust, an erotic work centred on incest and a range of sexual encounters.Gordon Grimley (1972) My Secret Life; Introduction. London: Granada Publishing, 1972; pp. 7-17 * Charles Stanley, a barrister and stockbroker, was put forward in 2000 by Vern Bullough and Gordon Stein as the most likely candidate, the known facts of whose life best coincide with the internal evidence of the work. \\"Walter\\" claimed to be a close friend of the barrister in a famous case of the time, which they identify as the case of R v Richard Clarke in 1854. That barrister, William Overend QC, was a childhood friend of Stanley. * William Haywood (1821-1894), who was Surveyor and Engineer to the City of London Commissioners of Sewers was suggested by John Patrick Pattinson in 2002 after extensive research. \\"The Man Who Was Walter\\" Victorian Literature and Culture, vol. 30, no. 1, pp. 19-40 Veracity The question of how much the book is a record of true experiences (whether of Ashbee or another writer), and how much is fiction or erotic fantasy can probably never be fully resolved. However, the presence of much mundane detail, the writer's inclusion of incidents that do him little personal credit, and the lack of intrinsically improbable circumstances (in contrast to most Victorian erotica) lend it considerable credibility. In spite of \\"Walter's\\" obsessive womanising over a period of several decades, only a few of his partners are of his own social class. The great majority are either prostitutes, servants or working class women. This would appear to reflect the realities of his time. Internal evidence from the book suggests that \\"Walter\\" was born between 1820 and 1825. In the last volume he notes seeing the books through print, which indicates that he was still alive in the 1890s.Steven Marcus (1969) The Other Victorians: a Study of Sexuality and Pornography in Mid-Nineteenth-Century England.

Life Wallmoden was an illegitimate son of George II of Great Britain by his mistress Amalie von Wallmoden. She was married to Adam Gottlieb, Count Wallmoden (1704‚àí1752), but for a payment of 1000 Ducats the Count was prepared to defer his claims on his wife to George, and was finally separated from her in 1740. On the death of Queen Caroline in 1737, the Prime Minister, Robert Walpole, suggested that Amalie be brought over from Hanover to Britain to take her place as ma√Ætresse en titre to George II. In the meantime Lady Deloraine, a loquacious but not very intelligent courtesan, with whom George had a distant relationship, functioned as a stopgap. Thus the young Johann Ludwig came to be conceived in England and grew up at St. James's Palace and Kensington Palace. As an illegitimate son of the king, he received a comprehensive education, after which he went on a Grand Tour to Italy, where he acquired an extensive collection of classical statues, busts, and reliefs. On his return he entered the Hanoverian army and rose to the rank of major general. Palace of Herrenhausen, 2014 Around the year 1700, several noblemen's country estates had been established in the former flood plain of the Leine. In 1768 Wallmoden acquired some of these gardens and merged them into the Wallmodengarten (later to become the Georgengarten). In 1782 he built the Wallmoden-Schloss to house his collections of antiquities. In 1782 he bought the Reichsherrschaft Gimborn in Westphalia from Prince Johann I. of Schwarzenberg, and on 17 January 1783 was raised to the nobility of the Holy Roman Empire by the emperor Joseph II, with the title Wallmoden- Gimborn and with a corresponding augmentation of his coat-of-arms to Imperial count. Simultaneously, Wallmoden attained a seat and a voice on the Westphalian College of Imperial Counts, and therewith on the Reichsstandschaft. After the death of count Philipp II of Schaumburg-Lippe (1723‚àí1787), Wallmoden-Gimborn acted for his widow (princess Juliane of Hesse Philippsthal) as guardian of her younger son and heir George William (1784‚àí1860). From 1790 to 1811, he was an honorary member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. On 5 July 1803, as Oberbefehlshaber (commander-in- chief) of the Hanoverian army, he signed the convention of Artlenburg and thus capitulated before the Napoleonic troops arrived. After Wallmoden-Gimborn's death, his nephew King George III acquired his collections of antique sculpture and books, over 8000 volumes. The collections are still in the ownership of the Welfs and since 1979 have formed a collection of the Archeological Institute in G√∂ttingen. Marriages Wallmoden-Gimborn was first married in Hanover on 18 April 1766 to Charlotte Christiane Auguste Wilhelmine von Wangenheim (1740‚àí1783), and they had five children: * Ernst Georg August (8 May 1767‚àí1 January 1792) * Ludwig Georg Thedel (6 February 1769‚àí20 March 1862), who became an Austrian General of Cavalry * Georgine Charlotte Auguste (1 February 1770‚àí13 August 1859) * Wilhelmine Magdalene Friederike (22 June 1772‚àí15 September 1819), who in 1793 married Baron Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein * Friedrike Eleonore Juliane (12 July 1776‚àí18 February 1826), who married Ludwig Friedrich Count von Kielmansegg and was the mother of Wallmoden's second marriage, on 3 August 1788 in B√ºckeburg, was to Baroness Luise Christiane von Lichtenstein (1763‚àí1809), a daughter of Baron Friedrich Karl von Lichtenstein by his marriage to Charlotte Ernestine von Berckefeld, and with her he had three further children: * Karl August Ludwig (4 January 1792‚àí28 February 1883), an Austrian Privy Councillor and Lieutenant-General. In 1833 he married Zoe, Countess von Gr√ºnne, daughter of , and from him is descended the Oberhaus Wallmoden line. * Adolf Franz James Wilhelm (25 December 1794‚àí3 December 1825) * Luise Henriette (1796‚àí1851) See also *House of Wallmoden Literature * Ralf Bormann: Wallmoden‚Äôs Collections at Hanover-Herrenhausen Depicted: Towards the Reconstruction of a Baroque aemulatio of the Uffizi, in: Andrea M.

Baeksuk is made with chicken or pheasant with plenty of water for several hours. However, the term generally indicates dakbaeksuk (Îã≠Î∞±Ïàô, chicken baeksuk), or chicken stew, whose recipe and ingredients are similar to samgyetang. While samgyetang is made with ginseng, various herbs, chestnuts, and jujubes, dakbaeksuk consists of simpler ingredients, such as chicken, water, and garlic. The chicken can be stuffed with glutinous rice. When the cooking is finished, salt and sliced Welsh onions (daepa, ÎåÄÌåå) are added to the diner's bowl according to taste. If the baesuk is not stuffed with glutinous rice, it is usually eaten with cooked rice. It is often seen as a simpler and cheaper variant of samgyetang. Sometimes it is mistakenly used as another word for samgyetang. Dak hanmari Dak-han-mari The dak hanmari (Îã≠ÌïúÎßàÎ¶¨) is a popular South Korean dish to have developed from baeksuk, which is said to originate in Dongdaemun area, Seoul since the 1960s.

It was developed at the University of Amsterdam as an alternative to an evolutionary approach and is now accepted as the European standard for knowledge based systems. Its components are: *A methodology for managing knowledge engineering projects. *A knowledge engineering workbench. *A methodology for performing knowledge elicitation. KADS was further developed into CommonKADS.  KADS methodology and the industrial development of expert systems  A study carried out in 1989 showed that the main reason why expert systems were not being used was an insufficiency of methods for development, especially in the construction of knowledge bases, e.g. the transfer of expertise. Knowledge Based Systems Analysis and Design Support (KADS) originating in the European ESPRIT project P1098 and representing 75 person-years of work, was one of the most highly developed KBs (Knowledge Based Systems) in the early 90s. This pioneering method provides two types of support for the production of KBs in an industrial approach: firstly, a lifecycle enabling a response to be made to technical and economic constraints (control of the production process, quality assurance of the system,...), and secondly a set of models which structure the production of the system, especially the tasks of analysis and the transformation of expert knowledge into a form exploitable by the machine.

In humans and other animals they include both vitamin deficiencies and mineral deficiencies, whereas in plants the term refers to deficiencies of essential trace minerals. Humans Micronutrient deficiencies affect more than two billion people of all ages in both developing and industrialized countries. They are the cause of some diseases, exacerbate others and are recognized as having an important impact on worldwide health. Important micronutrients include iodine, iron, zinc, calcium, selenium, fluorine, and vitamins A, B6, B12, B1, B2, B3, B9 and C. Micronutrient deficiencies are associated with 10% of all children's deaths, and are therefore of special concern to those involved with child welfare. Deficiencies of essential vitamins or minerals such as Vitamin A, iron, and zinc may be caused by long-term shortages of nutritious food or by infections such as intestinal worms. They may also be caused or exacerbated when illnesses (such as diarrhoea or malaria) cause rapid loss of nutrients through feces or vomit.The Development of Concepts of Malnutrition, Journal of Nutrition, 132:2117S-2122S, July 1, 2002. Plants In plants a micronutrient deficiency (or trace mineral deficiency) is a physiological plant disorder which occurs when a micronutrient is deficient in the soil in which a plant grows. Micronutrients are distinguished from macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium and magnesium) by the relatively low quantities needed by the plant.* A number of elements are known to be needed in these small amounts for proper plant growth and development.A Companion to Plant Physiology, Fourth Edition. Wade Berry, UCLA. Topic 5.1 Symptoms of Deficiency In Essential Minerals. Sinauer Publishing. Nutrient deficiencies in these areas can adversely affect plant growth and development. Some of the best known trace mineral deficiencies include: zinc deficiency, boron deficiency, iron deficiency, and manganese deficiency. = List of essential trace minerals for plants = *Boron is believed to be involved in carbohydrate transport in plants; it also assists in metabolic regulation. Boron deficiency will often result in bud dieback. *Chlorine is necessary for osmosis and ionic balance; it also plays a role in photosynthesis. *Copper is a component of some enzymes and of vitamin A. Symptoms of copper deficiency include browning of leaf tips and chlorosis. *Iron is essential for chlorophyll synthesis, which is why an iron deficiency results in chlorosis. *Manganese activates some important enzymes involved in chlorophyll formation. Manganese deficient plants will develop chlorosis between the veins of its leaves. The availability of manganese is partially dependent on soil pH. *Molybdenum is essential to plant health. Molybdenum is used by plants to reduce nitrates into usable forms. Some plants use it for nitrogen fixation, thus it may need to be added to some soils before seeding legumes. *Nickel is essential for activation of urease, an enzyme involved with nitrogen metabolism that is required to process urea. *Zinc participates in chlorophyll formation, and also activates many enzymes.

In 1993, he was elected as a Councilman of the Village of El Portal, in Miami-Dade County, Florida. In 2000, Derose became the first Haitian-American to be elected mayor in the United States when he was elected Mayor of the Village of El Portal. He served as a Councilman for the City of North Miami Beach between 2003 - 2013 and serves as the President of his own non-profit organization, the Haitian-American Alliance Youth Foundation. Early life and education Philippe Derose was born in the commune of Liancourt, Haiti on November 22, 1952. He grew up in the town of St. Marc. His father worked in construction, helping to build roads and also worked for the Haitian government in different capacities as a foreman. His mother was a businesswoman who sold cooked food (rice, beans, etc.) that she prepared in the countryside before traveling to big cities like the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince, to sell the food. Derose is the third child of nine children, with other siblings living in Florida, Haiti, and New York. Desiring to come to America in search of a better life, he moved with his wife, Marie, from Haiti to Brooklyn, New York in 1974. He completed his high school equivalency in 1976 and in 1977-1979 Derose attended York College. He obtained his bachelor's degree in Psychology at California Coast University. Personal life Philippe Derose is married to Marie Derose, and he is the father of three children, all who hold careers in community and/or public service., Sendy Derose is a Registered Nurse in Miami, Florida, James Derose works for the United Nations in Haiti, and Frantzy Derose, a state certified Paramedic, Frantzy also heads his father's non-profit organization serving as the Executive Director for the Haitian-American Alliance Youth Foundation Inc. Philippe Derose has five grandchildren. Political career in El Portal In 1990, while he was living in the Village of El Portal, Derose noticed at the time that there was a small Haitian community in the area. When he began to attend Homeowner's Association (HOA) Meetings in his residential community, he developed his passion as an advocate for the community and after garnering support from his peers, he became a voice for the community. In 1990, Philippe Derose ran his first political race, attempting to be elected for the city council of the Village of El Portal. He was unsuccessful. He ran for city council again in 1991 and was unsuccessful for a second time. With two years of unsuccessful attempts of securing a position in the public office, Derose changed his strategy when he ran for city council for the third time in 1992. In the first two years he had campaigned, he concentrated solely on Haitian- American voters. When he re-developed his campaign strategy in 1992, he realized he needed to gain the support of the Anglo and Hispanic voters, so his new strategy included targeting all ethnic groups. In 1993, after a strong campaign with this new strategy, he was the 1st place elected (obtaining the most votes) member of the Village of El Portal City Council becoming the first Haitian-American elected into public office in the United States. After serving as Mayor of the Village of El Portal for one year, Derose voluntarily vacated his seat and was elected to the North Miami Beach City Council. Political career in North Miami Beach As a Councilman for the City of North Miami Beach, one of Derose's major platforms was the beautification of the community, especially the planting and healthy maintenance of trees, shrubs, and greenery. A nature-lover, Derose commemorated Arbor Day by orchestrating community initiatives to plant trees and to distribute seedlings to residents. Derose served on the North Miami Beach City Council as Councilman between 2003 and 2013. Earthquake in Haiti A catastrophic earthquake (with a Richter score of 7) occurred in Haiti on January 12, 2010. Less than two weeks after this devastating act of nature, Derose traveled on a private plane to his homeland of Haiti with a delegation of government officials, some of which included other notable Haitian-American officials. Upon arrival in Haiti, a sad Derose looked at the unrecognizable places that once appeared familiar and noted, \\"What man took many years to build, was gone, wiped out in a matter of seconds.\\" Once the delegation reached the ravaged island-nation, they met with the central government in Haiti, consisting of Haitian and local officials including Parliament. Also included in this delegation was Patrick Gaspard, the Director of the Office of Political Affairs for President Barack Obama's Administration, and Vice- President of the United States, Joe Biden. Along with these officials, Derose assisted in the expedition of the process to obtain aid for Haiti.

Their ancestral seat of Wallmoden is today a town in Goslar. Branches of the family still survive. Its most notable members include Amalie von Wallmoden (a member by marriage, and a mistress of George II of Great Britain), Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn (Amalie and George's illegitimate son) and Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn (Johan's son). Elder line of the family belonged to High nobility. History The family was already in existence in the second half of the 12th century. One of its first demonstrable members was Thedel von Wallmoden, named in documents from 1154 onwards. An Eschwin von Wallmoden was mentioned in 1181. The Knight Templar Aschwin von Wallmoden is mentioned in 1307, on the dissolution of the Templars by Pope Clement V, at which time the Heinde herrschaft was a fiefdom of the Bishop of Hildesheim. Through marriage and inheritances, the family was able to significantly extend its property and continued into the 18th century. The marriage of Henning von Wallmoden (1335‚Äì1393) with Agnes von Hallermund led to the uniting of both the lordly families in Heinde. Thedel von Wallmoden (‚Ä† 1529), Stadthauptmann of Goslar, was the origin of both family lines. The elder line or upper house included Johan and his mother Amalie. In 1782 this line acquired from the princedom of Schwarzenberg the Reichsherrschaft Gimborn in Westphalia and on 17 January 1783 was raised by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor to the name of Wallmoden-Gimborn and promoted to Reichsgraf. Of the first graf's descendants, the last was Graf Karl August Ludwig von Wallmoden- Gimborn, k.u.k. geheimer Rat, who died on 26 February 1883 in Prague. The younger line or lower house has been able to retain the property of the Stamsitz, temporarily a 'Fideikommiss', right up to the present day. Also the first names Thedel has been kept up in the family to the present day. Coat of arms The tribe crest shows three (2 over 1) black rams on an or ground. On the helmet are two rams' horns, with black and gold stripes. The crest running off the back of the helmet is also black and gold. Thedel von Wallmoden In the 16th century Georg Thym wrote a variant of the 'Henry the Lion' saga under the title Thedel von Wallmoden (published by Paul Zimmermann in 1887).

This was an initiative of the T1 Committee of the United States who invited the other founding partner organizations ITU-T, ETSI and the Japanese TTC to the first ISC Meeting in Fredericksburg, VA. The goal was set by the ‚Äúspirit of Melbourne‚Äù, stemming from a CCITT Plenary Assembly, to find a way of co-operation between Participating Standards Organizations (PSOs) from different regions of the world in order to facilitate global standardization within the ITU (International Telecommunication Union). The ITSC focussed its work on fixed telecommunications networks. After a few years, the ITSC, as a conference, became too big and was therefore reduced to GSC, the Global Standards Collaboration, with delegations limited to a reasonable size (10 maximum). The first GSC meeting was held in 1994 in Melbourne, Australia. Around the same time, it was decided to expand the scope to cover Radio Communications with the addition of a parallel set of Global Radio Standardization (RAST) meeting, the first one being hosted by ETSI in Nice in October 1994. In the course of the time, the Australian, Canadian, Korean and Chinese national standards organizations joined bringing the number of Participating Standards Organizations to ten. Observers from other standards-related organizations and Fora are also invited to participate. In November 2001, it was decided to rename GSC as GTSC (where T = Telecoms) and RAST as GRSC (where R = Radio) and to use the term GSC an overall \\"umbrella\\" for the combined plenary sessions. GSC meets approximately once every year. GSC-16 was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from October 31 to November 3, 2011 hosted by the ICT Standards Advisory Council of Canada (ISACC).

His practice uses a wide range of media, including video, installation, photography, drawing, and performance.  Early life and education  Adam Chodzko was born in London, England. He graduated from the University of Manchester in 1988 with a degree in the History of Art and in 1994 completed an MA in Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, London.http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/grant_recipients/adamchodzko.html  Work  Chodzko's artworks explore the interactions and possibilities of human behaviour \\"in the gap between how we are and how we could be.\\" Exhibiting work since 1991, working across media, from video installation to subtle interventions, and with a practice that is situated both within the gallery and the wider public realm, Chodzko's work explores our collective imagination by wondering how, through the visual, we might best engage with the existence of others. His art proposes new relationships between our value and belief systems, examining their effect on our communal and private spaces and working with the documents and fictions that control, describe and guide these systems and spaces. Working directly with the networks of people and places that surround him, often using forms of anthropology,Andrew Wilson,'The Sacred and Traversal of Social Space', Adam Chodzko Proxigean Tide, Tate Publishing. 2008. pp 25-32, he focuses on the relational politics of culture's edges, endings, displacements, transitions and disappearances through a provocative looking in the 'wrong' place.Grant Pooke, \\"Contemporary British Art, An Introduction\\", 2010, pp 206‚Äì8, Routledge. Chodzko's practice operates between documentary and fantasy (especially in the form of \\"science fiction\\", using art to propose alternative realities), conceptualism and surrealismAndrew Wilson,'The Sacred and Traversal of Social Space', \\"Adam Chodzko Proxigean Tide\\", Tate Publishing. 2008. pp 25-32, and public and private space, often engaging reflexively and directly with the role of the viewer.http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/7D13B249-2AAE-4870-8907-8712E6320C5D Examples of Chodzko's socially-engaged artworks include Product Recall (1994, posters, advertisements and video installation), using the process of a product recall to assemble owners of a particular jacket made ten years earlier; Sal√≤:ReunionTeresa Macr√¨, Il Manifesto, \\"In cerco di Salo\\", 8 November 1997.Jonathan Jones, The Guardian, \\"Faces of Evil\\", p. 12, 18 August 1998.

Chodzko's development of these ideas and processes later became consolidated into a body of work collectively titled Design for a Carnival (c. 2001‚Äì2007). This includes works such as Plan for a Spell (2001, a video exploring ritual within the British landscape through programming its image, subtitles and audio to randomly combine in order to release a potential 'spell' embedded within it); Settlement (2004, the legal purchase of a square foot of land as a gift to a stranger), NightshiftGabriel Coxhead, \\"Who let the wolf out?\\" The Times T2, 13 October 2005.

A trilogy of video installations, Hole (2007, at Bologna Museum of Modern Art), Around (2007, based in Dublin and partly set in Ballymun) and Pyramid (2008, commissioned for the Folkestone Triennial) developed a series of myths set in the near future and focused on the relationship between a community and its architectural ruins.Proxigean Tide, essays by Martin Clark, Martin Herbert, Lisa Le Feuvre, Andrew Wilson, Tate Publishing, David Barrett, \\"Bad Timing\\", Art Monthly, no. 318, cover, pp 1-6, July 2008. Echo (2009, a video installation commissioned by Creative Time, New York), interweaves archive footage, documentary technique and conjecture to reveal that a derelict military ballroom on Governors Island, New York, was a site used for an anti- materialistic gift-exchange ritual invented by the children of the island's military. Throughout these earlier works, and further explored in later works such as The Pickers (2009, the editing of a British film archive by a group of migrant Romanian strawberry pickers) and Ghost (2010, a kayak designed by Chodzko for \\"visiting the dead\\"), are investigations into processes of how memory, archiving, empathy, identification and the imaginary are shaped by the act of looking. Because, (2013, at Tate Britain, as part of the exhibition Schwitters in Britain) and We are Ready for your Arrival (2013 at Raven Row, London) further develop these ideas through sculpture, video, drawing and photography, presented as manifestations of the unconscious relationships between individuals and groups; their excesses, displacements and disappearances.

Place as a site which appears to exercise power and influence over the people who happen to occupy it is often explored through Chodzko's use of displacement, separating objects and images from their familiar and 'natural' time and situation in order to relocate them in the \\"wrong place\\" so that a change might be catalysed by that dislocation.

The theme of physically remote but intimate cross-cultural social networks, operating on both a conscious and unconscious (or even supernatural) level, has been a consistent theme in Chodzko's work, from the anticipation of digital social-networking communities in the Transmitter series (1990-) and The god Look-Alike ContestRachel Greene, Internet Art, Thames and Hudson, pp.206‚Äì207, Andrew Renton, Adam Chodzko, Room for Laarni Image Moderator p. 31, Marlborough Contemporary. (1991) and more recently in the installation A Room for Laarni, Image Moderator (2013). This latter series of mixed-media works are based around the relationship and flow of images between a western European social-networking site (for teenagers) and an image moderator, based in the Philippines, whose job it is to monitor this flood of digital photographs, in order to flag up those whose contents might be deemed 'bad'. Although curated into many of the major Young British Artist exhibitions (e.g.; Sensation (art exhibition), and Brilliant!) of the 1990s (and in 2014, London Calling), Chodzko's practice - from his 1990 works with pre-internet social networks via classified advertisements - is more closely identifiable (through its notions of participation, process, intersubjectivity and community) with the Relational art that was to follow (partly in opposition to the dependency on spectacle that defined YBA art). Kevin Jackson, (1996)Kevin Jackson, 'Brit Pop Art', Arena, April, pp.60‚Äì66, 1996 singled out Chodzko from the other YBA's for his art's \\"pensiveness\\", involving \\"quiet acts of infiltration...nothing to do with one-line shock effects.\\" In 2013, Dan Fox, reappraising the diversity of British Art of the early 1990s, writes of Chodzko's work from this period as developing a \\"British occult modern... behavioural experiments to probe the public sphere.\\", whilst Jonathan Jones (journalist) described Chodzko as a \\"subversive...master of provocation\\" in The Guardian. = Exhibitions = Since 1991, Chodzko has exhibited at numerous venues around the world including Tate Britain; Tate St Ives; Venice Biennale; Royal Academy, London; Deste Foundation, Athens; PS1, NY; Ikon Gallery, Birmingham; Kunstmuseum Luzern; Henry Moore Institute, Leeds; Yorkshire Sculpture Park; Athens Biennale; Istanbul Biennial; Benaki Museum, Athens; and Folkestone Triennial. His commissioners include Creative Time, NY; The Contemporary Art Society; Frieze Art Fair; Hayward Gallery and Film And Video Umbrella. Chodzko has been included in many British Council curated international exhibitions of British Art including General Release (1995) in Venice, Micro/Macro: British Art 1996-2002,(2003), Mucsarnok Kunsthalle, Budapest, Breaking Step (2007), Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade, and Private Utopia(2014), Japan. = Awards = In 2002, Chodzko received awards from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award, and in 2007 was awarded an AHRC Creative Research Fellowship in the Film Department at the University of Kent, Canterbury. In 2015 Chodzko was shortlisted for the Jarman Award. In 2016 Chodzko was awarded an award from DACS ART360 in order to facilitate the comprehensive archiving of his artwork from 1990 to the present. = Collections = Chodzko's work is in the collections of the Tate; The British Council; The Arts Council; The British Film Institute; Artist Pension Trust; Auckland City Art Gallery; Contemporary Art Society; The Creative Foundation: Folkestone; Frac Languedoc-Rousillon; GAM - Galleria d‚ÄôArte Moderna, Turin; Grizedale Arts; LUX; Museo d‚ÄôArte Moderna di Bologna; Plains Art Museum, North Dakota; Saatchi Collection, South London Gallery; Towner Gallery, Eastbourne, and numerous international museums and private collections. = Teaching = The socially engaged concerns of Chodzko's artistic practice are partly evident in his Fine Art teaching at Higher Education and Further Education institutions, on B.A. and M.A. degree courses. Chodzko is senior lecturer in Fine Art at the University of Kent's School of Music and Fine Art, based at Chatham Dockyard. He has lectured and, or, tutored at numerous HE and FE institutions internationally including, in the UK; Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts, Slade School of Fine Art, Goldsmiths University of London, University of Kent, University for the Creative Arts, Sheffield Hallam University, Liverpool John Moores University and Ruskin College, Oxford. In the US: Carnegie Mellon University, Rutgers University. In Canada: Banff Centre.  Personal life  Adam Chodzko lives and works in Whitstable, Kent, and is married to the actress Gretchen Egolf.

The vehicle is in constant contact with the water, therefore the aerodynamic surfaces operate in ground effect. The name derives from the '‚ÄòAerodynamic Alleviation Concept‚Äô', presented by L.J. Doctors to illustrate the positive effect of using a wing-like superstructure on a catamaran configuration.Doctors, L. J., ‚ÄúANALYSIS OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AN EKRANOCAT: A VERY HIGH SPEED CATAMARAN WITH AERODYNAMIC ALLEVIATION‚Äù, International Conference on Wing In Ground Effect Craft (WIGs '97), RINA, 1997 Literature review In 1976, Shipps,Shipps, P. R., ‚ÄúHYBRID RAM-WING/PLANNING CRAFT - TODAY'S RACEBOATS, TOMORROW'S OUTLOOK‚Äù, AIAA/SNAME Advanced Marine Vehicles Conference, 1976 among other air-supported waterborne vehicles, analyzed a new kind of race boats, known as ‚Äòtunnel hull‚Äô race boats. Two planing sponsons act as aerodynamic end plates of the central ‚Äòchannel flow‚Äô or ram wing. These race boats immediately demonstrated to have better performances with respect to the conventional monohull race boats and a new race boat class was created. The advantages of this new configuration come from the aerodynamic lift. The additional aerodynamic lift can be equal to the 30-80% of the total weight of the marine vehicle. This means a lower hydrodynamic lift needed, therefore a lower chine and keel wetted length and a decreased hydrodynamic drag. Furthermore, the flow in the tunnel hull acts as an air cushion, damping the heave and pitch oscillation: the oscillations of the craft are smoother. Otherwise this aerodynamic lift can create safety and stability problem. Sometimes the craft, for example after a wave, can lose contact with the water. Generally the aerodynamic center is located upward with respect to the center of gravity, therefore when the vehicle jumps off the water the pitch moment is unbalanced and the vehicle performs a pitch- over. More generally, Shipps believed in the possible development of air- supported waterborne vehicle, capable of better performances, and suitable for littoral scenarios as well as for offshore scenarios. In 1978, Ward et al.Ward, T. M., Goelzer, H. F., Cook, P. M., ‚ÄúDESIGN AND PERFORMANCE OF THE RAM WING PLANING CRAFT - KUDU II‚Äù, AIAA/SNAME Advanced Marine Vehicles Conference, 1978 published an article on the design and performance of a ram wing planing craft: the KUDU II (KUDU I was mentioned in Shipps' article). This vehicle can be considered an AAMV, since it has two planing sponsons separated by a wing section. Therefore, it is a vehicle with aerodynamic and hydrodynamic surfaces, designed to obtain aerodynamic and hydrodynamic lift. In his article Ward presented the results of some trials: the KUDU II was able to run at . In 1978, Kallio,Kallio, J. A., ‚ÄúRESULTS OF FULL SCALE TRIALS ON TWO HIGH SPEED PLANING CRAFT (KUDU II AND KAAMA) ‚Äù, David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center, 1978 of the David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center, performed comparative tests between the KUDU II and the KAAMA. The KAAMA is a conventional mono-hull planing craft. The data obtained during comparative trials show that the KUDU II pitch motion, in sea state 2, at about 40 to , is about 30% to 60% lower than the conventional planing hull KAAMA. Unfortunately the KUDU II sustained severe damages during the trials, therefore there are little data available to compare. In 1996, Privalov and Kirillovikh Privalov, E. I., Kirillovikh, V. N., ‚ÄúTRANSPORT AMPHIBIOUS PLATFORMS: A NEW TYPE OF HIGH-SPEED CRAFT‚Äù, Workshop Proceedings of Ekranoplans & Very Fast Craft, 1996 presented a new vehicle concept called TAP, Transport Amphibious Platform. It can be considered an AAMV. The TAP consists in two hulls, like a catamaran, and a fuselage, a wing and an aerodynamic tail in between the hulls. It moves always in contact with the water and uses an aerodynamic cushion effect, obtained by forcing the powerplant gas jets beneath the platform between the hulls. The authors assess that the advantages of the TAP are: *the high speed, compared to air cushion vehicles and ships (around 250 km/h), *amphibious capability, *high cargo- carrying capacity, also due to his higher weight efficiency, obtained by a more simplified structural scheme as compared to hovercraft and WIGe vehicles. This vehicle seems to be very promising, however the authors presented only performances estimation of the TAP, without disclosing any detail on the dynamics model adopted. In 1997, Doctors proposed a new configuration called Ekranocat for which he mentioned the aerodynamic alleviation concept. The weight of the catamaran is alleviated by aerodynamic lift, thanks to a more streamlined superstructure than in traditional catamarans. The theoretical analysis and computed results show that reductions in total drag around 50% can be obtained at very high speed.

It retains much of its original character, including architecture inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement.  Geography  A Chorltonville road sign The Chorltonville estate comprises 262 houses in twelve roads, centred on a \\"village green\\", The Meade. It measures about 550 yards east-west by 280 yards north-south‚Äîaround 26 acres. The estate is separated from the central part of Chorlton on the north by Chorlton Brook,The brook formed the historic boundary between Hardy and its northern neighbour Chorlton. and on the south side borders the Hardy Lane residential area and the fields of Hardy Farm in the Mersey Valley Countryside area. Chorltonville Owners' Committee web site Vehicular access is via Claude Road (east) or Brookburn Road (north), and there is a footpath to Hurstville Road on the south side and another towards Hardy Farm to the south-west. The estate and an adjoining football field (owned and occupied by West Didsbury & Chorlton Football Club) are one of Manchester Council's 32 conservation areas. The designation was made in 1991.  History  The estate was conceived by two local businessmen, James Herbert Dawson and William John Vowles, and built between 1910 and 1911. Their objectives in building Chorltonville were: * To provide beautiful, healthy, conveniently planned homes, with plenty of light and abundance of fresh air, at reasonable rents. * To assist health by the provision of wide open spaces: giving ample accommodation for healthy outdoor recreation. * By laying out a bowling green, tennis courts, and otherwise providing for the social well-being of the tenants. * To prove that all this can be done so as to yield a satisfactory return on the capital invested. The original brochure. Albert Cuneo was responsible for the design and Thomas Whiteley for the construction.Nicholls, Robert (2004) Curiosities of Greater Manchester. Stroud: Sutton; p. 50 Dawson and Vowles had already developed a smaller area round Darley Avenue on the site of the former Darley Hall in Old Trafford, ca. 1909. At the time most houses were not supplied with electricity though the supply in Manchester had begun nearly 20 years earlier; the Chorltonville houses were supplied both with gas and electricity so that part of the house was lit by one and part by the other.Nicholls, Robert (2004) Curiosities of Greater Manchester. Stroud: Sutton; p. 50 The estate was opened on 7 October 1911 by Harry Nuttall, MP for Stretford. The houses were originally available for rental only, with annual rent starting at ¬£24. They were intended to be occupied by skilled artisans, but were quickly taken over by professional families. After the Second World War the Owners' Committee sold off the tennis courts and recreation area. The tennis courts were absorbed by gardens of adjoining Chorltonville houses, and the recreation area became a private football ground, currently owned by West Didsbury and Chorlton Football Club.Football Club website Traffic calming measures have been taken on Claude Road.  Characteristics of the estate  The Meade is dominated by a horse-chestnut tree. Inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, the builders attempted to make Chorltonville like a rural village using various techniques: * Curved, winding streets, emulating country lanes. * Grass verges beside the roadways. * Numerous trees (currently there are about 360 in the public areas). * Diverse house styles. Each pair of semi-detached houses mirror each other, but are slightly different from other pairs in the same street. * Use of interesting architectural details: bay windows, tile decals on gable ends and under windows, stained glass, exposed beams. * Two \\"village green\\" areas. Most of these features survive to the current day. Virtually all the original houses are still standing, although many have lost their stained glass. A programme of tree replacement ensures that the trees on the estate are healthy and new planting ensures their long-term well being.  Management of the estate  Chorltonville is a private estate, owned in common by all its home owners. A committee drawn from volunteers among the owners is responsible for maintaining: Brief of the management committee. * Roadways and footpaths * Grass verges * Trees * Drainage gullies * Lamp posts and street furniture To fund this work, all residents are liable for a levy (¬£155 in 2008) above the council tax paid to Manchester City Council.

In the following year, these were brought together in the Watford Technical School, with an annexe to the old library building opened by Lord Eustace Percy, an advocate of technical education. Inspectors praised the school in 1934 for its high employment rate among the skilled trades. It became a prestigious selective school, though behind Watford Grammar School for Boys and Watford Grammar School for Girls. Ambitious expansion plans were drawn up by the county council, but were shelved on the outbreak of the Second World War. Around 1960 the Watford Technical High School moved to cheaply constructed buildings on the north side of Bushey Hall Road. The Queen's Road site has since been demolished to make way for the Harlequin Shopping Centre. When the school became a comprehensive in 1971, it was renamed Bushey Hall School. The new school was simply a continuation of its predecessor, with no change in students, staff, and no special measures. Both road and school were named after the original Bushey Hall, which was located just to the north on Aldenham Road, and is now the site of a leisure centre and golf course. The school relocated to the London Road site in 1988, with September 1988 marked as the inaugural year for pupils at the new site. The buildings at the old Bushey Hall Road site remained derelict for 4 years before being demolished following a drowning in the old swimming pool. A housing estate and caravan site now occupy the Bushey Hall Road site. =The London Road site= The main hall, with masonic markings The current site is the location of the former Bushey Manor. The buildings were erected in 1928 to house the Royal Masonic School for Boys junior school, which opened in the following year. The school was designed to house 400 boarders in a line of four buildings connected by a cloister (covered walkway), across the quadrangle from the main building. The other buildings on the quadrangle were the dining hall (on the east side) and the teaching block and library (west). Due to falling rolls, the junior school closed in 1970. The site was then home to Grange Park School (a secondary school for boys) until it closed in 1987, when Bushey Hall School moved to the site. The building still bears evidence of its masonic heritage in the architectural detailing. The brick pillars to the main gate on London Road are topped with stone globes, unusually a lunar globe and oceanic globe. These relate closely with other celestial detailing on the site; in the main entrance hall a stained glass roof dome is marked with the 12 signs of the zodiac. Other masonic markings can be found on the stone lintels over significant doorways. Bushey School attained grant maintained status in the mid-1990s, converting to a foundation school when grant maintained status was abolished in 1999. The library was replaced in 1993 with the construction of a learning resource centre on the green space beside the gymnasium hall. An arson attack in 1994 destroyed the gymnasium roof and it was closed due to lack of funds to replace the heavy timber trusses. A temporary structure was built on the playing fields as a replacement gymnasium. Since to the introduction of partial selection in several other schools in southwest Hertfordshire in mid-1990s, the school's intake has been skewed toward the lower end of the ability range. Results at the school have been poor for several years and the school was placed in special measures in April 2008 following an Ofsted inspection in March 2008., Office for Standards in Education. As part of its improvement measures the school then applied for academy status. =Academy= The school converted to academy status in September 2009 and was renamed The Bushey Academy. The academy was originally sponsored by the David Meller Educational Trust and relocated to new buildings in January 2013. Jon Hebblethwaite was appointed as the school Principal in April 2017. In April 2018 the school was rated 'Inadequate' by Ofsted. As a consequence of this the school became sponsored by Future Academies in February 2020 and was later renamed The Grange Academy. The current Principal, Dr Philip Hills, was appointed in July 2020.

Education P√©rez Ad√°n obtained his doctorate (PhD) at Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia). Thought The sociology of Perez Adan hardly can dissociate from his life. In this sense one can affirm his vocation as a public sociologist. From his first investigations concerning the political theory of anarchism (his first book \\"Reformist Anarchism\\" was published in 1988) up to his commitment with communitarianism, has tried to make to see, both at theoretical and practical levels, the aptitude of human groups to manage its own affairs and the unnecessary importance we give to vertical structures of power. His bet on civil society can be traced, in addition to his books, from the foundation of the \\"Ecological Group of the Mediterranean\\" (Valencia, 1990) up to the starting of the \\"Free International University of the Americas\\" (San Jose of Costa Rica, 2001), a center of studies of postgraduate level not linked to any state and that thanks to the new technologies of communication works within a moneyless economy without fees or costs. Opposite to the refined contemporary individualism, Perez Adan defends the supremacy of society over the individual: \\"we all are born in families, languages, religions and cultures that exist already‚Äù. At the same time he defends the individual freedom, which understands not as the absence of domination (‚Äúthe recognition of the dependencies can be a factor of autoachievement‚Äù), but as the consequence of the growth of responsibility (‚Äúthe limit of one‚Äôs own freedom is not the freedom of others but our responsibility: beyond responsibility there is no freedom‚Äù). In the nucleus of the thought of Perez Adan is the study of identity and in particular the family as the builder of humanity: \\"what lies at the bottom of our human condition is our familiar condition‚Äù. His most interesting conceptual contributions have arisen concerning the study of the family. Thus, the concept of \\"alienness\\" (from familiar incommunicability the individuation stems), or that of \\"functional family\\" (that one that fulfils the functions that society expects from her, that is: generational equity, socialization, social control and cultural transmission). Perez Adan opposes the relativism that seems to dominate the sociological contemporary speech. The criterion of familiar functionality supposes the recognition that there can exist, and in fact there are, better and worse families. This distinction between better and worse can spread to any human group. In opinion of the author, the viability of the studies of development rests precisely on this premise. Perez Adan defends in his work that the viability of a free and prosperous future lies in the recognition and support to the ties that conform human groups and communities and in the parallel and progressive fading away of the structures of compulsive power.

The National Football League has the highest revenue and average attendance of any sports league in the world. In the United States the game is most often referred to as simply \\"football\\". Organization in the United States There is no single national governing body for American football in the United States or a continental governing body for North America. There is an international governing body, the International Federation of American Football, or IFAF. Befitting its status as a popular sport, football is played in leagues of different size, age and quality, in all regions of the country. A team / academy may be referred to as a 'football program'Division III football programs ‚Äì not to be confused with football program. = Professional = The governing body for American football in the United States is USA Football. The 32-team National Football League (NFL) is currently the only major American football league in the United States. There have been numerous attempts over the past several decades to create a second major or high-level professional league, most of which failed within a few years or, in the cases of the All- America Football Conference and 1960s American Football League, merged with the NFL. The NFL has not operated any developmental minor leagues since the folding of the NFL Europe League in 2007. From the time of the Spring Football League's 2000 collapse until the founding of the independent Stars Football League in 2011, there were no minor American football leagues (independent or affiliated) anywhere in the country. Since then, there has been the SFL (which ran through 2013), Fall Experimental Football League (which played from 2014 to 2015 before it was reformatted as the non-paying The Spring League for 2017), and the Alliance of American Football, which played one abbreviated season in 2019 before collapsing in a management dispute. The AAF positioned itself as an upper-level minor league serving to transition between the college game and the NFL. The XFL, a revamp of a league of the same name that played one season in 2001, began play in February 2020. In contrast to the former AAF, it does not position itself as a minor league, but an independent alternative league. There are several professional and semi-professional indoor football leagues, played at basketball-sized arenas. The largest one is the Indoor Football League which has 13 teams spanning from Ohio to California. Historically the Arena Football League, which launched in 1987 was the most prominent league but as the league had operational issues following its 2008 bankruptcy, teams folded and left for other leagues before the Arena Football League folded in 2019. Most other indoor leagues are also regional in nature. Indoor football leagues play by significantly different rules that accommodate a smaller field of play. Some players that do not make the NFL play in the XFL, in indoor leagues, or go to Canada and play in the Canadian Football League, which operates professionally on a somewhat older rule system with a number of differences from the American game but still recognizable as \\"football\\" to the casual American football observer. The CFL allocates half of its teams' rosters for players born and raised in Canada but allows the rest of the players to be foreign born (in practice, these spots are almost always filled by Americans); the CFL also has television presence in the United States and as recently as 1995 played games in the U.S. = University and collegiate = Alabama Crimson Tide football fans tailgating on the main campus of the University of Alabama. College football is particularly popular in the southeastern United States College football is also popular throughout North America. Most of college football in the United States is governed by the NCAA. Many colleges and universities have football teams, often with dedicated football stadiums. These teams mostly play other similarly sized schools, through the NCAA's divisional system, which divides collegiate sports teams into four divisions (I-FBS, I-FCS, II and III). The largest, most popular collegiate teams routinely fill stadiums larger than 75,000. Eight college football stadiums‚Äîthe University of Michigan's Michigan Stadium, Penn State's Beaver Stadium, Ohio State's Ohio Stadium, Texas A&M;'s Kyle Field, the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium, LSU's Tiger Stadium, Alabama's Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium, and Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas at Austin‚Äîseat more than 100,000 fans and usually sell out. The weekly autumn ritual of college football includes marching bands, cheerleaders, homecoming, parties, the tailgate party; it forms an important part of the culture in much of small-town America. Football is a major source of revenue to the athletic programs of schools, public and private, in the United States. The top college football players enter the NFL Draft after their college careers are over, in hopes of signing with an NFL team. \\"FBS\\" and \\"FCS\\" are abbreviations for the Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision, two sections of Division I that exist only in football. These two subdivisions were formerly known as Divisions I-A and I-AA respectively. The Championship Subdivision, consisting mostly of smaller schools than the FBS but larger than D-II, has a multiple-round playoff system just like Divisions II and III, while the Bowl Subdivision has only a limited, and unofficial, four-team playoff and has historically only featured division championships and bowl games. FBS and FCS teams can, and often do, play against each other. Unofficially, the Bowl Subdivision is divided into two further subdivisions, \\"major conferences\\" (also known as \\"Power Five conferences\\") and \\"mid-majors\\" (known in modern parlance as the \\"Group of Five\\"). In practice, only major conference teams are eligible to compete for the national championship and receive significant favor in the opinion polling over mid-majors, and it was not until the addition of the BCS National Championship Game that mid-majors had a realistic chance at appearing in one of the major bowls. Although the FCS has a playoff, three conferences do not participate (the Ivy League does not allow its teams to play in the postseason, and the historically black SWAC and MEAC instead play each other in a bowl of their own). Division III teams do not offer scholarships to their players; two Division I FCS leagues also do not offer scholarships‚Äîthe Ivy League, which prohibits athletic scholarships in any sport, and the Pioneer Football League, which only competes in football and whose members all offer scholarships in non-football sports. With the exception of the annual Army- Navy Game, only Power Five conference teams air on national broadcast television, although mid-majors, FCS teams, D-II and D-III games can see more limited coverage on cable and local television. Though the NCAA is the most publicized college athletic organization, the NAIA (which houses mostly smaller private colleges in the midwest), NJCAA (an association for community colleges), and California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA) (that state's equivalent to the NJCAA) also sanction football games; there also exists a club football circuit for student-run teams and colleges that choose not to compete at the varsity level. In addition to this, 10 colleges field teams in the Collegiate Sprint Football League, a league in which all players must weigh no more than in order to be eligible to play; four of those teams are long-established sprint teams that co-exist alongside their NCAA counterparts (two from the Ivy League and two military academies), while six teams that have been added since the CSFL began an ongoing expansion in 2008 either never had a varsity squad (one recent addition, 2015 expansion team Chestnut Hill College, was an all-women's school that did not even admit men until 2003) or downgraded from an NCAA team to a sprint team. = High school = Most American high schools field football teams. High school football is popular; top schools regularly fill stadiums holding over 10,000 fans, and can afford artificial playing surfaces. High school teams generally play only against other teams from their state (notable exceptions include matchups between nearby schools located on opposite sides of a state line and occasional matchups between two nationally ranked teams for television purposes). Still, some private Christian high schools play for national championships through organizations like the Federated Christian Athletic Association. Public high school football in most states, as is the case with other high school sports, is governed by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). For rural schools that do not have the student body to support a full football team, the NFHS sanctions nine-man football (most popular in the upper Midwest), six-man football (most commonly used in Texas, although previously more widely popular and undergoing a minor revival elsewhere), and eight-man football (which the most common reduced-man format in most other states). = Adult Amateur Football / Semi-Pro Football = Adult amateur football, also known as semi-pro football, is a level of American football. It's commonly known as \\"working man's\\" football, meaning the players have regular jobs and play football on the weekends. Though the players don't get paid, the leagues and the games are run in a somewhat professional manner. For most leagues, it's against the rules to pay its players to play. The rules of the game are usually a hybrid of NFL and NCAA rules. There are several different leagues playing in the United States: The North American Football League (NAFL) was an adult amateur American football league. Its teams were located mainly in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southern United States. The teams mostly played regionally in the regular season to keep travel short. In the playoffs, winners of regional play will meet each other for the league championship. The New England Football League (NEFL) has over 30 teams, with at least one in each of the six New England states. The league has three skill levels (A being more for recreational play; AAA being the most competitive; AA is somewhat in between). The Eastern Football League, based in New England, but at times teams from New York state have competed, is one of the country's oldest semi-pro leagues. It started play in 1961. The Mid Continental Football League began play in 1991 and by the 1990s had expanded through much of the midwest and mid-Atlantic United States before the league split apart and contracted into a four-state area in the midwest. Upstate New York also houses the oldest surviving professional football club in the United States, the Watertown Red & Black, founded in 1896. The Pacific Northwest Football League (PNFL) started in 2016 and currently has 6 teams, 4 in Portland, Oregon and 2 in Vancouver, Washington. Several leagues supporting women's semi-professional football play have existed. The current major league is the Women's Football Alliance (WFA). The WFA started to play in 2009 stocked with teams from two dissolved leagues, the National Women's Football Association and Women's Professional Football League (NWFA and WPFL respectively).  US National American football team  USA Football assembles a national football team for competition in the IFAF World Championship every four years. Because of concerns over competitive balance, USA Football did not field teams for the first two events in 1999 and 2003. The 2007 team consisted solely of amateur players who had graduated from college that spring, from a diverse mix of smaller and larger colleges and universities. The 2011 squad's criteria were looser, allowing some professional players to play (mostly unemployed, lower-end and minor league players; no NFL or NCAA stars participated). Both the 2007 and 2011 incarnations of the team won their year's respective world championship. The IFAF also fields an U-19 team composed of high school football players that has participated in the 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2016 junior world championships. The national U-19 team won the 2009 and 2014 contests but lost the 2012 contest to Canada.

With the emergence in the beginning of the nineteenth century of education for the masses, instead of simply for the upper-classes, demand for teachers increased. By 1840, it had become evident that the academic preparation of students for teacher training in a college system was inadequate. In 1846, Britain formalized a pupil-teacher system, focusing on training middle-class teachers, in which a senior pupil of at least thirteen years old, served as an apprentice, typically for five years, to learn the teaching profession. Pupil-teachers acted as a teacher of younger children, learning from observation and practical application, while simultaneously completing their own educations. It was widely criticized for its inability to provide adequate professional preparation, in the 1870s and 1880s, pupil teachers began being offered instruction at centres nationwide throughout Britain, which were designed to improve their training. The centres provided professional training by the best teachers in the elementary school system, but were not standardized. Most students who participated in centre programs spent half of their training on theory at the centralized school and half of their training with hands-on teaching in schools. In the Anglo- Caribbean, the system was widely used until the 1950s, offering students contracts of a specific period. The most promising primary students were selected for recruitment as educators. In exchange for offsetting the costs of their own education, they assisted teachers in instructing younger classmates. Upon completing their own education, pupil teachers were required to pass examinations to begin their own independent teaching. In some cases, the pupil teacher system was used as a stepping-stone to provide a basis of payment for secondary education before students were able to attend regular normal school training. While in theory, the Caribbean pupil-teacher program operated as an apprentice system, because there was an extreme shortage of teachers, in actuality, pupil-teachers often served as a full member of the teaching staff, having little time to attend to their own studies.

It was first described by Ugo Fano in 1947, as a fluctuation of amount of ion pairs produced by a charged particle of high energy in a gas. The amount of the ion pairs is proportional to the energy the particle loses in the gas, but with some error - due to the Fano noise. Surprisingly, the noise is usually smaller than a Poisson distribution noise (in which the variance is equal to the value - note the variance is average squared distance from the expected value), showing there is an interaction between ionization acts. A Fano factor was introduced to describe it, and the factor is almost independent of the energy measured (Fano computed it to change from 0.43 to 0.47 for ionization of atomic hydrogen by electrons of energy from 1keV to 100keV). Fano expected it to be between 1/3 and 1/2 for gases, for moderate energies of ionizing particles. The Fano noise applies as well to other processes in which an energy is converted to an electric charge - solid state detectors of charged particles and gamma radiation, and even semiconductor light detectors like image sensors. E.g. it is a limiting factor in the noise characteristics of CCDs and CMOS image sensors. The Fano factor achieveable is an important parameter of the detector material - the smaller it is the better.

At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Titusville Area School District received a $1,546,959 supplement for special education services in 2010. The state provided the same level of funding for 2011‚Äì12. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 51 or 2.38% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and school safety Titusville Area School District administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district in 2009‚Äì10. The School Board has provided the district's antibully policy in the school district's web site. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Virtual Academy The Titusville Virtual Academy provides an online learning experience for K-12 students who reside in Titusville Area School District. Students may earn a Titusville High School diploma and participate in the graduation ceremony. Budget In 2009, the district reports employing over 190 teachers with a starting salary of $39,705 for 180 days for pupil instruction and an additional 5 for teacher inservice. The average teacher salary was $54,940 while the maximum salary is $106,019. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. The school day is limited by the union contract to 37.5 hours per week. Special Education teachers receive additional compensation. Teachers receive a paid lunch time of 30 minutes. Additionally, Titusville Area School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, 2 paid personal days, 10 sick days, paid bereavement days and other benefits. Teachers are paid extra when they are required to work outside of the regular school day hours. Severance includes payment for unused sick days. Additionally, teacher receive $72.50 for each year they have been a full-time teacher in Pennsylvania. The union receives 12 full days of paid leave to use for union business According to State Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees‚Äô Retirement System Board, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary. In June 2011, the union and board agreed that the teachers would forego a salary increase for the 2011‚Äë2012 school year. The administration reported this would save $380,423. In 2007, the district employed 154 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $48,979 for 180 school days worked. Titusville Area School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $909.33 per pupil. The district is ranked 96th out of 500 in Pennsylvania for administrative spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In 2008, Titusville Area School District reported spending $12,067 per pupil. This ranked 267th in the commonwealth. ; Reserves In 2009, the district reported $1,866,942 in an unreserved- undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as $2,124,809. PA school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds. In September 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Significant findings were reported to the administration and school board. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= In 2011‚Äì12, the Titusville Area School District will receive $12,943,618 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district will receive $171,434 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011‚Äì2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010‚Äì2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011‚Äì12. Districts experienced a reduction in funding due to the loss of federal stimulus funding which ended in 2011. In 2010, the district reported that 1,065 pupils received a free or reduced-price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. For 2010‚Äì11, Titusville Area School District received a 2.96% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $13,962,921 payment. Valley Grove School District received a 3.88% increase, which was the highest increase in BEF in Venango County. Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010‚Äì11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010‚Äì11. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. In the 2009‚Äì2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 3.45% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $13,390,165. The state Basic Education funding to the district in 2008‚Äì09 was $12,943,618.28. The district also received supplemental funding for English language learners, Title 1 federal funding for low-income students, for district size, a poverty supplement from the commonwealth and more. Franklin Area School District received highest increase in BEF awarded by the Commonwealth, in Venango County, for the 2009‚Äì10 school year, a 6.43% increase. Among the 500 school districts in Pennsylvania, Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 1,022 district students received free or reduced- price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by LEA 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010‚Äì11, the Titusville Area School District applied for and received $465,314 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide all-day kindergarten the 6th year, to provide teacher training to provide research based instruction and to increase instruction time for pupils through before and after school tutoring. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Titusville Area School District did not apply for funding for 2006‚Äì07 nor in 2007‚Äì08. In 2008‚Äì09 it received 138,210. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future state grant awards. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010‚Äì11 the Titusville Area School District did not apply for this state funding. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $1,600,000 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding is for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 school years. Race to the Top grant School district officials sent an incomplete application for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district over one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. The teachers' union refused to sign the application as was required. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Titusville Area School Board chose to not permit the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program access to the district records. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The Titusville Area School Board set the 2010‚Äì11 the property taxes were 38.4600 mills for property owners in Crawford County. Venango County was set at 14.2300 mills while Warren County was ‚Äì 43.9300 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 37.1500 mills for Crawford County. 14 mills for Venango County. 42.0800 mills Warren County. *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 36.8100 mills for Crawford County. 13.9400 mills for Venango County. 42.0800 mills Warren County. *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 35.7900 mills for Crawford County. 12.7300 mills for Venango County. 39.0600 mills Warren County. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or the school board seeks one or more exceptions from the state's Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010‚Äì11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Titusville Area School District 2006‚Äì2007 through 2011‚Äì2012. * 2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 5.8%, Base 3.9% * 2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 5.1%, Base 3.4% * 2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 6.5%, Base 4.4% * 2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 6.1%, Base 4.1% * 2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 4.4%, Base 2.9% * 2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 2.1%, Base 1.4% For the school budget year 2011‚Äì12, the Titusville Area School Board did not apply for any exceptions to the Act 1 index. Each year, the school district has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. For the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly repealed most of the Act 1 tax increase exceptions leaving only special education costs, pension costs and prior voter approved (ballot referendum) debt for construction. The cost of construction projects in the future will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum. Districts can no longer raise property taxes, beyond their Act 1 index, to cover increasing health insurance costs for employees. Titusville Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009‚Äì10 or in 2010‚Äì11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Education announced the district's property tax relief from gambling would be $143 for each of the 3,424 approved properties. This was the lowest amount of property tax relief awarded in Venango County. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Titusville Area School District was $140 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,495 property owners applied for the tax relief. This was the lowest tax relief awarded in Venango County. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 73% of property owners applied for tax relief in Venango County. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports. These program begin with elementary children and extend through high school athletics. Eligibility to participate in these activities is determined by school board policy. The district also provides recreation activities outside of the regular school year. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Playing in the regional S√ºdost league the team made several appearances in qualification round play for the national level playoffs in the 1910s and 1920s, and won a string of four consecutive S√ºdostdeutschland championships beginning in 1930.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag That season they also finally broke onto the national stage after four earlier failed attempts, only to be put out in an eighth-final match versus Hertha Berlin (3:2). In each of their championship seasons SuSV advanced to the national level playoffs. They were put out in eighth-final matches in both 1931 and 1932 (0:2 to Hamburger SV and 1:5 to Polizei SV Chemnitz), with their best result coming in 1933 when they defeated SV Prussia-Samland K√∂nigsberg 7:1 before bowing to Munich 1860 0:3 in the quarterfinals.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag In 1933, German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight regional divisions and the Beuthener side qualified to play in the Gauliga Schlesien. They captured divisional titles there in 1934 and 1937, but were unable to advance out of group play to return to the national stage. A poor finish in 1938 sent the club down for a season before they came back to what had become the Gauliga Oberschlesien where they would play until the end of World War II as a lower table side. During this period SuSV qualified to take part in the Tschamerpokal tournament, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), for three consecutive seasons from 1936 to 1938, where they were put out in the early going each time. Following the war, the territory of Upper Silesia became part of Poland and the Beuthener side disappeared from the scene. Honours * South Eastern German champions: 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933 *Gauliga Schlesien (I) champions: 1934, 1937 Stadium SuSV played in several different stadiums through the course of their nearly four decades long existence. The club wandered between three different sites between 1909 and 1914 before first settling into And der Hohenzollerngrube until 1918. Between 1918 and 1939 they played in An der Heinitzgrube. During the war from 1939 to 1945 they again used several different facilitities, playing in Beuthener Stadion, BBC Platz, or Giesche- Kampfbahn.

They released five studio albums, one live album, one EP, two compilation albums with live material, demo recordings and remixes and had two compilation appearances between 1986 and 1997. They split up in 1997.Gore biography on the Dutch Muziek Encyclopedie Gore played their avant-garde hardcore solely instrumental. Their music was influenced by Metal just as much as by Industrial music and combined the darkest and heaviest moments of Black Sabbath, Black Flag and Big Black.Simon Reynolds, Melody Maker, 1987 They obtained an excellent live reputation in the hardcore scene of the late 80s and received predominantly positive reviews. Nevertheless, they stayed unknown to the vast majority of the public and never gained commercial success. Today a lot of reviewers consider GORE as seminal and highly influential. Especially the early works of the band were groundbreaking for several subgenres, such as sludge metal, stoner rock and drone metal. The later Gore are considered predecessors of Math rock.Doug Mosurock / Dusted ReviewsMangoon / Tiny MixtapesNed Ragget / All Music HistoryGore I: Frey/Lommen/de Swart 1985‚Äì1988= 1985 After Pieter de Swart (guitar) and Martin van Kleef (bass) left their band Disgust, they started a new outfit with Danny Arnold Lommen (drums) who previously had played with Pandemonium. Very soon van Kleef left the band and was replaced by Rob Frey (bass) who works under the pen name Marij Hel. While playing in GORE Pieter de Swart used the pseudonym Pieter de Sury and Danny Arnold Lommen used several variations of his name, such as Danny A. Lome and Danny Arnold.Rob Frey's liner notes for Southern Lord's re-issue of Hart Gore / Mean Man's Dream Frey joining the band might be considered the actual starting point of Gore, and Frey is the only band member of the early days staying in the band until their final breakup in 1997. Although particularly de Swart wrote a lot of the early Gore songs, Frey is considered the creative mastermind behind the band. Especially after the bands regrouping in 1991 this position of Frey was undisputed. 1986 Gore played their first show on February 26 at the \\"Effenaar Club\\" in Amsterdam opening up for the Swans. In March the band's first album Hart Gore was recorded at Tango Studios in Eindhoven. The record was published by the Dutch label Eksakt Records. Hart Gore was recorded live in the studio, no overdubs or additional recordings were added. Producer Theo van Eenbergen excellently captured the band's sound that shows a flagrant disregard for any kind of sonic restrained. Hart Gore was the first collaboration of Gore and van Eenbergen who produced several albums of the band in the following years. The cover of the album shows a photograph of a raw pig's heart pierced by a samurai sword. The picture is a work of Dutch photographer Egon Notermans. Hart Gore consists of 10 extremely reduced, repetitive, rhythmical and riff- dominated songs. The tracks lack almost all melody but are interspersed by tempo and rhythm changes. Feedback and distortions replace harmonies and volume is an essential element of the music. Gore on their debut are violent, loud and dirty. They break metal down to its essence, its pulsating, vibrant heart that then lies before us naked, just like the pig's heart on the cover of the record. Although Hart Gore is an instrumental record, lyrics to songs are included. With the exception of their last studio album Mest 694‚Äò3 and the compilation album Slow Death, this will be the case with all Gore albums. The controversial lyrics are no less radical and raw as the music of Gore. The vulgar outbreaks of violent images and obscenities give insight into the negative, pessimist world view of the band. The lyrics are signed with ‚ÄûVal Hard‚Äú which is yet another pseudonym of Frey. 1987 Mean Man's Dream, the follow up album, was recorded in Tango Studios in January 1987. Again the album recorded live in studio, produced by van Eenbergen and released on Eksakt Records. Mean Man's Dream is even more monotone, minimal, metric and metallic than Hart Gore was. There are no adornments on Mean Man's Dream, there are no charismatic reference points such as vocals or solos. There is only the naked, screaming riff and the mercilessly pounding rhythm in manic intensity. The iconic cover shows a crude butcher's knife on a scratched metal surface. The stark, direct photo, again taken by Notermans, visualizes perfectly the hard and cold aggression that fuels the music on the record. The album received predominantly positive reviews internationally, sold fairly well and is seen by many fans as the essential Gore record. In the summer Gore tours Europe with Henry Rollins who just had left Black Flag. Recordings made on this tour later appear on a Gore / Henry Rollins split LP. The Gore / Henry Rollins split LP is released in autumn 1987. It contains four live songs by Gore, which were recorded at a show at ‚ÄûDe Bakkerij‚Äú in Eindhoven. Three of the four songs are taken from the first two albums, but the song Arena is exclusively released this record. Gore / Henry Rollins Live is the last Gore record released by Eksakt Records. On October 27 GORE record the first of three Peel Sessions for British DJ legend John Peel. Gore Peel sessions at the BBC's Keeping It Peel site The session is aired by the BBC on November 4. The recordings for the first Peel Session are the last recordings made in the original line up of Frey / Lommen / de Swart. Pieter de Swart leaves the band shortly after. =Gore II: Frey/Lommen/Stroobants/Benli 1988‚Äì1989= 1988 After de Swart had left the band, two new guitar players, Frank Stroobants (using the pseudonym Frankie Stroo) and Yussef Benli (using the pseudonym Joes Bentley), joined in. Gore was invited to play at the New Music Seminar in New York and so they did. It was there that they signed a contract with the bigger label Megadisc Records to release the next album. Wrede (The Cruel Peace) was recorded in August 1988 in at ‚ÄûAs The Grass Is Two Asses High‚Äú studios in Weesp, NL. It was produced by van Eenbergen and Steve Albini and released as a double album by Megadisc. Wrede was the last collaboration of Gore and Theo van Eenbergen, who would work closely with Henry Rollins in the following years. Under the pseudonym Theo van Rock he went on to produce all records of the Rollins Band until their disbandment in 2001. There are only 4 tracks on Wrede, one on each side of the double album. The epic compositions, running between 15 and 25 minutes, are more mellow, mature, melodic and differentiated than those of the earlier albums. The crystalline, sharp aggression gave way to a doomy atmosphere. Van Eenbergen and Albini provided the album with a sound, that almost seems orchestral. Wrede is a heavy, deep behemoth of an album and Gore reach their stylistic climax with it. Considered by many fans and critics to be Gore's opus magnum and the most influential album of the band, the monolithic, idiosyncratic album failed in achieving wider recognition, and the responses in listeners and critics fell short of expectations. In summer Gore toured Europe with Negazione from Italy. A second Peel Session was recorded on November 29, 1988. It contained two tracks from Wrede and was aired December 6. Gore officially disbanded in early 1989. Drummer Danny Arnold Lommen joined Caspar Br√∂tzmann Massaker and stayed with them until they broke up in 1995. Lommen went on to work with Dee Dee Ramone in later years.Danny Arnold Lommen at Discogs Guitarist Frank Stroobants played in several bands after GORE and releases solo projects up until today.Frank Strobants at Reverberation =Gore III: Frey/Koolen/van Reede 1991‚Äì1997= 1991 After a hiatus of two years, Frey brought Gore back to life with a new line up. With Johan van Reede (guitar) and Bardo Koolen (using the pen name Bardo Maria, drums) he re-established the band. The first recordings of that outfit were done on July 9. For the third Peel Session GORE recorded five songs from their next album. The session was broadcast in Peel's show on September 21, 1991. 1992 Lifelong Deadline, Gore's fourth studio album is recorded August / September 1992 and released by Armageddon Records that winter as a two-CD set. In contrast to previous albums all material was written between 1989 and 1992 by Rob Frey alone, and he also produced the album himself. The songs on Lifelong Deadline are more complex, composed and controlled than those on the earlier releases. The sound is clearer and cleaner. The new Gore are more technical and less noisy. With its atypical, complex rhythmic structures and odd time signatures Lifelong Deadline is just as much a predecessor of Math Rock as the earlier recordings had been precursors of Stoner Rock and Sludge Metal. The Album also is distinctly more experimental, and the first Gore album that is not entirely instrumental. There is still no singing but the songs are riddled with numerous samples of absurd spoken scenes in several languages and sounds of nature. The spoken scenes were recorded with a twenty-person ensemble called \\"The United Voices From The House Of Suspicion\\". For the first time there is a guest musician, piano player Bart Spaan plays the song Waiting Time. The French label Pemis De Construire released the compilation Mortar in 1992. It contained two songs and the artist name was given as Gore/Hoer.Mortar home page These are actually no Gore recordings but a side project of Frey. The choreographer Xander Verwoort had asked Frey to write music for his performances. Frey produced scores for two of Verwoort's shows that consist of experimental sound collages. Both scores were released as albums. The first one, Stereo, under the band name \\"Rob Frey's Hoer\\" by Megadisc Records in 1991,Rob Frey's Hoer on Discogs and the second one, Truth & Trust, in 1992 by Barooni Records under the name \\"Hore\\".Hore on Discogs The German band Bohren & der Club of Gore name their band after Gore.Bohren & the Club of Gore home page 1993‚Äì1995 In June 1993 Gore again play at the New Music Seminar in New York. The show is recorded and partially released on Slow Death in 1997. In 1994 Frey established his own record label, Messback Music. Messback solely released albums by Gore and Frey's side projects. Messback's first releases were re-issues of Hart Gore and Mean Man's Dream on CD and a compilation cassette titled In The Name Of Rotten, Evil & Gore. The tape consisted of live and demo recordings taken in the years 1985‚Äì1987. Most of the material was re-released on Southern Lord Records' re-issues of Hart Gore and Mean Man's Dream in 2008, but the song Cracking Walls was exclusively released on In The Name Of Rotten, Evil & Gore. Gore toured Europe to promote the releases. In 1995 Messback issues an album by CET, another of Frey's side projects. The album is titled This Is No House / This Is A Tree.CET on Discogs 1996 The next Gore release is considered to be the most peculiar Gore record by many. It is the only Gore production with actual singing. With Dutch pop singer Henk Westbroek four songs for an EP were recorded in June and December 1995. Westbroek had several mainstream hits with his band Het Goede Doel in the 80s and was regarded as one of the Netherlands' most successful musicians. The EP was recorded at NOB Audio Studios. Messback releases the CD as Gore & Henk: Voor Nu De Eeuwigheid in early 1996. Gore drummer Bardo Maria only performs one of the songs, the others were recorded with drummer Johnbert Dijker. To the Fans of Westbroek as well as to the fans of Gore the collaboration might have seemed odd and disconcerting. The most interesting song for Gore fans is probably the instrumental Door Schaduw en Stilte. The obscure EP completely fell through with the critics and the fans alike. 1997 In February Messback Records release a new Gore album. Mest 694‚Äô3 ‚Äì The 10 Ultimate Hart Gore Rhythm Tracks contains Material that Frey had written already in 1994. Gore recorded the material in the Frey / van Reede / Bardo Maria line up in January and December 1995 at Total Recall Studios in Venlo. Additional material was recorded December 1996 at Trauma III Studios in Het Brook. The recordings were produced by Frey and producer Remko Schouten. The Cover was yet another photograph by Egon Notermans. It shows a red-hot screw. There is also a warning printed on the CD cover: \\"Warning! This CD is not suitable for Radio Air Play! It is mastered at 10 dB overhead! If radio broadcasted: dear DJ‚Äîtake all Limiters off!\\" Just as on Lifelong Deadline, the songs on Mest 694‚Äô3 are interspersed with samples and absurd voice recordings. The Song In The Name Of Evil, Rotten & Gore was accompanied by guest musicians R. Yen (keyboards) and Gino Taihuttu (mouth harp). Gore released their last album Slow Death in May 1997. In a limited edition of 6000, the CD came with issue #27 of Gonzo Circus Magazine. There is only one new song on the CD. Beyond The Black Hole PT. III, a sound collage of electronic noises. Slow Death also contains three songs from Mest 694‚Äô3 remixed by Frey (‚ÄúDeranged Slow-Death Remix‚Äù), and live versions of four songs from Lifelong Deadline. The live songs were recorded June 27, 1993 at Knitting Factory, New York, when Gore performed there for the New Music Seminar. Furthermore, there is a Version of In The Name OF Evil, Rotten & Gore performed by the renowned Metropole Orkest, that was recorded live in February 1997. The last Track on Slow Death consists of an 11-second spoken intro followed by 10 minutes of silence. After the release of Slow Death GORE disbanded. =After the split= Rob Frey joins Dutch folk rock band De Nieuwe Blijdschap in which he plays guitar.De Nieuwe Blijdschap on the Dutch Muziek Encyclopedie Guitarist Johan van Reede and Dutch singer Annemiek van Gr√ºndling formed the band Super Spade and play classic rock cover versions.Super Spade home page In 2008 the American label Southern Lord re-issues Hart Gore and Mean Man's Dream.Hart Gore / Mean Man's Dream at Southern Lord Records Each record contains the ten songs from the original LP and each song in a live or demo version recorded 1986 & 1987\\\\. The re-issue of Hart Gore contains three additional songs. A studio left over of The Hunt that was not used for the original release of Hart Gore; a quite interesting very early version of Death Has Come, recorded live with Pieter de Swart on guitar; and a practice room recording of Gore destroying David Bowie's Station to Station. Each album was issued as a double vinyl LP including a booklet with lyrics, rare pictures and detailed liner notes by Rob Frey. A two CDs set with both albums and a 32 pages booklet was also released. In 2014 a Gore page was created by German publisher Violess War.

In March 2019 they released the album Revanche on the german label Exile On Mainstream. Tha album contains ten songs from the 1992 double CD Lifelong Deadline, the production of which the band considered a failure. The tracks were partly re-recorded and remixed by Gore and Terry Date.

He was also known for his studies about cardiovascular diseases, and is remembered in the eponymous Lancisi's sign.  Biography  Giovanni Maria Lancisi (Latin name: Johannes Maria Lancisius) was educated at the Collegio Romano and the University of Rome, where he qualified in medicine aged 18. He was physician to Popes Innocent XI, Clement XI and Innocent XII. He was given the lost anatomical plates of Bartolomeo Eustachius by Pope Clement XI; these were made in 1562 and had been forgotten in the Vatican Library. Lancisi edited and published them in 1714 as the Tabulae anatomicae. He studied epidemiology, describing malaria and influenza epidemics. He published De Noxiis Paludum Effluviis (On the Noxious Effluvia of Marshes) in 1717, in which he recognized that mosquito-infested swamps are the breeding ground for malaria and recommended drainage of these areas to prevent it. He also published extensively on cardiology, describing vegetations on heart valves, cardiac syphilis, aneurysms and the classification of heart disease. His landmark De Motu Cordis et Aneurysmatibus was published posthumously in 1728.Giovanni Maria Lancisi at TheFreeDictionary.com Early in the 18th century, Lancisi had protested the medieval approaches to containing rinderpest in cattle by stating that \\"it is better to kill all sick and suspect animals, instead of allowing the disease to spread in order to have enough time and the honour to discover a specific treatment that is often searched for without any success\\" (Mantovani and Zanetti, 1993). Lancisi who made the first breakthrough in the control of rinderpest (Lancisi, 1715), a procedure that was later adopted by Thomas Bates (Bates, 1718). However, Lancisi also erred, as he disputed the work of Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo (1663-1696), his contemporary, who had correctly identified the cause of scabies as a parasite. Lancisi however felt scabies was of humoral origin. Because of Lancisi‚Äôs powerful position and, because previous scientists like Galileo Galilei had fallen into disgrace, Bonomo was silenced and his discovery was forgotten until the modern era.  Brain & Soul Inquiries  Lancisi described the corpus callosum as the \\"seat of the soul, which imagines, deliberates and judges.\\"Andrew P. Wickens, A History of the Brain: from Stone Age Surgery to Modern Neuroscience (2014) His Dissertatio Physiognomica provided the supporting argument in 1713. He opposed alternative locations of the soul as hypothesized by others, such as the centrum ovale, by Andreas Vesalius, and the pineal gland, by Ren√© Descartes. He hypothesized that the Longitudinal striae (later named in his honor as the \\"striae lancisi\\" or \\"nerves of Lancisi\\") were the conduit between the anterior location of the soul, and the posterior location of sensory organ functions, both within the corpus callosum.Marco Catani, Stefano Sandrone, Brain Renaissance: From Vesalius to Modern Neuroscience (2015) p. 85.

During the war Manunda saw service in both the Middle East and Pacific Campaigns, specifically New Guinea. She resumed her passenger duties after the war, before being sold to a Japanese company and finally broken up in 1957. Design and construction In 1927 the Adelaide Steamship Company in Australia ordered a new liner to provide full-time Australian coastal passenger services, which had previously only been offered by the company on a limited scale. The Twin Screw Motor Vessel Manunda was built by William Beardmore and Company at Dalmuir in Scotland.Bremer, Home and Back, p. 45 The vessel was in length, with a beam of . Diesel motors provided power to the two propeller shafts, with a top speed of . Passenger capacity was 176 first class and 136 second class. The ship was launched on 27 November 1928, and completed on 16 April 1929. It was a company policy for all its motor vessels to have a name starting with \\"M\\" and the ship was named after an Aboriginal word meaning \\"place near water\\". She was the largest ship operated by the Adelaide Steamship Company at the time, and as a result of her success the company commissioned a larger, faster sister ship, , which was completed in 1935. Operational historyEarly career= She arrived in Australia in June 1929 to begin her duties on the Australian coastal trade, running passengers and cargo between Sydney, Fremantle, Melbourne and Cairns. In late 1929, Manunda rammed Birkenhead Wharf in Adelaide. =World War II= The newly fitted hospital ship Manunda in Sydney Harbour on 17 August 1940 The declaration of war saw Manunda fitted out as DEMS ship (Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship), under the control of the Australian Shipping Control Board. During the process of converting it into a hospital ship, the No. 1 Hold was deemed to be dangerous and never rectified. One death was recorded (that of Second Officer Rupert Mafeking Blunt) and several officers were injured due to the complications with the design. She was converted into a hospital ship at Sydney in compliance with the Geneva Convention Regulations and was taken over by the authorities on 25 May 1940, and entered service as AHS Manunda on 22 July 1940, under Captain James Garden, previously the captain of the Adelaide Steamship Company Manoora and Commodore of the Adelaide Steamship Fleet. The general hospital based on board was commanded by Lt. Col. John Beith, and members of the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) on board were led by Matron Clara Jane Shumack (1899‚Äì1974). Manunda sailed on a shakedown cruise to Darwin, Port Moresby and returned to Sydney, before heading for Suez in the Middle East (she made four trips to the Middle East and Mediterranean between November 1940 and September 1941). She was then despatched to Darwin. On the morning of 19 February 1942, Manunda was damaged during the Japanese air raids on Darwin, despite her highly prominent red cross markings on a white background. 12 members of the ship's crew and hospital staff were killed, 19 others were seriously wounded and another 40 or so received minor wounds. Manunda was able to act as a casualty clearing station for injured personnel from other ships involved in the attack. She sailed to Fremantle the next day. Captain James Garden was later awarded the OBE, in 1945, for his bravery and skill, both during the attacks, in leading a fire extinguishing team on the ship and in later navigating it by the stars to Fremantle with no navigation equipment and a jury-rigged steering system. In 1943 Thomas Minto, First Mate on Manunda, was awarded the M.B.E. for gallantry and devotion to duty on the Manunda during air raids at Darwin in February 1942.Sydney Morning Hearld, July 1943, In June 1945 Matron Clara Shumack was awarded the Royal Red Cross. Her Citation included \\"...On one occasion when the ship was in Darwin it was badly damaged...It was especially during this period that MATRON SHUMACK displayed very great calmness and exceptional devotion to duty, and her quiet and confident manner was an inspiration to all her fellow workers\\".Honours and Awards, Royal Red Cross, NFX70204 Major Clara Jane Shumack, Citation After a refit in Adelaide, she went to Milne Bay in Papua New Guinea, where she acted as a floating hospital for the Allied forces who were stationed there. She spent several nights in Milne Bay, during attacks by Japanese warships, but her status as a hospital ship was, on this occasion honored by Japanese naval units, which raked her with searchlights on three nights running. She made a total of 27 voyages from Milne Bay to Brisbane and Sydney transporting wounded troops. As the war continued, she was relocated as required and she followed the Allied forces the various islands around the Pacific. Six days after the sinking of AHS Centaur, a request was made by the Australian Department of Defence that the identification markings and lights be removed from AHS Manunda, weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort.Milligan and Foley, Australian Hospital Ship Centaur, pp. 189‚Äì92 The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in New Zealand and the United States of America caused the completed conversion to be undone. The cost of the roundabout work came to ¬£12,500, and kept Manunda out of service for three months.Milligan and Foley, Australian Hospital Ship Centaur, p. 192 On 9 June 1943, communications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to the Manunda incident as a response to the attack on Centaur, with the conclusion that the attack was the work of an irresponsible Japanese commander, and that it would be better to wait until further attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.Milligan and Foley, Australian Hospital Ship Centaur, p. 191 Manundas final wartime voyage was to New Zealand transporting civilian passengers. During the war she carried approximately 30,000 casualties to safety. After the Japanese surrender, Manunda was despatched to Singapore to repatriate ex- POWs and civilian interneesBremer, Home and Back, p. 43 who had been imprisoned in Changi Prison.She also sailed to Labuan in Borneo to pick up ex- POWs and civilian internees from Batu Lintang camp. =Postwar career= Manunda was decommissioned in September 1946 and refitted. She returned to service on 2 April 1948, transporting passengers around the Australian coast. In September 1956 she was withdrawn from service and sold to the Japanese Okadagumi Line, who renamed the vessel Hakone Maru. The company's plans for the ship did not eventuate, and she was broken up the next year in Japan,Bremer, Home and Back, p. 44 arriving in Osaka for scrapping on 18 June 1957.  Legacy  In 1973 the suburb of Manunda in Cairns was named after the ship. In 1975 the neighbouring suburb of Manoora was named after its sister ship.

The pack consisted of two adult males, one adult female, one subadult female and two pups. Initially thought to be a lone animal, the fear caused by the wolves had serious repercussions on the life of the villagers within their hunting range. Farmers became too frightened to leave their huts, leaving crops out of cultivation, and several parents prohibited their children from attending school, for fear that the man-eaters would catch them on the way. So great was their fear, that some village elders doubted the man- eaters were truly wolves at all, but Shaitans. With the exception of the pups, which were adopted by Pardhi tribesmen, all wolves were killed by hunters and forest officials. First victims The first officially recognised victim was a boy of eight, killed in the village of Foodra near Dodi Ghati, on the third week of November. The boy was playing near his family's jowar field, when one of the wolves grabbed him and carried him into the forest. The boy's parents, brandishing a lathi, pursued the wolf, which upon seeing them, left the child, who was by then dead, with his abdominal cavity torn open. The second victim was a balahi baby boy taken from the village of Amala Majju. The child had been left in a sari hammock whilst his mother worked in the nearby fields. Upon returning to feed her son, she found the hammock empty. A search party was organised, and after a few hours of fruitless searching, a splash of blood was found on a leaf. A little further, the child's bloodied clothing was found caught on a Lantana bush. The villagers brought the matter to the attention of the Dodi Forest Officials, who passed the information onto the Ashta Range Officer, who in turn informed the District Forest Officer at Sehore. The Officer sent officials to the village, who upon inspecting the site of the killing, found the tracks of a large male wolf. First hunting strategy A group of hunters and government men, intent on formulating a strategy to tackle the wolf, congregated at a house in the village of Dodi, situated on the banks of the Dudhi river which was at the heart of the wolf's killing range. Among them were Ajay Singh Yadav the Collector of the Sehore District, Bruno D‚Äôcruz the district superintendent of police, Chaudhry the Divisional Forest Officer and his two assistants Shrivastava and Naqvi, and Kaurav the Sub Divisional Officer of Ashta. It was decided that baits in the form of goats and sheep would be tied up at waterholes or game trails frequented by the man-eater in Rupahera, Amla Mazzu, Gwala, Arnia Gazi and the Dodi Plateau. Shikaris with 12 gauge shotguns would sit over these baits. Police pickets would be posted at all affected villages to boost morale, and mobile patrolling parties would move through the area at all times. These strategies had no effect on the killings, which continued regardless. Death of the first wolf A fortnight after the unsuccessful strategy had been mobilised, a farmer named ‚ÄúDr. Haidar‚Äù, who was a friend of Yadav the Collector, went alone to the hills near the village of Amla Mazzu, where he knew the man-eater sometimes frequented. After finding a cavern containing two wolf pups, Haidar left for the village of Pardhikhera, where he asked assistance from the local Pardhi chieftain Rajaram. The Pardhis were skilled trappers, and gladly assisted in the hunt by digging a small pit about 4‚Äì6 feet wide outside the den. The pit was covered in vegetation, with the two pups tied to a pole near it. When the sun reached its western horizon, the she-wolf returned, and upon seeing its pups, rushed into the trap, where it was immediately killed by the Pardhis. The she-wolf's pups were later adopted by the Pardhis. Although upon examination, the she-wolf's stomach contents were shown to contain strands of human hair and fragments of human bone, the animal was smaller than what had been described by witnesses and estimations on the previous attacker's tracks. It was concluded from that point on that a whole pack rather than a solitary animal was involved in the killings. This was confirmed when a month after the first child killings were reported, a sadhu in the Dodi Plateau was attacked while sleeping outside his temple of Shiva. He managed to fight off the wolf by placing a burning ember from a nearby fire onto its face, causing the animal to retreat. The sadhu survived, though with a large laceration on his left shoulder. Death of the second wolf A hunter of Bhopal by the name of Hafiz-ur-Rahman (Shahzade), a rifle and jeep owner who had killed tigers and a leopard, was drafted to help kill the wolves when a farmer stated that one of the wolves had just killed one of his lambs, and that they could still catch it if they made haste. After a five-minute car journey following the farmer's directions, the wolf was seen standing over the lamb's body. Taking aim with his rifle, Shahzade killed the wolf with one shot. After this, Shahzade was rewarded 2,000 Rs and offered a job as a police sub-inspector, but he rejected the job offer. Encounter with the last two wolves During a ceremonial visit of the minister of Bhopal and his bodyguard, Yadav spotted fresh wolf tracks on a road heading in the direction of the village of Pardhikera. Yadav, along with Ram Singh the home guard jawan, and the minister's bodyguard. Upon arriving at Pardhikera, the young Pardhis pointed to the direction the wolf went. The tracks were headed to outcrops of black basaltic rock situated on a stony lava plane. Two wolves were sighted in the distance, and after positioning themselves on the wolves route, the trio waited. When the wolves came, the bodyguard fired prematurely at them with his Sten gun, causing the wolves to retreat. Death of the third wolf Yadav was contacted by a mango cultivator named Achan Mian who lived outside the village of Khadi. Yadav was told that two wolves had been repeatedly seen in the orchard, possibly attracted by the grazing goats. Yadav planned to stay at the orchard at nightfall with the goats in order to catch the man-eaters. Dressed as a shepherd and armed with a shotgun, Yadav stayed awake all night in the goat pen until a wolf was seen trying to enter the pen. Yadav killed the young female wolf. Death of the last wolf On January 2, 1986, Yaddav, Ram Singh, Naqvi and a judge named Siddique went to a hill frequently patrolled by the wolf in the vicinity of the road between Amla Mazzu and the Dodi Plateau. There, the team produced a lifelike dummy of a human child dressed in well worn clothes in order to better imitate a human scent. The group hid in nearby bushes, with Ram Singh imitating the cries of a human child to attract the wolf. By nightfall, the wolf was heard howling several times, and after a few minutes, it arrived, heading for the dummy. The group flashed a torch at the wolf and fired at it twice with two 12-gauge shotguns. The wolf fell gasping and was finished with a shot from Naqvi. The animal was a large, dark furred male in prime condition with no infirmities or anything to indicate why it had resorted to man-eating. The animal's death coincided with an end to the attacks.

Iodine deficiency is a range of disorders that affect many different populations. It is estimated that IDDs affect between 800 million and 2 billion people worldwide; countries have spent millions of dollars in implementing iodized salt as a means to counteract the iodine deficiencies prevalent today. With China accounting for \\"40% of the total population\\", it bears a large portion of those who are iodine deficient. Iodine is a micronutrient the body needs to properly produce thyroid hormones. The human body is not able to produce it, and iodine is an essential nutrient. Iodine is not readily available in many foods, thus making it difficult for many people to obtain it. One particular source, found in great supply, is ocean water although it is not an effective dietary source. Iodine deficiency diseases (IDDs) are able to develop before birth, so it is crucial for all populations to have sufficient levels of the micronutrient and prevent such diseases from developing early on.  The Chinese government and iodine regulations  The Chinese government implemented a program of regulating salt to contain iodine starting in 1995. A more recent study has confirmed that the availability of iodized salt in the provinces has increased since this date. Today, about one third of the Chinese population is living in areas with low concentrations of iodine in their water supply. Salt is available in China for less than the retail price in some other countries, at about 5 cents, and is consumed regularly in most diets. This is very cost effective for producers who now must abide by the iodized salt regulations and those for those who need to consume it. The black market, however, is laden with the non-iodized counterpart and partially accounts for the population still be fairly saturated with IDDs.  Implementations of solutions  The levels of iodized salt were measured in a urinalysis of households in China. It was confirmed that about 15‚Äì25 mg/kg of iodized salt content in the diet was sufficient in preventing IDDs and preventing side effects of over consumption. In provinces where people are consuming less than this amount, there is an increased amount of improper brain development in children. Furthermore, one can see the relation between the importance of iodine in thyroid hormones and the IDD goitre. This disease causes a swelling in the neck, where the thyroid glands are, leading to impaired cognitive abilities. The child population was about 20% saturated with the disease but continues to decrease with the new initiatives. Another common IDD prevalent in China is Kashin-Beck disease. A particular outbreak in Tibet was recorded as occurring from lack of iodine. Kashin-Beck is a bone deformity endemic. Iodine deficiency, hypothyroidism, and low serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin were significantly related to Kashin‚ÄìBeck disease. Iodine supplemented irrigation water in combination to iodized salt helps in reducing the neonatal and infant mortality rates. The province of Xinjiang suffers severely from IDDs and in 1993, started the use of potassium iodate in combination with irrigation water. Irrigation water is widely used and accessible to all households making it the predominant solution in reducing micronutrient deficiencies for Xinjiang.

History  The Caledonian Asylum was launched by members of the Highland Society of London in 1815 to provide a home and education for Scottish children in London who had been orphaned in the Napoleonic Wars. John Galt, the novelist, became secretary to the Asylum in 1815. The first Asylum was at 16 Cross Street, Hatton Garden, London from December 1819 until 1828 when it relocated to Copenhagen Fields, Islington. Its long residence in Islington resulted in the naming of Caledonian Market and the Caledonian Road. In 1852 Queen Victoria became Patron and the Asylum was renamed the Royal Caledonian Schools, although legally it was and still is the \\"Caledonian Asylum\\". At that time it catered for about 70 boys and 50 girls. The Asylum's band occasionally played at charitable and other events. Buildings of the former Royal Caledonian School in Bushey, now housing the Purcell School. By the late 19th century the Islington site, near to Pentonville Prison, was recognised as unsuitable, and a new boarding school was built in Bushey, Hertfordshire, from 1902. The Caledonian Estate was built on the school's site in Caledonian Road. Bricks from the old Caledonian Asylum were used to build two blocks of flats in Widdenham Road, London N7, known collectively as Loraine Mansions. The Royal Caledonian offered education until 1948, after which resident children received their education at local schools, in later years Queens' School which lies adjacent on Aldenham Road. In 1996 the premises were sold to the Purcell School. The proceeds of the sale were used for the charity to operate as the Royal Caledonian Education Trust, which continues to provide support to \\"children (no age limit) of Scots who have served in the Armed Forces, or the children of poor Scots living in the London area\\". Another objective is to allow the children of Scots serving in the armed forces a level of continuity in their education despite the frequent re- posting of their parents.

The play was later adapted for film in 1956, and the 1970 Broadway musical Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen. The play opened on Broadway in October 1953. It was a Broadway hit, running for 1,027 performances and winning awards including:the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best American Play of the Year, the Pulitzer Prize in Drama, and the Tony Award. The play, well regarded for several decades, came to seem old- fashioned with increased understanding and sensitivity of racial issues. The portrayals of the Okinawa characters in the play were seen as offensive, and the generational humor began to lose its impact in the 1970s. Plot summary In the aftermath of World War II, the island of Okinawa was occupied by the American military. Captain Fisby, a young army officer, is transferred to a tiny Okinawa island town called Tobiki by his commanding officer, Colonel Purdy. Fisby is tasked with the job of implementing \\"Plan B\\". The plan calls for teaching the natives all things American and the first step for Capt. Fisby is to establish a democratically elected mayor, chief of agriculture, chief of police, and president of the Ladies League for Democratic Action. Plan \\"B\\" also calls for the building of a schoolhouse (Pentagon shaped), democracy lessons, and establishing capitalism through means left up to the good captain's judgment. A local Tobiki native, Sakini by name, is assigned to act as Fisby's interpreter. Sakini, a Puck-like character, attempts to acquaint Fisby with the local customs as well as guide the audiences through the play, providing both historical and cultural framework through his asides and monologues. John Forsythe as Fisby and David Wayne as Sakini on Broadway in 1954 After receiving many gifts from the villagers, including a geisha named Lotus Blossom, Fisby tries to find local products on which to build his capitalist endeavor. He is discouraged when the villagers can not find a market for their handmade products, items like geta (wooden sandals), lacquered bowls, cricket cages, and casas (straw hats). He is also frustrated when the newly elected democratic government votes to build a teahouse (ochaya) for Lotus Blossom with the building supplies designated for his Pentagon-shaped school. Through the villagers, Captain Fisby starts to see the beauty of preserving their culture and a slower way of life. He agrees to build the teahouse and even lands on a moneymaking product ‚Äì sweet potato brandy. Soon the Cooperative Brewing Company of Tobiki is churning out liquor by the gallon and selling it to all the neighboring military bases. The gala opening of the teahouse is the moment when Colonel Purdy decides to make his progress inspection and finds Captain Fisby serenading the villagers in his bathrobe with a rendition of \\"She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain\\". He is in danger of court martial and reprimanded for misusing government supplies, selling liquor and \\"not turning the villagers into Americans fast enough\\". Col. Purdy orders the destruction of all the stills and the teahouse. Sakini and the villagers outsmart the colonel and only pretend to destroy everything, instead hiding everything \\"quick as the dickens\\". Their foresight proves fortuitous when Purdy learns that Congress is about to use Tobiki as a model for the success of Plan B. The villagers rebuild the teahouse on stage, and even offer a cup to Col. Purdy in a gesture of goodwill. Like all great comedies, in the end, all is forgiven. The village returns to the rich life they once knew (plus a teahouse, export industry, and geishas), Fisby is touted a hero, and Purdy, we hope will get a brigadier general's star for his wife Grace after all. Set in the time-frame of the aftermath of World War II and U.S. occupation of the Japanese islands,Teahouse of the August Moon is a comedy whose laughs come from the inability of the American characters to understand Tobiki culture and tradition. However, it is not just a story of culture clash. Through the character of Fisby, we see acceptance and the beauty of making peace with oneself somewhere between ambition and limitations. We also learn, like Fisby, that sometimes the better life is had by taking a \\"step backward in the right direction\\". Productions The Teahouse of the August Moon premiered on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre on October 15, 1953 and closed on March 24, 1956 after 1,027 performances.\\"'The Teahouse of the August Moon' Broadway 1953\\" playbillvault.com, accessed December 18, 2015 Directed by Robert Lewis, the cast featured John Forsythe (Capt.

The community was planned to include eco-friendly homes, two community lakes, a community center and market with local organics, and community parking on the edge. Everything was to be connected via miles of multi-surface walking, hiking and biking trails. Bicycle City has been featured in Bicycling magazine, Next American City magazine, and Outside magazine as one of \\"10 Big Ideas for 2010.\\" In 2010, Bicycle City sponsored the Interbike Conference in Las Vegas and the Livable Cities Conference in Charleston. Bicycle City communities plan to reduce storm water runoff, reduce congestion, protect animals and the environment, and provide a key model for sustainable development that is not dependent on cars. Bicycle City's design team includes Ozzie Nagler, who designed Seoul Olympic Village and the Three Rivers Greenway; Anne Lusk, Harvard School of Public Health research fellow; and Mike Lydon, principal of the Street Plans Collaborative. The concept of Bicycle City has been influenced by the ideas of new urbanism, smart growth development and healthy, active communities, as well as the work of people such as Frank Lloyd Wright, John Naisbitt, Andreas Duany, Paolo Soleri, John Robbins, Scott Martin, Maria Montessori, Richard Register, and J.H. Crawford.

Designated in 1962, the district recognizes Lahaina for its well-preserved character as a 19th-century port, and for its social and economic importance in the 19th century as a major whaling center in the Pacific, and as one of the capital cities of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Donn Beach and Pete Wimberly played an important early role in establishing building ordinances to govern restoration and preservation projects in Lahaina. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962. and The district is bounded on the north by Puuona Point, the south by Makila Point, and the east by the ridge of hills above the town. Its western bound extends all the way out to the island of LƒÅna ªi, encompassing the Lahaina Roads, the roadstead which enabled the town's growth in the 19th century. Lahaina was a popular residential center for the kings of Maui prior to the arrival of European explorers in the late 18th century. Kamehameha I made his landing here when he began the conquest of Maui in 1795, and Kamehameha II established a residence here in 1819. That same year, the first whaling ships arrived, beginning the community's rise in economic importance. Lahaina eclipsed Oahu as a preferred whaling port between 1840 and 1855, because of its better deep-water anchorage. When Kamehameha III ascended to the Hawaiian throne in 1825, he made Lahaina his capital, preferring it to the busier Honolulu. The town declined in economic importance in the 1860s, as the whaling industry waned. Buildings When the landmark district was designated in 1962, nine buildings were called out for their specific contribution to the district: { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;font-size:85%\\" + style=\\"font-size:125%;\\"  Contributing buildings in the Lahaina Historic District !

It ran primarily in the pages of Doctor Who Magazine, written by John Freeman and novelist and future television series writer Paul Cornell. The story used elements of previous television continuity, as well as the continuity used by the comic strip, reviving popular characters such as \\"Dalek Killer\\" Abslom Daak and the Star Tigers. It also attempted to bridge the gap between Revelation of the Daleks and Remembrance of the Daleks. Plot On the Daleks' homeworld of Skaro, the Daleks place their creator Davros on trial for crimes against their race. Coming to his aid is the sixth incarnation of Davros' eternal enemy the Doctor, who offers to take Davros to a planet where he can create new lifeforms for good if he is willing to change; Davros agrees. During the rescue, the Doctor makes a sly reference to the Hand of Omega. Incensed with yet another humiliating delay at the hands of the Doctor, the Emperor Dalek makes use of his empire's delicate time-travel capabilities to snatch Abslom Daak from the brink of death, and pose as humanoid delegates of Earth. They deceive Daak and offer a way of reviving his long-lost love Taiyan in exchange for the capture of the Doctor. Daak agrees. The TARDIS materialises on the planet \\"Hell\\", a world the Doctor had visited earlier in his seventh incarnation in Daak's previous appearance, Nemesis of the Daleks. The Doctor is now accompanied by Bernice Summerfield, and it is not long before the two discover that Daak's former team the \\"Star Tigers\\" are alive and well, having been presumed dead when their vessel crashed in the previous story. Drunk and downbeat, the Tigers are ill-prepared for the return of Daak, who soon captures the Doctor and Benny, as well as his old teammates, and returns all of them to the \\"Earth Delegates\\", who reveal themselves as Daleks and capture all of them. The Doctor agrees to take the Daleks to the planet where he has hidden Davros, but both groups discover that the world was Spiridon. Davros has activated the long-dormant Dalek army hidden there, converting them to the white and gold colour scheme applied to the Daleks he created on the planet Necros in Revelation of the Daleks. Davros leads a successful coup d'√©tat on Skaro, destroying the Emperor Dalek, but his wheelchair is split in half by Abslom Daak's chainsword, triggering his self- destruct mechanism which seemingly obliterates the Dalek city. The Doctor, Benny, the Star Tigers, and Daak escape the city in the TARDIS. Shortly afterwards, the Seventh Doctor meets up with his sixth incarnation at a bar as his group of friends celebrate. He assures the Sixth Doctor that time will show him that Davros will doom him and Skaro to oblivion. Back on Skaro, Davros' body is pieced together by his loyal Dalek forces with a new casing, they inform Davros he has claimed the mantle of \\"Emperor\\". Much of Davros' memory has been affected by the explosion, but as he regains his composure, he recalls the Doctor referencing the Hand of Omega, and vows to find it when he faces the Doctor in what he believes will be their next and possibly final confrontation. Continuity Davros and the Sixth Doctor's experiences following their departure from Skaro is explored further in a prequel strip, \\"Up Above The Gods\\", published several months after this story had concluded.\\"...Up Above the Gods...\\" (with Richard Alan and art by Lee Sullivan, in Doctor Who Magazine No. 227, 1995) Reprint The entire story was reprinted in a graphic novel, also entitled Emperor of the Daleks in 2017(IMDB:978-1846538070).

The Act, which came into effect on 1 January 1949, was passed in consequence of the 1947 Commonwealth conference on nationality and citizenship, which had agreed that each of the Commonwealth member states would legislate for its own citizenship, distinct from the shared status of \\"Commonwealth citizen\\" (formerly known as \\"British subject\\"). Similar legislation was also passed in most of the other Commonwealth countries. The Act formed the basis of the United Kingdom's nationality law until the British Nationality Act 1981 came into force in 1983. Background to the Act Broadly speaking, nationals of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, and the various British colonies had always shared a common citizenship status of \\"British subject\\". However, in 1946 the Canadian parliament passed the Canadian Citizenship Act, which established a separate Canadian citizenship. In response, a Commonwealth conference met in London in 1947, where it was agreed that each of the Commonwealth member states would be free to legislate for its own citizenship, while still retaining elements of a common Commonwealth citizenship. The resulting legislation passed by the United Kingdom for itself and its colonies was the British Nationality Act 1948, which was introduced by a Labour government. It marked the first time that married British women gained independent nationality, regardless of the citizenship of their spouses. Legislation passed in the other Commonwealth countries included Australia's Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, New Zealand's British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948, and Southern Rhodesia's Southern Rhodesian Citizenship and British Nationality Act, 1949. Provisions of the Act The Act created the new status of \\"citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies\\" (CUKC) for people born or naturalised in either the United Kingdom or one of its colonies. Provision was also made in certain circumstances for citizenship to be acquired by descent from a CUKC, or by registration. Despite the fact that the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were neither part of the United Kingdom proper nor were colonies of it, article 33 of the Act provides that when the Act mentions colonies, it must be construed as including references to these Islands. Islanders were allowed, upon personal wish and not as a compulsory denomination, to be presented as \\"citizens of the United Kingdom, Islands and Colonies\\". This does not constitute a separate category of citizens but is merely a formal denomination.Legislation.gov.uk, Section 33 of the British Nationality Act 1948 as originally enacted. Reform of the Act, and subsequent Acts Between 1962 and 1971, as a result of popular opposition to immigration by Commonwealth citizens from Asia and Africa, the United Kingdom gradually tightened controls on immigration by British subjects from other parts of the Commonwealth. The Immigration Act 1971 introduced the concept of patriality, by which only British subjects with sufficiently strong links to the British Islands (i.e. the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) had right of abode, the right to live and work in the United Kingdom and Islands. Most of the 1948 Act was replaced by the British Nationality Act 1981 with effect from 1 January 1983. The Act today The only significant provision of the Act to survive today is section 3, which concerns the extra- territorial jurisdiction of the criminal courts over crimes committed by British subjects overseas. Generally, British criminal law does not apply to things done overseas, but there are some exceptions for acts done abroad by British subjects, such as murder. Section 3 restricted the scope of this jurisdiction to CUKCs (except in respect of crimes that would be against UK law even if committed by aliens). This was necessary so that, for example, a Canadian citizen who committed murder in Canada could not be prosecuted for it in a British court instead of in Canada. As modified by section 51 of the British Nationality Act 1981, section 3 now restricts this jurisdiction to British citizens, British Overseas Territories citizens, British Overseas citizens and British Nationals (Overseas). (Note, however, that section 3 is subject to any subsequent legislation to different effect, such as section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (as amended).) Also, in spite of the fact that most of this Act has been repealed by the British Nationality Act 1981, the acquisition of new categories of British Nationality created by the British Nationality Act 1981 is often made dependent on one's nationality status prior to the effective date of the British Nationality Act 1981. This therefore means that many of the original provisions of British Nationality Act 1948 are still relevant today.

The order - founded in 1871 - was under Jesuit direction from her spiritual director and was involved with the education of children in Salamanca though expanded during her lifetime. Barriola was canonized as a saint on 17 October 2010. Life Juana Josefa Cipitria y Barriola was born in mid-1845 as the eldest of seven children to the weavers Juan Miguel Cipitria and Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Barriola. Her father was a weaver. Rather than attend school she helped look after her siblings because she was the eldest child. She received her Confirmation on 5 August 1848 and made her First Communion in 1855. At a young age, she went to Burgos to help support the household and worked as a domestic servant in various homes. Barriola was affected to a great degree from the depth of the poor conditions that she witnessed in a place undergoing the social effects of the Industrial Revolution in her native land. The Jesuit priest Miguel Jos√© Herranz advised her on her path ahead and at his advice started a number of charitable and educations programs; the two met in Valladolid in 1868. Barriola believed that she experienced a vision of Jesus Christ on 26 March 1869 on Good Friday. On 8 December 1871 - alongside five companions - she founded the Daughters of Jesus and she assumed the religious name: \\"C√°ndida Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s\\". The nun founded the congregation for the education of children and the advancement of the women in Salamanca. The congregation received diocesan approval from the Bishop of Salamanca on 3 April 1873. On 8 December 1873 she made her solemn profession. Barriola based her spiritual principles and practices on the Spiritual Exercises. Father Herranz collaborated with her as she wrote the constitutions for the order which received the decree of praise from Pope Leo XIII on 6 August 1901; full papal approval came from Pope Pius X after her death in 1913. Barriola was a contemplative religious and was immersed in God who spent long hours before the tabernacle where she became serene even in trials and suffering. Her motto for life was: \\"I am for God alone\\". Barriola died in 1912. In 2005 her order had 1116 religious in 114 houses in countries such as the Dominican Republic and the Philippines. Canonization The informative phase for the beatification process spanned in Salamanca from 17 June 1942 until 9 July 1957; all of her spiritual writings received theological approval on 25 October 1961. The formal introduction to the cause came on 22 September 1978 under Pope John Paul I and she became titled as a Servant of God. The informative phase received validation in Rome from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 7 October 1982 while later receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1989. Theologians approved this dossier on 12 March 1993 as did the C.C.S. on 22 June 1993; the confirmation of her heroic virtue allowed Pope John Paul II to title her as Venerable on 6 July 1993. The miracle for beatification was investigated in Spain and received C.C.S. validation on 17 December 1983; the medical experts approved it on 22 June 1994 as did theologians on 28 October 1994 and the C.C.S. on 10 January 1995. John Paul II approved this miracle on 6 April 1995 and beatified the late religious on 12 May 1996 in Saint Peter's Square. Another miracle needed for her to become a saint was investigated again in Spain and it received C.C.S. validation on 10 June 2005 before medical experts approved it on 25 September 2008. Theologians likewise approved this miracle on 7 March 2009 as did the C.C.S. on 16 June 2009. Pope Benedict XVI approved this miracle on 3 July 2009 and canonized her as a saint on 17 October 2010.

West House is an octagon house built in 1860 in Monroe, Wisconsin. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 for its association with the historically significant West, and for its unusual combination of multiple polygons. Francis H. West was a New Englander who came west to become an early settler of the Monroe area. He had a diverse career, including lead miner, lumberman, state senator, and California explorer. During the Civil War he commanded the 31st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In the 1850s, West built a wooden octagon house on the same property as the current house, but it was torn down in the 1930s. With West built the current octagon house from 1860 to 1861, with walls of brick two stories high. Most octagon houses are a single octagon, but this one is three joined polygons, with a rectangular wing behind and a small octagonal cupola on top of them all. The styling outside is Italianate, with brackets and knob pendants under the eaves. Inside, the first floor contains a foyer, a parlor, a study, and a dining room, with the rectangular wing containing a kitchen, a family room, and a patio. Some of these rooms have parquet floors. The second floor holds bedrooms and a bathroom, with a library in the rectangular wing. From the start, West's house included a progressive-for-the-time gravity plumbing system fed by a tank in the attic, and an \\"air conditioning\\" system which let air funnel from the cupola above into the rooms below. Orson Fowler of New York was the proponent of octagon houses, publishing a book on them in 1847. It's unclear how much Francis West was influenced by Fowler, but West's combination of polygons is unique in Wisconsin and not an idea from Fowler.

Background Pennant's mother emigrated from Jamaica while pregnant and he was born in Doncaster, Yorkshire. Six weeks old, he was abandoned and was placed into a Dr. Barnardo's Home. As a black baby, Pennant was fostered by an elderly white family in Slade Green, Greater London where he was the only black person, and where he states he was \\"bullied from day one\\" year after year, and beaten persistently - \\"Not just from rivals or other kids, the whole town. Imagine as a kid, you're picked out; people in vehicles shouting out at you, total strangers\\". Pennant had been christened Carol (a common masculine name in parts of the West Indies, unusual as a masculine name in England, but is the Irish equivalent for the name \\"Charles\\") by his biological mother, which was also a source of bullying for him, particularly at school. After he saw the boxer Muhammad Ali beat Henry Cooper he adopted the name Cass. Pennant who stands 6'4 (193 cm), was a member, and leader, of the Inter City Firm (ICF) associated with the English football club, West Ham United in the 1970s. Cass Pennant's story is remarkable given the level of racism that was prevalent during the 1970s, 1980s and early 90s in Britain. Cass managed to rise to the top and become one of the generals of the ICF despite being black. He was eventually sentenced to four years in prison in 1980 and was the first person to receive a long term sentence for football hooliganism. After a second time in prison he started running a night club security firm in London. While working at one such nightclub in South London he was shot three times. In 2002, Pennant appeared on the Channel 4 documentary, Football's Fight Club about football hooliganism in the 1970s. He has been a consultant on television programmes such as The Real Football Factories and The Real Football Factories International. He also worked as a consultant and played a cameo role as a riot police officer in the 2005 drama film about football hooliganism, Green Street. In 2006, he had a documentary made about him, Cass Pennant - Enough Said (Gangster Videos) directed by Liam Galvin, and in 2008 a film was made based on Pennant's life story, Cass, starring Nonso Anozie as Pennant, and directed by Jon S. Baird. In 2010, he played a leading role in the movie Killer Bitch.

She identifies as a feminist and her work often tackles themes regarding race, sex, and privilege, often in conjunction with the Asian-American experience, through a satirical lens. She currently serves as an elected representative of the Wilshire Center Sub-district 5 Koreatown Neighborhood Council in Los Angeles.  Early life and education  Wong was born in San Francisco to an accountant mother and insurance salesman father. She is a third-generation Chinese American. Her grandmother immigrated to the United States from Guang Mei Cun, a village near Kaiping county, in the 1930s. Wong attended an all girls Catholic high school, where she took speech class. Wong attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). For her senior project, she created ‚ÄúBig Bad Chinese Mama‚Äù, a fake mail-order bride website to tackle fetishization of Asian women by white males. The site was advertised in fetish chat rooms, next to masseuse ads in the local newspaper, and optimized in search engines to return alongside searches for Asian porn. It featured biographies of real Asian women accompanied by photographs of them in fighting poses and abrasive language critiquing the viewer's potential search for mail order brides. She graduated in 2000 with double degrees in English and World Arts and Cultures and a minor in Asian American Studies. She later returned as a commencement speaker for the UCLA English Department in 2008 and UCLA's student-initiated Asian Pacific Islander graduation (APIG) in 2014, the latter included a bit about re- defining sex appeal of Asian American men. Prior to finding success as an artist, she worked as an eBay vendor, a restaurant hostess, and earned $10/hour at an art non-profit.  Performance Art  Fannie Wong = In 2017, Wong exhibited her \\"Fannie Wong\\" persona, a crass ‚Äúformer Miss Chinatown 2nd-Runner-Up‚Äù, at \\"In Search of Miss Ruthless\\", an experimental, multi-media exhibition revolving around the cultural impact of the Miss Chinatown USA pageant within the Chinese American diaspora, at the Para Site gallery in Hong Kong. The installation included Wong interacting with exhibit goers next to a display case full of memorabilia from \\"Fannie Wong's\\" previous performances, including the time she crashed Miss LA Chinatown 2003 pageant. Themes include questioning the traditional beauty standards for Chinese-American women and the cultural expectation of them to be obedient and overachievers. = Kristina Wong for Public Office = As part of the City of Los Angeles Individual Artists 2018 Fellowship, Wong intends to run for public office before 2030. While doing so, she intends on performing various exaggerated campaign events, such as a debate match with a dog and public stoning by audience members during a stump speech. Wong comments on the reality of the current presidency and the dualistic nature of being a politician and a performance artist, whether that be the trained, such as the trained, codified body language. ‚ÄúWe used to listen to politicians and laugh at comedians, now we laugh at politicians and listen to comedians.‚Äù The piece premiered as an interactive exhibit in LA Chinatown in November 2018. She lost the election for Democratic delegate of Assembly District 53 in Jan 2019, a volunteer position to represent the district at the Democratic State Convention. Wong has subsequently been elected to the Wilshire Center Koreatown Neighborhood Council in April 2019, a largely volunteer position that meets once a month at the local library. She intends to launch her next campaign event alongside the presidential election in February 2020.  Theatre Wong Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest= In 2006, Wong received support from the Creative Capital and the National Performance Network to create \\"Wong Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" The show explores the high rates of depression and suicide among Asian American women. It ran for eight years. And it has toured nationally. It was directed by Katie Pearl. =Wong Street Journal= The show premiered in 2015 in San Francisco and is directed by Emily Mendelsohn. The show was developed in residency at York University in Toronto, initially focusing on \\"economics, the stock market, and theory.\\" Her previous works touched upon stereotypes of Asian American women by Western society, i.e. fetishism and the model minority myth, in a satirical manner. Wong Street, in that vein, challenges the West's patronizing perception of Africa, including her own, such as the need to donate clothes. Birthed out of the mental burnout from her previous two shows, Wong Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Cat Lady, regarding depression and loneliness respectively, and the Sisyphean task of combating online trolls, Wong decided to take a break by volunteering with a microloan organization in Northern Uganda for three weeks in Sept 2013. She draws upon that experience to present a contemporary, ethnographic perspective that contrasts previous colonial \\"ethnological expositions\\" at previous World's fairs. Throughout the show, Wong discusses her trip and criticizes white privilege in America while struggling to come to terms with the adjacent privilege of being a Westerner in a developing country. Despite the racial differences back home, once in Uganda, she was often called ‚Äúmzungu,‚Äù a Bantu term for ‚Äúwhite.‚Äù ‚ÄúSuddenly, I was the face of oppression...it was really weird to go from constantly calling out white people to people having to literally walk around the power I bring to the room.‚Äù Wong accepts the privilege of being able to live out an \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" moment of self discovery in a foreign country and ponders how to \\"leave a legacy, and not be a colonial asshole?‚Äù. Additionally, Wong discusses the pervasive nature of social media and contrasts it to the lack of personal understanding between people of different cultures, admitting to the urges of documenting everything online. Wong posits that this practice is no different than American's perception of Africa coming from different forms of white media. Wong concludes that \\"the best way to help [marginalized people] is to find ways to support their self-determination...the ability of people who want to speak for themselves?‚Äù While in Gulu, Ugandaa, Wong ended up collaborating on a rap album with local Ugandan producer Nerio. The album, Mzungu Price, dropped in November 2013. Written and performed by Wong, it features Festo Wine, MC Kash, LMG Silver, Sarah Sullivan, and Nerio himself. The song \\"Boss Lady\\" is featured in Wong Street Journal. It touches upon themes of racial privilege and female empowerment and is still played on Ugandan radio. In 2018, Wong brought the show to Africa and appeared as a guest in The Other News (Nigeria's Daily show), My Africa Podcast and also as Guest on Nigerian comedian Ali Baba's Seriously Speaking  Other work  Video = In 2017, Wong launched ‚ÄúHow (Not) to Pick Up Asian Chicks‚Äù, a web series where she and a panel of Asian women review self-published books by white men about picking up Asian women.

She appeared alongside comedians Jo Koy and Dan St. Germain, who debated with her and Wilmore the legitimacy of a white woman being cast as a woman of color. Wong condemned the casting choice, declaring that legitimately Asian actors \\"would've been happy to take a shit part, that's all we get anyway.\\" When Wilmore asked about colorblind casting, she took the stance that all colorblindness means is that \\"everyone gets to be white. Everyone gets a shot at having a narrative...which is usually just depicted by white people.\\" She wrote a self-assessment editorial for Scenario USA later that month recollecting the experience.  Selected awards and recognition  Wong appeared in the premiere episode of Asian American cable network Myx TV's first original reality series I'm Asian American and.... In October 2014, Wong was featured in the New York Times \\"Off Color Comedy\\" series. The video focused on the ways in which her comedy, speeches, one-woman shows, and poetry take on racist stereotypes, the fetishization of Asian women, and the perception of women in media. She asserts that her attempt to change the way that people like her are viewed \\"is a long fight. And if I fight it constantly with anger, that's the man getting me twice, right, once when they've made fun of me and the second time by getting me to be angry.\\" * 2019 Center Theatre Group's Dorothy and Richard E.

Tallkrogen (Swedish for the \\"Pine Inn\\") is a suburban city district located south of central Stockholm, Sweden, but within the Stockholm Municipality.  History  In Stockholm, construction of small cottage areas intended for working-class families began at Olovslund and Pungpinan in 1927, a municipal initiative which quickly proved a success. About 90% of the construction costs, at the time roughly SEK 10,000, could be financed by loans from the city, while the rest could be covered by the builder's own work. Soon, construction works had spread across various peripheral parts of the city, including Enskede and √Ökeshov, and in 1931 the former of these saw its thousandth cottage.Andersson, Stockholms √•rsringar, \\"Tallkrogen - sm√•stugor i stram planform\\", pp 145-147 Construction works at Tallkrogen started in 1933. Its plan contrasted both to the organic street networks of earlier garden cities and the straight avenues in the recently completed similar area Norra √Ñngby in Bromma. At Tallkrogen, the small buildings are aligned along curved streets forming the shape of a stadium, the streets consequently named after athletics pioneers P H Ling and Viktor Balck and the blocks named after various Athletics events. Approximately 950 houses were built: Instead of the previously preferred one and a half-floor buildings, single-floor buildings were built at the centre of the area, while the peripheral buildings were made two floors. The building were delivered to the site as prefabricated elements -- windows and doors already in place, chimneys made of concrete blocks with channels, and trusses assembled. When completed in 1943, Tallkrogen as a result of prefabrication suffered of a lack of variation throughout, a problem since solved by later additions. The city, on its part, tries to limit changes to the backside of the houses it once helped to realise.W√¶rn, Guide till Stockholms arkitektur, \\"Tallkrogen\\", p 210  Notes  References  * * Category:Districts of Stockholm ","title":"Tallkrogen"},{"id":"18041225","text":"Dahan-e Khawal is a village in Bamyan Province in northern-central Afghanistan.

The island is barren and conical in shape with sheer cliffs rising to heights of 30 to 45 m (98 to 148 ft). Several rocks lie off the island, including a group of four 9 to 12 m (30 to 40 ft) high rocks about 800 m (about 0.5 mi) to the north-northwest and several detached rocks 160 to 320 m (0.1 to 0.2 mi) to the south. The island is often enveloped in dense fog due to cold bottom water upwelling to the surface. The flood tidal current off the island sets west, while the ebb sets to the east or east-southeast. These currents may reach up to 1.5 to 2 knots during spring tides and create numerous eddies, small whirlpools, and tide rips around the island for some distance offshore.National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency.

These small barnacles have been studied in part because of the taxonomic confusion over a group of species that, by and large, are morphologically and ecologically quite similar. In recent years, molecular techniques have identified a number of cryptic species that have been subsequently confirmed by taxonomists using morphological measurements. Most recently the genus has been shown to be paraphyletic, with the genus Microeuraphia nested within Chthamalus. Field Identification Identification of barnacles in the field can be challenging, and identification of particular species of Chthamalus is not considered reliable in the field other than a few species. However, a notable distinction in the arrangement of wall plates can help biologists distinguish Chthamalid barnacles from the other common barnacles in the family Balanidae. In chthamalid barnacles, the side plates overlap both the rostrum and the carina (the plates at the ends of the opercular opening), while in balanids one end plate (the rostrum) overlaps the adjoining side plates (rostrolaterals).

It is located in a pass in a mountainous region North East of Barmiyan town on the Ghandak highway 10 km from the border with Baghlan Province. It has a bazaar, a coal weigh station built in 2007 and a police check point. Do Abe is the centre of a coal mining industry that employed manual methods to extract coal from shafts in sacks. Coal seams visible on the surface are followed deep underground. The shaft roof is unsupported so accidents are common. From 2009/10 a contract was to be let to a Chinese coal mining group to extract the coal using mechanized equipment. Prior to the establishment of the weigh station coal smuggling across the border into Baghan province was rife. Kiwi 5 patrol of the New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Team spent time in Do Abe in 2008 training the ANP in order to stop coal smuggling. This area is subject to attacks by roadside bombs. It was near Do Ab, close to the Ish Pesta ANP check point that a New Zealand soldier was later killed in a roadside bomb blast. After the IED exploded the 3 vehicles were attacked by RPGs and automatic gun fire. This led to a combined NZ/US attack on the Taliban group responsible that resulted in 13 terrorists being killed . Baghak Attack In August 2012 2 New Zealand soldiers were killed at Do Abe by automatic gunfire and RPG. The NZ soldiers had been called to give assistance to the ANP who were attempting to arrest a known Taliban bomb maker. The force was attacked by a second group of between 12 and 17 Taliban who shot and wounded the NZ commander, an ex SAS soldier. One of the kiwi soldiers was killed while going to rescue his wounded commander. He was Lance Corporal Malone, the great-grandson of Lt Colonel William Malone, who was killed at the battle of Chunuk Bar, Gallipoli, Turkey, leading the New Zealand forces in 1915. The other, Lance Corporal Pralli Durrer, an LAV commander, was hit by small arms fire in the head. He was standing out of the turret, attempting to deal with an ammunition fire caused by insurgent activity at the time. 2 ANP soldiers were also killed and 4 wounded. One civilian was wounded . On Anzac day 2013, it was announced by Lt Colonel Jones of the NZ Army, that following an investigation, it was found that 2 of the wounded had been hit by shell fragments fired from a New Zealand Forces LAV 25mm cannon that was supporting the infantry.

As well as 2 KIA the kiwis suffered 6 wounded in the gun battle. The NZ soldiers were unable to follow the escaping insurgents as they do not have authority to manoeuvre in Baghan province which is under the military control of the Hungarian PRT. The following day the NZ army was given authority to manoeuvre in Baghan province and reinforcements were flown to Bamiyan. In previous counter insurgency operations into Baghan Province the force has mainly comprised NZ SAS and US special forces. The two New Zealand soldiers were buried with full military honours at a ceremony in Christchurch New Zealand. Valley Attack with IED On 19 August 2012 a four Humvee Kiwi convoy was attacked with a 20 kg roadside bomb about 3 km west of the forward operating base at Do Abe. The convoy had picked up a sick soldier from the FOB and was returning to Romero Base. Three soldiers were killed by a bomb which Lt General Jones described as very large, probably a pressure plate or remote command wire bomb. The soldiers were Corporal Tamatea, Lance Corporal Jacinda Baker and Private Richard Harris. All of the soldiers were experienced. Female soldiers make up about 15% of each kiwi PRT team. Most serve as driver/medics. One of the early PRT rotations was commanded by a female officer. The bomb completely destroyed the last vehicle in the convoy. This western area is so rugged that Humvees are preferred as they can manoeuvre off-road better than LAVs. The valley where the attack occurred is very narrow and overlooked by steep, rock-covered mountain sides. Taliban insurgents fired down from near the top of the mountains. The New Zealand soldiers replied with automatic small arms fire and turret mounted 25mm cannon fire from the Humvees.TV3 NEWS. 13.6.2013 In New Zealand General Jones said it was not a remotely exploded wireless bomb as the convoy was equipped with anti electronic pulsing equipment which disrupts wireless bomb control signals. The vehicle destroyed was an armoured Humvee. Kiwi soldiers patrol the road which goes to the capital Kabul at irregular periods. The Bamiyan ANP commander said that insurgents had been increasingly active on the highway in the last month, stopping people going to and from the capital. Recently five people associated with the government were taken at illegal check points and beheaded. General Jones said the NZ SAS would be sent into the Do Abe mountain area to gather intelligence. The New Zealand PRT team which is the 20th rotation, is scheduled for final withdrawal about April 2013. At the military funeral of the 3 soldiers in Christchurch, attended by the Prime Minister John Key, the officer wounded in the first August attack spoke about the soldiers and added that the same infantry unit were ready and able to reinforce the PRT team at any time if directed. A Taliban spokesperson said that during the winter Bamiyan province had been infiltrated by a number of different groups who all had separate targets. He called for the New Zealand PRT team to leave Baniyan immediately. He claimed the Taliban would now target New Zealand soldiers. The Bamiyan provincial governor said the local forces are not well enough armed to fight the Taliban by themselves and called for heavier weapons. Radio New Zealand reported NZ Prime Minister John Key as saying that last week 4 New Zealand SAS intelligence officers had flown to Bamiyan to gather information to make a case for a counter insurgency operation by US special forces against insurgents responsible for recent attacks in the area.Radio NZ News 20th Sept 2012 Afghan and Coalition counter insurgency forces in Afghanistan arrested three Taliban near Do Ab in an early morning helicopter raid on the village of Taleh bah Wafer, Baglan province, yesterday. One is described as a local third tier Taliban leader, connected with gun dealing. During the raid one Taliban insurgent was killed. The prime minister of New Zealand said no New Zealand troops took part in the raid. The Taliban leader is said to be behind the attack that killed two kiwi soldiers in August. Special forces are still hunting a known bomb maker in the same area. The Prime minister announced that a new New Zealand army company, plus forty disestablishment specialists, will go to Afghanistan shortly.

He is known for his invention of the Australian fast food phenomenon that became known as the Chiko Roll. Early life and career McEncroe was born at Castlemaine, Victoria on 11 October 1908, the second son of Victoria-born parents Pierce Francis McEncroe, a wheelwright, and his wife Sarah Ann, n√©e Desmond. Frank attended a local primary and acquired his secondary education at Marist Brothers College, Bendigo, where he obtained his certificate of merit. He then completed an apprenticeship as a boilermaker at Thompson's foundry, Castlemaine, where he worked for a time. During the Great Depression, McEncroe joined his father and two brothers on a dairy farm at Bendigo. In the late 1930s he ran an outdoor catering business, selling pies, pasties and other types of takeaway food at race meetings, country shows and similar gatherings. During World War II he was the licensee at the Court House Hotel in Pall Mall, Bendigo, while also holding a boilermaker's position at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Following the war McEncroe resumed his outdoor catering business, which he now ran from his family's former dairy farm, gaining experience in the processing, packaging and snap-freezing of takeaway foods. Invention of the Chiko Roll In 1950, inspired by Chinese chop suey rolls he saw being sold outside the Richmond Football Ground, McEncroe decided to try to develop a similar product of his own, one which he reportedly envisaged could be eaten with one hand while holding a beer in the other at a football match or other venue.Chiko still on a roll fifty years on , Simplot Australia website. The result was a product which was much larger and heavier than a conventional Chinese roll, but with somewhat similar ingredients and flavour. The roll was composed of \\"a mixture of cabbage, barley, carrots, celery, condiments and meat (beef or mutton) wrapped in an egg-batter dough\\".Dunstan. McEncroe initially prosaically named it the \\"Chicken Roll\\", but since it actually contained no chicken, he later reconsidered and dubbed it, simply, the \\"Chiko Roll\\". He launched his new product at the Wagga Wagga Show in 1951. Later that year, McEncroe moved to Melbourne with his family and began producing Chiko Rolls with the help of a sausage machine from the back of a fish-shop in Moreland Road, Coburg. As sales began to pick up, he set up a larger plant in a North Essendon factory, where he began to progressively modernise the machinery and improve packaging, freezing and distribution facilities. A mutually beneficial relationship with a local firm, Floyd's iceworks, resulted in the amalgamation of the two companies in 1960 to form Frozen Food Industries Pty Ltd. The new company went public in 1963. =Formula for success= Ingredients for the Chiko Roll were diced and extruded into a long tube of pastry which was then cooked as it made its way along the production line, after which the rolls were deep-fried and then snap-frozen prior to distribution. As a pre-cooked product, the rolls only required a rapid deep- fry at the place of purchase to reheat them. The convenience of selling and eating the rolls under all kinds of conditions, along with their novel savoury flavour, made them a highly popular alternative in an era when the fast food industry was rapidly expanding, and the Chiko Roll became a staple product of the ubiquitous Australian fish-and-chip shop as well as other takeaway food outlets for many years. By the late 1970s, 40 million Chiko Rolls were being sold Australia-wide each year, and more were exported to Japan. With the increasing diversity of fast food outlets over the last two decades, Chiko Rolls have gradually declined in popularity in Australia, but they can still be purchased in fish and chip shops, or as a frozen convenience food for home use from supermarket shelves. The Chiko Roll brand today is owned by Simplot Australia, a wholly owned subsidiary of the J. R. Simplot Company, a private food and agribusiness company based in Boise, Idaho.About Simplot ‚Äì Simplot Australia website. Personal life McEncroe married Anne Doreen Nolan at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bendigo on 20 August 1932. He was fond of fishing and shooting as a young man, and later enjoyed playing golf at Medway Golf Club, Melbourne, and Tweed Heads Golf Club, New South Wales. He died of ischaemic heart disease on 14 March 1979, and was buried at Keilor cemetery, Melbourne, survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

Parliament of Kenya. Accessed June 19, 2008. Biography Mwahima was born on 1 November 1949 and grew up without attending school, receiving little formal education throughout his childhood. Despite this he learned English as well as Kiswahili, in which he was described by Kenya's Standard newspaper as having \\"legendary oratory skills\\". Mwahima began his political life in 1987 when he was elected as a councillor in Kenya's port city of Mombasa, representing the ward of Shika Adabu in the Likoni area of the city. He went on to become deputy mayor of the council, and eventually mayor, a position he held from 1999 to 2002. In 1997 Mwahima became the chairman of the Likoni division of Kenya's then-ruling party, the Kenya African National Union (KANU). He was expelled from KANU in 2002 after pledging allegiance to Simeon Nyachae of the opposition Ford People party. He stood as a Ford People candidate for the Likoni Constituency of the Kenyan National Assembly in the 2002 Kenyan general election, but lost to Suleiman Shakombo of the National Rainbow Coalition. Mwahima contested the same seat in the 2007 general election, this time representing the Orange Democratic Movement party led by Raila Odinga. He defeated Shakombo, who had been the Heritage Minister under President Mwai Kibai in the previous government, by a margin of 17,859 votes to 7,324. As a member of parliament (MP), he served as on the Local Authorities Committee, the Catering and Health Club Committee, and the Departmental Committee on Health. Early in his tenure he was involved in a row with Odinga, who by then had become prime minister in the coalition government. Odinga was seeking to appoint a non-Coast Province leader of the Kenya Ports Authority, a move which was opposed by Mwahima and the province's five other Coast MPs who felt that the role should be in the hands of a local. Relations between the six MPs and Odinga remained tense in subsequent years, and they appeared on the verge of leaving ODM and aligning with William Ruto and Uhuru Kenyatta, rivals of Odinga. They re-pledged their allegiance to ODM at a public reconciliation in 2011, however. Mwahima retained his seat in the 2013 general election, polling a total of 18,258 votes. Shakombo, representing the United Republican Party was again his nearest challenger, with 7,009 votes, closely followed by Bernard Odhiambo Waore of The Independent Party. Mwahima died on 25 August 2020 at his home in Likoni. His family gave complications as a result of asthma as the reason for his death.

TCAG also operates as a Science and Technology Innovation Centre of Genome Canada, with an emphasis on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics support. Research at TCAG focuses on the genetic and genomic basis of human variability, health and disease, including research on the genetics of autism spectrum disorder and structural variation of the human genome. The centre is located in the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning in downtown Toronto, Canada. History The need for a centralized core facility for human genome research at SickKids Hospital prompted the establishment of The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) in 1998. The founding director and associate director were Drs. Lap-Chee Tsui and Stephen W. Scherer, respectively. Scherer is now the scientific director. The Centre for Applied Genomics ‚Äì MaRS location Funding from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) enabled TCAG to form by consolidating existing core facilities including the Medical Research Council of Canada Genome Resource Facility, the Canadian Genetic Diseases Network (CGDN) large insert clone core, the CGDN DNA Sequencing Core and the SickKids Biotechnology Service DNA Sequencing and Synthesis labs. A genome-wide microsatellite genotyping laboratory at the Ottawa Health Research Institute, led by Dennis Bulman, was added. Subsequently, operational funding from the CIHR Genomics Special Projects panel provided for additional staff. In 2001, a proposal entitled \\"Genome Resource Core Platform\\" was submitted to the then newly formed Genome Canada. This provided operational support, enhancing existing facilities and adding a mouse genotyping core at the University of Toronto led by Lucy Osborne. In 2002, SickKids built a new Affymetrix microarray facility. This core has quickly grown to become the largest such service centre in Canada and is in the top ten in North America.Data provided by Affymetrix, Inc. In 2004, TCAG entered a second phase of development driven by a $12 million CFI/Ontario Innovation Trust funded project entitled \\"Integrative Genomics for Health Research\\",Integrative Genomics for Health Research news item (Ontario Innovation Trust website) allowing for consolidation of the mouse genotyping core with the SickKids facilities. This award also supported the establishment of an \\"Ontario Population Genomics Repository\\" (OPGP) to be used as controls in studies of common diseases. To efficiently complete this project, TCAG partnered with John McLaughlin's group at Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto). In May, 2004, an application to the newly announced CFI Research Hospital Fund resulted in a $10.9 million award to build out lab space and consolidate all operations on the 14th and 15th floors of the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower (TMDT) in the MaRS Discovery District. TCAG was the first occupant of TMDT (in August, 2005), quickly followed by other SickKids scientists. Investments in computer infrastructure from the 2003 CFI/Ontario Innovation Trust competition resulted in the establishment of new phases of the high-performance computing cluster (HPF) that is currently used by TCAG and many other users, to allow analysis of large genomic datasets arising from new microarray and sequencing technologies. Further enhancements to the TCAG infrastructure were supported by a $10.7 million renewal grant from CFI's Leading Edge Fund competition, entitled \\"Integrative Genomics for Health Research ‚Äì Phase II\\", awarded in June 2009.SickKids press release, June 18, 2009 More recently, a CFI grant entitled \\"The Centre for Applied Genomics: Paediatric Genomes to Outcomes\\" provided further infrastructure support.SickKids kicks off 2013 with two Leading Edge Fund grants, January 13, 2013 In October 2013, TCAG moved to the Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, a new building housing the SickKids Research Institute.The Centre for Applied Genomics has moved - news item, TCAG website, October 229, 2013 TCAG operates in large part on Science and Technology Innovation Centre (STIC) funds from Genome Canada, administered by the Ontario Genomics Institute.

The character is portrayed by Sarah Flood. She was first seen on- screen during the opening episode in 1989. Backstory Suzanne first appears as a child (Sarah Flood, her portrayer, was eight at the time). She is a member of the Doyle family, a daughter of Bela (Jim Bartley) and Rita. Storylines Suzanne has a few relationships in Carrigstown. She has one with Floyd Phelan but leaves him after he treats her badly. She then has a relationship with Damien Halpin. They break up when they feel their relationship is going nowhere. In 1998 Suzanne is heartbroken when her sister, Helen, dies. In 2000 she is overjoyed when her parents get back together at Christmas. In 2001 Suzanne has a relationship with her college lecturer, Fiachra. However, she is disappointed when she finds out he is married and has also slept with her best friend, Sarah O'Leary. In 2002 Suzanne helps her father, Bela cope with prostate cancer. In 2003 Suzanne leaves college and decides to take a year out of Ireland. She goes to Indonesia to try to find herself and protect animals in the rainforest there. In 2005 Suzanne returns and is quick to resume her friendships with Sarah and Damien. She also starts a relationship with Morgan. However she is horrified when she learns that he is behind the brutal and savage murder of Gabriel Udenze. She quickly dumps him and Morgan is jailed. In 2007, Suzanne is told that Morgan wants to see her. She reluctantly visits him in prison where he tells her that he loves her and wants her to wait until he has served his time and continue their relationship. Suzanne is horrified and turns him down. The next day, she learns that Morgan has committed suicide after she leaves. Suzanne feels very guilty. Later in the year, she starts to have feelings for her ex-boyfriend Damien. However, she fears that if she acts on her feelings, it might ruin their friendship. Also, she cannot tell him how she feels as Damien is in a strong relationship with a teacher of his brother Mark. Suzanne finds out that she is having an affair with another man and is unsure whether she should tell Damien. Mark eventually finds out and Damian dumps her. Suzanne and Damien finally get together and get engaged straight away. Suzanne's parents are uncomfortable with how fast the relationship is going but are happy for her. She marries Damien in January 2008. At the reception, she is devastated to see her mother, Rita, is after having a stroke. Herself and Damien postpone their honeymoon and spend days by her bedside. Rita is in hospital for a few months before being sent to a nursing home. Suzanne is upset when she learns that her mother may never recover.

Bela convinces her to make up with him and go on her honeymoon. She does. In 2010, Damien's infidelity causes their marriage to begin to fall apart. Suzanne becomes very domineering towards Damien, cultivating in her taking her frustration out on him violently. Pregnant in 2012 with the child of David Osbourne (with whom she becomes involved after her relationship with Damien fails), Suzanne decides to take a year out of Ireland and goes to Australia to try to find herself again. In 2013, Sarah departs Carrigstown. Reception Suzanne's abuse of her husband Damien is considered \\"one of the plots on the show that had everyone talking\\". It was reported to have \\"gripped Fair City fans for months\\". It led to a marked increase in calls from men in similar situations dealing their own Suzannes, and coverage in national media ‚Äî such as The Irish Times ‚Äî of domestic abuse perpetrated against men.

Worsey is a tenured professor and well-known mining and explosives expert and researcher at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla). Outside of teaching, research, and writing in his field, he is noted for creating and hosting the University's annual \\"Explosives Camp\\" for 16- and 17-year-old aspiring mining engineers. Since 2008, Worsey has been one of the host experts on the Discovery Channel documentary series, The Detonators.  Background  Worsey obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Bristol in 1977. The following year he completed his Masters of Science degree in Rock Mechanics Excavation Engineering. In 1981 he obtained his Ph.D. in the field of Mining (Explosives) Engineering. His dissertation was entitled: Geotechnical factors affecting the application of pre-split blasting to rock slopes. In the past 10 years his research has focused on the demilitarization of explosive ordnance. He is the holder of several patents, including US Patent No. 4,754,705 for a blast control plug. \\"The device is designed to help keep explosive energy in blastholes when they detonate and thus more efficiently break rock and reduce environmental problems such as flyrock, airblast and ground vibrations.\\" He is also a certified British Parachute Association Instructor, having trained more than 1,000 students at the Sunderland Parachute Center.  Explosives camp  The camp was first held in 2004 and hosted 20 students for the one-week course. By 2008 the camp was hosting 60 campers in three one-week residential camp sessions. It is currently restricted to students who can prove American citizenship, are at least 16 years of age or older, and considered \\"up and coming students\\" in their high school classes. The camp has been widely reported upon in such media outlets as the New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), and the International Herald Tribune. Camp curriculum includes: > In addition to blowing up chickens, the campers feel concussions from > underground explosions, help generate a 150-foot water spout, experience > demolition demonstrations and fashion fireworks displays. ... Many of the > activities take place at Missouri S&T;‚Äôs Experimental Mine. Each day, the > campers participate in classroom instruction and safety training before > initiating an explosion.  Teaching  Worsey teaches a number of courses at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, including the following which he personally developed: * Demolition of Buildings and Structures * Principles of Explosives Engineering * Commercial Pyrotechnics Operations * Blasting Design and Technology * Environmental Controls for Blasting * Instrumentation for Explosives and Blasting The Missouri University of Science and Technology is the only institution in the United States to offer a specific \\"explosives minor\\" and a \\"non-thesis masters\\" as part of its Explosives Engineering Program.

Known as one of Indonesia's classic musical acts, the band peaked in popularity in the days far before the advent of private television companies, delivering stripped-down pop and rock songs at the then-only TV station, TVRI. In 2007, Rolling Stone Indonesia magazine placed 6 of the band's studio albums on their 150 Greatest Indonesian Albums of All Time list. Those are Dheg Dheg Plas (1969) at number 4, To The So Called The Guilties (1967) at number 6, Koes Bersaudara (1964) at number 14, Koes Plus Volume 2 (1970) at number 21, Koes Plus Volume 4 (1971) at number 30 and Koes Plus Volume 5 (1971) at number 38. In addition, Rolling Stone put 10 of the band's songs on the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time list. The songs are \\"Bis Sekolah\\" (1964) at number 4, \\"Kembali Ke Jakarta\\" (1969) at number 6, \\"Nusantara I\\" (1971) at number 19, \\"Kolam Susu\\" (1973) at number 31, \\"Bunga Di Tepi Jalan\\" (1971) at number 80, \\"Kelelawar\\" (1969) at number 83, \\"Manis dan Sayang\\" (1969) at number 88, \\"Pelangi\\" (1972) at number 92, \\"Jemu\\" (1975) at number 100 and \\"Di Dalam Bui\\" (1967) at number 126. HistoryEarly days and controversy= Hailing from the Bojonegoro- Tuban area in East Java, the band started out as Koes Bersaudara (Koes Brothers), initially consisting of all five Koeswoyo brothers: John Koeswoyo, Yok Koeswoyo, Yon Koeswoyo, Nomo Koeswoyo and Tonny Koeswoyo. Its antics of pioneering Beatles-influenced rock and roll subculture in Indonesia proved to be controversial. Such subcultures had been banned by President Sukarno in the early 1960s, and in 1965 the brothers were arrested by the Highest Operation Commando (KOTI) for performing covers of Beatles songs.Connoy, Jason and Chandra Drews (2010). \\"Koes Plus\\". In Those Shocking, Shaking Days (pp.13) [LP booklet]. Los Angeles: Now-Again Records. They were eventually released just the day preceding the nation's coup d'√©tat, on 29 September. This experience resulted in their song \\"Di Dalam Bui\\". =Koes Plus= When drummer Nomo quit in 1969, Murry was invited to fill the niche, but the decision caused an internal uproar as the band was initially projected as a family act. The feud was resolved by rebaptizing the band as Koes Plus. It consisted of the Koeswoyos plus an outsider; hence the name. Music historians have hypothesized that it was Murry's heavy drumming which led to the band incorporating rock tunes within their generally ballad-heavy albums. Koes Plus' early days were rugged, as record companies insisted on rejecting them. Murry became frustrated at some point and temporarily quit the band, distributing their records freely as well as joining several other acts. Not until their songs were played on the state radio network did they gain considerable fame. =Present= Koes Plus never owned any legal rights pertaining to their works; they received only flat payment of approximately three million rupiahs for each album they recorded. While this meant that their record label was willing to produce a huge number of albums by Koes Plus due to the small investment involved, it also meant that the band never enjoyed any form of royalties whenever their works are being reproduced. As such, they rely upon their continuing live performances for their income. Murry (Kasmuri) died on February 1, 2014 in Jatisampurna, Bekasi, West Java, aged 65.

The book is about the false imprisonment of two people, John Button and Darryl Beamish who were both convicted for murders that were later proved to be committed by Eric Cooke the last man hanged in Western Australia in the Fremantle Gaol. Though the information was to go into a book it became a combined exercise in authorship and citizen advocacy which led to the re-opening of the cases of both Button and Darryl Beamish and the quashing of their long-standing convictions. Background In 1963 John Button was convicted of the manslaughter of his girlfriend, Rosemary Anderson. Button was originally charged with wilful murder but the jury found him guilty of the lesser charge and was sentenced to 10 years jail. Button's brother approached Blackburn in January 1992 claiming his older brother had been framed for a murder committed by Eric Cooke, though skeptical Blackburn met John Button in February 1992. After hearing his testimony and reading the appeal books kept from his previous court actions, she decided that his case would be an appropriate topic for the book.The End of Innocence, pp. 20-26. The key discovery in the revision of the case histories was that Eric Cooke had been a multiple-method killer. His offences show a significant deviation from the pattern generally accepted as the orthodox \\"serial killer\\" template, which holds that such killers target the same type of victim in the same way, impelled by the same underlying motive. Cooke, conversely, for differing reasons, using various methods, killed or attempted to kill persons of both sexes and of a wide spread of ages and social circumstances. Justice for Button and Beamish: Darryl Beamish, Estelle Blackburn and John Button at the Supreme Court celebrating Beamish's exoneration on 1 April 2005 (44 years after conviction), following Button's exoneration on 25 February 2002 (39 years after conviction). Blackburn discovered, once granted access to police archives, that the police had not emphasised this behaviour pattern of Cooke in their public statements. They made no public announcement that Cooke had attacked seven other women in five hit-runs and five other women asleep in their beds, women who survived the attacks. So the Western Australian community at large and the legal advocates for Button and Beamish were unaware that Cooke had attempted murder by vehicle impact. This was the means by which John Button's girlfriend, 17-year-old Rosemary Anderson, had been killed. At the time of Button's trial for her wilful murder, her death appeared to be an isolated event and his claim that he had coincidentally discovered her after the attack seemed implausible. Likewise, during Darryl Beamish's trial for the wilful murder of 22-year-old heiress Jillian Brewer (who was attacked while she slept), the offence was not placed in the context of the series of assaults that Cooke had committed against other women asleep in their homes. The location and interviewing of the other, surviving, victims of Cooke and the creation of a detailed analysis of his life and criminal career produced the narrative history, \\"Broken Lives\\". This work had a powerful impact on the public discourse about jurisprudence in Western Australia and the process of completing it created relationships between justice advocates in the fields of journalism and the legal profession which provided the impetus for a renewed campaign to clear Button and Beamish. Following the initial publication of Broken Lives in 1998, Blackburn became the recipient of a number of awards, the most significant being the Medal of the Order of Australia, a Walkley Award for the greatest contribution to journalism, and induction into the Western Australian Women's Hall of Fame. Renewed public interest in the cases led to several appearances in the electronic media, including on ABC Television's high-profile programme, Australian Story. This increased media profile afforded an opportunity to engage in paid public speaking and invitations to contribute to true-crime anthologies. Blackburn also assisted in the preparation of the appeal cases for John Button and Darryl Beamish and acted as media liaison for the defence team during the preparation for and hearing of the appeals. In 2002, this epic story of Western Australian jurisprudence, begun with the events of the late 1950s and early 1960s, approached its conclusion: the conviction of John Button for manslaughter was quashed. Darryl Beamish's wilful murder conviction was quashed in 2005.

Its aim was to prepare Indians to struggle for complete independence. It was a daily organ of Indian nationalism. It was accused of spreading 'radical Indian nationalism' and 'Nationalist Extremism'. According to S. K. Ratcliffe, a previous editor of The Statesman, in a letter to the Manchester Guardian of 28 December 1950, \\"It had a full-size sheet, was clearly printed on green paper, and was full of leading and special articles written in English with a brilliance and pungency not hitherto attained in the Indian Press. It was the most effective voice of what we then called nationalist extremism.\\" The two decades of increasing influence of journals such as Bande Mataram in Bengal, and similar journals emerging in the United Provinces led to a strict government censorship under the Press Act 1910.

He is currently serving as the chairman of the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC) after President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed him to the position. He belongs to the Jubilee Alliance Party and was elected to represent the Bureti Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya in the Kenyan parliamentary election, 2007.Members Of The 10th Parliament . Parliament of Kenya. Accessed 19 June 2008. Early life and education Franklin Kipng‚Äôetich Bett, also known as Chepkooit to his supporters, was born on 23 March 1953 in Kiptiriri Village, Cheborge, in the larger Kericho District. He was enrolled in Cheborge Primary School in 1960 and later moved to Korongoi Primary School in 1963 where he graduated top of his class in 1968. He was selected to join Tenwek High School in 1969, then a mission school under the auspices of the World Gospel Missionaries. Some of Bett's notable co-alumni of Tenwek High School include Mark Kipkemoi Bor, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation, his close friend and predecessor at the Ministry of Roads Kipkalya Kones, Dr. Bishop Rono, Ambassador John Koech, Josephat Nanok and many other leaders in business, politics and academia. Bett graduated from Tenwek High School in 1972 with Division 1, the highest grade possible in the then Kenya Certificates of Examination (O-level). In 1973, he proceeded to Shimo la Tewa High School in Mombasa for his Kenya Advanced Certificate of Education (KACE) where he attained three principals in history, geography, economics and a subsidiary in general paper upon graduation from the school in 1974. After graduation, Bett went back home where he founded Tebesonik Secondary School and served briefly as its first head teacher before joining the University of Nairobi to pursue an undergraduate degree in commerce (accounting). He graduated in 1979. Public Service After graduating, Bett joined the civil service where he built a career that culminated in his appointment as an Assistant Secretary at the Treasury in 1987. His seniors at the time included Simeon Nyachae, a one- time finance minister, Chief Secretary and businessman; and Jeremiah Kiereini who too was once a Chief Secretary, Head of the Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet. After his resignation, he worked briefly with the Federation of Kenya Employers before the then president Daniel arap Moi recalled him back to government and assigned him the Supplies Branch of the Ministry of Roads and Public Works. Soon after, Moi once again tapped him for the position of Deputy State House Comptroller. His main duties were speech and report writing. He served in the position until 1996 when he was promoted to the position of State House Comptroller upon the retirement of Abraham Kiptanui, for whom he was a deputy. He held this role for two years until, in 1998, he was demoted to a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Environmental Conservation. Political career In early 2002, Bett was approached by Raila Odinga to join him in a new political party - the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and he acquiesced. When LDP joined hands with the Mwai Kibaki-led NAK to form NARC, Bett was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating its activities in the South Rift. In spite of the fact that South Rift had been a KANU bastion for the four decades since independence, Bett's team was able to claw back substantial ground for NARC. As the historic 2002 election votes trickled in, his input was manifest in the numerous civic seats, impressive performance by parliamentary candidates on its ticket and thousands of votes for its presidential candidate Kibaki who eventually was declared the winner. Unlike many leaders from the region, Bett's judgment carried the day. The NARC government nominated him as a member of parliament in 2003 and was subsequently elected to chair the Parliamentary Select Committee on Agriculture, Land and Natural Resources. With him at the helm, the committee sponsored many bills and motions with the Forest Act of 2005 being its most remarkable. The committee is remembered for vehemently opposing the introduction of GMOs in the country. The year 2005 saw Bett and Henry Kosgey leading the people of Rift Valley to join the rest of the country in rejecting a what they termed a 'watered-down' draft constitution in that year's referendum. In 2007, Bett contested the Buret Constituency parliamentary seat on an ODM ticket and won. He garnered 43,000 votes against his nearest competitor Paul Sang of KANU who managed got 7,000 votes. From his contributions on the floor of the House, he was able to nudge the government into putting up a pineapple processing plant in Roret and the Tiriitab-Moita- based Bureti Technical Institute, both projects are still underway. Other projects are Kapkatet Stadium that is being modernised alongside the Sotik- Cheborge-Roret-Sigowet and Litein-Kibugat roads that are being upgraded with bitumen. Following the demise of Kipkalya Kones, he was appointed to replace him as Minister for Roads in February 2009. His stewardship at the Ministry of Roads has seen a rapid expansion of roads infrastructure in all parts of the country. The Thika Superhighway became a reality under his charge. Personal life Bett is fond of travelling for business and leisure. He has visited over 70 countries and has close business and political contacts in Australia, United States and United Kingdom. He has five daughters and four sons.

Prior to geomipmapping, techniques such as quadtree rendering were used to divide the terrain into square tiles created by binary division with quadratically diminishing size. The subdivision step is typically performed on the CPU which creates a bottleneck as geometry commands are buffered to the GPU. Unlike quadtrees which send 1x1 polygon units to the GPU, to reduce the CPU processing time geomipmapping divides the terrain into grid-based tiles which are themselves regularly subdivided. Typically, a fixed number of vertex buffer objects (VBOs) are stored on the GPU at different grid resolutions, such as 10x10 and 20x20, and then placed at major terrain regions selectively chosen by the CPU. A vertex shader is then used to reposition the vertices for a given VBO, all on the GPU. Overall, this results in a major reduction in CPU processing, and reduced CPU-to-GPU bandwidth as the GPU then performs most of the work. Geoclipmaps and GPU raycasting are two other modern alternatives to geomipmapping for interactive rendering of terrain.

She was born in Carleton, New Brunswick (now West Saint John), and was known in the family as \\"Suzie\\" in order to distinguish her from her mother with the same first name. Her family moved to the town of St. Stephen where her father and uncle Gilbert founded the Ganong Bros. chocolate company. Susan Ganong is the sister of businessmen Edwin and Arthur, and to botanist and educator William. Her sister Kit married Howard P. Whidden, Chancellor of McMaster University in Ontario. Susan Granong graduated from St. Stephen High School and obtained her teaching certificate from the Normal School in Fredericton. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts where her brother William was a professor. Ganong taught school in her hometown for three years and taught science for four years at Halifax Ladies' College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1903, she joined the faculty of the Netherwood School, an exclusive private school for girls in Rothesay, New Brunswick. At the time, the school was in severe difficulty and had less than ten students but as co-principal with Miss Ethelwyn Pitcher, she took over the lease of the building and implemented ideas and improvements so that by 1905 enrollment had increased to thirty- three students. In 1912, Susan Ganong purchased the facility, expanding its facilities further and increasing the School's emphasis on academic excellence to a point where the school gained a reputation internationally as school of high scholastic standing. She advanced the learning of music and art and arranged for musicians, artists, and art exhibitions to appear at the school. She also put in place a program for the teaching of the French language, a pioneering effort in a very English institution designed to develop an understanding between Canada's two founding cultures. Outside of her school, Ganong was active in the YWCA organization and the New Brunswick Museum. In 1943, she received an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from the University of New Brunswick as an acknowledgment of her substantial contributions to education in the province of New Brunswick. After leading the Netherwood School for forty-one years, in 1944 Dr. Ganong sold the institution to the Netherwood Foundation Limited. Although retired, she resided in her cottage on the school's grounds for the remainder of her life. In 1952, she published A Sketch of Life at Netherwood, the Rothesay School for Girls. Susan Ganong died on April 29, 1961 in Rothesay and was buried with family members in the St. Stephen Rural Cemetery. The Netherwood School offers the Dr. Susan B. Ganong Memorial Scholarship and the Susan B. Ganong Theater, built in 1997, was named in her memory. Her portrait by Kenneth Forbes hangs in the dining hall at the school.

Formation Its first commander was Oberst von Arentsschild, and it was formed from non-French prisoners and deserters left behind in Russia during and after the French invasion earlier that year. Although called the \\"Russo- German Legion\\", the legion included Dutchmen and Belgians, who were also called up to join. Those prisoners of war wanting to join, were enlisted in the rank they had held in the French army. It was formed to fight against Napoleon as part of the Imperial Russian army but was paid by Russia's ally, Great Britain. Ernst Moritz Arndt, the private secretary to the pro-Russian Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein, acted as head propagandist to entrants to the Legion. He stayed in Saint Petersburg from 1812 onwards and attracted entrants by winning them over to fight to liberate Germany from its French occupying forces. =Structure= The Russian‚ÄìGerman Legion was 9,379 strong in total and consisted of eight infantry battalions, one company of J√§gers, two regiments of hussars and two batteries of horse artillery. Carl von Clausewitz was among notable soldiers of the Legion. Campaigns On 6 July 1812, after the contract of Peterswaldau, Great Britain received the task of providing for the Russian‚ÄìGerman Legion and thus acquired the right to determine how and where it was to be deployed. At first, the Legion was directed south towards, where it became clear the legion was to be united with a Russian Corps and be deployed against the Persians, with whom the Russians were still at war. A staff officer, Major Logger van Koch, then rode off to the Russian headquarters in Konigsberg, where he had an audience with the Czar. He soon returned with the order to march to Germany. Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn was now put in command, and the Legion ventured to the lower Elbe, fought at Mecklenburg and Holstein, attacked Harburg and marched far as the Netherlands. In mid March 1814 it crossed the Rhine and fought in Flanders in order to blockade Antwerp. After returning from France in 1814, the Legion was received by Prussia, where collaborators were viewed critically, and any non-German personnel were discharged, and so on 2 June 1814 it was renamed the German Legion. The Legion moved to Kurhessen for exercises in 1814 and from then until 1815 took up quarters in the Bergischen. After Napoleon's return from Elba on 26 February 1815, the soldiers of this unit were merged into the 30th and 31st infantry regiment, 8th (Russisch-Deutsche Legion) Ulanenregiment and 18th and 19th horse-artillery batteries of the Prussian army. These units took part in the Waterloo campaign, known as the Hundred Days, as part of the III Corps of the Prussian Army.Order of Battle of Waterloo campaign Several Dutch members of the Russo-German Legion had been decorated for valour. Already in 1814, several of them were given permission to wear their medals. In 1821, the members of the Legion were awarded the Russian Service Medal for the wars of 1813-1814, and also given permission to wear this decoration.

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (formally the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) is an international treaty to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe. Right Article 8 is considered to be one of the Convention's most open-ended provisions. = Family life = In X, Y, and Z v. UK, the Court recalls that \\"the notion of 'family life' in Article 8 is not confined solely so the families based on marriage and may encompass other de facto relationship. When deciding whether a relationship can be said to amount to 'family life', a number of factors may be relevant, including whether the couples live together, the length of their relationship and whether they have demonstrated their commitment to each other by having children together or by any other means. = Home = In Niemietz v Germany case the court gave broader meaning to the 'home' notion including professional/business premises such as a lawyer's office. = Private life = For better understanding of perception of \\"private life\\" case law should be analyzed. In Niemietz v. Germany, the Court held that it \\"does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an exhaustive definition of the notion of 'private life'. However, it would be too restrictive to limit the notion to an 'inner circle' in which the individual may live his own personal life as he choose and to exclude therefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle. Respect for private life must also comprisehttps://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Guide_Art_8_ENG.pdf to a certain degree the right to establish and develop relationship and develop relationship with other human beings.\\" Case law Article 8 clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for \\"private and family life\\" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus not to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to do something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced father to his child). * Golder v.

Under the Dome is the 58th book published by Stephen King, and it is his 48th novel. The novel focuses on a small Maine town, and tells an intricate, multi-character, alternating perspective story of how the town's inhabitants contend with the calamity of being suddenly cut-off from the outside world by an impassable, invisible glass dome-like barrier that seemingly falls out of the sky, transforming the community into a domed city. Plot summary At 11:44 a.m. on October 21, 2017, the small Maine town of Chester's Mill is abruptly and gruesomely separated from the outside world by an invisible, semipermeable barrier of unknown origin. The immediate appearance of the barrier causes a number of injuries and fatalities and traps former Army Captain Dale \\"Barbie\\" Barbara‚Äîwho is trying to leave Chester's Mill because of a local dispute‚Äîinside the town. Police Chief Howard \\"Duke\\" Perkins is killed instantly when his pacemaker explodes when he gets too close to the Dome. This removes the last significant opposition to James \\"Big Jim\\" Rennie, used car salesman and the town's Second Selectman. Big Jim exerts a significant influence on Chester's Mill and seizes the opportunity to use the barrier as part of a power play to take over the town. Big Jim appoints one of his cronies, the incompetent Peter Randolph, as the new police chief. He also begins expanding the ranks of the Chester's Mill Police with questionable candidates, including his son, Junior Rennie, and his friends. Junior has frequent migraines caused by an as-yet-undiscovered brain tumor which has also begun affecting his mental state; unknown to Big Jim, Junior was in the process of beating and strangling a girl (Angie McCain) to death when the barrier appeared and has killed another girl (Dodee Sanders) by the time Big Jim places him on the police force. Elsewhere in Chester's Mill, Col. James O. Cox (who is stationed outside of the Dome) calls Julia Shumway, the editor of the local newspaper, and has her carry a message to Barbie to contact him. Cox then asks Barbie to act as the government's agent to bring down the Dome, as it has come to be known. Drawing similarities to Barbie's Army specialization in locating enemy munitions factories, Cox gives him the task of locating the Dome's power source, which is believed to be somewhere in the town. Cox is also able to foresee the small-town political ramifications of such a situation. By virtue of a Presidential order, Barbie is reinstated in the U.S. military and brevetted to the rank of Colonel. Barbie is also presented with a decree granting him authority over the township. However, small-town politics being what they are, this action is not well received by Big Jim and his band of renegade police officers. Around this time, Brenda Perkins, Duke's widow, discovers a file on her husband's computer that lists Big Jim's money-stealing schemes. As Big Jim covertly encourages and orchestrates unease and panic among the townspeople to build up his grab for power, Barbie, Julia, and some other townspeople attempt to stop things from spiraling out of control. After crossing Big Jim's path on several occasions, Barbie is framed and arrested for four murders. He is accused of killing Reverend Lester Coggins, who laundered money for Big Jim's large-scale methamphetamine operation, and Duke's widow Brenda Perkins, who were both murdered by Big Jim, as well as Angie and Dodee. While Barbie is in jail, other residents track the source of the Dome, using a Geiger counter, to an abandoned farm; the device they find in the middle of the farm's orchard is strongly indicated to be extraterrestrial in origin. The restrictions issued by Big Jim become more severe, and the police force grows more abusive, galvanizing the town and eventually leading some residents to break Barbie out of jail, killing Junior seconds before he can murder Barbie. The semi-organized resistance flees to the abandoned farm, where multiple people touch the strange object and experience visions. They not only conclude that the device was put in place by extraterrestrial \\"leatherheads\\" (so named for their appearance), but that specifically they are juveniles who have set up the Dome as a form of entertainment, a sort of ant farm used to capture sentient beings and allow their captors to view everything that happens to them. On an organized \\"Visitors Day\\"‚Äîwhen people outside the Dome can meet at its edge with people within‚ÄîBig Jim sends Randolph and a detachment of police to take back control of his former methamphetamine operation from Phil \\"Chef\\" Bushey, who is stopping Big Jim from covering up the operation as well as hoarding the more than four hundred tanks of propane stored there (Chef wants it all, explaining, \\"I need it to cook\\"). Big Jim underestimates Chef's capacity for self-defense and meth-induced paranoia; he, as well as the now-ostracized head selectman Andy Sanders (whom Chef has introduced to meth use), defend themselves and the meth lab with assault rifles. Many are killed in the ensuing gunfight, and Chef, who is mortally wounded, detonates a plastic explosive device he has placed in the meth production facility. The ensuing explosion, combined with the propane and meth-making chemicals, unleashes a toxic firestorm large enough to incinerate most of the town. More than a thousand of the town's residents are quickly incinerated on national television, leaving alive just over 300 individuals who gradually die out as the toxic air restricts their breathing. Among the survivors are the twenty- seven refugees at the abandoned farm, an orphaned farm boy, hiding in a potato cellar, and Big Jim and his informal aide-de-camp, Carter Thibodeau, in the town's fallout shelter. Big Jim and Thibodeau eventually turn on each other over the limited oxygen supply (and Big Jim's worry that Thibodeau may act as a witness against him if they survive); Big Jim stabs and disembowels Thibodeau, only to die several hours later when hallucinations of the dead send him fleeing into the toxic environment outside. The survivors at the barn begin to slowly asphyxiate, despite efforts by the Army to force clean air through the walls of the Dome. Barbie and Julia go to the control device to beg their captors to release them. Julia makes contact with a single female leatherhead, no longer accompanied by her friends and thus not under peer pressure. After repeatedly expressing that they are real sentient beings with real \\"little lives,\\" and by sharing a painful childhood incident with the adolescent alien, Julia convinces the leatherhead to have pity on them. The Dome rises slowly and vanishes, allowing the toxic air to dissipate and finally freeing what is left of the town of Chester's Mill. CharactersMain characters= * Dale \\"Barbie\\" Barbara ‚Äì A former Army lieutenant (initially referred to as a former captain by Colonel Cox), Barbara became a drifter after separating from the Army. Trapped within feet of the edge of the Dome, witnessing a woodchuck cut in half by the event, Dale was attempting to flee the town after a confrontation with Junior Rennie and his friends. Dale soon becomes the U.S. government's choice to run Chester's Mill, after being recalled to active service and promoted to the rank of colonel. This causes more tension between Dale, Big Jim, and Junior, causing the two to frame Dale for the murders they commit. One of the 26 survivors of the Dome. * Julia Shumway ‚Äì A cynical woman who owns and edits The Democrat (despite being a Republican), the town's local newspaper. Julia often feels the need to prove a point and expose those she sees around her. Julia becomes the conduit between Colonel Cox and Dale Barbara via her cell phone. Julia and Dale have a budding romantic relationship. Both Dale and Julia are gutsy and tough, brave enough to try any chance they might have for survival. Julia comes from a family of news executives; the newspaper is a family concern. She was groomed early for success and was viewed by her peers as a \\"goody-two-shoes\\". A confrontation with her classmates in fourth grade caused her to rethink her status and changed the course of her academic career; however, this same confrontation is key in helping her formulate a plan to end the siege. One of the 26 survivors of the Dome. * James \\"Big Jim\\" Rennie ‚Äì A power-obsessed second selectman of Chester's Mill based on Dick Cheney,Stephen King: 'We all live under the dome' owner of a used car dealership and the biggest crystal meth lab on the east coast. When Chief Perkins is killed on Dome Day, Big Jim becomes the de facto leader of Chester's Mill. He is owed favors by virtually every person of authority in town, and is rubber stamped by Andy Sanders, the grieving and incompetent first selectman, and Pete Randolph, the new, incompetent town police chief. Big Jim directly controls both Andy and Pete through most of the story. Big Jim murders Lester Coggins, Brenda Perkins, and Carter Thibodeau during his time under the Dome. His actions make him responsible for the deaths of many others. Presumed dead from heart failure in the town's emergency shelter. * James \\"Junior\\" Rennie ‚Äì Junior is a smalltown thug and son of the most influential man in Chester's Mill. After he is deputized, he recruits new police officers for his father.

He particularly hates Dale Barbara, who laid a beating on Junior and his friends even though they outnumbered him. Dale could have had Junior arrested for assault, but Dale was an outsider and Junior's father was Big Jim. Junior murders Angie McCain early in the story, and Angie's friend Dodee Sanders a short time later when she stops by the McCain house. He later molests the corpses of the two women, referring to them as his \\"girlfriends\\" in his delusional state. He slowly becomes more delusional as the novel progresses and his tumor becomes more debilitating. Eventually Junior comes to the false conclusion that Barbara has poisoned him and sets out to kill him. He later murders special deputies Stacey Moggins, Rupe Libby, and Mickey Wardlaw by shooting them, before being killed himself by Jackie Wettington. * Eric \\"Rusty\\" Everett ‚Äì A kind-hearted physician assistant at Cathy Russell Hospital. Rusty is married to Linda Everett, a police officer, and has two young daughters, Janelle and Judy.

He organizes a protest at the Dome's wall‚Äîassisted by Norrie and Benny‚Äîand manages to rally the town before an incident calls the entire protest off. He later becomes a valuable ally of Dale Barbara, assisting him in providing a video feed during the incident early in the book where the government sends a missile to try to destroy the Dome. Afterward, he continues to make an effort to find answers to the Dome with his friends, and is among the group that finds the alien generator in the town's back fields.

Retrieved January 21, 2016. Other human survivors are Dougie Twitchell, Ginny Tomlinson, Gina Buffalino, Harriet Bigelow, Janelle Everett, Judy Everett, Pete Freeman, Tony Guay, Claire McClatchey, Joanie Calvert, Alva Drake, Little Walter Bushey and Lissa Jamieson. Julia Shumway's dog Horace also survives. Writing In January 2008, Time magazine quoted King as saying he would \\"be killing a lot of trees\\" with his next novel. The first draft was completed in late August 2008, with the manuscript weighing . King has stated the novel is twice as long as his most recent, Duma Key, at \\"over 1,500 pages in manuscript\\", and \\"deals with some of the same issues that The Stand does, but in a more allegorical way\\". King also described the novel as \\"very, very long\\", adding: \\"I tried this once before when I was a lot younger and the project was just too big for me.\\" King read from the first draft at \\"The Three Kings\\" reading event that was held on April 4, 2008 at the Library of Congress, which was broadcast by C-SPAN as part of their Book TV series on May 4, 2008. =The Cannibals connection= Under the Dome is a partial rewrite of a novel King attempted to write first in 1972 under the same title and then a second time in 1982 as The Cannibals.He Likes His Horror Personal and Global As King stated on his official site, these two unfinished works \\"were two very different attempts to utilize the same idea, which concerns itself with how people behave when they are cut off from the society they've always belonged to. Also, my memory of The Cannibals is that it, like Needful Things, was a kind of social comedy. The new Under the Dome is played dead straight.\\" From the material originally written, only the first chapter is included in the new novel. According to Stephen J. Spignesi's 1998 book The Lost Work of Stephen King,Spignesi 1998 The Cannibals (originally titled Under the Dome) is an unpublished unfinished 450-page handwritten novel written in 1982, while King was filming Creepshow. This work later served as inspiration to King's new novel Under the Dome. In 1982, King said: \\"I've got about four-hundred-and- fifty pages done and it is all about these people who are trapped in an apartment building. Worst thing I could think of. And I thought, wouldn't it be funny if they all ended up eating each other? It's very, very bizarre because it's all on one note. And who knows whether it will be published or not?\\" In Douglas E. Winter's book The Art of Darkness, Stephen King is also quoted, talking around the time of Creepshow, about the origins of Under the Dome: \\"I worked on a book called The Cannibals‚ÄîI had started it five years before, but it was called Under the Dome then. It didn't get finished either time.\\" On September 15, 2009, Stephen King's official site posted a 61-page facsimile excerpt from King's original novel The Cannibals, consisting of the first four chapters of the original typescript. A further 63 pages were posted on October 4. The excerpts served to also document how long ago King had had the idea of being under a dome: > Several Internet writers have speculated on a perceived similarity between > Under the Dome and The Simpsons Movie, where, [...] Springfield is isolated > inside a large glass dome [...]. I can't speak personally to this, because I > have never seen the movie, and the similarity came as a complete surprise to > me...although I know, from personal experience, that the similarity will > turn out to be casual. For the doubters, this excerpt [from The Cannibals] > should demonstrate that I was thinking dome and isolation long before Homer, > Marge, and their amusing brood came on the scene.\\" =Environmental and political undertones= Regarding the theme of Under the Dome, King said: > From the very beginning, I saw it as a chance to write about the serious > ecological problems that we face in the world today. The fact is we all live > under the dome. We have this little blue world that we've all seen from > outer space, and it appears like that's about all there is. It's a natural > allegorical situation, without whamming the reader over the head with it. I > don't like books where everything stands for everything else. It works with > Animal Farm: You can be a child and read it as a story about animals, but > when you're older, you realize it's about communism, capitalism, fascism. > That's the genius of Orwell.

We have to conclude we're on our own, and we have to deal with it. > We're under the dome. All of us. Speaking to Time and The New York Times Book Review regarding the novel's politics, King said: > I was angry about incompetency. Obviously I'm on the left of center. I > didn't believe there was justification for going into the war in Iraq. And > it just seemed at the time, that in the wake of 9/11, the Bush > Administration was like this angry kid walking down the street who couldn't > find whoever sucker punched him, and so turned around and punched the first > likely suspect.

Release The paperback edition of Just After Sunset, released on September 29, 2009, included an excerpt from the novel. An excerpt was published in the November 6, 2009 issue of Entertainment Weekly. The preliminary dust jacket cover art was released to online retailers like Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble with the words \\"cover to be unveiled\\". In late August 2009, it was revealed that the real cover would be unveiled on October 5, 2009, with parts of it being shown on September 21, 25 and 28. The cover art design for Under the Dome is said to be a departure from King's previous illustrated covers, using a combination of illustration, photographs, and 3D renderings. The final jacket design was released in two variations: with white lettering; and with the less common dark gray lettering. Stephen King held a book signing at The Magic Lantern movie theater in Bridgton, Maine, the town that the fictitious Chester's Mill is modeled after, and made several TV appearances discussing the similarity between the real town and the fictional one. \\"I live 18 miles out of town and I‚Äôve lived there for a long time,\\" said King. \\"I looked at the police station, that's the police station in the book. I just used the geography, the lake; everything is there.\\" King was a Bridgton resident for nearly five years. It also served as the model for the town in The Mist. On the day of the release, Stephen King was in New York City at The TimesCenter to promote the book. In mid-October, Under the Dome became one of the highly discounted book preorders on Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, and Target, sparking a \\"price war\\" between the retailers. The price for Under the Dome and several other high-profile hardcover books to be released in November 2009, typically around US$25, was set at just US$9 (a discount of nearly 75 percent off on a new hardcover). Later, Wal-Mart lowered the price to US$8.98 and included free shipping. Target's price was set at US$8.99. =Viral marketing= A number of viral marketing websites for popular locations referenced in Under the Dome were created to publicize the book, including Big Jim Rennie's Used Cars, the Sweet Briar Rose Diner, the Chester's Mill Democrat Newspaper, and others. A site was created for the Town of Chester's Mill, which provides links to all points of interest. An alternate reality game also took place utilizing all of these sites, beginning at the blog of Scarecrow Joe, one of the characters in the novel. =Limited editions= A Collector's Edition (limited to 25,000 copies) and a Signed Edition (limited to 1,500 copies) were published by Scribner concurrently with the regular trade edition. These editions feature a dust jacket without any lettering, a removable band with author name and title, printed endpapers with the map of the town in color (regular edition contains a black and white map in the book's front matter), 27 illustrations by The New Yorker cartoonist Matthew Diffee, a ribbon marker, and also contain a deck of cards with the Diffee illustrations. These editions are printed on specialty paper with different binding. A signed and numbered UK edition, published by Hodder & Stoughton, sold exclusively by both Hatchard's Bookshop and Waterstones, was limited to 500 copies. It included the 4-color endpapers, the 27 trading cards illustrated by cartoonist, Matthew Diffee, and was packaged in a slipcase. Reception The author Dan Simmons, to whom Stephen King sent the manuscript for Under the Dome as a gift, commented on it on May 5, 2009, calling the novel \\"huge, generous, sprawling, infinitely energetic [...], absolutely enjoyable and impressive.\\" Publishers Weekly reviewed the novel on September 11, 2009, calling it \\"formidably complex and irresistibly compelling.\\" The review said the book contains \\"themes and images from King's earlier fiction, and while this novel doesn't have the moral weight of, say, The Stand, nevertheless, it's a nonstop thrill ride as well as a disturbing, moving meditation on our capacity for good and evil\\". In a review for The Plain Dealer, Daniel Dyer calls Under the Dome \\"a massive cautionary novel\\", saying it is \\"busy, ambitious, overlong but addictively munchable, [and] fundamentally a novel about human cruelty, animated by our desires for power, pleasure and sex.\\" USA Today called the novel \\"propulsively intriguing\\", \\"staggeringly addictive\\", and stated that \\"Readers can wallow in this glorious novel's metaphoric and oh-so au courant messages about U.S. domination, freedom of the press, torture and environmental abuse, but they also can come to this novel just for the story.\\" The Los Angeles Times called Under the Dome \\"impressive\\", containing \\"lucid prose and chilling precision.\\" Janet Maslin's review for the New York Times said that Under the Dome \\"has the scope and flavor of literary Americana.\\" Maslin says, \\"Hard as this thing is to hoist, it's even harder to put down.\\" Ted Anthony of The Associated Press states that \\"Under the Dome is one of those works of fiction that manages to be both pulp and high art, that successfully‚Äîand very improbably‚Äîcaptures the national zeitgeist at this particularly strange and breathless period in American history.\\" On November 9, 2009, the author Neil Gaiman in his blog stated that \\"Under the Dome was one of [his] favourite books of the year so far.\\" James Parker of the New York Times noted in his review of Under the Dome that the novel contains lines that are \\"stinkers\\", which made him feel \\"the clutch of sorrow.\\" Regarding King's \\"pulp speed\\" output, James Parker noted: \\"We shouldn‚Äôt be too squeamish about the odd half-baked simile or lapse into B-movie dialogue.\\" The review in the New York Post states that Under the Dome \\"shares some of The Stand‚Äôs faults, like a left-field disaster [...] that works almost as a Diabolus Ex Machina, randomly wiping out half the cast. In both novels, the climactic \\"battle\\"‚Äîif you can really call it that‚Äîpales to the buildup. King is better at characters and situations than causes and reasons. But at least The Stand feels like a saga [...]. I won't reveal the secret of the Dome, except to say that the payoff is more Star Trek (original series) than epic.\\" John Dugdale, in a review for The Sunday Times wrote: \\"King's inability to raise his game‚Äîto relinquish the methods of his more straightforward tales of the paranormal‚Äîprevents you taking his socio- political vision seriously. The simple division of characters into goodies and baddies, the use of magic, the homespun style, the sentimental ending, the vital role played by a dog in defeating the forces of evil‚Äîall of these belong in fiction for older children, not the grown-up novels he's bent on emulating.\\" Television adaptation Shortly after the release of the book, it was announced that Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Television would be developing a cable miniseries based on the novel. Spielberg and King were announced as executive producers. Brian K. Vaughan was hired to adapt the book. Vaughan wrote the first episode, which was directed by Niels Arden Oplev.

The article contains a limited exception for the cases of lawful executions and sets out strictly controlled circumstances in which the deprivation of life may be justified. The exemption for the case of lawful executions has been subsequently further restricted by Protocols 6 (restriction of the death penalty to war time) and 13 (abolition of the death penalty), for those parties who are also parties to those protocols. The European Court of Human Rights has commented that \\"Article 2 ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention\\".McCann & Others v UK - 21 EHRR 97 The obligations on a State under Article 2 consist of three principal aspects: the duty to refrain from unlawful deprivation of life; the duty to investigate suspicious deaths; and in certain circumstances, a positive obligation to take steps to prevent avoidable losses of life. Deprivation of life The first, and most obvious obligation under article 2 is for the state, through its agents, to refrain from itself causing the deprivation of life, that is to say that domestic law must regulate the permissible use of lethal force by agents of the state. The court first considered the obligations imposed by Article 2 in the case of McCann and Others v United Kingdom brought by the relatives of three individuals shot by members of the SAS in Gibraltar. This case imposes two obligations to the State: # To conduct a full, open and transparent investigations into why the public bodies have taken a life. This should be public, independent and should involve members of the family of the victims (R (Amin) v S.O.S. Home Dept) # A positive duty to refrain from unlawful killing, better expressed as the \\"Duty of command, control and training\\" i.e. to ensure those who take the life (such as police marksmen) are highly trained and overseen at all times. If the state has not followed these obligations then it will be found to be an unlawful killing. Further reading of cases on the matter include: Kelly and Others v UK; Osman v UK; McKerr v UK; Jordan v UK; Shanaghan v UK; and R(Amin) v SOS Home Dept itself. Positive duty to protect life in certain circumstances Article 2 has been interpreted to include the positive obligation of the state to ensure preventive measures are taken to protect citizens. The leading case on the matter is Osman v UK which overruled the UK court's decision in Hill v West Yorkshire as to the fact that public bodies could not be held to be negligent. Some cases establish further obligations for states; for instance, LCB v UK establishes a positive obligation for states to take \\"appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within their jurisdiction.\\" Likewise, Makaratzis v Greece pushes these obligations further, so that the state must have mechanisms to deter offenses against people. This was initially applied to the use of firearms; although the court recognized the defensive benefits in gun ownership, it found a much larger threat in unchecked gun use. Duty to investigate suspicious deaths The investigation must be effective, independent and prompt. The duty to investigate is even stronger where the death has occurred whilst a person was detained by the state. The leading authority on this is Salman v Turkey (2000). The judgement states that: Use of force and exceptions in paragraph 2 This constitutes the negative obligation of the state under the convention. The states must under article 3 refrain from any random deprivation of life. This article however offers states a few exceptions to that rule. This constitutes a license to use force and is not to be construed as a license to kill. The exceptions are well defined and are subject to a very narrow interpretation by the Court. The states may use only necessary amounts of force: * in defence of any person from unlawful violence; * in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; * in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection. There are three conditions set by the court: # The use of force must be absolutely necessary; # It must be in defence of a third party; # It must be subject to a proper and effective investigation which is both impartial and independent. Key rulings in this matter are McCann and Others v United Kingdom, Makaratzis v Greece, and Nachova and others v Bulgaria. Beginning of life In 1980, the Court ruled out the foetal right to sue the mother carrying the foetus. In Paton v. United Kingdom, it was decided that the life of the foetus is \\"intimately connected with, and cannot be regarded in isolation from, the life of the pregnant woman\\". (Paton v United Kingdom (1981) 3 EHHR 408 at para 19) The key ruling was Vo v France where the court ruled that due to lack of consensus over the matter in the member states, the court allows a margin of appreciation (usually reserved only for the derogable rights) to each state to determine whether a foetus falls under the protection of article 2. The court, as it usually does in such unsettled matters, refrained from clarifying the issue further. End of life Ocalan v Turkey Case law ;1. Legal and administrative framework :a. Requirement for laws prohibiting the taking of life. :b. Euthanasia, pretty much left to the margin of appreciation. :c. No right to die as stated in Pretty v UK 2000. :d. Amnesties of criminals ‚Äì Dujardin v France 1991 ‚Äì an amnesty is not a breach unless it is part of a systematic effort to prevent prosecution and punishment for murder... :e. Regulation of activities posing risk to life ‚Äì Nachova v Bulgaria; MP were allowed to use lethal force when arresting military personnel. :- Oneryildiz v Turkey ‚Äì dangerous industrial activity must be regulated and licensed and monitored. ;2. Law enforcement machinery * Calvelli and Ciglio v Italy 2002 ‚Äì Police delay in investigation meant time restrictions is taking civil action against negligent doctor, thus there was a breach on the part of the state for its failure to properly investigate. * Vo v France 2004 ‚Äì Involuntary abortion by a doctor, NO breach because the law did not encompass a 21-week-old foetus, whilst an amnesty applied to the other offense. FURTHER, the victim had recourse to civil litigation, which was deemed sufficient. =Preventive measures to protect life= * LBC v UK ‚Äì‚Äòappropriate steps‚Äô to protect life principle... LCB had leukaemia, which she blamed on her father's presence at nuclear testing site, the UK had failed to inform them of the risks...held, and there was No liability because the injuries complained of were not reasonably foreseeable at the time with the information they had. * Oneryildiz v Turkey, the LCB obligation to take appropriate steps applies in the context of any activity, public or private in which the right to life is at risk...especially industrial activities dangerous by nature. Authorities knew or ought to have known of the risks and should have taken measures, which they did not thus breaching Article 3. The LBC obligation applies more commonly to criminal cases. In Osman v UK 1998 ‚Äì THE OSMAN OBLIGATION: there is a certain well defined circumstance of a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual‚Äô provided the follow requirements are satisfied; # The authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of individuals from criminal acts of a third party and; # Failed to take measures within the scope of their power which, judged reasonable, might have been expected to avoid that risk. The osman criteria in action; * Gongadez v Ukraine 2005 ‚Äì The Court found a breach of the duty to take preventive measures when they did nothing to prosecute the murders police officers for a killing of an anti-government critic * Akkoc v Turkey ‚Äì failure by the authorities to take any steps against those threatening to kill my akkoc breached the osman criteria due to the specific nature of the threats and the fact that the authorities were well aware of them after petition. The OSMAN obligation also applies to persons in detention * Edward v UK 2001 ‚Äì a prisoner killed by his cell mate who was mentally ill. Failure to pass on information regarding murderers state of mind and also failure to take any steps to protect Edward. In detention cases, there is a very high burden of proof put on the state to show they took reasonable steps to protect prisoner in their custody. * Kenaan v UK 2001 ‚Äì suicidal prisoners must also be watched and preventive steps taken for their care. * Saoud v France 2007 ‚Äì a mentally ill person died whilst being arrested. Extreme force was used to pin him down for 30 minutes which caused his death by asphyxiation, the technique used was known to be dangerous and no test was done on him despite the presence of a doctor. Torkel Opsahl suggests in his book 'European System', that there is no positive duty to force someone to live, but rather to provide the essentials for it, food and water, no more. Health care and social services Cyprus v Turkey 2001 ‚Äì An obligation for health care exists to an undefined degree, at least it is a breach to deny it when offering it to general population. Article 1 obligation to secure convention Rights and Article 3 obligation as set out in LCB to take 'appropriate steps' to protect life thus combine to create a general duty to investigate unnatural deaths for the purposes of creating accountability and deterring the breach of Article to right to life. The Obligation to investigate is a general obligation for deaths, such as McCann v UK killings by government agents, Private killings such as Menson v UK and deaths caused by known persons such as Togcu v Turkey, Kyay Turkey, Yasa v Turkey, etc. These investigations need not be criminal investigations depending on the circumstances. For example, the case of Powell v UK showed that disciplinary investigations of professional may be sufficient. McCann v UK inquest held also satisfied the investigation requirement provided it is fair and impartial. Nachova v Bulgaria shows that the state has a positive obligation to investigate death upon becoming aware of it, as opposed to receiving a complaint by family members. Yasa v Turkey shows that a State of emergency DOES NOT excuse the obligation to investigate deaths. Hugh Jordan v UK - The investigation can vary so long as it meets the strict requirements of effectiveness. Effectiveness thus creates certain criteria to be followed: # Investigators must be 'independent and impartial both at law and in practice'. Nachova v Bulgaria also requires good impartial conclusion based on evidence. Ergi v Turkey - There was a breach because the investigators relied solely on evidence provided by the police who were being investigated. Ramsahai v Netherlands - Evidence provided by the colleagues of those being investigated does not satisfy the requirements for impartial investigations even as in the case of Jordan v UK, the colleagues where supervised by independent body. # Jordan v UK - investigation must be adequate, adequacy requires the investigation to show the cause of death and find those responsible for it. # Jordan v UK - investigation must be fast and reasonably expedient. # McKerr v UK - must allow for public scrutiny and provide punishments that would deter others, Oneryildiz v Turkey - Methane explosion in refuse tip caused a landslide which killed dozens of people living in a slum. The investigation found only 2 mayors to bear any responsibility who were given suspended sentences and the minimum statutory fine just under 10 euros. this was held by the court to fail in its requirement to allow public scrutiny and deter others. # as in Jordan, Legal Aid may also need to be provided. =Abortion cases= Article 3 does not recognize an absolute right to life, in abortion cases there is a wide margin of appreciation because of the lack of consensus in Europe. * X v UK - abortion of 10-week-old fetus to protect physical and mental health of women was not a breach. * H v Norway - abortion of 12-week- old fetus for social reasons, to prevent putting the women in a 'difficult situation in life (literal interpretation of Norwegian statute)' was NOT A BREACH, again due to lack of consensus in Europe on the issue of abortion. The case was brought by the expectant father who did not want the abortion carried out. * Vo v France - abortion done as a result of mistaken name and thus medical negligence. The Court did not consider the right to life issue, rather stating that civil remedies where available and thus that satisfied the requirement for legal and administrative framework as set out in LBC. *Evans v UK - same margin of appreciation doctrine as in VO, with specific reference to lack of European consensus thus necessitating a wide margin or appreciation. the ECHR cannot impose requirements, rather it protects minimum rights common to all the signatory states. =Taking life by force of arms= The taking of life by state agents is strictly prohibited except for exceptional circumstances, whilst private killings require investigation and legal and administrative protection. Makaratzis v Greece - Car chase by police, lead to them shooting wildly at the car. No death resulted but there was found to be liability as the nature of the incident could have been lethal, thus the inadequacy of planning and conduct of the officers constituted a breach. Killings by state agents are notoriously difficult to prove in many situations. In cases where a person is taken into custody, and dies, it is for the state to show how he died as was the case in Salman v Turkey. Demiray v Turkey - The explanation must be satisfactory. Akkoc v Turkey - Killing by suspected state agent. State refused to support investigation and provide evidence, thus the court turned the burden of proof on the state to justify with holding information. Estimarov v Russia - Reasons must be provided for the killing of the suspect. The Burden of Proof issue is a difficult one which is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the court finds breaches in failures to investigate. Thus is a death occurs the state is obligated to investigate it which it is unlikely to do where one of its agents is responsible, thus there is a breach. The investigation must also be effective as in Jordan v UK. In other words, the state is caught between a rock and hard place. In cases where persons have been detained by security forces and have subsequently disappeared the court has stated that two criteria must be satisfied: # it must be shown beyond reasonable doubt that the missing person was detained by security forces or state agents. # there must be 'sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, on which it may be concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the person is dead' Cakici v Turkey. If these requirements are met, the burden of proof turns to the state to explain what has happened to the person. The main problem here is that there is often no record of arrest, and further no way of obtaining circumstantial evidence. Kurt v Turkey - the son of the applicant was arrested by security forces. The state claimed the person had instead left with rebel fighters. The court had little evidence to show where the son had been taken and what happened to him. he had been missing for 4 and a half years. the court refused to recognize that the arrest by the security forces was in its context life-threatening and thus refused to shift the burden onto the state. * Timurtas v Turkey - applicant son arrest by security forces but unlike Kurt, he was taken to an identifiable location and was seen by other detainees in the facility for months. There was also an operational report shown to the court but was contested by the State. the court requested the state provide evidence to support its claims that the operational report was fake, the state refused on security grounds. thus the court turned the burden of proof on the state in order to show what had happened to the missing detainee and subsequently found a breach of article 3. The case is distinguished from Kurt because the applicant was missing for 6 years. further in the context of south east turkey, persons arrested on suspicion of having links to PKK rebels were shown in other cases such as Kaya, Yasa Kilic etc. to be life-threatening. The abducted person was suspected of these link. thus the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to turn the burden of proof. The requirement for circumstantial evidence DECREASES with the number of years the missing person is unaccounted for. Provided he was detained by the state. * Cyprus v Turkey - The court was not ready to presume death for 1700 civilians that disappeared when the north was invaded. * Baysayeva v Russia - This case totally discarded Kurt and went further than Timurtas in that there was NO circumstantial evidence to presume death. The Court simply relied on the fact that the abduction had been by unidentified state agents in uniform. there was no record of arrest and a procedural failure to investigate thus it was accepted that the arrest was life-threatening in the circumstances. =Permitted Killings Cases= Capital Punishment is effectively non existent in the signatory states. All states aside from Russia are signatories to Protocol 6 which bans death penalties in peace time. Further many states are signatories to Protocol 13 which bans it out right. Russia, although not being a signatory to either protocol has an effective moratorium on the death penalty. The main issue here then is extradition to countries where the person life is at risk. * Oscalan v Turkey - PKK leader arrest in Kenya, sentenced to death in Turkey. Had his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. At the time however, Turkey was in the process of signing protocol 6, thus there were genuine fears that due to his status and public opinion as well as political pressures he may be executed. The court found that there had been a breach of Article 6, unfair trial, thus to sentence him to death would be a Breach of Article 3. * Soering v UK - also demonstrates how the Courts ineffectively use Article 3 to prohibit death sentences in the context of extradition. However the court did recognize Death Row Syndrome, in which psychological distress is caused while awaiting execution. Thus it is a breach of article 3 to sentence one to death, but death row syndrome itself does not constitute inhuman treatment. =Death from Permitted Use of force= *McCann and Others v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 97 - shows us that force applied must be no more than 'absolutely necessary' meaning that it must be STRICTLY PROPORTIONATE' to the achieve the permitted purpose. This goes beyond proportionality as we find it in article 8 and others. it is extremely strict with no margin of appreciation afforded. the court simply construes facts as they are and reaches an impartial assessment. Micheal O'Boyle says that the situation regarding shootings must be judged with the facts of the situation at the time and not ex post facto. this has also been a criticism of Dissenting judges in McCann v UK, who stated that the courts should be wary of the benefits of hind sight in their finding of a breach of article 3 on the case. The use of deadly force must be lawful at a national level. C v Belgium, Kelly v UK, Stewart v UK and MUST meet the requirements of Lawfulness as set out in Article 5 and the case of Bozano v France thus meeting the rule of law requirement as expected in a democratic society so as to allow the citizens to conduct their lives accordingly as stated in Sunday times v UK. =Defence of oneself or of another= Firstly, shootings in defence of property is not allowed. The signatory states did not incorporate the 4th derogation of shooting to stop access to certain facilities which was suggested at the time or writing the treaty. McCann v UK - soldiers did not breach article 3, they responded to a threat at the time and their response was lawful. the Breach was by the authorities in planning. firstly, they did not stop the suspects at the border which they should have. secondly, they used extremely lethal SAS soldiers who had been trained to kill and informed that the suspects had remote detonators, thus relying on false intelligence which they did not question. Andronicou and Constantinou v Cyprus- police commando's raided flat in which man was holding fianc√©e hostage. NO Breach as the soldiers firing and thus killing both persons was in self-defence and defence of the fianc√©e. there was also no procedural preach of planning as in McCann because the authorities in the circumstances acted proportionally in self-defence of the fianc√©e who was in real and immediate danger. Gul v Turkey - the raid on a flat suspected to have PKK militants was grossly disproportionate in its use of force. Isayeva v Russia- rebels entered a town of 20,000. the Russian security forces responded with artillery and aircraft fire. they made available information to the population regarding a safe passage out of the town. the court found this inadequate whilst also finding the use of such lethal force on a crowded place to be disproportionate especially in peacetime. the breach was as a result of the planners to have regard for civilian lives. Isayeva, Yosupova and Bazayeva v Russia- Air force plane reported receiving small arms fire from a convoy, and subsequently got authorization to attack. The air-to-ground missile attack killed scores of people, including the applicants' children. Subsequent investigations showed no presence of fighters in the convoy. The court rejected the state's argument of self-defence, as the use of such firepower was grossly disproportionate. Nachova v Bulgaria- it is grossly disproportionate to use lethal force to effect an arrest, as the force cannot be considered absolutely necessary, especially when the person was not posing any threat, simply running away from Military Police who wanted to arrest him for dereliction of duty. Further, the court ruled in Kelly v UK that to shoot a person when seeking to arrest them defeats the purpose of the mission, which is to bring them before a court. It also rules out any future arrest and the fact that the victim will not get a chance to defend himself in law. =Riots and insurrections= Stewart v UK - 150 people throwing missiles at a patrol of soldiers amounted to a riot. Although the court has not laid down clear criteria as to what constitutes a riot. thus the force used firing plastic bullets killing a 13-year-old boy was proportionate. Gulec v Turkey - a crowd of several thousand throwing missiles at security forces and damaging property was also deemed to be a riot. There was however a breach here as the McCann obligations still apply regarding proportionality. So the security forces had fired shots at the ground near the rioters to scare them off. Ricochet bullets had thus killed applicants son. The Breach was found in that the authorities had no provided any riot equipment to the security forces even though a state of emergency was declared thus it was expectant that violence would occur. The operation had not been planned so as to minimize risk to the civilians. X v Belgium - Police officer shot an innocent bystander in the course of a riot. He had no authorisation to use the weapon thus his actions were not lawful, therefore clear breach. *Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) See also *European Convention on Human Rights ReferencesExternal links *D.

The European Court of Human Rights has emphasized the fundamental nature of Article 3 in holding that the prohibition is made in \\"absolute terms‚Äî... irrespective of a victim's conduct\\".Chahal v. United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 413. The Court has also held that states cannot deport or extradite individuals who might be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in the recipient state.Chahal v. United Kingdom (1997) 23 EHRR 413; Soering v. United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439. The Court has further held that this provision prohibits the extradition of a person to a foreign state if they are likely to be subjected there to torture. This article has been interpreted as prohibiting a state from extraditing an individual to another state if they are likely to suffer the death penalty. This article does not, however, on its own forbid a state from imposing the death penalty within its own territory. Torture In Aksoy v. Turkey (1997) the Court found Turkey guilty of torture in 1996 in the case of a detainee who was suspended by his arms while his hands were tied behind his back.Aksoy v. Turkey (1997) 23 EHRR 553. The process was referred to by the Court as \\"Palestinian hanging\\" but more commonly known as Strappado. Selmouni v. France (2000) the Court has appeared to be more open to finding states guilty of torture ruling that since the Convention is a \\"living instrument\\", treatment which it had previously characterized as inhuman or degrading treatment might in future be regarded as torture.Selmouni v. France (2000) 29 EHRR 403 at para. 101. Inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment This provision usually applies to cases of severe police violence and poor conditions in detention. =Ireland v. United Kingdom= In Ireland v. United Kingdom (1979‚Äì1980) the Court ruled that the five techniques developed by the United Kingdom (wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink), as used against fourteen detainees in Northern Ireland by the United Kingdom were \\"inhuman and degrading\\" and breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to \\"torture\\".Ireland v. United Kingdom (1979‚Äì1980) 2 EHRR 25 at para 167. In 2014, after new information was uncovered that showed the decision to use the five techniques in Northern Ireland in 1971-1972 had been taken by British ministers, the Irish Government asked the European Court of Human Rights to review its judgement. In 2018, by six votes to one, the Court declined.ECHR revision judgment on application No. 5310/71 =Bamber Case= On 9 July 2013, UK prisoner Jeremy Bamber won an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights that whole life imprisonment (with no chance of parole) was in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Grand Chamber voted overwhelmingly in favour of the decision by 16-1, meaning that the UK government will now be forced to review 49 instances of whole life sentences. =Ataun Rojo v. Spain Case= In this case, which ran jointly with the Etxebarria Caballero v.

Mason (1832-21 April 1890) was a Glasgow merchant, who had been the MP for the constituency since the 1885 general election. He was known for having written pamphlets on political topics, such as monetary and land questions, the Anglo-French treaty of 1860 and banking in Scotland.Who's Who of British Members of Parliament, Volume II 1886-1918, edited by M. Stenton and S. Lees (Harvester Press 1978)  Candidates  Three candidates were nominated. The list below is set out in descending order of the number of votes received at the by-election. 1\\\\. The Liberal Party candidate was John Wynford Philipps (30 May 1860 - 28 March 1938). He was called to the bar of England and Wales in 1886. Philipps contested Devizes at the 1886 general election. He was MP for this seat from the by-election until he resigned in 1894. He was subsequently elected MP for Pembrokeshire at an 1898 by-election. He sat for the Welsh county until he was created the 1st Lord St Davids in 1908. He was advanced in the peerage as the 1st Viscount St Davids in 1918.(1) Craig. (2) Who Was Who, Vol. III 1929-1940 (Adam and Charles Black 1947). 2\\\\. The Conservative candidate was William Robert Bousfield (12 January 1854 - 16 July 1943), admitted to the bar of England and Wales in 1880. Bousfield was elected MP for Hackney North at a by-election in 1892 and retained that seat until he was defeated in 1906.(1) Craig. (2) Who Was Who, Vol. IV 1941-1950 (Adam and Charles Black, 3rd edition 1964). 3\\\\. Representing the Labour interest, as an Independent Labour candidate, was the Lanarkshire born (James) Keir Hardie (15 August 1856 - 26 September 1915). Hardie had a background as a manual worker, which was unusual for a political candidate in 1888. Previously some working men, with a trade union background, had been elected to Parliament as Liberal-Labour candidates but none without Liberal support. Hardie had worked as a miner. He became a trade unionist and then a journalist. At the time of the by-election he was a member of the Liberal Party, but the local Liberal Association rejected him as its candidate at the by-election. Hardie subsequently was a leading figure in the development of the Labour Party. He was elected Independent Labour MP for West Ham South in 1892 and sat until defeated in 1895. During this time he was the person who presided over the meeting which created the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893. Hardie contested Bradford East for the ILP in a by- election in 1896 and Preston at the 1900 general election for the Labour Representation Committee (LRC). He also contested and won Merthyr Tydfil in the 1900 election. The LRC was renamed the Labour Party in 1906. Hardie was the Parliamentary Labour Party Chairman (its de facto leader) from 1906 until 1908. He continued to represent Merthyr Tydfil until he died in 1915.(1) Craig.

In criminal law cases and cases to determine civil rights it protects the right to a public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal within reasonable time, the presumption of innocence, right to silence and other minimum rights for those charged in a criminal case (adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, right to the free assistance of an interpreter). Text Article 6 reads as follows. Nature The majority of Convention violations that the Court finds today are excessive delays, in violation of the \\"reasonable time\\" requirement, in civil and criminal proceedings before national courts, mostly in Italy and France. Under the \\"independent tribunal\\" requirement, the Court has ruled that military judges in Turkish state security courts are incompatible with Article 6. Another significant set of violations concerns the \\"confrontation clause\\" of Article 6 (i.e. the right to examine witnesses or have them examined). In this respect, problems of compliance with Article 6 may arise when national laws allow the use in evidence of the testimonies of absent, anonymous and vulnerable witnesses. Cases * Colozza v Italy (1985) ‚Äì \\"When domestic law permits a trial to be held notwithstanding the absence of a person 'charged with a criminal offence' who is in Mr. Colozza's position, that person should, once he becomes aware of the proceedings, be able to obtain, from a court which has heard him, a fresh determination of the merits of the charge.\\" (see also: Trial in absentia ¬ß Europe) * Heaney and McGuinness v. Ireland (2000) ‚Äì Case involving two Irish citizens imprisoned for choosing to remain silent and to use their rights not to incriminate themselves when suspected of an IRA- related terrorist act. \\"The Court ... finds that the security and public order concerns relied on by the Government cannot justify a provision which extinguishes the very essence of the applicants' rights to silence and against self-incrimination guaranteed by Article 6 ¬ß 1 of the Convention.\\" * Perez v France (2004) ‚Äì \\"the right to a fair trial holds so prominent a place in a democratic society that there can be no justification for interpreting Article 6 ¬ß 1 of the Convention restrictively\\" * Garc√≠a Ruiz v Spain (1999) ‚Äì The Court applied the fourth-instance doctrine, stating that it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Report at Garc√≠a Ruiz v Spain (Application 30544/96), ECHR 1999-I at p. 87, https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Reports_Recueil_1999-I.pdf Retrieved 30 September 2019 * Van K√ºck v Germany (2003) ‚Äì the court took the approach of considering the merits of the case and in finding a breach based on the fact that the German courts had failed to follow the Strasbourg court's approach to medical necessity on hormone replacement therapy and gender reassignment surgery. This was in line with and an expansion of the earlier ruling in Camilleri v Malta (2000) in which the courts were more willing to consider the merits of the court's decision which compromised fairness, stating that the decision had been \\"arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable\\". * Khamidov v Russia (2007) ‚Äì the court considered \\"abundant evidence\\" contradicting the finding of the national court, with the result that \\"the unreasonableness of this conclusion is so striking and palpable on the face of it\\" that the decision was \\"grossly arbitrary\\". This once again showed the court's changing stance in considering the actual merits of a case. This therefore illustrates the court is developing an appellate function as opposed to a review function. The Convention applies to contracting parties only; however, in cases where a contracting party court has to confirm the ruling of a non-contracting state, they retain a duty to act within the confines of article 6. Such was the case in Pellegrini v Italy (2001), a case concerning the application of a Vatican ecclesiastical court ruling on a divorce case. In the determination of criminal charges, Engel v Netherlands set out three criteria to determine meaning of \\"criminal\\": a) the classification of the offense in the law of the respondent state, b) the nature of the offence, c) the possible punishment. Funke v France states that if the contracting state classifies the act as criminal, then it is automatically so for the purposes of article 6. * John Murray v United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 29 * Benthem v Netherlands (ECtHR October 23, 1985) * Assanidze v.

Early life A native of Tainan, Yen stationed in the Kaei Public School (Kaei K≈çgakk≈ç) after graduating from the Tainan Teachers‚Äô Training School (Âè∞ÂçóÂ∑ûÊïôÂì°È§äÊàêÊâÄ) in 1918. He went to Japan in 1920, and was admitted into the Western Painting Division of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts two years later. By 1927, he entered graduate school at the same institute to study under Fujishima Takeji, Okada Saburousuke, and Wada Eisaku. He returned to Taiwan in 1929 and held a solo exhibition to raise funds for further studies in Paris. By introduction, he studied under Kees Van Dongen (1877~1968) at the Acad√©mie d‚ÄôArt Moderne. While studying in France, he applied for permission from the Louvre to copy famous works by artists such as Titian (1488~1576) and Ingres (1780~1867), and his work was selected into the Salon d‚ÄôAutomne in 1931. Work and Public Life However, he became afflicted with hepatitis as a result of overwork and poor nutrition. In order to recover, he returned to Taiwan in October 1932. In 1934, he and other artists, such as Tan Ting-pho, founded the Tai-Yang Art Society (Ëá∫ÈôΩÁæéË°ìÂçîÊúÉ). Starting in 1936, Yen devoted himself to the promotion of arts and crafts. In 1941, he and other artists, including Zhang Wanchuan (ÂºµËê¨ÂÇ≥) and Chen Dewang (Èô≥Âæ∑Êó∫), founded the Taiwan Plastic Arts Society (Âè∞ÁÅ£ÈÄ†ÂΩ¢ÁæéË°ìÂçîÊúÉ). He also devoted himself to the pursuit of art and craft skills, such as straw basket weaving and bamboo-processing work. Over the course of his life, he taught at Taiwan Provincial Tainan Junior College of Technology (Âè∞ÂçóÂ∑•Ê•≠Â∞àÈñÄÂ≠∏Ê†°; today‚Äôs National Cheng Kung University), National Taiwan Academy of Arts (today‚Äôs National Taiwan University of Arts), Private Tainan School of Home Economics, and Shih Chien School of Home Economics (today‚Äôs Shih Chien University). In addition, he also wrote the book Taiwan‚Äôs Arts and Crafts (1952). Although his focus shifted to arts and crafts, Yen continued to produce oil paintings as well. His paintings are in a realist style, with succinctly formed objects in strong and contrasting warm colors. The dominant themes of his works include still lifes, landscapes, and figures. A series of his works with Orchid Island as their primary theme were especially famous. Yan Shui-long also worked in advertisement design. Between 1933 and 1940, he painted commercial advertisements for Osaka Smoca Tooth Powder Company. These works were later collected in a series that became a classic exemplar of Japanese advertising design in the 1930s. Contributions to art Yami girl, Girl from Orchid Island (Á¥ÖÈ†≠Â∂º‰πãÂ®ò), drawn by Yen Shui-long in 1936 Aside from his advertisement designs, Yen Shui-long left behind many mosaic works. One of the most famous mosaics was his From Agricultural to Industrial Society at Jiantan Park. His work Sunflower can also be found on the walls of the Taiyang Tang Bakery in Taichung. In addition, Yen accepted a commission to help with the beautification of Taipei City landmarks such as Zhongshan Hall and the fa√ßade of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which set a precedent for Taiwanese public art and landscape design. Between 1933 and 1944, he returned to Japan, worked on advertising design and applied arts. Yen resided in Taiwan again later, and became a teacher of Tainan Technical College (now National Cheng Kung University). Yen made a series of mosaic art works after 1961. And he also created many art works that contain some motifs about Taiwanese aborigines. In 1984, Yen resigned from Shih Chien College of Home Economics (now Shih Chien University). In his old age, Yen worked mainly on painting, drawing, other visual arts and his personal exhibitions. He worked long hours to prepare for a 1997 retrospective meant to celebrate his 95th birthday. While working, he slipped and fell in a bathroom, resulting in a bone fracture that required surgery. Yen died of surgical complications before work for the planned exhibition was completed.

Dutch career After finishing his MA in Cultural Sciences Micha Wertheim moved to Amsterdam and started working as a freelance radio producer, writer and comedian. He became a member of the Amsterdam based Dutch comedy collective Comedytrain in 1998. Playing regularly in Amsterdam comedy theatre Toomler he developed rapidly, and soon after won first prize in the prestigious ‚Äò‚ÄôLeids Cabaret Festival‚Äô‚Äô (Comedy Festival in the Dutch town of Leiden). This award resulted in his first one man show in 2005 that was received well and, like al his following shows was broadcast on Dutch National television. Off stage Wertheim writes a weekly satire for Vrij Nederland magazine. International career Since 2001 Micha started performing in English. First in London (2001) later in New York (2003), but the real start of his international career was his performance as a compare of the Amsterdam Underground Comedy Collective a sell out show at the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He was very well received and invited back to Britain where he performed in The Comedy Store and for three weeks opening for Dutch Comedian Hans Teeuwen in the West Ends Soho Theatre. In 2008 Wertheim and Hans Teeuwen returned to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival together to perform their one-man shows in de Pleasance dome. The shows were well received and Wertheim was invited to perform spots at several London comedy clubs an asked to bring his one-man show to London‚Äôs Battersea Arts Center. In 2010 Wertheim took part in the New York International Fringe Festival where his show \\"Amsterdam Abortion Survivor\\" became the first International act to be awarded an extension as part of the best of Fringe Encore Series. Style Wertheim‚Äôs one-man shows distinguish themselves from conventional stand-up by being more theatrical and having a narrative. British Comedy website http://www.chortle.co.uk/ called Micha Wertheim \\"on the edge, highly intelligent, as ironic as any Brit could be and not for the easily offended.\\" [2] Controversy Micha Wertheim has always maintained he wants just to entertain people, not to stir controversy. Yet by choosing controversial topics such as euthanasia, abortion and xenophobia, Wertheim has always divided his audiences. On 11 March 2008 Micha made headlines in the Dutch National news after ending a show in Roermond (Limburg) prematurely. In that show Wertheim addressed the contemporary revival of Dutch xenophobia (Geert Wilders) by redirecting xenophobia to the handicapped community. Asserting that handicapped are parasites that refuse to adapt to the western way of life. A group of audience members turned against Wertheim when he addressed a man who he thought was using his cell phone, but was in fact using the display of his wheel chair. Wertheim apologized and proceeded with his show telling the audience that the only way to deal with handicapped is through zero tolerance adding he had just released a video explaining the treat imposed by the handicapped towards western liberalism. It was a reference to the film FITNA that was released among big controversy that exact week. When the handicapped man left the room a part of the audience turned against Wertheim, leaving him no choice than to leave the stage. Immediately after, the theatre reacted by saying that Wertheim would never again be welcome in their venue. On this, some of the Netherlands' most respected comedians, among whom Theo Maassen, Eric van Sauers and Ronald Goedemondt, decided they would not perform in that venue again. Story Telling In 2008, inspired by The Moth, Micha Wertheim initiated Echt Gebeurd a monthly story telling event in Amsterdam. Publications Micha Wertheim writes a weekly satire for one of Holland‚Äôs leading magazines Vrij Nederland, was a regular contributor to the Dutch version of ‚Äò‚ÄôHave I Got News for You‚Äô‚Äô and is a freelance radio producer for Dutch Public Radio.

As such he was in familiar contact with Benedictine monasteries in Austria and Germany. Hebert also had contacts with artists and with Protestant circles in Switzerland and with the high church Lutheran movement in Sweden. He was very much aware of the social implications of liturgical renewal in Continental Europe. Many mistakenly read his surname as Herbert. Notice the 'r' before the 'b'. But his actual surname is Hebert, with only one 'r', which is before the 't'. This is most likely due to the fact that \\"Herbert\\" is a well-known name while Hebert is relatively unknown, and the brain makes a quick, though in this case erroneous, judgement. Both the modern editions from SPCK and Wipf & Stock, which have been on sale for years now, have made this error on their Amazon pages and websites, though the actual publications themselves still retain the correct spelling. Hebert was in some respects a disciple of Gregory Dix.

For example, a given page may have k choices for the title, m choices for the featured image or graphic, and n choices for the company logo. This example yields k√óm√ón landing page configurations. The first application of an experimental design for MVLPO was performed by Moskowitz Jacobs Inc. in 1998 as a simulation/demonstration project for LEGO. MVLPO did not become a mainstream approach until 2003 or 2004. Multivariate landing page optimization can be executed in a live (production) environment, or through simulations and market research surveys.  Overview  Multivariate landing page optimization is based on experimental design (e.g., discrete choice, conjoint analysis, Taguchi methods, IDDEA, etc.), which tests a structured combination of webpage elements. Some vendors (e.g., Memetrics.com) use a \\"full factorial\\" approach, which tests all possible combinations of elements. This approach requires a smaller sample size‚Äîtypically, many thousands‚Äîthan traditional fractional Taguchi designs to achieve statistical significance. This quality is one reason that choice modeling won the Nobel Prize in 2000. Fractional designs typically used in simulation environments require the testing of small subsets of possible combinations, and have a higher margin of error. Some critics of the approach question the possible interactions between the elements of the webpages, and the inability of most fractional designs to address this issue. To resolve the limitations of fractional designs, an advanced simulation method based on the Rule Developing Experimentation (RDE) paradigm was introduced. RDE creates individual models for each respondent, discovers any and all synergies and suppressions among the elements,Alex Gofman. 2006. Emergent Scenarios, Synergies, And Suppressions Uncovered within Conjoint Analysis. Journal of Sensory Studies, 21(4): 373-414. uncovers attitudinal segmentation, and allows for databasing across tests and over time.  Live environment execution  In live environment MVLPO execution, a special tool makes dynamic changes to a page so that visitors are directed to different executions of landing pages created according to an experimental design. The system keeps track of the visitors and their behavior‚Äîincluding their conversion rate, time spent on the page, etc. Once sufficient data has accumulated, the system estimates the impact of individual components on the target measurement (e.g., conversion rate). Live environment execution has the following advantages: * Capable of testing the effect of variations as a real-life experience * Generally transparent to visitors * Relatively simple and inexpensive to execute Live environment execution has the following disadvantages: * High cost * Increased complexity involved in modifying a production-level website * Long period of time required to achieve statistically reliable data. This situation is due to variations in the amount of traffic that generates the data necessary for a decision. * Likely inappropriate for low-traffic, high- importance websites when the site administrators do not want to lose any potential customers  Simulation (survey) execution  In simulation (survey) MVLPO execution, the foundation consists of advanced market research techniques. In the research phase, the respondents are directed to a survey that presents them with a set of experimentally designed combinations of a landing page. The respondents rate each version based on some factor (e.g., purchase intent). At the end of the research phase, regression analysis models are created either for individual pages or for the entire panel of pages. The outcome relates the presence or absence of page elements on the different landing page executions to the respondents‚Äô ratings. These results can be used to synthesize new landing pages as combinations of the top-scoring elements optimized for subgroups or market segments, with or without interactions.Alex Gofman, Howard Moskowitz, and Tonis Mets. 2009. Integrating Science into Web Design: Consumer Driven Website Optimization. The Journal of Consumer Marketing, 26(4): 286-298. . Simulation execution has the following advantages: * Faster and easier to prepare and execute in many cases, as compared to live environment execution * Applicable to low-traffic websites * Capable of producing more robust and rich data because of increased control over the page design Simulation execution has the following disadvantages: * Possible bias because of a simulated environment rather than a live environment. * Necessity to recruit and optionally incentivize the respondents  References  Category:Search engine optimization Category:Market research ","title":"Multivariate landing page optimization"},{"id":"18042619","text":"Scientific research model of the earth by Carl Anton Bjerknes. Technical Museum, Oslo. Cabinet photo of Carl Anton Bjerknes in 1883 Wilhelmine Dorothea Koren Bjerknes, wife of Carl Anton Bjerknes Carl Anton Bjerknes (; 24 October 1825 ‚Äì 20 March 1903) was a Norwegian mathematician and physicist. Bjerknes' earlier work was in pure mathematics, but he is principally known for his studies in hydrodynamics.Carl Anton Bjerknes (Karen Mathilde Haugland. Store norske leksikon) Biography Carl Anton Bjerknes was born in Oslo, Norway. His father was Abraham Isaksen Bjerknes and his mother Elen Birgitte Holmen. Bjerknes studied mining at the University of Oslo, and after that mathematics at the University of G√∂ttingen and the University of Paris. In 1866 he held a chair for applied mathematics and in 1869 for mathematics. Over a fifty-year time period, Bjerknes taught mathematics at the University of Oslo and at the military college. A pupil of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Gabriel Lam√© and Augustin-Louis Cauchy Bjerknes worked for the rest of his life in the field of hydrodynamics. He tried to explain the electrodynamics of James Clerk Maxwell by hydrodynamical analogies and similarly he proposed a mechanical explanation of gravitation. Although he did not succeed in his attempts to explain all those things, his findings in the field of hydrodynamics were important. His experiments were shown at the first International Exposition of Electricity in Paris that ran from August 15, 1881 through to November 15, 1881 at the Palais de l'Industrie on the Champs-√âlys√©es and at the Scandinavian naturalist meeting in Stockholm. John Charles Fields the founder of the Fields Medal for outstanding achievement in mathematics had this to say about the great minds that Norway had produced since it gained independence: International Exposition of Electricity (W)hen at the 1881 Paris International Electric Exhibition, he (Carl Anton) and his son (Vilhelm Bjerknes), demonstrated instruments that reproduced hydrodynamic analogies, few observers could ignore these baffling phenomena. Such celebrities as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the Siemens brothers, and the Marquis of Salisbury visited the small Norwegian exhibit booth and watched with amazement as a system of pulsating spheres and similar devices appeared to reproduce well-known electric and magnetic phenomena. For many observers the Bjerknes apparatus seemed to illustrate that the mysterious nature of electricity could perhaps be revealed. British observers allegedly exclaimed, \\"Maxwell should have seen this!\\" Of the eleven dipl√¥mes d'honneur, seven went to non-French exhibitors, including Werner Siemens, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and William Thomson. Professor Carl Anton Bjerknes, representing Norway, joined their ranks.Appropriating the Weather: Vilhelm Bjerknes and the Construction of a Modern Meteorology, Robert Marc Friedman, Nov 1, 1993 Family On June 30, 1859, after returning from his foreign travels, Bjerknes married Wilhelmine Dorothea Koren (10.11.1837‚Äì21.10.1923) whose father was a minister in the Church in West Norway. His son Norwegian physicist and meteorologist, Vilhelm Bjerknes continued the work of his father. Death Bjerknes died suddenly of a stroke on 20 March 1903 at the age of 77.\\"To some it may appear strange that the son of C. A. Bjerknes should have been chosen to deliver the commemorative address summing up the life-work of his father. As a matter of fact, however, no other choice could have been made. In his scientific research Bjerknes worked apart from others. His only confidant and colleague was his son. So in the monograph before us the son, after sketching his father's early life, traces step by step the development of the Hydrodynamic Action at a Distance from the days when its author was a pupil under Cauchy, Lam√©, and Dirichlet until the last manuscript, written two or three days before his sudden death by apoplexy. Bjerknes left about 40,000 pages of closely written manuscript, accumulated since the early seventies. So great was his love of perfection, his striving for quality rather than quantity that little of all this had been published until the appearance of the Hydrodynamische Fernkr√¢fte and that which remains is accompanied by a request that nothing be printed without the most careful revision. It is a rare and noble sight to see men like Josiah Willard Gibbs and Bjerknes who are possessed of a spirit of research apart from the common desire to rush into print.\\" ‚ÄîEdmund Beecher Wilson, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol.X, October 1903 to July 1904 Selected works * Niels Henrik Abel.

She has been awarded Fellowships by the Swedish Research Council, Arts Council of Englad, British Council amongst others. She has also been a recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Award in 2016 and the recipient of the highly coveted MAP Funding (USA) award in 2019, among other awards and recognitions.  Career and Activities  Since 2016 S√°nchez-Colberg moves fully into non-stage multidisciplinary/cross-arts works based on experimentation with generative compositional rules to create new forms of collaborative and participatory contemporary art. The works defy categorization as they bring together elements of fine and visual art, audio composition, movement, photography and film, live documentation in works that question the relationship between art institutions, the ‚Äòart-object‚Äô and the subjects involved in the creation and reception. Her current portfolio can be seen at www.anasanchezcolberg.com Her most recent project Love Letters to Ana has been selected for inclusion in the exhibition Coantivirus curated by NY20+ Nongyuan Culture in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. From there it will move to be part of the permanent collection of the channel SVOX.TV Film and Video Arts. The video series is a collaborations between nine international artists during the nine-week period of 'heavy lockdown' in the city of Athens. Ana is the lead artist who invited artists in 'lockdown cities' (from Seoul to Beijing, to Bangkok, Rome, Milan, San Antonio, to name some) to send her an audio 'love letter'. This love letter was used as an audio-score to 'go on a walk' (a poetic slightly ironic variation on the museum audio walk) in the conditions of 'containment'. The letters serve as a cross-border reflection on the shared and distinct conditions of 'lockdown' as well as an exercise in 'recuperation' amidst the loss. In February 2020 she was artists mentor for the project Grass Stains in Miami, Fl, an initiative of Pioneer Winter Collective. This gathering of twenty-two creators worked under the mentorship and facilitation of S√°nchez-Colberg, in a laboratory setting over the course of one week. The MDC Live Arts Lab surrounding MDC Wolfson Campus (Building 1) hosted the artists. The final event curated by S√°nchez-Colberg can be viewed at https://vimeo.com/395733654. In 2019 Ana was one of 40 awardees of the prestigious MAP Awards 2019 for the creation of the project 1[-1] Materiality of Exile in collaboration with BoxoPROJECTS. The project was part of a one- month residency at Boxo HOUSE arts centre and focused on migratory histories of the Southwest desert, with a focus on the Latinx community whose identity is marked by migrations and ‚Äúcrossing‚Äù through the desert. https://mapfundblog.org/1-1-map-2019/. The archive can be seen at: https://materialityofexile.blogspot.com/ . A second strand 11.11 Materiality of [Contained] Exiles was premiered in a global on-line screening 29/31 May 2020. See https://vimeo.com/showcase/6883129. Other works include Seven to the Seventh, an unprecedented global project that connected synchronically artists and their communities across seven time zones, using mobile technology throughout seven days 24-30 June 2019. The event was made possible with the support of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. By the end of the week over 3.4k people had participated in the event either remotely through mobile platforms or at one of the multiple international sites. See https://vimeo.com/showcase/6273097 for the documentation of the Athens event. J[us]t 5 in collaboration with art curators CHEAPART.GR evolved between 2017-2018 across various contexts including the biennale Art-Athena International Arts Fair and Return to Athens Festival. The works were a series of site-responsive public interventions throughout the city of Athens. J[us]t 5 REDUX an immersive installation that ‚Äòcollected‚Äô previous events into a single locality was presented within the Athens International Festival in June 2018. The work interweaved the collected narratives of the artist as she travelled through various cities- each city bringing her back to her relationship with Athens- raising questions about art, her collaborators, immigrant identity, the challenges and possibilities of life in the city in this precise historical moment. The artist created the participatory event as well as composed the audio soundscape/ score that the public used to follow the event.http://und-athens.com/journal/ana-sanchez-colberg-just5 See https://vimeo.com/channels/570376/287799153. The project Micropolies: Invisible Cities (February ‚Äì May 2019) consisted of a series of public participatory interventions in the cities of Byblos (Lebanon), San Juan (Puerto Rico), Miami (Florida USA), Stockholm (Sweden), Athens (Greece). The project dispensed with the presence of the artist, the general public was invited to gather and ‚Äòperform‚Äô invisible solos by following an audio score (created by the artist) and a task score delivered through mobile technologies. See https://vimeo.com/showcase/6352708 The Sky Leans on Me, (me the one horizontal amongst all the verticals) created as part of the Benaki Museum, Athens Out/topias Exhibition, the largest European exhibition that year on art in public and outside spaces (see: https://vimeo.com/210896650) in November 2016. The work was an open invitation to participate in rethinking the public nature of the museum space and consider ways in which the art form is held between the artist (who opens the space) and the audience (invited to inhabit and transform it).

Artistic Research and Pedagogy  S√°nchez-Colberg is a guest teacher in dance schools and festivals and has taught in the Tanzwochen/Vienna, International Festival of Theatre in Bogota, Colombia, Helsinki Theatre Academy, University College Dance Stockholm, and the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, amongst others.http://www.theatreencorpscollectif.com She has worked at centres for dance and theatre training, including the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance (now Trinity/Laban, the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, Helsinki Theatre Academy, and most recently the University of the Arts Department of Dance and Circus in Stockholm where she has held the position of Visiting Professor of Choreography and Composition 2006‚Äì2013. She is currently Professor of Theatre at the Estonia Academy of Music and Theatre. Her publications can be accessed at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ana_Sanchez-Colberg  Work in Theatre and Performance  S√°nchez-Colberg also has a track record in work in theatre and performance. S√°nchez-Colberg holds a BA (Hons) Theatre Arts, Magna Cum Laude (with a double major in Drama Literature-20th Century ) from the University of Pennsylvania. As part of the work towards the honours, she followed an independent programme of study leading to a dissertation looking at the 'birth' of physical theatre in relation to changes to theatre and dance practices stemming from the avant-garde of the early 1900s in Europe. The work looked in detail at practitioners such as Meyerhold, Copeau, Checkhov, Lecoq, Artaud and Grotowski. The research had a practical dimension in collaboration with the physical theatre company 'Intuitions', a devised-performance based on Euripide's Bacchae for which she did the movement direction as well as played the lead role of Dyonisus. As movement director for Intuitions, she was involved in three major productions: Alice In Wonderland (1983) (based on the Andre Gregory Performance Garage text of the 1970s), Bacchae - in 84, and Buchner's Woyzzeck(1984). She has also worked with London-based Rougue 28 Theatre Company as performer and movement advisor between 2006‚Äì2008. S√°nchez- Colberg was course leader of the MA Performance Practices and Research at Central School of Speech and Drama (2005‚Äì2008), the largest conservatory of drama and theatre in the UK. The MA focusses on physical and interdisciplinary based performance. During this time she was leader of the Dramaturgy strand of the MA Advanced Theatre Practices as well as contributed to various modules in the MA Movement Direction, MA Classical Acting and MA Musical Theatre. She was also Ph D supervisor to various theatre and performance research projects ranging from interdisciplinary approaches to puppetry and dance to re- examination of Laban's work in dialogue with the philosophy of Aristotle. Her approach to movement for performance is based on Laban's principles, in particularly an understanding of the infinite possibilities of movement that are available both through the 'body's own terms' as well as in relation to working with text - devised and classical. The approach is not one that seeks to establish a movement language based on external repetition of movement patterns or effort/psychological traits, but rather one that seeks to develop the performer as an 'articulate subject' with physical, dynamic, mental and emotive dimensions all which play a role in the creation of the work. Importantly the training is organised under the framework of a 'laboratory' of movement exploration, bringing forward the idea of 'what if...' to bear upon the treatment of the materiality of the body. The emphasis is on engaging creatively in process based work whilst acquiring precise physical skills (core stability, flexibility, dynamic range, effective use of breath for movement and voice, understanding the poetics of the body-in-space and space- of-the body). However, different to the ‚Äòtradition‚Äô of ‚ÄòLaban for actors‚Äô which remain rooted in ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô and therefore addresses the actor/text/director relationship) she brings to the foreground the lesser known aspects of Laban's work and that is the study of ‚Äòmaking space‚Äô (choreutics). This angle aligns the work of the performer to the work of the scenographer/dramaturg through a consideration of how the body in motion shapes an invisible scenographic dramaturgy. The training aims to draw awareness to the dynamic and shifting design of the ‚Äòlived‚Äô space [through spatial parameters that include progression, projection, tension] created through spatial relationships between the performers to each other and simultaneously to everything that is a ‚Äòbody‚Äô on stage (in the architectural sense, everything that occupies/delineates space is a ‚Äòbody‚Äô)- props, scenography elements, light. Therefore, in training for ‚Äòmovement‚Äô the student of theatre and performance is confronted with the totality of the stage world, the training goes beyond movement as a subtext for plot and ‚Äòcharacterization‚Äô. S√°nchez-Colberg position as an expert practitioner in theatre is confirmed by the many invitations to teach at important international fora as well as the track record of external examination in the area of movement for actors -including examination of Ph D level work- at Rose Bruford College (UK), Chichester University (UK), Dartington College (UK), Brunell University (UK), University of Canterbury (UK), Helsinki Theatre Academy (FI).

It was dedicated to Scientific Humanism and carried a distinctive pale orange cover. It closed in January 1930, a victim of the Great Depression. It was founded in 1928 by the political scientist George Catlin and Major A. G. Church, then assistant editor of Nature, who became its editor. It was backed by Lord Melchett and published by Macmillan. The literary editor was the then little- known philosopher Gerald Heard. Contributors included, Arnold Bennett, H. G. Wells, Sir Richard Gregory, J. B. S. Haldane, Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, Herbert Read, Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley, Sir Frank Baines, H. J. Laski and Rebecca West. Its editorial meetings were held at the London restaurant, Kettners. The founders hoped to find a market for an intellectual monthly along similar lines to the American Harper's Magazine.
