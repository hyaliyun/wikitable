She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 22 September 1989. She departed on 22 August 1990. Emma was described as a teen punk and a tomboy. DevelopmentCreation and casting= In 1989, Young Talent Time actress Dannii Minogue was offered an audition for Home and Away. Following her return from New York City, where she was recording her first album, Minogue read for the role of Marilyn Chambers. She believed she was not right for the character and she did not win the role.Minogue 2010, p.48. However, the producers asked Minogue's manager Terry Blamey if they could write a part especially for her and they came up with Emma Jackson. Minogue wanted to accept the role, as she loved the character's personality, but she was in the middle of recording her album and was nervous about relocating to Sydney for filming.Minogue 2010, p.49. Blamey decided that she should have a short run on the show and negotiated a thirteen-week contract, with an option to extend once her album was finished. Minogue stayed with the show for a year, before she quit to launch her music career in 1990. In October 2007, it was rumoured that Minogue was due to reprise her role as Emma for the show's 20th anniversary in 2008. However, she did not appear. In 2018, Minogue stated that she would love to return for a short stint as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations. She also said she had been contacted by the producers, but added \\"If I did it, I'd want it to be short and sharp, in and out, because those schedules are huge.\\" =Characterisation= Emma was described as a punk, a \\"spunky tomboy\\" and a \\"teen rebel\\".Mercado 2004, p.256. Of her character, Minogue said \\"In the beginning, Emma was really arrogant and punk and in every scene she would slam the door when she walked in or out.\\" Storylines Emma comes to live with her aunt Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn) after attacking her stepfather, Barry. She immediately clashes with Ailsa's husband Alf (Ray Meagher). Emma attempts to buy alcohol from the local store but Alf's sister Celia (Fiona Spence) refuses her the sale as she is underage, which causes Emma to insult Celia. Emma tells Ailsa she thought she would be more fun because she had been in jail and that was why she'd asked to stay with her. Ailsa refused to admit what she had been jailed for but reminds Emma that the experience was unpleasant. They both agree to stay out of each other's way. Ailsa gives Emma a job at the Bayside Diner but she constantly winds up Ailsa's business partner Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson) Emma proves to be a lazy employee and is threatened by Bobby with the sack. She continues her feud with Celia and does little to impress principal Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn) with her attitude. Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson) invites Emma out on a date but when he tries to get close to her, she feels uncomfortable. Adam tells Emma he only went out with her for a bet, anyway. Upset, Emma takes revenge and drills holes in his raft causing it to sink in a race the next day. Emma confides in Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) that Barry abused her after her real father died when she was eight. She takes Viv Newton (Mouche Phillips) under her wing, dragging her into trouble which does not sit well with Viv's guardian, Donald, who bans Emma from seeing Viv. Emma is fired from the diner and begins attending Summer Bay High, where she organises a student rebellion against the uniform. The plan fails when Donald turns up in punk clothing himself. Emma then encourages Viv to skip school and accept a ride from two guys who drive them out to a deserted forest. The guys soon turn on the girls and nearly rape them, luckily Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Alf rescue them. Emma is grateful to Steven and is attracted to him but he clearly prefers Viv. She then passes her driving test and lets Viv drive Alf's car but Viv crashes into a car belonging to Maurice \\"Revhead\\" Gibson (Gavin Harrison) and his friend \\"Skid\\" (Chris Harding). They demand payment otherwise they will tell Alf about the crash. Bobby helps the girls stall Revhead and Skid while Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson) fix the car and they avoid payment. Emma begins a relationship with Adam but she has a momentary attraction to Grant Mitchell (Craig McLachlan) and asks him out. Grant rejects Emma as he will be starting as her new teacher. Vicki Baxter (Nana Coburn), Emma's nemesis, herself has a crush on Grant and when he rejects her, she invents a story in which Grant sexually assaulted her resulting in him being suspended. Emma applies pressure to get Vicki to change her story but every attempt backfires. Vicki does eventually confess and Grant is off the hook. Bridget (Paula Duncan), Emma's mother arrives and she is not pleased to see her and tells her to stay away. However, Bridget manages to convince her she has kicked Barry out and they begin rebuilding their relationship. Ailsa and Bridget constantly fight over Emma's welfare. Emma agrees to go back to Riverstone with her mother and bids Ailsa an emotional farewell. Several weeks later, she returns in a bad mood and is constantly rude. Emma reveals Bridget has not changed. She breaks up with Adam and begins seeing Paul Jensen (Craig Black), who writes her a song. She encounters more problems with Vicki, who steals an exam paper and frames Emma for it, getting her expelled from school. Emma is forced to attend Yabbie Creek High. She is upset when Alf and Ailsa do not believe her and is even more distraught when Paul begins hanging out with Vicki. It emerges that Paul is only seeing Vicki as part of a plan to clear Emma's name. The truth is revealed after Vicki's cousin Anna (Rebecca George) arrives at the school and tells Donald all. Vicki is expelled and Emma is reinstated but she refuses to return to school. Donald, Alf and Ailsa apologise. Shortly after Emma ends things with Paul and takes a job on the Gold Coast and leaves to become an air hostess. Reception For her portrayal of Emma, Minogue was nominated for the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress in 1989. Holy Soap named Minogue as one of Home and Away's \\"Sexiest girls ever\\".

Ringer's solution typically contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate, with the last used to balance the pH. Other additions can include chemical fuel sources for cells, including ATP and dextrose, as well as antibiotics and antifungals. Composition Ringer's solution typically contains NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and NaHCO3, sometimes with other minerals such as MgCl2, dissolved in distilled water. The precise proportions of these vary from species to species, particularly between marine osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Uses Ringer's solution is frequently used in in vitro experiments on organs or tissues, such as in vitro muscle testing. The precise mix of ions can vary depending upon the taxon, with different recipes for birds, mammals, freshwater fish, marine fish, etc. It may also be used for therapeutic purposes, such as arthroscopic lavage in the case of septic arthritis. Its clinical uses are for replacing extracellular fluid losses and restoring chemical balances when treating isotonic dehydration. History Ringer's solution is named after Sydney Ringer, who in 1882‚Äì1885 determined that a solution perfusing a frog's heart must contain sodium, potassium and calcium salts in a definite proportion if the heart is to be kept beating for long. This solution was adjusted further in the 1930s by Alexis Hartmann, who added sodium lactate to form Ringer's lactate solution.

The Tokara Islands and the northwestern group of the ≈åsumi Islands belonged to Kawanabe District of Satsuma Province. The Amami Islands paid tribute to the Ryukyu Kingdom to the South until they were put under direct control in the late 16th century, but were conquered in 1609 by the Satsuma Domain. In 1879, the Amami Islands became ≈åshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture. The Tokara Islands and the north-western group of the ≈åsumi Islands were transferred to ≈åshima District in 1897, and then to Kagoshima District in 1973. After World War II, the Tokara and Amami Islands were put under United States military occupation, which formed the Government of the Northern Ryukyus. The Japanese government fiercely contested the Amami Islands being affiliated with the word \\"Ryukyu\\", believing that it would lead to a later return of the islands to their control. The Tokara Islands were returned to Japan in 1952, which were followed by the Amami Islands in December 1953.

The area is bordered by Collins Bay on the north and west sides, Lake Ontario on the south and Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport on the east. History In 1784, Johan Jost Herkimer, a Loyalist, was granted a land allotment of 3,450 acres in the township west of the village of Cataraqui (modern-day downtown Kingston) for his service to the Crown during the American Revolutionary War. He also received two acres in the village. The township land allotment included what is now the conservation area and became known as Herkimer's Nose or Herkimer's Point. The land remained in the Herkimer family until sold to Captain William Lemoine in 1836. The Lemoine family (after which the conservation area is named) sold the land to William Hugh Coverdale as a summer vacation property. The Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority (CRCA) acquired the current conservation area land in 1975. Part of the land (35 hectares) remains as farmland belonging to the Coverdale family, although the CRCA would like to eventually acquire this land and extend the conservation area to cover all 170 hectares. Description The conservation area includes a variety of terrain, including deciduous woodlands, 2.5 km of shoreline, marshland, fields and grassy areas. Picnic tables, barbecues, and washrooms are available. There are two entrances, each with its own parking lot, at the north and south ends of the conservation area. Most trails are quite flat; several of them are wide and smooth enough to be wheelchair accessible. A variety of wildlife may be seen in the conservation area, including birds, insects, snakes, and mammals ranging from chipmunks and squirrels to deer.

Brown tried to make capital on this issue too emphasising his role as the local organiser for the Agricultural Workers‚Äô Union.The Times, 21 June 1923 p11 While Acland-Troyte also defended the government‚Äôs overall record, Francis Acland was playing up his south-western credentials and his personal qualities. The fact that the Lloyd George and Asquithian wings of the Liberal Party in the area both supported Acland and the party nationally appeared to be moving towards reunion was also offered as a factor in shoring up support for the party in the by-election.The Times, 23 June 1923 p14 Result Despite local Unionist optimism that they would be able to hold the seat, Acland got home with a majority of 403.

The war was the result of a dispute between the Republic and the Dukagjini family over the possession of the Dagnum fortress. Skanderbeg, then ally of the Dukagjini family, moved against several Venetian held towns along the Albanian coastline, in order to pressure the Venetians into restoring Dagnum. In response, the Republic sent a local force to relieve the besieged fortress of Dagnum, and urged the Ottoman Empire to send an expeditionary force into Albania. At that time the Ottomans were already besieging the fortress of Svetigrad, stretching Skanderbeg's efforts thin. However, the League of Lezh√´ defeated both the Venetian forces and the Ottoman expedition. The League won over the Venetian forces on 23 July 1448 at the gates of Scutari, and over the Ottomans three weeks later, on 14 August 1448, at the Battle of Oronichea. The Republic was, thereafter, left with few soldiers to defend Venetian Albania. As a result, the League soon signed peace with the Republic of Venice, while continuing the war against the Ottoman Empire. After the Albanian‚ÄìVenetian War of 1447‚Äì1448, Venice did not seriously challenge Skanderbeg or the League, allowing Skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against the Ottoman Empire.  Background  In 1444, Skanderbeg had managed to unite the major Albanian princes under his leadership at the League of Lezh√´, where a confederation of all the Albanian Principalities was created. Stresses within the alliance were felt, when Nicholas Dukagjini, a member of the Dukagjini family, a powerful family in northern Albania, ambushed and killed Lek√´ Zaharia Altisferi, prince of Dagnum and also League member. Since Zaharia had no children, he organized the killing to more easily gain Dagnum. The year in which Zaharia was killed is not recorded. A Venetian document dated to 4 January 1445, mentions Zaharia as the once lord of Dagnum which was given to Boxia, Zaharia's mother. The Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno says that Zaharia was killed close to the advent of the year 1445. The two princes had been in dispute over who should marry Irene Dushmani, the only daughter of Lek√´ Dushmani, prince of Zadrima. In 1445, the Albanian princes had been invited to the wedding of Skanderbeg's younger sister, Mamica, who was being married to Muzaka Thopia. Irene entered the wedding and hostilities began. Dukagjini asked Irene to marry him, but Zaharia, who was drunk, saw this, and assaulted Dukagjini. Some princes attempted to stop the fight, but only more people became involved. Several people died or got injured before peace was established. Neither of the two antagonists had suffered any physical damage, but after the event Dukagjini was morally humiliated. The death of Zaharia left his princedom with no successor. As a result, his mother handed the fortress over to Venetian Albania, a stretch of possessions of the Republic of Venice. Skanderbeg urged the Venetian legates that Dagnum (along with Sati, Gladri and Dushmani which had been taken by Venice) should be restored to the League since it guarded an important trade route, but Venice refused and, consequently, Skanderbeg prepared for war against the Republic itself. The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojeviƒá and ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. Brankoviƒá, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who was also in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, expressed his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but not against the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, refused to accept the offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and did not participate in it.  Initial campaigns  Durr√´s in 1573. In December 1447, after leaving a protective force of three to four thousand men under Vrana Konti to guard the frontier in the event of an Ottoman incursion, Skanderbeg turned towards Dagnum with a force of 14,000 men. Initially offering the garrison at Dagnum the opportunity to surrender, he promptly besieged the fortress upon rejection. In order to pressure the Venetians, Skanderbeg also turned towards Durazzo, then another possession of Venetian Albania, and cut the city off from their local resources and trade. This move forced Venice to redirect to Durazzo two galleys, which initially were bound for Crete, in order to watch over the events there. By then Venice treated Skanderbeg as a rebellious Ottoman vassal, so on 4 March 1448 a life pension of 100 gold ducats per month was offered to anyone who would assassinate Skanderbeg. In May, Ottoman forces besieged Svetigrad, putting great strain on Skanderbeg's campaigns. On 27 June 1448 Venice sent Andrea Venier, then provveditore at Scutari's Rozafa Castle, to attempt to persuade the Ottomans to invade Albania. After, Venice also sent Venier to meet with Skanderbeg in order to convince him to break off hostilities, and also attempted to push the Dukagjini clan away from their alliance with Skanderbeg. Despite measures taken by the Venetians, Skanderbeg marched towards Scutari unabated. He also dared the Venetians to send out a force to defeat him. The siege of Dagnum continued, however, with a force of 4,000 that Skanderbeg had left behind.  Battle of the River Drin and the Ottoman expedition  Rozafa Castle today. On 23 July 1448 Skanderbeg crossed the Drin River with 10,000 men, meeting a Venetian force of 15,000 men under the command of Daniele Iurichi, governor of Scutari. Venetian forces were composed largely of local mercenaries, forming the center of Iurichi's line. They included forces under Koja and Andreas Humoj, Simeon Vulkata, Vasilije Ugrin, Zapa family (Jovan and his brother), Pedantari family (seven Pedantari brothers and many other), Moneta family (three sons of Rajko Moneta), Malon≈°i family (Petar with his two sons), and Bu≈°a Sornja who were pronoiars. Iurichi positioned himself on the left wing with his Dalmatian forces, while the right was composed of Italian natives. Skanderbeg positioned himself and his personal bodyguard on the right wing, opposite Iurichi. The center of Skanderbeg's army was commanded by Tanush Thopia, and the right by Moses of Dibra. Skanderbeg instructed his troops on what to expect and opened battle by ordering a force of archers to open fire on the Venetian line. Soon, the Albanian right wing advanced to engage first and managed to push the Venetian left wing back, while the center and the right engaged the Venetian center and left. The breakthrough was soon accomplished by attacking the gaps in the Venetian lines, causing disorder among their ranks. The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress. The Albanians managed to inflict 2,500 casualties on the Venetian force, capturing 1,000. Skanderbeg's army suffered 400 casualties, most on the right wing. The Venetian presence in Albania was weakened and the garrisons in the cities were stretched thin. Skanderbeg retreated from the area to fight off an Ottoman invasion. Before leaving, he garrisoned the fort of Baleƒç (Balsha) near Dagnum, under the command of Marin Spani. Andrea Venier ordered the capture of Baleci after Skanderbeg had left, forcing Marin Spani to evacuate it. Venier then burned it to the ground. In retaliation, Hamza Kastrioti, one of Spani's colleagues, attacked a nearby Venetian fortress with what little men he had, but was defeated. Despite the setbacks while he was away, Skanderbeg continued to focus on campaigning against the Venetian-requested Ottoman incursion at the Battle of Oronichea in August 1448. The Ottoman expeditionary force was crushed on 14 August, with Ottoman commander Mustafa Pasha captured. The loss of Balsha to the Venetians, however, forced Skanderbeg to continue raiding Venetian territory.  Aftermath  With Durazzo, Scutari, and Dagnum on the point of surrender and seeing a victorious Albanian army after the Battle of Oronichea, the Venetians sent Andrea Venier to open peace negotiations with the Albanians. The conference was held in Alessio and peace was signed by Skanderbeg and George Arianiti who represented the other princes on 4 October 1448. The signatories agreed that Venice would keep Dagnum. In return, the Venetians agreed that Skanderbeg would receive an annual pension of 1,400 ducats and an annual tax exemption for 200 horse loads of salt from Durazzo. An agreement was also made to establish trading privileges between Arianiti, Skanderbeg's ally, and Venice. Furthermore, a refuge in Venice would be offered in case Skanderbeg was driven out of Albania and two scarlet garments would be given to Skanderbeg in exchange for two altered falcons from the Albanian. However, threats were still exchanged between both sides and unofficial skirmishing continued. Wary of Skanderbeg, Venice no longer openly challenged him. Another treaty was signed in 1463, when Venice went to war with the Turks. However, no peace was made between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg until 1463, before the Ottoman-Venetian war was of the same year, who retreated to Macedonia and prepared for another invasion of Albania after their defeat at Oronichea. During the Albanian-Venetian war, they had taken Svetigrad after several months of siege. Thence, they could cross into Albania uninhibited.

A phantom ballplayer is either a baseball player who is incorrectly listed in source materials as playing in a Major League Baseball (MLB) game, often the result of typographical or clerical errors, or a player who spent time on an MLB active roster without ever appearing in an MLB contest during his career. Most of the first form of phantom players date from the 19th or early 20th century, with at least one showing up as late as World War II. A modern-day phantom ballplayer is generally caused by the player being removed from the active roster by a subsequent action (such as being optioned to a minor league team) or the team reaching the end of their season, and the player not having later opportunity to play in a major league game. Many of these phantom players were September call-ups in backup roles. Phantoms who never were Pete Compton of the St. Louis Browns, now credited with the plate appearance of \\"Lou Proctor\\" *Edward L. Thayer supposedly played one game for the 1876 New York Mutuals; he was listed in The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball as having been born in Mechanic Falls, Maine. The player was actually George Fair, who adopted a pseudonym that, coincidentally, resembled the name of then-12-year-old Ernest Lawrence Thayer, who would later go on to become a poet and write \\"Casey at the Bat.\\" (Some 19th and early 20th century players sometimes played under assumed names in an attempt to circumvent contractual obligations with another club.) *An outfielder named Turbot (no first name given) was listed in The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball as playing one game for the 1902 St. Louis Cardinals. In the 1971 anthology This Great Game, writer and humorist Roy Blount Jr. included him on his \\"all-time fish team\\" (as turbot is also the name of a fish) and bemoaned that Turbot had been dropped from the encyclopedia; \\"I don't know what happened to him, but we need him in the outfield.\\" *Lou Proctor was listed as playing one game for the 1912 St. Louis Browns, drawing a walk in his only plate appearance. He appeared in The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball as a pinch hitter named \\"L. Proctor\\". Research in the 1980s, however, revealed that the appearance belonged to the Browns' Pete Compton. According to legend, Proctor was a Western Union operator who inserted his name into the box score as a prank. However, whether Proctor existed‚Äîeven as a prankish telegraph operator‚Äîis unknown. *A catcher named Deniens (no first name given) was listed in The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball as having played one game for the 1914 Chicago Chi-Feds of the Federal League. Later research showed that the game was caught by the Chi-Feds third-string catcher Clem Clemens ‚Äî historians reading a handwritten scorecard of the game had incorrectly deciphered \\"Clemens\\" as \\"Deniens\\". Real players who never played Research by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) has identified over 400 players who appeared on major league rosters, but did not appear in a major league game, since 1884. A number of examples are presented here. =Pre-1950= *Pitcher Bill Stewart was on the roster of the 1919 Chicago White Sox, but was sent to the minor leagues without playing for the team. It is unclear whether he was on the team's active roster, as he had been injured the previous winter. Stewart would go on to be an umpire in the National League and an ice hockey referee in the NHL. *First baseman Jeff Jones was briefly on the roster of the 1920 Philadelphia Athletics, but did not play. As with several other players of this era, it is not established if Jones was on the A's active roster during the season. *Outfielder Lou Almada made the major league roster of the 1927 New York Giants out of spring training, but was hurt as the season began, and did not reach the majors again. In 1933, his brother Mel Almada became the first Mexican to play in the majors. *Minor league pitching legend Jake Levy was reported in at least one contemporary account to have signed with the 1927 New York Giants in mid-September, without getting into a game. Peter and Joachim Horvitz' The Big Book of Jewish Baseball list Levy's stint on the Giants bench as having occurred in 1932. However, whether Levy spent any time at all on a Giants' active roster is a matter of dispute. *Al Olsen is an unusual example of a verifiable real-life person who did not play in the major leagues, but was included in official major league records for many years. Olsen, a career minor league pitcher, was credited as appearing in the first game of a doubleheader on May 16, 1943, as a pinch hitter (walking, and then stealing a base) for the Boston Red Sox against the Chicago White Sox. However, research by SABR in the 1980s showed that while Olsen had been with the 1943 Boston Red Sox during spring training, he was sent to San Diego of the Pacific Coast League before the 1943 season began. Olsen pitched on May 15 for San Diego, and given wartime travel restrictions, could not have arrived in Chicago for the game the following day. Olsen himself said, \\"It wasn't me. I was a left-handed pitcher. I couldn't hit my hat. Besides, I never played a game in the major leagues.\\" The pinch hitting appearance probably, but not definitely, belongs to Leon Culberson; it also could have been Johnny Lazor, who wore uniform number 14, the same number Olsen wore in spring training. Official records now credit Culberson with the walk and stolen base‚Äîthough Culberson himself swears he did not play in what would have been his major league debut game (he was the starting center fielder in the second game of the doubleheader, thus his debut date is not in question). =1950s= Bill Sharman, who was briefly on the roster of the 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers * Outfielder Bill Sharman spent time on the roster of the 1951 Brooklyn Dodgers when he was called up in mid-September; he did not appear in a game. Sharman is often cited as the only player to be ejected from an MLB game without playing in one, when umpire Frank Dascoli cleared the entire Dodgers bench for arguing with a call at home plate on September 27, 1951. However, Sharman was not ejected; those who had to leave the bench were still eligible to be brought into the game. Sharman is far more notable as a professional basketball player and coach than as a baseball player; he is one of only four individuals to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. =1960s= *Pitcher Ed Nottle spent a few days on the 1963 Chicago White Sox active roster. He pitched in a mid-season exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs, and then was returned to the minors. *The 1964 New York Yankees named middle infielder Chet Trail their \\"designated player\\" for the season under baseball's pre-draft era bonus rule, which allowed him to be assigned to a minor league club while still counting against (and being considered part of) the team's 25-man active roster. Additionally, Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick ruled that Trail was eligible for the Yankees' 1964 World Series roster. However, Trail never played in an MLB game. Trail is the only player to have appeared on a World Series eligibility list without ever appearing in a major league game. *Infielder Ike Futch was added to the active roster of the 1966 Houston Astros, when Joe Morgan suffered a broken kneecap on June 25‚Äîhowever, Futch himself sustained a knee injury in a Triple-A game on June 26, which ended his season. *Pitcher Maurice \\"Moe\\" Ogier was on the opening day roster for the 1968 Minnesota Twins, but he did not get into a game and was optioned to the Twins' farm team in Charlotte in late April to make room for Jim Kaat, who had injured his elbow in his final start of the 1967 season and was coming off the disabled list. Ogier had an ailing shoulder, which may have been the reason he did not get into a game. =1970s= * Catcher-outfielder Lee Robinson did not appear in an MLB game, despite spending nearly two months on the roster of the 1974 Los Angeles Dodgers. He was recalled from the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes on May 11 to replace pitcher Greg Shanahan, and was returned to Albuquerque on July 3 when the Dodgers called up Rick Rhoden. Robinson was later voted $2,000 in World Series money by his teammates. *First baseman Ed Kurpiel was a September call- up for the 1974 St. Louis Cardinals, but did not appear in a game. *Pitcher Davis May was called up from Tacoma by the 1977 Minnesota Twins, along with fellow pitcher Jeff Holly, on April 25 to replace Mike Pazik and Don Carrithers, who had been seriously injured in a car accident early that morning. Holly pitched for the Twins, but May was sent back to Tacoma on May 16 to make room for Glenn Adams, who was returning from the disabled list. May was not used (or even asked to warm up) by Twins manager Gene Mauch during the time he was on the active roster. *In September 1977, no fewer than three ballplayers who never played in a major league game served a couple of weeks' time on major league rosters, all of them pitchers: Tom McGough of the Cleveland Indians, Pat Cristelli of the California Angels, and Ed Ricks of the New York Yankees. (Scott McGough, the son of Tom McGough, pitched in six games for the 2015 Miami Marlins.) *Catcher Harry Saferight was a September call-up for the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates, but failed to appear in a game. He was the on-deck batter on three different occasions, but each time, the batter ahead of him made the final out of the inning. Fellow call-up Gary Hargis narrowly avoided phantom status by making a single MLB appearance, and is listed as an honorable mention. =1980s= *The 1983 Kansas City Royals briefly called up two catchers to back up regular backstop John Wathan; Duane Dewey was on the roster from May 16 to June 1, while Russ Stephans spent time on the roster from June 29 to July 5; neither made an MLB appearance. *Pitcher Mark Leonette was called up by the 1987 Chicago Cubs on July 2, and was sent down on July 6 without making an appearance in a game. He wore number 32 while with the club. *Infielder Bill Merrifield spent two days on the roster of the 1987 Pittsburgh Pirates in September, but did not appear in a game before being sent to the Florida Instructional League. His son Whit Merrifield made his major league debut with the 2016 Kansas City Royals. *Pitcher Joe Law spent four days on the active roster of the 1988 Oakland Athletics without making an appearance. He was first called up on July 4, and deactivated after the first game of a doubleheader on July 5. He subsequently was called up on August 8, and sent back down on August 10. =1990s= *Infielder Armando Moreno was added to the 1990 Pittsburgh Pirates roster on August 3, and sent back to Triple-A two days later, without appearing in a game. *Outfielder-first baseman Terrel Hansen was on the active roster for the 1992 New York Mets for two games, April 30 and May 1, without making an appearance. *Outfielder Bruce Dostal spent four games on active roster of the 1994 Baltimore Orioles; he was called up on June 10, then designated for assignment on June 14. On two occasions, manager Johnny Oates told Dostal he would pinch run if designated hitter Harold Baines reached base; both times, Baines was retired. *Infielder Joel Chimelis was called up by the 1995 San Francisco Giants on June 4 to replace injured third baseman Matt Williams, who had broken a bone in his foot. Chimelis had been a replacement player during spring training that year, and Giants players grumbled about the idea of welcoming a strikebreaker on the team. After a threat of player revolt, the Giants sent him back to the minor leagues two days later, without Chimelis having appeared in a major league game. He was not called up to the major leagues again. *Pitcher Billy Percibal was on the active roster of the 1995 Baltimore Orioles for eight days starting on September 21. However, the roster move was simply a favor to Percibal, who was recovering from bone spur surgery he had undergone two days prior. *Pitcher Jesus Mart√≠nez, the younger brother of Pedro and Ram√≥n, was added to the active roster of the 1996 Los Angeles Dodgers on September 2, but did not appear in a game. =2000s= *Outfielder Luke Wilcox was briefly called up by the 2000 New York Yankees, July 13‚Äì16, but did not appear in a game. He wore number 50 with the Yankees. *Catcher C√©sar King spent five days on the 2001 Kansas City Royals active roster, May 19‚Äì23, without making an appearance. *Pitcher Jeff Urban was on the 2003 San Francisco Giants active roster on April 26‚Äì30 and again on August 1‚Äì2. He did not make an appearance during either stint. *Catcher David Parrish, son of Tiger great Lance Parrish, was called up by the 2004 New York Yankees for three days without making an appearance, after regular catcher Jorge Posada was hit in the face with a ball during a game. Parrish wore number 57 during his short stint as a Yankee. *Pitcher Cory Morris was on the active roster of the 2006 Baltimore Orioles on April 9‚Äì12, without making an appearance. *Catcher Tim Gradoville was on the 2006 Philadelphia Phillies active roster for 18 days in September without making an appearance *Pitcher Tim Lahey was on the active roster of the 2008 Philadelphia Phillies for the first six days of the season without making an appearance. Lahey spent his entire six-year minor league career pitching for the Minnesota Twins organization. However, in a five-month period from December 2007 to April 2008, he was selected by the Tampa Bay Rays in the Rule 5 draft, sold by the Rays to the Chicago Cubs, released by the Cubs, signed by the Phillies (where he was briefly on their active roster), and then returned to the Twins under conditions of the Rule 5 draft. Lahey managed to do all this without throwing a regular season pitch for anyone other than Minnesota farm teams. *Pitcher Luis Mu√±oz spent two games on the active roster of the 2008 Pittsburgh Pirates in July without making an appearance. His fate was probably sealed before he arrived, with Pirates general manager Neal Huntington saying of his call-up to the majors: \\"I would not anticipate Luis being here for an extended period of time. It was a step short of desperation.\\"\\"Pirates promote Munoz; Cleveland claims Bulllington.\\" www.post- gazette.com, 2008-07-10. Retrieved 2013-01-07. Two days after his arrival, Munoz was removed from the Pirates roster and designated for assignment. He was eventually sent to the farm system of the Seattle Mariners. =2010s= *Pitcher Tom Cochran was on the active roster of the 2011 Cincinnait Reds between May 29 and May 31st, before being optioned back down to AAA. *Catcher Jos√© Y√©pez was called up by the 2011 Seattle Mariners on June 29, then designated for assignment on July 7, without making an appearance in a game. He wore number 35 while with the Mariners. *Catcher Brian Jeroloman was on the active roster of the 2011 Toronto Blue Jays for the final 37 days of the season without playing in a game. *Pitcher Jason Rice was on the active roster of the 2011 Oakland Athletics beginning on September 1, after being acquired from the Boston Red Sox organization.

In October 1918, Burr died in France while serving in World War I. *Shortstop Frank Verdi played one inning on defense for the 1953 New York Yankees on May 10, his only major league appearance, and did not have a plate appearance. *Pitcher Larry Yount, older brother of Hall of Famer Robin Yount, suffered an injury while throwing warmup pitches after being summoned as a reliever during a September 15 game for the 1971 Houston Astros. He did not face a batter and did not appear in any other MLB game. Under MLB rules, Larry Yount is credited with an appearance in that game‚Äîbecause he had been announced‚Äîdespite not actually playing in the game. *Infielder Gary Hargis made his lone MLB appearance as a pinch runner in an extra-innings game for the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates on the next-to-last day of the season, September 29. * Second baseman Bob Hegman played a single inning in the major leagues, as a defensive replacement for the 1985 Kansas City Royals on August 8. *Pitcher Brian Mazone was to start a game for the 2006 Philadelphia Phillies on September 5, but the game was rained out and the Phillies did not activate him to their roster. He spent the rest of his career, which ended in 2010, in the minors. \\"That's a tough thing to shake\\", Mazone said. \\"I was getting called up by the Phillies in 2006 to make a start [replacing Randy Wolf], and the game got rained out and they sent me back down without activating me. Randy came up to me here and apologized. Not that he did anything wrong, he just felt bad.\\"http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090320&content;_id=4040698&vkey;=n *Infielder Mark Kiger never appeared in an MLB regular season game, but he holds the distinction of being the only player whose major league career consists only of postseason games. Kiger was activated by the 2006 Oakland Athletics for the ALCS due to an injury to Mark Ellis. Kiger made two one- inning defensive appearances during the series, without having a plate appearance, and without ever playing in another MLB game.

Comprising 53 buildings situated on over , U-PARC is located from Downtown Pittsburgh in Harmar Township, Pennsylvania adjacent to the Route 28 expressway and Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike. It was founded as the research laboratories of Gulf Oil in 1933 and moved to Harmar Township in 1935. It served many decades as one of the leading industrial research centers in the world, with labs engaging in petroleum, chemical, polymer, refining, and nuclear research. At its peak, it employed over 2,000 scientists and engineers and had an annual budget of $100 million ($ in dollars). Upon Gulf Oil's acquisition by Chevron Oil in 1985, the research park was donated to the University of Pittsburgh in order to keep the center open for the benefit of the region. U-PARC is home to more than 100 different companies from around the world, including several Fortune 500 Companies. In addition, the university's Swanson School of Engineering maintains laboratories and its Manufacturing Assistance Center at the site. It also serves as the home to the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences' Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies. History One of 53 U-PARC buildings as seen from outside the campus U-PARC was founded as the research labs of Gulf Oil in 1933 in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Work began on its current Harmar Township location in August 1934https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat;=19340814&id;=zzcxAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=NGkDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=953,4886374&hl;=en with the opening of the first three buildings in 1935. For many decades it was one of the leading industrial research centers in the world, with labs encompassing research ranging from petroleum, chemical, polymers, refining to even nuclear applications thanks to a three million volt Van de Graaff particle accelerator. It also served for a time as the site of geophysics research by John Bardeen, before he turned to solid state physics and won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice. Products developed in its labs included the airborne magnetometer, the marsh buggy, No-Nox gasoline, Gulf Spray pesticide, and processes for the hydrodesulfurization of sour crude oil and shale oil extraction. For at least the first 20 years of its existence it was the \\"most highly integrated of all the petroleum research laboratories in the world\\". By 1955, it employed over 1,200, and by the late 1970s, it employed 1,500. General Matthew Ridgway keynoted the dedication of three new research laboratories at the center in May, 1957 with Richard King Mellon and about 600 others in attendance.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat;=19570530&id;=VLtRAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=2WsDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6661,5071904&hl;=enhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat;=19570522&id;=FTEbAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=B04EAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6418,2340534&hl;=en In 1985 Gulf Oil was acquired by Chevron Corporation which maintained its own research facilities in Richmond, California, the complex had grown to with 54 multi-story lab buildings and employed nearly 2,000 scientists and engineers with an annual operation budget of over $100 million. The University of Pittsburgh proposed that it would be able to maintain and operate the facility in order to keep the center open for the benefit of the region. Gulf and Chevron agreed to the university's proposal and donated the site, valued at $100 million including the fully furnished and equipped laboratories, a computer telecommunications center, an executive office building, and unique facilities such as large cold room containing a wind tunnel. Chevron also added a $3 million start up grant, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania added a $3 million matching grant for economic development. The donation was announced by university Chancellor Wesley Posvar at a press conference in April, 1985. The university took over the facility in early 1986 and renamed it the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center. On March 17, 1986, the university signed its first major tenant, General Motors Corporation, to a four-year, $13 million contract and in two years was sheltering 80 small businesses. U-PARC is home to academic programs and to more than 100 companies from all over the world, including several Fortune 500 companies. U-PARC's pilot plant services range from petroleum, petrochemical, and chemical-based technologies to environmental, synthetic fuels, biotechnology, and other emerging technologies. Buildings are connected indoors throughout the campus via tunnels. On-site amenities include 24-hour monitored access points, free parking, catering service, meeting/conference space, a U.S. Postal Service sub-station, a credit union, ATMs, picnic areas, outdoor dining, volleyball courts, locker rooms, and shower facilities. In addition to the companies that rent occupy the facilities at U-PARC, the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering maintains research groups and laboratories at the site, including the Manufacturing Assistance Center. Beginning in 2010, the University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences initiated a Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies headquartered at U-PARC. The space for the Physician's Assistant program includes classrooms, breakout rooms, student lounge, computer room, conference room and offices for faculty and administration. Manufacturing Assistance Center The Manufacturing Assistance Center (MAC), located in Building A-11 of U-PARC, is a working factory opened in November 1994 as an initiative of the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering's Department of Industrial Engineering that offers technical assistance and educational resources to the academic and industrial community of Western Pennsylvania. It also serves as an incubator for manufacturing innovation and as a center for technology transfer. The MAC provides access to advanced manufacturing technology, encourages its adoption, and assists in training and educating students in its use. The center comprises a synergistic network of laboratories encompassing machine tooling, computer-aided design and manufacturing, metrology, materials tracking, and human issues. The MAC began following a 1990 survey of 550 Western Pennsylvania manufacturers by the Department of Industrial Engineering that revealed the need for manufacturing support services in this part of the state. In response a concept of shared manufacturing was created by Pitt School of Engineering professors Dr. Bopaya Bidanda and Dr. David I. Cleland, and a proposal describing how the MAC would meet this need resulted in a $2.3 million grant from the Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The center's purpose is to provide research and educational support to the University of Pittsburgh, as well as to provide small and mid-sized manufacturers of Western Pennsylvania with the tools to compete in the global marketplace. As such, area manufacturers can receive demonstrations on new equipment and manufacturing processes, perform pilot manufacturing, and conduct limited production utilizing the resources available in the MAC labs. In addition to these services, the MAC also provides training on computer numerical control (CNC) machining, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), plus a variety of other concepts, such as materials requirements planning, total quality management, and team development, that are utilized by modern manufacturing organizations. Working in partnership with private industry, the MAC is part of the development of the regional RoboCorridor, promoting automation and agile robotics. The MAC's of available space contains a working factory, classrooms, and administration offices and supplies secure space for startup companies wishing to access its facilities. The factory has a 5-ton and a 1-ton overhead crane, a loading dock, 220 and 480 volt 3-phase power, a paint room, and welding booths. The space is subdivided into classrooms, a conference room, a computer laboratory designed for CAD/CAM training, offices and training areas for manual, welding training, and CNC and EDM machine tool and precision grinding training. The facility also includes two classrooms seating 24 and 12 students, respectively, as well as five offices, a metrology lab, and a computer lab. There are five additional rooms available on the basement floor for offices, storage, a small production setup area, along with a test facility with a garage entrance and access to a 1-ton overhead crane.

Suga also recommended Ujihara to take the entrance exam of Kyoto University, assuming the school name would be a help when they become a manzai duo in the future. Ujihara accepted his offer, took the entrance exam, and passed it when he was a high school junior. Since Ujihara had expected his parents would be against his career decision, he kept secret his activities as a comedian from them. However, one day in a TV variety show, his father saw him wearing only a shorts and chasing around money in the street. His father became furious shouting at him \\"Why are you going to university!?\\" Although His father stayed against Ujihara's comedy career, the father, having seen Ujihara's nine-year effort to graduate from the university, eventually recognized Ujihara's passion for comedy and supported his decision. Interests Ujihara is a big fan of professional baseball team Hiroshima Toyo Carp and singer Hitomi. Quiz King Ujihara frequently appears in quiz shows. He won championship titles in \\"Brain Survivor II\\" (TBS) a special program broadcast in the Spring of 2002 and \\"Quiz! Nihongo-oh\\" (TBS) broadcast on June 24, 2008. On the TV program \\"Cho Time Shock -- Saikyo Quiz-oh Ketteisen,\\" he won the first place in his first appearance. He revealed there that he had earned approximately 5 million yen from quiz shows.

The aim of a struggle session was to shape public opinion and humiliate, persecute, or execute political rivals and those deemed class enemies. In general, the victim of a struggle session was forced to admit various crimes before a crowd of people who would verbally and physically abuse the victim until they confessed. Struggle sessions were often held at the workplace of the accused, but they were sometimes conducted in sports stadiums where large crowds would gather if the target was well-known. Etymology According to Lin Yutang, the expression comes from \\"pƒ´p√†n\\" (, literally \\"to criticize and judge\\") and \\"d√≤uzhƒìng\\" ( literally \\"to fight and struggle\\"), so the whole expression conveys the message of \\"inciting the spirit of judgment and fighting\\". Instead of saying the full phrase \\"pƒ´p√†n d√≤uzhƒìng\\", it was shortened to \\"pƒ´d√≤u\\" (). Origins and purpose Struggle sessions developed from similar ideas of criticism and self-criticism in the Soviet Union from the 1920s. The term refers to class struggle; the session is held, ostensibly, to benefit the target, by eliminating all traces of counterrevolutionary, reactionary thinking. Chinese communists resisted this at first, because struggle sessions conflicted with the Chinese concept of saving face, but struggle sessions became commonplace at Communist Party meetings during the 1930s due to public popularity. Later struggle sessions were adapted to use outside the CCP as a means of consolidating its control of areas under its jurisdiction. Frederick T. C. Yu identified three categories of mass campaigns--economic, ideological, and struggle--employed by the CCP in the years before and after the establishment of the PRC. Economic campaigns sought to improve conditions, often by increasing production in particular sectors of the economy. Ideological campaigns sought to change people's thinking. Struggle campaigns were similar to ideological campaigns, but \\"their focus is on the elimination of the power base and/or class position of enemy classes or groups.\\", summarizing Yu‚Äôs categories. Tactics in early struggle sessions Struggle campaigns emerged as a tactic to secure the allegiance of the Chinese people during the land reform () campaign. That campaign sought to mobilize the masses through intensive propaganda followed by ‚ÄúSpeak Bitterness‚Äù () sessions in which peasants were encouraged to accuse land owners. The strongest accusations were incorporated into scripted and stage-managed public mass accusation meetings (). Cadres then cemented the peasants‚Äô loyalty by inducing them to actively participate in violent acts against landowners. This process served multiple purposes. First, it demonstrated to the masses that the party was determined to subdue any opposition (generally labeled ‚Äúclass enemies‚Äù), by violence if necessary. Second, potential rivals were crushed. Third, those who attacked the targeted foes became complicit in the violence and hence invested in the state. All three served to consolidate the party's control, which was deemed necessary because party members constituted a small minority of China's population. Both accusation meetings and mass trials were largely propaganda tools to accomplish the party's aims. Klaus M√ºhlhahn, professor of China Studies at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, wrote: Julia C. Strauss observed that public tribunals were ‚Äúbut the visible d√©nouement of a show that had been many weeks in preparation.‚Äù Accounts Margaret Chu, writing retrospectively for the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation's Mindszenty Report, in November 1998, said: Anne F. Thurston, in Enemies of the People, gave a description of an infamous struggle session for the professor You Xiaoli: Disuse after 1978 Struggle sessions were disowned in China after 1978, when the reformers led by Deng Xiaoping took power; Deng Xiaoping prohibited struggle sessions and other kinds of Mao-era violent political campaigns.

Onset, increased prominence and severity usually occurs during winter. It is a type of genodermatosis. The name \\"Oudtshoorn skin\\" derives from the town of Oudtshoorn in the Western Cape province of South Africa, where the disorder was first described. It is one of several genetic disorders known to be highly prevalent among the Afrikaner population.  Presentation  KWE is characterized by a number of anomalies affecting the skin. Erythema causes redness of the skin, which is generally associated with inflammation and irritation. Including erythema and hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum), naturally occurring keratolytic peeling and scaling, with increased manifestation in winter, are prevailing features of the disorder. Erythema in KWE has been attributed to necrobiosis (cellular death) within the Malpighian layer (the innermost layer of the epidermis). Peeling and scaling are caused by spreading dissection of the stratum corneum, correlating to the underlying necrobiosis. The effects of KWE appear intermittently as patches on the skin of the palms and soles, with these patches appearing on the limbs, buttocks and torso in severe cases. Facial lesions of this type have also been reported with the disorder, though this is considered to be an extremely rare occurrence. Onset and cyclical recurrence of KWE have shown to be associated with the arrival of winter, or winter-like weather. Worsening of symptoms during this time may be considered as an indicator of recurrent onset in patients known to have the disorder, and age of initial onset can be from early childhood to young adulthood, with attenuation of symptoms sometimes happening after age 30. Patients first exhibiting the disorder at a younger age may also experience worsened symptoms. Currently, no specific correlating factor or reason for winter-related manifestation has been established, though the coldness and dryer air common to winter conditions may be suspect. Winter onset is, however, considered to be a distinguishing feature of KWE among other erythematic skin disorders. When peeling of skin occurs, the newly exposed layer of skin underneath is moist, raw and very sensitive. While this may result in minor discomfort and inconvenience, in severe cases of KWE where large areas of raw skin are present, it is often life-altering and debilitating. KWE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 8 is an autosome), and one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who also has the disorder. KWE can begin as a spontaneous mutation, first appearing in an individual with no previous family history of the disorder. This may be due to a genetic predisposition for the disorder, possibly connected to the Oudtshoorn ancestral line. Genetics KWE is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 8 is an autosome), and one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who also has the disorder. KWE can begin as a spontaneous mutation, first appearing in an individual with no previous family history of the disorder. This may be due to a genetic predisposition for the disorder, possibly connected to the Oudtshoorn ancestral line.  Pathophysiology  KWE is of unknown cause, as at the present time, no specific mutation of any gene has been established as the cause of the disorder. Research has shown, however, that the gene involved is located on human chromosome 8. The function of enzymes in general are fundamentally subject to temperature. A candidate gene is a gene that is suspected to cause a disease or disorder. In KWE, this gene is known to be located in the area between chromosome 8q22 and 8q23. Within this region, the occurrence of loss of heterozygosity (simultaneous loss of function in both alleles of a gene) has been associated with malignancy, including certain types of breast and lung cancer. During the investigation for a KWE candidate gene in this same region, twelve protein transcripts were evaluated between microsatellite markers D8S550 and D8S1759, which is a critical area shown to be the source of KWE pathogenesis. Among the twelve transcripts identified, one corresponded to the BLK gene, which encodes the enzyme B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase. Four other of these transcripts included a myotubularin (MTMR8), a potential human homologue of the mouse Amac1 enzyme, a transcript similar to the mouse L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase gene, and one similar to a human oncogene. The remaining seven transcripts did not resemble any currently known genes. In all, none of the twelve transcripts displayed any evidence of pathogenic involvement with KWE. As a transcriptional map of this critical area is being drawn, based on microsatellite identification, haplotype analysis and other measures; localization of the gene associated with KWE pathogenesis is an ongoing process. DiagnosisTreatment Epidemiology  Oudtshoorn is a town in Western Cape (formerly Cape Province), South Africa, where KWE (\\"Oudtshoorn skin\\") was first described. The disorder is quite prevalent among Afrikaners of South Africa, a population which can be defined as caucasoid native- speakers of Afrikaans, with northwestern European lineage. Among this group, KWE occurs at a rate of approximately 1/7,200. This relatively high rate of occurrence has been attributed to the founder effect, in which a small, often consanguinous population is formed out of the larger ancestral population, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity. In the context of KWE, the founder effect was confirmed by haplotype analysis, which indicates that the chromosomal origin of a possible genetic mutation responsible for the disorder is particularly common among affected Afrikaners. This is also true in other South Africans of European descent with KWE, and the chromosome of interest in both these and Afrikaner patients strongly points to an unspecified ancestor or ancestral group that may have settled around the Oudtshoorn area. A second lineage known to exhibit KWE has been reported in Germany, although there it is less prevalent and appears to involve the chromosome from a different ancestral origin than that seen in Afrikaners. KWE has also been noted in other countries around the northwestern region of Europe, such as Denmark.

In each of the first five instances, the name was used for a regional operating company (that is, a division or subsidiary) of The Greyhound Corporation (the parent Greyhound firm). In the last instance the name was used for an internal administrative department of the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., the (second) GLI, a separate, independent, unrelated firm, after the GLI bought the core bus business of The Greyhound Corporation.  The first GLI  The Motor Transit Corporation (MTC), the original Greyhound firm, before it became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation, started a new route between Chicago, Illinois, and Indianapolis, Indiana, in February 1927, four months after its formation (as the MTC). To comply with an Indiana statute (one which required that corporations doing business in the Hoosier State be domiciled there), the MTC had already (in November 1926, the same month as its own incorporation) created a wholly owned subsidiary, based in Indiana and named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., of Indiana (called also the GLI of Indiana), to conduct the route between Chicago and Indianapolis (mostly in Indiana). Thereby the GLI of Indiana became the first business unit of the growing Greyhound empire to make a public use of the name of the Greyhound Lines. The GLI of Indiana also took over another firm, the Blue Goose Lines, running in the Hoosier State from Indianapolis southward to Evansville and northward to Kokomo and onward to Fort Wayne (all four in Indiana), bought from Ralph Bogan and Swan Sundstrom, two original busmen from northern Minnesota. [The two sellers continued as key players at Greyhound. Bogan served eventually as the vice president of The Greyhound Corporation during the presidency of Orville Swan Caesar (1946‚Äì56), after the retirement of Carl Eric Wickman, the principal founder of Greyhound; Sundstrom served as a long-time president of the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines.] [In November 1926 the MTC created also a sister subsidiary, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., of Ohio (the GLI of Ohio), which in November 1927 began service between Detroit, Michigan, and Cincinnati, Ohio.] [For a short time during 1927‚Äì28, there was also a third subsidiary (of the MTC) using the name of the Greyhound Lines, Inc. ‚Äì the GLI of Delaware, which came into existence to buy the Purple Swan Safety Coach Lines, running between Chicago and Kansas City via Saint Louis (the two latter in Missouri), and which became renamed as the Pickwick-Greyhound Lines, after the Pickwick Corporation bought a one-half ownership interest in that firm (hence the hyphenated name). Later the route segment between Saint Louis and Kansas City became transferred to the Southwestern GL, and the segment between Chicago and Saint Louis became transferred to the Illinois GL (then to the Central GL, then eventually to the Great Lakes GL).] In 1929 the MTC became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation (with an uppercase T, because the word \\"the\\" was an integral part of the legal name of the corporate entity). The GLI of Indiana and the GLI of Ohio developed additional routes, mostly by buying existing properties. During the early years of the growth of the Greyhound empire, the GLI of Indiana performed an important function, by operating a number of significant routes before they became transferred to other operating companies.  The first Central GL  In 1930 The Greyhound Corporation, the parent Greyhound firm, formed two new regional companies ‚Äì the Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines (GL) and the (first) Central GL. The purpose of the Pennsylvania GL was to provide an entity in which the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) soon bought a minority interest, a subsidiary in a territory which coincided with the territory of the railway firm ‚Äì so that the rail company could supplement its train service and substitute bus service in place of some of its unprofitable and marginally profitable passenger trains. Greyhound then transferred the routes of the GLI of Indiana and the GLI of Ohio to the new companies. The east-west routes went to the Pennsylvania GL, as did the other ones paralleling other lines of the PRR. The remaining routes [that is, those between Evansville and Indianapolis and between Detroit and Cincinnati and onward to Louisville (in Kentucky)] went to the (first) Central GL. The GLI of Indiana and the GLI of Ohio then went out of existence.  Ohio GL  The (first) Central GL in 1935 (five years later) became renamed as the Ohio Greyhound Lines (completely different and separate from the GLI of Ohio, which had gone out of existence in 1930) ‚Äì to allow Greyhound to reassign the name Central to a new subsidiary, in the Midwest and the Northeast, one in an area which coincided with the territory of another major railway company, the New York Central (NYC) System, one in which Greyhound transferred a minority non-voting interest to the NYC System. The Greyhound executives wished for the latter subsidiary to bear a name (Central) which suggested the kinship with the related railway firm (New York Central), as in the case of the neighboring Pennsylvania GL and the Pennsylvania Railroad. [For several years during the 1930s, the coaches of the Central GL and the Pennsylvania GL bore (in addition to their usual Greyhound markings) the logos of the related railway companies ‚Äì the oval (or ellipse) of the NYC System and the keystone of the \\"Pennsy\\" Railroad.] Despite the name of the Ohio GL, the firm was based in Indiana (as had been the GLI of Indiana and the first Central GL), to satisfy the statutory requirement of the Hoosier State for domestic corporations for operations there. The Ohio GL continued to increase its route network throughout its area, mostly by the acquisition of existing carriers.  The second Central GL  Thus the second Central GL came into existence in 1935, based in Cleveland, Ohio, as a subsidiary of The Greyhound Corporation, and it continued until late in 1954, when it was merged into the Pennsylvania GL. {In the next year, 1955, the enlarged Pennsylvania GL became redesignated as the Eastern Division of The Greyhound Corporation [called also the (second) Eastern GL], the first of four huge new divisions (along with Southern, Western, and another Central).} The (second) Central GL came from three major components: :first, the former Safety Motor Coach Lines, running from Chicago into Michigan (including the routes between Chicago and Detroit) and throughout the western part of the lower peninsula of the Wolverine State; :second, the routes between Chicago and New York City via Cleveland (in Ohio), including the route via Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany (all four in the Empire State), paralleling the touted \\"water-level route\\" of the New York Central (railway) System [in contrast with the shorter mountainous route of the Pennsylvania Railroad between Chicago and New York City via Fort Wayne (in Indiana), Bucyrus, Mansfield, and Canton (all three in Ohio), and Pittsburgh, Altoona, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia (all four in Pennsylvania)]; :third, a large route network throughout upstate New York, with one extension to Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada, and another from Albany to Boston via Pittsfield, Springfield, and Worcester (all the last four in Massachusetts). The first major part of the (second) Central GL, the Safety Motor Coach Lines, had been founded (with the backing of Wickman) in 1924 by Edwin (Ed) Eckstrom, an accountant, born in Ludington, Michigan, and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota. [Eckstrom in -17 had become an investor and participant in the Mesaba Transportation Company, based in Hibbing, the first incorporated firm (which replaced the Hibbing Transportation Company, a partnership consisting of Eric Wickman, Ralph Bogan, and others) which led to the founding of the Greyhound empire.] In 1926, after the Motor Transit Corporation (MTC) came into existence, its first purchase was Eckstrom's Safety Motor Coach Lines, and Eckstrom became the first president of the MTC. [When the MTC bought the Safety Motor Coach Lines, Eckstrom's company contributed to the MTC not only the name Greyhound and the image of a greyhound dog but also the blue-and-white livery (color scheme) used on Eckstrom's coaches. Eckstrom is said to have proposed the use of the name of the Greyhound Lines even before he left (with the support of his associates in Minnesota) to go back eastward. For more details please see the article about the Great Lakes GL.] In 1929 the Safety Motor Coach Lines (as a subsidiary of the MTC) took over the Interstate Stages (which had used the brand name of the Oriole Lines and had named its coaches as the Oriole Flyers), the Southwestern Michigan Motor Coach Company, and the YellowaY of Michigan (a part of the YellowaY-Pioneer System, bought from the American Motor Transportation Company), all three of which firms Greyhound had acquired through a related company, named as the Automotive Investments, Inc., based in Duluth, Minnesota. In 1930 the Safety Motor Coach Lines became renamed as the Eastern Greyhound Lines (EGL) of Michigan, then in -35 (briefly) as the (third) Central Greyhound Lines (CGL) of Michigan; then in -36 it became merged into the undenominated main (second) Central GL. [In 1948 Greyhound transferred all the Michigan routes of the (second) Central GL (formerly those of the Safety Motor Coach Lines) to the Great Lakes GL, which had begun in 1941.] The second major part of the (second) Central GL, the routes between Chicago and New York City via Cleveland, began in 1923, when Clark McConnell, a lawyer in Cleveland, founded the Cleveland-Ashtabula- Conneaut (CAC) Bus Company, running about 71 miles from Cleveland to Conneaut (both in Ohio), reaching to the east-northeast on the way toward Erie, Pennsylvania, and Buffalo, New York. [McConnell had begun in the bus industry in 1919 by taking part in starting two other firms ‚Äì the Cleveland-Akron Bus Company and the Cleveland-Elyria-Toledo Bus Company (which latter firm, despite its name, ran from Cleveland only as far as Norwalk, beyond Elyria but short of Toledo); O.B. Baskett, a former driver and sometime manager for those two firms (1919‚Äì24), in 1925, after a brief stint in North Carolina, began running coaches of his own in East Tennessee between Knoxville and Johnson City, then in 1928 co-founded the Tennessee Coach Company, which long (1929‚Äì56) cooperated (in part by running through-coaches on through-schedules in pool interline operations) with the Atlantic GL, the Dixie GL, and (especially) the Southeastern GL, but which in 1956 became a member of the Trailways association (then named as the National Trailways Bus System), and which in 1966 became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Continental Trailways.] [While Baskett lived in North Carolina (1924‚Äì25), he worked for the Carolina Motor Coaches, which soon became a major part of the newly founded Carolina Coach Company, which in 1940 became a member of the National Trailways association (and thereby became known also as the Carolina Trailways), and which in 1997 became a wholly owned subsidiary of the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., the (second) GLI.] [One curious result of that last step is that now a Greyhound subsidiary (the Carolina Coach Company, the Carolina Trailways) is a member of the Trailways association (now named as the Trailways Transportation System).] The CAC Bus Company in 1927 extended its route to Buffalo. CAC in the next year, 1928, became renamed as the Great Lakes Stages (GLS), and it extended all the way to New York City ‚Äì via Buffalo and Olean (all three in New York), Port Allegany, Mansfield, Scranton, and Stroudsburg (all four in Pennsylvania), and Columbia, Dover, and Newark (all three in New Jersey). [Some of the trips of the GLS ran directly between Erie and Olean via Jamestown (in the Empire State), thus bypassing Buffalo; others ran directly between Erie and Port Allegany via Warren (in Pennsylvania), thus bypassing not only Buffalo but also both Jamestown and Olean.] The GLS also developed a branch line between Erie and Pittsburgh (both in the Keystone State). In 1929 the Motor Transit Corporation (MTC) bought the GLS, and (in a separate transaction) the MTC became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation. The GLS became renamed as the Eastern Greyhound Lines (EGL) of Ohio (completely different and separate from the GLI of Ohio, which had gone out of existence in 1930, and the Ohio GL, which then still ran between Evansville and Indianapolis and between Detroit and Louisville). The other route between Cleveland and New York City (the \\"water-level route\\" via Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany) came into existence during the development of the set of routes described next. The prelude to the third major part of the (second) Central GL, the routes in upstate New York (with the two extensions), began in 1913 in the Thousand Islands region, a resort area along the border between Canada and the US, on the Saint Lawrence River, which is the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean from Lake Ontario and therefore also from all five of the Great Lakes. In 1913 Fred Dailey began service (with a Cadillac open touring car) between Watertown, New York, the nearest town with a train station (in the US), and Alexandria Bay, on the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River, a distance of about 32 miles. Dailey and others, with various degrees of success (or lack of it) developed a number of routes throughout the region. Dailey also extended downstream from Alexandria Bay to Ogdensburg. In 1923 Walter Aldrich and others started a bus firm to run from Syracuse to Watertown, about 73 miles to the north. [Aldrich already owned a firm running from Syracuse to Norwich, about 66 miles to the southeast, using Fageol Safety Coaches.] By the next year, 1924, Aldrich alone ran the line between Watertown and Syracuse, using Fageols, on the first highway link between that part of northern New York and the rest of the Empire State. He also took over the two routes between Watertown and Alexandria Bay. In 1925 a group of investors in Watertown set out to assemble a bus line between Binghamton (in the Empire State) and the Canada‚ÄìUS border, a distance of about 180 miles. They formed the Colonial Motor Coach Corporation, which then bought Aldrich's routes from Watertown to Syracuse and from Watertown to Alexandria Bay. Colonial then developed routes from Watertown to Utica and to Plattsburgh (via Canton, Potsdam, and Malone) plus several branch and feeder lines, mostly by the purchase of existing firms. By 1928 Colonial had indeed extended from Syracuse ‚Äì not only just to Binghamton but also all the way to New York City ‚Äì along two routes ‚Äì one via Binghamton and Scranton (in Pennsylvania) and one via Utica, Albany, Kingston, and Newburgh (all four in the Empire State), in part along the west shore of the Hudson River, and via Ridgewood (in New Jersey). [The route segment between Scranton and New York City, with interstate rights only (that is, without intrastate authority), duplicated a segment of the Great Lakes Stages on its route between Cleveland and New York City.] Colonial continued to increase its route network within its area (that is, in the central part of upstate New York). Late in 1928 Colonial extended westwardly from Syracuse to Rochester, then early in 1929 eastwardly from Albany to Boston (in Massachusetts) and westwardly again from Rochester to Buffalo. In 1928 Colonial began acquiring the intrastate rights between Syracuse and Buffalo, by buying existing firms; that process continued until 1930, after it had become a member of the Greyhound family. In 1929 the Motor Transit Corporation (MTC) bought the Colonial Motor Coach Corporation, and (in a separate transaction) the MTC became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation. Colonial became renamed as the Eastern Greyhound Lines (EGL) of New York. [When Greyhound bought Colonial (in 1929) and renamed it as the EGL of New York, Greyhound thereby made its first presence in New England (between Albany and Boston, along the entire width of Massachusetts).]  The first Eastern GL  In April 1929, as previously mentioned, the Motor Transit Corporation (MTC) formed the Eastern GL (EGL), as a holding company (rather than an operating company), to own a number of Greyhound subsidiaries (both existing ones and future ones) to the east of Chicago ‚Äì other than the Pennsylvania GL, in which the Pennsylvania Railroad would hold a large but minority interest. In 1929 the MTC bought both the Great Lakes Stages and the Colonial Motor Coach Corporation, then in 1930 renamed the GLS as the EGL of Ohio and renamed Colonial as the EGL of New York. [Those two operating companies, the EGL of Ohio and the EGL of New York, became operating subsidiaries of the undenominated main EGL (the holding company), as did the EGL of Michigan (formerly the Safety Motor Coach Lines) and the EGL of New England (which began running in 1930, between Boston and New York City).] Even before the MTC completed its purchase of Colonial, a number of Colonial coaches began to appear in the Greyhound livery, including lettering for the Colonial Greyhound Lines (which never existed at all as a distinct or separate entity) ‚Äì in part (for a short time) to take advantage of the goodwill attached to the name of Colonial. Likewise the names of the GLS and Colonial were retained and used in public for a while. In 1928 the MTC bought the Detroit-Toledo-Cleveland Bus Company, which served the cities which the name indicates, then in 1931 Greyhound merged it into the EGL of Michigan (formerly the Safety Motor Coach Lines), then transferred that route to the EGL of Ohio (formerly the Great Lakes Stages). Thus by 1933 Greyhound consolidated the entire service between Cleveland and Chicago (including the branch from Toledo to Detroit) in the EGL of Ohio (formerly the Great Lakes Stages). Later in 1933, however, Greyhound transferred the routes from Cleveland to Detroit and to Chicago (from the EGL of Ohio) back into the EGL of Michigan (formerly the Safety Motor Coach Lines), then merged the remainder of the EGL of Ohio (formerly the Great Lakes Stages) into the EGL of New York. Thus the former GLS routes between Cleveland and New York City and all the former Colonial routes became consolidated in the EGL of New York.  The third Central GL  In 1935 The Greyhound Corporation renamed the (first) Eastern GL, a holding company, as the (second) Central GL ‚Äì to attach the name Central to the territory coinciding with that of the New York Central (railway) System (in preparation for the pending transfer of a minority interest in the new Greyhound subsidiary, the Central GL, to the NYC System) ‚Äì and Greyhound renamed the EGL of Michigan (formerly the Safety Motor Coach Lines) as the CGL of Michigan (the third Central GL), as a subsidiary of the main (second) Central GL. The CGL of Michigan (formerly the Safety Motor Coach Lines) continued only until the next year, 1936, when (in a move as a part of a tax strategy) Greyhound merged it into the undenominated main (second) Central GL.  The fourth Central GL  In 1935, in connection with the renaming of the (first) Eastern GL as the (second) Central GL and the EGL of Michigan as the CGL of Michigan, Greyhound also renamed the EGL of New York as the CGL of New York (as subsidiaries of the (second) Central GL. [Thus the CGL of New York became the fourth entity to use the name of the Central GL.] [At the same time, however, the EGL of New England continued with the same name, because of its location, which was (and is) clearly eastern rather than central, and which was outside the territory of the NYC (railway) System.] In 1936 The Greyhound Corporation began to eliminate its multiple (and often complex) intermediate holding companies (between the parent firm and the operating companies) ‚Äì to avoid a hugely increased federal income tax on the undistributed earnings of corporate subsidiaries ‚Äì one under the Revenue Act of 1936, which the national Congress had passed as a means by which to cause (or force) a simplification of complex corporate structures in the public-utility industries (including the transportation industries). In that same year, 1936, Greyhound (by necessity) applied to the federal Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for its mandatory approval to merge the EGL of New England (as a division) into The Greyhound Corporation and to merge both the CGL of Michigan and the CGL of New York (as divisions rather than subsidiaries) into the main (second) Central GL. The ICC approved. In 1936 Greyhound merged the EGL of New England as a division (formerly a subsidiary of the CGL, a subsidiary of The Greyhound Corporation) into the parent firm, thereby converting The Greyhound Corporation into an operating company (rather than merely a holding company). Thereby the parent firm, The Greyhound Corporation, became a carrier in its own right (for the first time) and with its own authority (with its own ICC-MC number). Also in that same year, 1936, Greyhound merged the CGL of Michigan into the main CGL, which continued as a subsidiary of the parent firm. However, the Public- service Commission (PSC) of the State of New York, which also held jurisdiction over the activities of the CGL of New York within the boundaries of its own state, withheld its approval ‚Äì saying that the proposed merger would jeopardize its authority over operations within its state. Therefore, the CGL of New York remained (until the end of 1955) as a separate corporate entity and as a subsidiary (of the main second CGL), but as a subsidiary of a subsidiary (no longer as a subsidiary of a holding company). In December 1955 the New York PSC finally agreed to drop its requirement for a domestic Greyhound subsidiary in New York ‚Äì on the condition that Greyhound continue to obtain the vehicular base registration in New York for all the coaches assigned to the routes operating in that state. [In 1937 The Greyhound Corporation formed the New England GL (NEGL, as the first direct subsidiary of the parent company itself), thereby becoming a carrier (for the first time) rather than merely a holding company; in 1939 the federal ICC gave its required approval, and the NEGL began operating; in 1940 Greyhound transferred to the NEGL the routes of the EGL of New England between Boston and New York City (on which the latter firm had begun in 1930); then the EGL of New England continued running to the north of Boston, on routes which it had acquired in the meantime, to Portland, Maine, then on several lines in Maine, reaching eventually Saint Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, on the border, across from Calais, in the eastern part of Maine, until 1950, when it became merged into the NEGL.]  More growth for Central GL  The (second) Central GL continued to develop its route network, mostly and typically, by acquiring other properties. In 1942 the CGL of New York bought the Champlain Coach Lines, thereby gaining its routes between New York City and Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada, including a branch on the east shore of the Hudson River (via Hudson, Poughkeepsie, and Beacon) between Albany and New York City and a branch along each side of Lake Champlain [on the west side via Plattsburgh (in New York) and on the east side via Rutland and Burlington (both in Vermont)] between Albany and Rouse's Point, New York, at the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In 1946 the main (second) Central GL bought the West Ridge Transportation Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Buffalo and Erie Coach Corporation, thereby gaining their route networks, roughly within an irregular polygon enclosed by line segments connecting Ashtabula, Erie, Buffalo, Olean, and Pittsburgh, then back to Erie. The routes in the southwest corner of the Empire State became transferred to the CGL of New York.  Further events for Central GL  In 1947 The Greyhound Corporation finished reacquiring the remaining shares of the non-voting common stock in the Central GL which (in 1935) it had transferred to the NYC System. [It had begun to reacquire it in 1937.] No longer having a need to maintain a subsidiary coinciding with the territory of that railway firm, Greyhound next reorganized some of its routes in the Midwest and the Northeast, seeking a more efficient operation. During 1948 The Greyhound Corporation merged the Illinois GL into the main (second) Central GL. The routes involved, all in Illinois except into three cities on state lines, were those between Chicago and Effingham (in Illinois and on the way to Memphis in Tennessee and New Orleans in Louisiana), between Chicago and Saint Louis (in Missouri) via Springfield (in Illinois), between Chicago and Louisiana (not the state of Louisiana but rather the city of Louisiana in the state of Missouri and on a shortcut, bypassing Saint Louis, to Kansas City, on the state line between Kansas and Missouri), between Springfield and Champaign (both in Illinois), and between Davenport (in Iowa) and both Champlain and Springfield. On the last day of 1948, Greyhound converted the main (second) Central GL from a subsidiary into a division of The Greyhound Corporation, thus ending the separate existence of the CGL as a corporate entity ‚Äì after the completion of reacquiring the stock in the CGL which the NYC (railway) System had held. In 1954 Greyhound merged the main (second) Central GL (along with the Capitol GL and the Richmond GL) into the Pennsylvania GL, then in the next year, 1955, the enlarged Pennsylvania GL (along with the New England GL) became redesignated as the Eastern Division of The Greyhound Corporation [called also the (second) Eastern GL], the first of the four huge new divisions (along with Southern, Western, and another Central). Thus ended the second Central GL, and thus began the second Eastern GL. About the end of 1955 Greyhound merged the CGL of New York into the new Eastern Division [the (second) Eastern GL]. Thus ended the fourth Central GL.  Through-coaches on through-routes  The main (second) CGL and the CGL of New York ran a large number of through-coaches along their own routes, including those between Chicago and Boston, Chicago and New York City, and Montr√©al and New York City. At first they took part in relatively few pool interlined through-routes in cooperation with other Greyhound operating companies ‚Äì those between Montr√©al and Washington, DC, and between Syracuse and Philadelphia [both with the Pennsylvania GL], between Cleveland and Miami (in Florida) [with the Atlantic GL and the Florida GL], and eventually between New York City and San Francisco [with the Overland GL and the Pacific GL]. Starting in 1948 (after receiving the routes of the former Illinois GL), the main (second) Central GL took part in several more pool interlined through-routes ‚Äì those between Chicago and New Orleans (in Louisiana) [with the Dixie GL and the Teche GL], between Chicago and both Houston and Laredo (both in Texas) [both with the Southwestern GL], and between Chicago and Los Angeles (in California) [with the Southwestern GL and the Pacific GL].  Meeting other Greyhound companies  The (second) CGL and the CGL of New York met the Eastern Canadian GL to the north, the New England GL and the EGL of New England to the east, the Northland GL, the Overland GL, and the Southwestern GL to the west, the Atlantic GL and the Dixie GL to the south, the Great Lakes GL at several points between Chicago and Detroit, and the Pennsylvania GL at various points along most of their routes.  The fifth Central GL  In September 1957, in another round of consolidation, The Greyhound Corporation merged the Great Lakes GL with the Northland GL (called also Northland or NGL), a neighboring operating company, thereby forming the Central Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the Central GL, making the fifth of six uses of that name), the second of four huge new divisions (along with Eastern, Southern, and Western). Thus ended the Great Lakes GL and the Northland GL, and thus began the fifth Central GL. Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thereby leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet.  The sixth Central GL  For a short time late in the 1980s, the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., the (second) GLI, made the sixth and last use of the name of the Central Greyhound Lines, not as an operating division but rather as an administrative department (in bookkeeping and other internal purposes), along with the Eastern GL, the Southern GL, and the Western GL.  Beyond Central GL  In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original parent Greyhound firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business) to a new company, named as the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., also called the (second) GLI, based in Dallas, Texas ‚Äì a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., also called TWI, also based in Dallas), which was by far the largest member company in the Trailways association. Later in 1987 the (second) Greyhound Lines, Inc., the (second) GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey as the chief executive officer (CEO) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has since continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives while continuing to reduce its level of service - by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states - and by doing so on fewer days - that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) - and by using fewer through- coaches, thus requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation (the original parent Greyhound firm) changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial - if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda - Œõ - that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound ‚Äì that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation.

This filarial nematode is one of two that causes serous cavity filariasis in humans. The other filarial nematode that causes it in humans is Mansonella perstans. M. ozzardi is an endoparasite that inhabits the serous cavity of the abdomen in the human host. It lives within the mesenteries, peritoneum, and in the subcutaneous tissue. Morphology Like other nematodes, M. ozzardi is a cylindrical and bilaterally symmetrical worm, with a pseudocoel, or a false body cavity. The exterior of the parasite, the cuticle, is a protective layer that can withstand the harsh environment in the digestive tracts of the human hosts. M. ozzardi and other nematodes have longitudinal muscles that run along the body wall. They also have dorsal, ventral, and longitudinal nerve cords connected to these longitudinal muscles. In the adult stages of M. ozzardi, the females are larger than the males. M. ozzardi is usually smaller than those Onchocerca Volvulus (that causes human onchocerciasis) when both species co-exist; especially in some rural areas in Brazil, within the Amazonian onchocerciasis focus. M. ozzardi microfilariae from a thick blood smear: The sample was stained with Giemsa solution for easier visualization under the microscope. Reproduction This is a dioecious species; the female is believed to release a pheromone to attract males.Prior, J. \\"Mansonella ozzardi.\\" Animal Diversity Web. 2003. (17 May 2009). When the male finds the female, he will coil around the female over the genital pore. The male's spicules are used to hold the female during copulation. The females are ovoviviparous. The sperm of a nematode lacks a flagellum. Its motility is due to its amoeboid-type cell. Geographic range This is a New World parasite. It is prominent in the subtropical, tropical, and temperate regions of Central and South America (Mexico, Panama, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina), and the Caribbean.Medeiros, J. F. et al. 2009. Mansonella ozzardi in Brazil: Prevalence of Infection in Riverine Communities in the Purus Region, in the State of Amazonas. Mem√≥rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz 31: 169-177 The prevalence of M. ozzardi in Brazil is very high; about 44-52% of Brazilian farmers are infected. It is also prevalent with the American Indian population. Many transmission hotspots in the Amazon Basin map to indigenous communities. Endemicity levels vary widely among rural villages, situated a few kilometers apart along the same rivers in the western Amazon Basin of Brazil Rozendaal, J. A. 1997. Vector Control: Methods for Use by Individuals and Communities. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 412 p. Lifecycle # An arthropod (black fly or biting midge) will take a blood meal from a human and will insert its third-stage filarial larvae into the human host. # The larvae will then become adults and will inhabit the peritoneal spaces and adjacent locations. # The adults will mate and produce unsheathed microfilariae. These microfilariae will go to the bloodstream. # An arthropod will take a blood meal from an infected human and ingest the microfilariae. # In the arthropod, the microfilariae will travel from the midgut to the thoracic muscles. # In the thoracic muscles, the microfilariae will develop into the first-stage larvae. # Later, the microfilariae will further develop into the third-stage larvae. # The third-stage larvae will travel from the thoracic muscles to the arthropod's proboscis. This is the stage where the arthropod can infect a human when it takes a blood meal. right Transmission M. ozzardi is transmitted by two types of arthropods that feed on the blood of humans: biting midges (genus Culicoides) and blackflies (genus Simulium). In the Caribbean, M. ozzardi uses the biting midge as its intermediate host. The black fly serves as the intermediate host for the filariae parasite in the Amazon Basin and mainland South America. =Biting midge= Biting midge The biting midges are small flies that breed on sandy beaches near the sea. Some species also lay their eggs on decaying leaf litter, humus, manure, and partially rotten vegetation, in tree holes, and the cut stumps of banana trees. They feed on the blood of mammals, birds, reptiles, and humans. Their short mouthparts prohibit them from biting through clothing. As a result, they prefer to feed on the head or other exposed body parts. Blood meals occur throughout the day and night, but biting activity peaks during the early evening. Since individual bites can be painful, they are a cause of concern because they tend to attack in swarms of hundreds or thousands. Due to their small size, they can pass through mesh mosquito nets. =Black fly= Black fly The blackflies are larger blood-sucking flies that breed in fast-flowing streams and rivers. Their larvae can be found attached to submerged vegetation and stones of infected waterways. Blood meals occur during the day in the outdoors, especially along riverbeds. After a meal, the flies rest for 2‚Äì3 days on trees and other vegetation to digest the blood. Like the biting midges, blackflies attack their victims in swarms and their bites are painful. The bites may cause swelling, inflammation, and irritation that may last for weeks.Rozendaal, J. A. 1997. Vector Control: Methods for Use by Individuals and Communities. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 412 p. PathologySymptoms= The pathogenicity of M. ozzardi needs further research. Although the adult worms live in the body cavities and the mesentery, they seem to cause little or no harm to their human hosts. As a result, infected people rarely present any symptoms. However, a few clinical manifestations have been reported: # Moderate fever # Coldness in the legs # Joint pains, like articular pain or arthralgias # Headaches # Pruritus (itchiness) # Skin eruptions # Pulmonary symptoms # Lymphadenitis - inflammation of the lymph nodes # Adenopathy - enlargement of the lymph nodes # Hepatomegaly - enlargement of the liver M. ozzardi is also considered as a possible cause for corneal lesions. Even though there is no significant evidence for it, but in certain regions in Central and South America where both M. ozzardi and O. volvulus co-occur, skin biopsies have always showed that onchoserciasis is the cause for corneal lesions. =Diagnosis= Microscopic examination is the most practical diagnostic tool used to identify the M. ozzardi microfilariae in blood samples from infected patients. Blood smears are usually stained with haematoxylin or Giemsa to visualize the worms under the microscope.World Health Organization. ‚ÄúBench Aids for the Diagnosis of Filarial Infections.‚Äù 1997. (16 May 2009). Diagnosticians must not rely entirely on blood samples, since microfilariae have also been detected in the skin. Ultrasound may be used to detect the presence of the adult worms. Researchers are currently developing a polymerase chain reaction-based method of detecting the parasites in skin biopsies.Ewert, A. et al. 1981. Microfilariae of Mansonella ozzardi in Human Skin Biopsies. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 30: 988-991. Because M. ozzardi harbors the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia, doxycycline may be an effective therapy to eliminate adult worms. However, no trials with doxycycline (either alone or in combination with ivermectin) have been conducted for M. ozzardi infection. =Treatment= Ivermectin is the treatment of choice for M. ozzardi infections. It is a potent macrocyclic lactone that binds to chloride channels, which then open and allow chloride ions to enter the affected cells. These cells hyperpolarize, resulting in muscle paralysis in the M. ozzardi microfilariae. This allows host immune cells to adhere to the microfilariae surface and facilitate their elimination. Ivermectin is unable to kill the adult worms.Richard-Lenoble, Dominique et al. 2003. Ivermectin and Filariasis. 17: 199-203. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) also has been used in treating filarial infections. While DEC works well against many filarial parasites, it is not effective in treating M. ozzardi microfilarial infections.Bartholomew, C. F. et al. 1978. The Failure of Diethylcarbamazin in the Treatment of Mansonella ozzardi Infections. Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 72: 423-424. Disease control Aside from ivermectin, preventive measures can be taken by individuals living in areas endemic to M. ozzardi. Since biting midges cannot bite through clothing, those living in the Caribbean should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to decrease the body parts exposed. Insect repellents could also be used to cover body parts not protected by clothing.Rozendaal, J. A. 1997. Vector Control: Methods for Use by Individuals and Communities. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 412 p. Communities should also maintain the natural vegetation around them to decrease the possible breeding grounds for the biting midges. In South America, the best way to control the population of blackflies, and the transmission of M. ozzardi, is to apply insecticides specific for blackfly larvae to streams and rivers. Application of insecticide to a specific breeding site also kills larvae in breeding sites up to 10 km downstream. Extensive networks of waterways must be treated with insecticide since blackflies have the ability to fly with the wind for several hundreds of kilometers. Individuals should also avoid the waterways whenever possible. References * Lima, N. F., Veggiani Aybar, C. A., Dantur Juri, M. J., & Ferreira, M. U. (2016).

Early life and education Miles was born Emma Bell in Evansville, Indiana on October 19, 1879. Her parents, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Ann Mirick Bell, were both schoolteachers. Emma's early childhood was spent in Rabbit Hash, Kentucky, a small town on the Ohio River near Cincinnati. When she was nine, her family moved to the area that is now Red Bank, Tennessee and then to Walden's Ridge (now Signal Mountain), Tennessee. A talented young woman, she left home to study art in St. Louis, Missouri. Homesickness forced her to return to Walden's Ridge after only two years. There she fell in love with George Franklin Miles, (known as Frank) and, only three weeks after her mother's death, married him in spite of her family's opposition. Emma and Frank had five children, twin daughters Jean and Judith in 1902, Joe in 1905, Katharine ‚ÄúKitty‚Äù in 1907, and Frank Mirick ‚ÄúMark‚Äù in 1909. Emma was devastated in 1913 when Frank Mirick died from scarlet fever. Career as writer Emma and Frank struggled to make ends meet and often their major source of income was from Emma's short stories and poems. She also made money selling her art, often in the form of small items such as greeting cards. In 1904 Emma sold her first poem to Harper's Monthly. An eleven-verse poem titled ‚ÄúThe Difference,‚Äù appeared in the March issue. She followed that up the next month with another poem, ‚ÄúHomesick,‚Äù written when she was living in St. Louis. Emma's major success was The Spirit of the Mountains published in 1905. This genre-defying book has elements of local color, short story, travel narrative, personal memoir, and cultural analysis. The music chapter in Spirit of the Mountains was first published in 1904 as an article titled ‚ÄúSome Real American Music‚Äù in Harper's Monthly. It was probably the first appreciation of Appalachian music to appear in a popular magazine, and it was certainly one of the first to appear anywhere at all, following by only four years the early academic writing on the subject by William Wells Newell in the Journal of American Folklore. She also wrote articles for local newspapers, the most popular of which were entitled The Fountain Square Conversations, a fanciful series in which birds gather at a fireman's memorial fountain in downtown Chattanooga and have philosophical conversations on life. Emma's book, Our Southern Birds, was published in 1922. Her journals also contain several references to manuscripts of other works, including The Good Gray Mother and Our Southern Flowers, that were never published and have not been located. Emma's poetry, journals, and short stories were later published in Strains from a Dulcimore (1930), Once I Too Had Wings: The Journals of Emma Bell Miles, 1908-1918 (2014), and The Common Lot and Other Stories: The Published Short Fiction, 1908-1921 (2016). Emma and Frank had a difficult marriage. They and their children often suffered from poverty and hunger, and Emma was sometimes bitter about Frank's inability to find paying work to support the family. At one point she notes in her journal that her daughter, Jean, had run away and then she adds ‚ÄúI don't blame her.‚Äù Emma and Frank separated a number of times, and during these times Emma lived in the Francis Willard Home for Women in Chattanooga, in order to make money in town. Emma proved to be a darling of society, and she often gave lectures which were highly regarded and well received. Emma also held the post of writer-in- residence at Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate, Tennessee for one term. Yet no matter how much Emma enjoyed the intellectual life of the city, she always returned to her simple life on the mountain with her husband. For two months in 1914 Emma had a salary from the Chattanooga News and she was able to pay all of the family's bills. But life in the city would have been unbearable without weekends in the country and that June she became pregnant and had to give up the job.

The Albano lane system is a method of marking kayak, canoe and rowing race courses using lines of buoys. It was first used internationally in the 1960 Summer Olympics held on Lake Albano, Italy. It has since become an international standard for most FISA events and is used in Olympic rowing events. Technical description The marked course is typically straight, and 2000 meters in length. The buoy system usually consists of six adjacent 13.5 meter-wide lanes, outlined by 7 lines of small, spherical buoys placed 10 or 15 meters apart. The buoys are red for the first and last 100 meters, the rest being white.Rowing Faster by Volker Nolte. Human Kinetics. 2005. SBN13: 9780736044653 The six lanes are used for racing, and there may also be a separate lane for boats moving from the end of the course to the start line (the up channel). Some courses have as many as eight racing lanes.http://www.rowontario.ca/Groups/Documents/Documents/MastersChampsBidDocumentFINALMarch182009.doc  HOSTING & BID GUIDELINES For the ROWONTARIO Masters Rowing Championships Regatta Distances along the course are often marked at intervals, usually every 250 metres, with prominent numbered signs on the shoreline. The lane buoys remain in place in most water and weather conditions due to longitudinal wires that are suspended from the buoys at a depth of about 1.5 metres. Depending on local conditions, cross links between the longitudinal wires are attached every 500 metres along the course.Rowing Olympic Handbook of Sports Medicine Ed. by S. Volianitis and N.H. Seche. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007. . Chapter 1: History. The system is anchored at intervals and tensioned with weights both in the water and on the shore. This allows the entire system to ride up and down with varying water levels. In some locations, the entire Albano system can be removed from the racecourse in as little as four hours.

The series characterizes itself as a cyberpunk action adventure game. The first game, named Baldr Sky Dive1 \\"Lost Memory‚Äù was released in Japan on March 27, 2009, for Windows. The second game, Baldr Sky Dive2 \\"Recordare\\" was released in Japan on November 27, 2009. A fandisc called Baldr Sky DiveX \\"Dream World\\" was released in Japan on September 24, 2010. An English version containing both Dive1 and Dive2 was released by Sekai Project on December 20, 2019. Gameplay A majority of Baldr Sky's gameplay consists of reading the text that's rendered on screen and supported with audio for voices. The player will occasionally be presented with choices to select which may or may not determine the outcome of the game. As Baldr Sky has multiple endings, the player will have to replay the game multiple times in order to view all of the endings. Similar to other games in the Baldr series, Baldr Sky is also driven by a top-down 2D interface where the player controls a mecha in sprite form to combat enemy machines. The player is given a chance to upgrade or modify the equipment of the mecha prior to a series of battles. PlotSetting and themes= Baldr Sky takes place in Japan some time in the future during the 21st century. Nanomachines have become commonplace and have taken a major role in society. The abilities of these nanomachines range from medical purposes for curing ailments and modifying the taste of food. A new generation of humans now also have a chip embedded in them which allows them to be connected to the Internet at all times. With the dawn of these new technologies, warfare has expanded beyond the physical world onto the virtual world. People engage in combat online in simulacrums, the name of the mecha units in the game, or with viruses (unmanned robots). =Story= The story of Baldr Sky revolves around the male protagonist and is told through two timelines, the present and the past through flashbacks. At the beginning of the story, Kou is suffering from memory loss, so much of the back story about the past is told through flashbacks while Kou is recalling his memories with the aid of medical nanomachines. In the present, Kou and his subordinate, , are after a group of scientists who had inadvertently triggered a hazard due to leaking of a developing nanomachine. The city and the surrounding area that the lab is located in is ultimately demolished but the scientists had actually evacuated to safety from the lab before the place was destroyed. Kou wishes to uncover the truth about what happened that day and to prevent another tragedy from occurring again, as his girlfriend Sora was killed by the nanomachines. =Characters= ; : The protagonist of the story. A free mercenary and an excellent simulacrum pilot. Kou has been chasing after the truth behind the incident known as \\"Gray Christmas\\", in which he lost the person most precious to him. As he recovers his memories and experience new ones, he reaches closer to the truth. ; : A mercenary and Kou's subordinate. Referring to Kou as Lieutenant, she becomes the one to guide the amnesiac Kou. Like a commander, she scolds and encourages Kou whenever he is in the midst of confusion at times. Even though she is polite and gentle, her gestures and expression often give people a cold impression. Rarely letting out her emotions, she often remains composed. She is merciless towards enemies. Her actions usually put Kou's safety as top priority, so much that she may even give up her own life for Kou. ; : Kou's friend that lived with him in the Kisaragi dormitory. She disappeared after Gray Christmas, but later reappeared before then undergoing memory restoration process Kou, dressed in an army uniform and heavily cyborgized. ; : Kou's childhood friend, a year younger. She lost her parents due to a bomb. Now she's a keeper of an internet cafe. ; : Kou's second cousin who he considers as his sister. She's a \\"wizard\\" - a genius programmer in the virtual world. Kou's simulcrum is her gift when he was moving to Kisaragi dormitory. She works in the corporation of Kou's aunt, Ark Industry. ; : Sora's little sister, she met Kou who saved her from bullying by her peers due to her illness. Later moved to Kisaragi dormitory. ; : Makoto's older sister, whom she heavily adores. She died in the accident, called \\"Gray Christmas\\". ; : Kou's best friend, who loves women and mecha. Moved with Kou in Kisaragi dormitory when they lost their previous place due to a certain incident with their upperclassmen. ; : A woman with a childlike appearance, and a capable underground doctor, who lives in the Suzushiro City's slums.

The opening theme for Dive2 is \\"jihad\\", also by KOTOKO. Development Baldr Sky is the third game in the Baldr series following Baldr Force and Baldr Bullet \\"Revellion\\". Character designs were, like the other two games in the series, by Seiji Kikuchi. Music composition was provided by Tgz Sounds, Barbarian on the Groove, and LittleWing. =Release history= Prior to Dive1's release, GIGA released a demo of the game's prologue chapter online on the Internet on January 23, 2009. The full game was released about two months later on March 27, 2009. On September 24, 2010, GIGA also published a fandisc called \\"BALDR Sky DiveX: Dream World\\", which included many scenes that weren't mentioned in Dive1 and Dive2, such as the memories of Kou while he was a mercenary with Rain. Baldr Sky \\"Zero\\", another game in the series, had been in production and released in March 2013. One of the new elements is a crossover between the Baldr Sky series and Jinki series (Jinki crossover in terms of art design). Reception According to the sales numbers on Getchu.com, a popular Japanese games shop, March 2009 sales ranked twentieth in the following month in April. In Getchu's user-voted rankings for games of 2009, Dive2 came in first overall, as well as first in the System, Scenario, and Music divisions, 4th in the Movie division (referring to the opening and ending animations for the game), and 10th in Graphics. Rain Kirishima and Sora Minazuki were voted the #1 and #3 characters in that year's Character division. Dive1 was awarded the Silver Prize in the Theme Song category in 2009's Moe Game Awards. In 2010, Dive2 won the Silver Prize in the Program category and the Gold Prize in the 3D category. In Getchu.com's 2010 game ranking, DiveX was ranked at 4th place in the System category, 8th place in the Movie category, and 18th overall. The story is rated as one of the best visual novels of all time, both on the Japanese review site Erogamescape and on the English-speaking site vndb.

Early life and marriage In Albania, when Zaimi was twelve and half years old, her father visited her in her bedroom and proceeded to tell her that she would have to begin wearing a veil whenever she went out of the house. When he handed her the veil, without saying a word, she opened the window and threw the scarf onto the neighbours roof where it remained for several days. Her father, angry, called her a \\"wild goat\\", the equivalent of tomboy in Albania, and left the room. This rebellious act would set the tone for Zaimi's adult life. Nexhmie was one of the first six girls (along with her brother Mehmet) to attend high school in Albania, run by American Presbyterian missionaries. While a teenager in Albania, her traditional family tried to force her into marriage. She ran away from Albania and became the first female from Albania to achieve a higher education at Wellesley College. She lived with relief worker Florence Spencer Duryea\\"Miss Zaimi will Marry Mr. Margolis\\" Brooklyn Eagle (29 December 1940): B3. via Newspapers.com and soon became an American citizen. While attending Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, she married Henry M. Margolis, an attorney and businessman, in the 1940s. They divorced in the early 1950s. She had one son, writer Eric Margolis. Work and publications In 1938, her autobiographical book Daughter of the Eagle was published and became a national best-seller. During World War II, she worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency). After the war, she took a very active role in Albanian-American affairs, becoming president of the Pan Albanian Association, Vatra. She aided Albanian immigrants and helped support her family in Albania. In the early 1950s, she was one of the first American female journalists to report from the Middle East. She interviewed Egypt's leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, and Jordan's King Hussein. She was also one of the first journalists to write and lecture widely about the Palestinian refugees, whose plight was virtually unknown at the time in the United States. She delivered a study to the US State Department in which she warned that unless the problem of the Palestinian refugees was resolved, it would blow up in America's face in fifty years. Her broadcasting and speaking careers were terminated after the newspapers for whom she wrote were pressured into dropping her writing, and constant threats were made against her life and that of her young son. During this period, Mrs Zaimi came down with severe glaucoma and other eye ailments that crippled her and prevented her from writing another book. She worked for the Albanian community in New York and New Jersey, translating at the New York Criminal Courts, and engaging in community activities and helping war refugees in Europe. She also lived for periods in Paris, Rome, Geneva, and Cairo. She was a strong voice in the US against Albania's Communist regime. Her Manhattan home was constantly filled with journalists, artists, writers, diplomats, UN personnel, and visitors from Europe and the Mideast. Due to the onset of blindness, Nexhmie Zaimi reluctantly left New York in the 1980s and moved to a retirement community in Santa Barbara, California. In her late 80s, she took over the care of three children from Kosovo who had been gravely injured by accident in a NATO airstrike. She continued to write her second book until her death. Remaining proud and defiant to the end, in 2003, her body finally gave out. She visited Albanian twice: first time in 1939, and second time in 1986 when she was expelled as persona non-grata from the communist authorities. In Albania and New York, she was widely known as \\"the First Lady of Albania\\". Italy had made her a 'Knight Commander of the Crown of Italy.'

It uses a claims-based access-control authorization model to maintain application security and to implement federated identity. Claims-based authentication involves authenticating a user based on a set of claims about that user's identity contained in a trusted token. Such a token is often issued and signed by an entity that is able to authenticate the user by other means, and that is trusted by the entity doing the claims-based authentication. It is part of the Active Directory Services. Details In AD FS, identity federation is established between two organizations by establishing trust between two security realms. A federation server on one side (the Accounts side) authenticates the user through the standard means in Active Directory Domain Services and then issues a token containing a series of claims about the user, including its identity. On the other side, the Resources side, another federation server validates the token and issues another token for the local servers to accept the claimed identity. This allows a system to provide controlled access to its resources or services to a user that belongs to another security realm without requiring the user to authenticate directly to the system and without the two systems sharing a database of user identities or passwords. In practice a user might typically perceive this approach as follows: # The user logs into their local PC (as they typically would when commencing work in the morning). # The user needs to obtain information from a partner company's extranet website, for example to obtain pricing or product details. # The user navigates to the partner-company extranet site, for example: http://example.com. # The partner website now does not require any password to be typed in; instead, the user credentials (in a secure assertion) are passed to the partner extranet site using AD FS. # The user is now logged into the partner website and can interact with the website as if logged in. AD FS integrates with Active Directory Domain Services, using it as an identity provider. AD FS can interact with other WS-* and SAML 2.0-compliant federation services as federation partners.

Although initially thought to be involved only in positive selection, thymic nurse cells have now been discovered to facilitate negative selection of thymocytes as well. Negative selection refers to the degradation of thymocytes, and has been found to occur through the help of lysosomes. Lysosomes are present near the nucleus in the cytoplasm of TNCs. If the internalized thymocytes are selected for negative selection, vacuoles containing the thymocytes move closer to the area with lysosomes and eventually fuse with the lysosomes. This leads to the degradation of the T cells within the vacuoles.Samms, Michael, et al. \\"Lysosomal-mediated degradation of apoptotic thymocytes within thymic nurse cells.\\" Cellular immunology 197.2 (1999): 108-115. Macrophages have also been found actively moving in and out of the vacuoles inside the TNCs during the times of high apoptotic activity suggesting their involvement in the elimination of negatively selected T lymphocytes.Reyes Garc√≠a, Mar√≠a Guadalupe, and Fernando Garc√≠a Tamayo. \\"The importance of the nurse cells and regulatory cells in the control of T lymphocyte responses.\\" BioMed Research International 2013 (2012). MHC restriction within TNCs Whether the thymocytes undergo positive or negative selection is determined through MHC restriction, which refers to the interaction between the Œ±Œ≤TCR (Œ±Œ≤ T cell receptor) of the T cells and MHC antigens on the antigen-presenting cells.Martinez, Marcia, et al. \\"Thymic nurse cell multicellular complexes in HY-TCR transgenic mice demonstrate their association with MHC restriction.\\" Experimental Biology and Medicine 232.6 (2007): 780-788.Ohigashi, Izumi, Mina Kozai, and Yousuke Takahama. \\"Development and developmental potential of cortical thymic epithelial cells.\\" Immunological reviews 271.1 (2016): 10-22. This role of MHC restriction was observed in a study conducted by Martinez et. al in HY-TCR transgenic mice. Since HY is a male specific antigen, the developing thymocytes would be expected to undergo degradation in males but not in females. However, both males and females were found to contain TNCs. Furthermore, female mice TNCs were found to contain five times more thymocytes than male mice, and less than 4% of them were apoptotic compared to almost 50% in the male TNCs. Also, almost 90% of all thymocytes extracted from the female TNCs were found to be double positives (CD4+CD8+), whereas no such phenotype was present within the male thymic nurse cells. Thus, since not all thymocytes internalized by TNCs went through apoptotic pathways, this was used to conclude that thymic nurse cells are involved in MHC restriction process. Negative selection has been proposed to occur when the Œ±Œ≤TCR in developing T cells interact with MHC present on antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages with strong affinities, which then leads T cells down the apoptotic pathway inside the TNCs. Similarly, extremely weak affinities lead to the death of T lymphocytes through neglect. Only intermediate affinity interaction between the Œ±Œ≤TCR of the T cells and MHC antigens in the TNCs results in positive selection.C Guyden, J., et al. \\"Thymic Nurse Cells Participate in Heterotypic Internalization and Repertoire Selection of Immature Thymocytes; Their Removal from the Thymus of Autoimmune Animals May be Important to Disease Etiology.\\" Current Molecular Medicine 15.9 (2015): 828-835. Thymocytes uptake The thymic cortical cells take up early thymocytes migrating from the bone marrow to the thymus and form the thymocyte-TNC complexes. The formation of finger-like projections has been found to facilitate this uptake; which also requires the participation of membrane and cytoskeleton proteins of TECs and thymocytes. Other players that mediate this process are ICAM-1, which is a cell adhesion molecule found on the surface of vacuoles and TNCs, and other extracellular glycoproteins like fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen, which are produced by TNCs. Similarly, the cytoplasmic vacuoles present in the cytoplasm near the membrane network also facilitate the uptake of thymocytes that have been negatively selected to undergo apoptosis. The molecules like gal-3 (Galectin-3) and gal-1(Galectin-1), on the other hand, produce antagonistic effects. They inhibit thymocytes/TEC interaction and affect the movement of thymocytes in and out of TNC, in particular by increasing thymocyte release from TNCs. Thymocytes within TNC Incubation of TNC at 37¬∞C in tissue culture releases thymocytes (TNC-T) present within it.Vakharia D.D.\\"Demonstration of keratin filaments in thymic nurse cells (TNC) and alloreactivity of TNC-T cell.\\"Thymus 5.1(1983):43-52.Dilip Dwarkadas Vakharia.\\"Thymic Nurse Cells in the Mouse.\\" PhD thesis, UCL, UK (1983):1-205.https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.759963 Incubation of TNC at 4¬∞C or room temperature inhibits release of TNC-T. Incubation of TNC at 37¬∞C in presence of 0.1% sodium azide prevents the release of TNC-T from within even though the TNC-T are viable. This suggests that metabolic activity of epithelial thymocyte complex is essential for the release of TNC-T. TNC-T are functionally mature than those external to TNC (ET).

Unlike ET, mouse TNC-T cells proliferate following stimulation with alloantigen , mitogen and help B cell make antibody when tested in tissue culture experiments. Chicken TNC-T cells exhibit greater graft vs host reactivity than peripheral blood T cells or ET cells when TNCs from one strain of chicken were placed on egg choriallantoic membrane of another strain of chicken with different MHC antigen . Based on the observation that TNC harbor functionally mature population of TNC-T and the electronmicroscopic studies suggesting that TNCs are localized in close proximity of blood capillaries in both cortex and cortico-medullary region of thymus, Vakharia & Mitchison have hypothesized that TNC-T are potential thymus emigrant cells.

Origins Caireall mac Curnain was a member of the Soghain people of Ireland, specifically those located in the kingdom of that name in what is now east County Galway. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh identified them as part of a larger group called the Cruithin, and stated of them: \\"Of the Cruithin of Ireland are the D√°l Araidhi (D√°l nAraidi), the seven L√≥igisi of Leinster, the seven Soghain of Ireland, and every Conaille (see Conaille Muirtheimne) that is in Ireland.\\" The Soghain of Connacht were described by Se√°n M√≥r √ì Dubhag√°in in his poem Triallam timcheall na Fodla where he states that: \\"The six Sogain let us not shun/their kings are without oblivion/Good the host of plundering excursions/to whom the spear-armed Sogain is hereditary.\\" While the Book of Lecan lists their six branches as Cinel Rechta, Cinel Trena, Cinel Luchta, Cinel Fergna, Cinel Domaingen and Cinel Deigill. Kerrill's genealogy is given as Caireall mac Curnain mac Treana mac Fionnchada mac Nair mac Earca mac Tiobraide mac Sodhain Salbhuidhe mac Fiacha Araidhe. His grandfather, Treana mac Fionnchada, was the eponym of the Cinel Trena, who were apparently located close to Knockma as evinced by the placename T√≠r Mhic Trena (the land of the sons of Trena). Mission Local tradition maintains that Saint Patrick did extensive missionary work among the Soghain. Kerrill was a disciple of Saint Benan of Kilbennan, Tuam. Benen was born in T√≠r Ailill, County Sligo, though his mother was from Kilbennan. Benen's grandfather, Lughaidh mac Netach, gave his fort at Kilbennan to St. Patrick to establish a fort over which he placed Benen, who set it up as a training school for evangelists. Kerrill was apparently with Patrick when the latter founded a church at Tawnagh, Lough Arrow. Patrick made Kerrill a bishop and placed him in charge of Tawnagh. He also led the nuns who were under the care of Mathona, Benen's sister. Kerrill was later translated to Soghain, much of which Patrick had apparently reserved for him to evangelise. Legends told about Kerrill include his fight with an Oll-ph√©ist (terrible serpent) which was devastating the area about Cloonkeen. According to Joseph Mannion the story \\"is an echo of the enormous struggle which took place between Christianity and Paganism and the defeat of the Oll- ph√©ist by St. Kerrill symbolises his success as a Christian missionary in the area. The 'monster' in question, in all probability, refers to some pagan deity that was worshipped at this place in pre-Christian times ... Many similar stories are told ... at different locations throughout the country.\\" Kerrill is portrayed as having a rivalry with St Connell, whose eccleastical territory bounded Kerrill's. One outcome was a mutual cursing, in which Connell said May there be blood shed on every fair day in Kilconnell to which Connell replied May there be a funeral every Monday in Cloonkeen. To this day no funerals are held in Cloonkeenkerrill on Monday. Connell has been mistaken for Conainne, a female missionary and founder of Kilconnell. A miracle told of Kerrill stated that his intercessions with God allowed Cian√≥g n√≠ Cichar√°in to become pregnant after years of a childless marriage. She bore two daughters, who were the respective ancestors of Brian Boru and the √ì Conchobair Kings of Connacht. Kerrill was important enough to be rated the second Patrick of that fifth (i.e., province). There is a 14th Century Roman Catholic Church named Cille Choirill in Glen Spean, north of Ben Nevis, in the Lochaber district of the Scottish Highlands. Local tradition maintains that it is named for the same St Kerrill whom it is believed, evangelized in the area before returning to Clonkeenkerril in East Galway. Though the scholarship now may doubt the connection between the Irish Cruithin and the Scottish Picts, is it not interesting that Kerril was from the Soghain Cruithin people then went to preach to people fairly inland in the Scottish Highlands and therefore probably still Pictish in culture?

Seventy-four were built. The Germans seized forty when they occupied Bohemia- Moravia in March 1939; there is no record of their use. The Slovak Republic inherited thirty at the same time when it declared independence from Czechoslovakia. In Slovak service it only saw combat during the Slovak National Uprising.  Description  The Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33 was assembled from a framework of steel \\"angle iron\\" beams, to which armor plates were riveted. The driver sat on the right side using a observation port protected by of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter which had a slit. The gunner sat on the left and had a similar vision port half the size of the driver's. His ZB vz. 26 machine gun was mounted in a ball mount directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on the sides and the rear. The driver's machine gun was fixed and he fired it using a Bowden cable; 2,600 rounds were stored for the machine guns.Kliment and Francev, p. 46 The front armor was thick, the sides had a thickness of , the top was thick and the bottom plates were in thickness.

Transmission, reduction gear, differential, driving shafts and brakes were all taken from the Praga AN truck.Kliment and Francev, pp. 46-7 The suspension was a modified version of that used in the Carden-Loyd tankettes. It consisted of two small road wheels fastened together on a frame, two frames paired and sprung by leaf springs that made a wheel carrier, one wheel carrier per side. The track was guided by wooden, metal-lined frames. It had a ground pressure of only 0.5 kg/cm2. The vehicle could cross a ditch wide, climb an obstacle high and ford a stream deep.Kliment and Francev, p. 47  Development  The Czech Army bought three Carden-Loyd tankettes and a production license for them in 1930, ƒåeskomoravsk√° Kolben-Danƒõk building four copies that same year as prototypes for future orders. The Carden-Loyds were evaluated during the Fall maneuvers and revealed numerous problems: the crews had very poor vision through the narrow slits, the machine gun had a very narrow field of fire, and the crewmen had a difficult time communicating. Furthermore, they were slow, underpowered and often broke down. One of the P-1 prototypes was rebuilt to address these issues with additional vision ports in all directions, internal ammunition storage and the machine gun's field of fire increased to 60¬∞. It was extensively tested during 1931‚Äî2 and a few other changes were made as a result. The armor was increased from and from and a fixed machine gun was added for the driver. Two of the other prototypes were rebuilt to the same standard; all three were officially accepted by the Army on 17 October 1933. The other prototype was eventually given to the Shah of Iran. The order for seventy was placed on 19 April 1933, all being delivered by October 1934.Kliment and Francev, pp. 44-5  Operational history Czechoslovakia= The 1934 Fall maneuvers validated the misgivings of many in the Army. The gunner had trouble holding his weapon at speeds over and could not lay it properly at all. The driver could not use his machine gun in addition to driving the vehicle. The vehicle had trouble negotiating the terrain, and proved unsuitable for reconnaissance because, while \\"buttoned- up\\", the crew could only see the road ahead of them. The lack of a radio made coordination among vehicles in a platoon or larger-sized formation impossible.Kliment and Francev, p. 45 While used as a substitute for the light tanks not yet in service during 1934‚Äî36, the Army decided to organize them in three-vehicle platoons, and assigned them to support units in the border areas. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938. They were also used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They helped to screen the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938.Kliment and Francev, pp. 162-4 =Germany= The Germans captured forty Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33s when they occupied Czechoslovakia, but there is no record of their use so they were presumably quickly scrapped or relegated to training duties. =Slovakia= The thirty Tanƒç√≠k vz. 33s formed one platoon in the Armored Battalion \\"Martin\\" formed by the Slovak Army in mid-1939, but they were relegated to training duties during 1940.Kliment and Nakl√°dal, pp. 36-7 They saw some use by the insurgents when the Slovak National Uprising began in September 1944, but little is known of their activities.

History EVIPNet grew out of discussions at the Ministerial Summit on Health Research held in Mexico City, November 16‚Äì20, 2004. Following the Summit, the World Health Assembly which governs the World Health Organization passed Resolution 58.2, 4-5 endorsing the \\"Mexico Statement On Health Research: Knowledge for better health\\" developed during the Summit.Hamid M, Bustamante-Manaog T, Dung TV, Akkhavong K, Fu H, Ma Y, Zhong X, Salmela R, Panisset U, Pang, T. EVIPNet: translating the spirit of Mexico. The Lancet. 2005. 366(9499): 1758-1760. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67709-4 In the statement, Ministers of Health and delegates called \\"for national governments to establish sustainable programs to support evidence-based public health and health care delivery systems, and evidence-based health related policies.\\" Resolution 58.34 made a call \\"to establish or strengthen mechanisms to transfer knowledge in support of evidence-based public health and health-care delivery systems, and evidence-based health-related policies\\". Developments relevant to EVIPNet are regularly reported to the Advisory Committee on Health Research of the World Health Organization and of its Regional Offices. In March 2009 the EVIPNet Secretariat presented to WHO‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Health Research a capacity building strategy that assessed through a validated tool the knowledge needs with respect to a defined set of skills for EVIPNet teams, allowing a strategic and organized approach to capacity building. Similarly, WHO Regional Advisory Committees on Health Research monitor progress and provide key guidance to EVIPNet efforts. EVIPNet gained great momentum in Africa where policy briefs soon became available.Lavis JN, Panisset U. EVIPNet Africa's first series of policy briefs to support evidence-informed policymaking. Int. J. of Tech. Assessment in Health Care. 2010. 26(2): 229-232. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266462310000206. The enthusiasm had spread also to the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean, and after a coordination meeting organized by WHO in Addis Ababa in October 2015, it gained traction in the European region as well.World Health Organization. Regional Office for Africa. (2016). EVIPNetAfrica Meeting, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 14‚Äì16 October 2015: Final Report. World Health Organization. Regional Office for Africa. http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/204661 By then, the Global Steering Group working with WHO Collaborating Centers (e.g. WHO Collaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy, at McMaster Universit y)and specialized centers such as BIREME, the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information - had set up one-stop shops that enabled access to specialized collections of indexed policy briefs, systematic reviews, policy documents and other relevant resources, as one of the shared resources for the global EVIPNet networks. For example, the free access portals (with registration) of Health Systems Evidence and Health Evidence.Moat K. A., Lavis J. N..

European Journal of Public Health, Volume 27, Issue suppl_3, 1 November 2017, ckx187.642, https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckx187.642 In November-December 2016, PAHO's 46th Advisory Committee on Health Research convened and its report, issued in 2017, provided updates on EVIPNet and knowledge translation efforts in the Americas.Pan American Health Organization. 46th Session of the Advisory Committee on Health Research. (Washington, D.C., 28-30 November 2016). Washington, D.C.: PAHO; 2017. http://iris.paho.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/34305. The meeting was informed by a preliminary version of a Report on Strengthening Research Capacities in the Caribbean that described EVIPNet related technical cooperation in that region.Pan American Health Organization. Report on Strengthening Research Capacities for Health in the Caribbean, 2007-2017. Washington, D.C.: PAHO; 2017. Available at http://iris.paho.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/34342. In July 2018 The BMJ published a special series on the policy on research for health of the Pan American Health Organization (that applies to the Secretariat and Member States) featuring EVIPNet in the article on Advancing public health and health systems through evidence-informed policy in the Americas.Pantoja T, Barreto JM, Panisset U. Improving public health and health systems through evidence informed policy in the Americas. BMJ 2018;362:k2469.. Operation EVIPNet operated by forming country or regional-level teams composed of policy makers, researchers and representatives from other sectors (e.g. science & technology, education, civil society organizations, patient advocates, topic experts, local networks, etc.). These teams identify and address country priority topics where a perceived need to strengthen the systematic use of research evidence to inform decisions about policies for health has been identified. EVIPNet therefore includes components relevant to research and development and claims to help strengthen national health research systems. By providing a common purpose to team members EVIPNet facilitates that different sectors jointly address specific priorities and develop and use specific skills to assess research evidence and integrate it into policies. Frequent outputs of EVIPNet teams are policy briefs that integrate evidence with context and values on succinct and helpful documents that inform decisions by high level decision makers. Several EVIPNet teams have already delivered useful relevant outputs such as Policy Briefs and deliberative dialogues that have informed policy at national and local levels. To join EVIPNet country health authorities establish a formal commitment with the Secretariat and develop a work proposal. The Secretariat of EVIPNet is composed by staff from the research policy teams of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva and its Regional Offices. The EVIPNet Secretariat supports country teams so that they produce robust proposals. EVIPNet has Steering Groups (in the regional and global network) and resource groups in each region. These groups work with experts and networks to provide feedback and expertise to the country teams. The Secretariat works with country teams to identify and address skill needs and deliver targeted capacity building activities in collaboration with networks and partners (e.g. SUPPORT Collaboration, McMaster Health Forum, Cochrane Collaboration, etc.) Reception and impact As EVIPNet expands and develops it has been highlighted as a worthy approach featured in prominent strategy documents addressing development and capacity building for research for health. It remains relevant as reflected in the call to action issued at the Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health in Bamako in November 2008 by ministers and ministerial representatives from 53 countries. EVIPNet was also featured in at least 12 different presentations at the First Global Symposium on Health Systems Research (Montreux, Switzerland, 2010), and is frequently featured at Colloquiums of the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations, and Global Forums on Health Research (e.g. Bamako 2008, Havana 2009). EVIPNet has also allowed for the development of customized resources that have helped advance their work and knowledge about health systems research. For example, the SUPPORT Tools for Evidence Informed Policy Making (available in various languages), the Evidence Portal, or the McMaster Database on Health Systems Evidence with >1800 systematic reviews on health systems evidence. PAHO/WHO technical programs EVIPNet has also become a tool for PAHO/WHO technical programs offering an integrated approach to technical cooperation; in PAHO/WHO research focal points in country offices are part of EVIPNet teams, and technical programs have adopted EVIPNet methods to provide an integrated technical cooperation.

His annotated translation of Euclid's Elements in Russian is also well- regarded.Euclid's Elements (in Russian), an article in Great Soviet Encyclopedia.  Biography  Morduhai-Boltovskoi, a descendant of a Russian noble family, was born in 1876 in Pavlovsk, near Saint Petersburg. His father was a railroad engineer and high-ranking official in the Imperial Russian transportation ministry, and his grandfather was a general. In 1894 he entered St. Petersburg University where he attended courses by Andrey Markov, Aleksandr Korkin, Julian Sochocki and Dmitry Grave. He finished his dissertation under Konstantin Posse in 1898 and started in Warsaw Politechnic Institute. He continued to work in Warsaw alongside Georgy Voronoy, and became a professor at Warsaw University in 1914. In 1915, after Germany captured Warsaw in World War I, parts of Warsaw University were evacuated, and Morduhai-Boltovskoi with colleagues started working at Rostov University. He continued living in Rostov and working there until 1945, and from 1947 to 1950. In 1943-1945 and 1950-1952 he worked in Pyatigorsk, and in 1945-1947 -- in Ivanovo. Morduhai-Boltovskoi was the founder of mathematics research in Rostov. His students included Boris Levin and Nikolai Efimov. His son, Filaret Dmitrievich, was one of the leading Russian experts in hydrobiology.

However the first pioneers began to settle in Coast Rica in 1940 followed quickly by the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly being elected in San Jos√© in April 1941. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961. As of 2009 Bah√° º√≠s sources indicate the national community includes various peoples and tribes and over 4,000 members organized groups in over 30 locations throughout the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 13000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Pre- history ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan=  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. After mentioning the need for the message of the religion to visit the Latin American countries  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° continues: > ... becoming severed from rest and composure of the world, [they] may arise > and travel throughout Alaska, the republic of Mexico, and south of Mexico in > the Central American republics, such as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, > Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Belize... Following the Tablets and about the time of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s passing in 1921, a few other Bah√° º√≠s began moving to, or at least visiting, Latin America. =Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades= Shoghi Effendi, who was named  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bah√° º√≠ Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s vision to begin. In his cable he wrote: > \\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° > in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming > National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of > Bah√° º√≠ Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous > stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. > Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in > American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace > the light of the Faith of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and establish structural basis of His > World Order.\\" Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bah√° º√≠ North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bah√° º√≠s to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan (1937‚Äì44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah√° º√≠s the goal of establishing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bah√° º√≠s communities and assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America. Developments in Costa RicaFirst arrivals= In March 1940 Gayle Woolson came from the United States as the first pioneer to settle in Costa Rica. She was joined by Almalia Ford before April when they, along with four Costa Ricans, held a memorial service for the death of May Maxwell. There were four Costa Ricans convert to the religion by August 1940. In October 1940 the group was able to have printed a translation of a pamphlet authored by Shoghi Effendi characterizing the religion. By March 1941 there were 10 Bah√° º√≠s in San Jos√© and they were able to elect the first local spiritual assembly in San Jos√© in April 1941 and by November a study group was established in the Puntarenas Province. =Wider attention and movement= After starting plans in January 1941 for a radio broadcast by Ford covering Central and South America the broadcast was successfully accomplished November 26, 1941. By June 1942 magazines in Costa Rica were publishing stories on the religion including Repertorio Americano of Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Monge. After first arriving in Panama in January 1940 and working for a time in San Salvador John Eichenauer pioneered in Costa Rica starting October 1941 for a time and his activities were covered in local newspapers before he moved onto Honduras in 1942. He was drafted by June 1943 and left the area. Eichenauer would later play an important role in the re-development of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Germany. After the first conversions in January 1942 in April 1943 an assembly was elected in Puntarenas and by June a group studying the religion began in Alajuela Province. =Latin American connections= An All-American Convention was held in 1944, and Raul Contreras was the delegate from Costa Rica. At the same time, Gerardo Vega, of Costa Rica, was the first Latin-American native to pioneer when he began work in Panama. After 1946 Woolson became more involved in developments in Panama and a regional committee overseeing Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua was appointed. In January 1947 Panama City hosted the first congress of the northern Latin Americas to build a new consciousness of unity among the Bah√° º√≠s of Central America, Mexico and the West Indies to focus energies for the election of a regional national assembly. Its members were Josi Antonio Bonilla, Marcia Steward, Natalia Ch√°vez, Gerardo Vega, and Oscar Castro. By July 1947 Costa Rican pioneer Marcia Steward was appointed secretary of the committee and planning a periodical for the region. Secretary for this publication would be Guillermo Arias. Retrospectively a stated purpose for the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. =A new campaign= At the Panamanian conference Steward mentioned a campaign had begun and demanded her return to Costa Rica. It was explained more in May 1947 that she and others had advertised in major newspapers of several cities along these lines: > We are seeking people of good will to organize a Center of Study and > Teaching founded on the following principles (a formulation of Bah√° º√≠ > teachings). This movement already has affiliated groups established in all > the major countries of the world, which function by means of the collective > consultation of all their members. Without obligation, you may ask for > literature and every kind of information by writing to (address in San > Jose). From this advertising 45 enquiries came. In response to these letters individual letters were returned with pamphlets. Upon further letters pains were taken to answer questions and the enquirer was asked if they wanted to start a class in their area and receive Bah√° º√≠ literature. Over time and further communication further books were sent and then they were offered a declaration card, and if registered they were offered the chance to form a registered group. In this fashion groups of Bah√° º√≠s were established in Quepos, Lim√≥n, Turrialba, Ciudad Quesada, aka San Carlos, and Heredia. In 1947 there was an assembly elected in Quepos though the brief Costa Rican Civil War stopped its meetings for a time. By October 1947 this method was being used in Chile (and continued at least into 1966.) Chile returned the favor when Lucha G. de Padilla, wife of the former consul-general of Chile to the United States, came to Costa Rica in May 1948 after joining the religion by January 1942 though Costa Rica was increasingly sending out pioneers of its own. However, there was disruption in the community that required \\"re-activating\\" the community in San Jose by April 1950, other assemblies having failed to be re-elected though the regional committees continued operation. =Reforming the Costa Rican community= A regional National Spiritual Assembly for Central America in 1951 when also the Quepos assembly was re-elected. A letter of the regional assembly noted that \\"Considerable attention is being paid to stressing the need throughout the area of a much greater understanding of the administration of the religion. Local assemblies are being taught, by means of the National Teaching Committee and the Baha'i Bulletin to acquire a much higher concept of their own importance as governing bodies. They are being groomed slowly but surely to realize that they are not merely groups of nine people gathered together in a purely spiritual unity, but nine members of a governing body, gathered together to maintain order and peace in their own communities, resolve their problems through the medium of prayer and consultation and to devise efficient ways and means of spreading the Faith in the territory under their immediate jurisdiction.\\" The second and third meeting of the regional assembly was held in San Jose. And San Jose hosted the second election of the regional assembly in April 1952. Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker attended the convention. Another Hand of the Cause, Dhikru'llah Khadem, visited the reformed community in Lim√≥n in 1953. The 1954 elected regional assembly also met in San Jose and pioneers returned to Puntarenas and Heredia while the assembly of Escazu was again elected. In April 1956 Alajuela was again listed as an active community (but not an assembly yet.) In 1958 Esmarilda Thompson de Vega pioneered into the rural lands near Guanacaste. In July 1960 the last convention for the regional assembly was again held in San Jose. In 1961 Costa Rican Bah√° º√≠s elected their own National Spiritual Assembly with its seat in Uruca. The convention was attended by Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem. The elected assembly was composed of Esteban Canales, Richard Milkovich, Humberto Ulloa F., Theodore Cortazzi, Antonio Soto G., Jose Barquero, Edgard Gomez, Aaron Barnes, John Rutan. A number of pioneers came and went over the period into the 1960s and assembly statuses fluctuated - two assemblies were noted in 1963 in Escazu and San Jos√©.The Bah√° º√≠ Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bah√° º√≠ Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953-1963, Compiled by Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, page 48. In 1963 the members of the National Assembly, and thus participated in the first election of the Universal House of Justice, were Jose Baltodano, Aaron J. Bames, Esteban Canales, Theodore Cortazzi, Jean Dobbs, Richard Mirkovich, John Rutan, Antonio Soto, and Fernando Soto. Modern community Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Below you will find a number of internal and external projects Bah√° º√≠s in Costa Rica have entered into over the years. Meanwhile, there were developments in the religion in other ways too. In 1984-5 official and semi-official visits by distinguished visitors to the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre have increased and included the ambassador to Israel from Costa Rica at roughly the same time musicians from 14 countries met for an international conference for Baha'i musicians, including Charles Wolcott, which served as an exhibition of indigenous dance and music, a memorial to Bah√° º√≠s suffering Persecution and an opportunity to visit a local children's hospital, orphanage, a school and a local theatre to play for children and staff - two traveling musicians joined the religion during the conference. At the end of 1985 Costa Rica co-sponsored Resolution 40/141 of the United Nations General Assembly adopted by a vote of 53‚Äì30 with 45 abstentions concerning the human rights situation in Iran even though a number of Arab and Muslim delegations made it clear that they would support the resolution if, and only if, the references to the Bah√° º√≠s were deleted. About the same time the Bah√° º√≠s of Costa Rica hosted an awards banquet for Human Rights giving awards to Luis Demetrio Tinoco Castro, the original delegate from Costa Rica for the founding of the United Nations, and the first signatory of the first statement on human rights offered by the UN. In 1987 Bah√° º√≠s hosted an even at the national center by inviting people from Taiwan, Korea and Indonesia in Costa Rica to an International Bah√° º√≠ Dinner. Also in 1987 the Bah√° º√≠s of Costa Rica co-sponsored a Family Education for Peace seminar at University for Peace with the Society of the Friends (Quacker) at which a number of papers were presented from authors across North America. About 30 Bah√° º√≠s from eight countries participated in a similar seminar held with an interfaith prayer service for peace sponsored by (and at) the University for Peace and the government of Costa Rica in 1990 - the interfaith service was televised live in Costa Rica. =People= Ruth (n√©e Yancey) Pringle is among the Bah√° º√≠s who pioneered to Costa Rica, moving in 1953 and lived in various Latin American countries and served in various positions until she was named as a Continental Counselor in 1980 and then she lived many of her last years in Costa Rica until she died in 2003. Cecilia King Blake is among those that continued to arrive and lived there since the 1970s and is named as having an influence on the growth of the religion across Costa Rica and nearby countries. Hand of the Cause R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum visited Costa Rica in 1981 as part of visiting six Central American countries. In Costa Rica she met president Rodrigo Carazo Odio, one of his advisers and spent nearly an hour with the president's wife. She also participated in a weekend conference for believers, spoke at a large public meeting and a unity feast, and made a trip by air to Talamanca. =Indigenous peoples= After the national assembly sponsored a four-day Indian school in Amubri, Talamanca near the Sixaola River. In the national convention of 1964 members of the Talamanca and Terraba (see Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica) were among the delegates. In 1966 construction began on a new teaching institute on the Bah√° º√≠ endowment property in Alajuela and also in 1966 the community raised the number of assemblies from fourteen to twenty. In February 1970 pioneer family of Samuel and Teresa Garcia and their four children, native Costa Ricans, in February 1970 to the area of Guanacaste seeking to identify members of lapsed communities. Come April 1970 eight Local Assemblies were re-established following which a number of programs were initiated to solidify the understanding of some of these new Bah√° º√≠s. In 1980 two teams of Native American Baha'is from Alaska, Canada and the United States representing 10 tribes under the name Trail of Light traveled from the north to the south starting mid June and taught in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and finally Ecuador. While in Panama they gathered with more than 1,000 Guaymi Bah√° º√≠s joined by Costa Rican Guaymi, Talamanca, Teribe representatives and they agreed on founding a Native Council for the Panamanian and Costa Rican tribes. In 1984 a reprise of the 'Trail of Light' was undertaken when an international team of five Bah√° º√≠s spent 17 days in Guatemala; they were a Mapuche Indian from Chile, a Quechua from Peru, a Bribri from Costa Rica, and two Guaymis from Panama. A beautification project in 1984 was held in Guanacaste province inspired by the Bah√° º√≠ gardens on Mt. Carmel as well as reading prayers - thirty people joined the religion during the project. There was also a chance to record some Bribri chanted prayers which would be broadcast on the radio. A 1984-5 continuation of the 'Trail of Light' process brought Costa Rican indigenous Bah√° º√≠s into Veracruz Mexico. In 1988 Costa Rica was represented at the fifth Continental Indigenous Council among the 400 participants. =Youth= The first international Baha'i Youth Conference held in Costa Rica came about in 1972 two days after the Managua earthquake. However a minibus full of young people came through Honduras with only minor difficulties and two Nicaraguan youth got through. Total attendance was about seventy-five. 1977 also saw the first time a Bah√° º√≠ float was entered in one of the annualfestivals in Santa Cruz. A larger conference of about 200 gathered in January 1978. Some of the attendees, together with various adults, then took a trip into Guanacaste province where over a short time 14 new assemblies were founded and then they extended work into Meseta province (see San Ram√≥n for mention of this remote province) where several groups were re-contacted and a new assembly elected. In 1983 the Universal House of Justice recognized the twin youth conferences of Honduras and Costa Rica held in early March - a challenge representing a substantial increase in the number of youth Bah√° º√≠s - and called on them to consider the example of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in civilizing influences they should undertake individually and collectively. In the fall of 1984 a permanent site for the National Youth Institute was chosen and plans were developed for it to serve as a center for the arts and performance, agriculture and outreach programs. A television crew made up of two youth from EI Salvador, a Bah√° º√≠ from Venezuela, and two non-Baha'i volunteers filmed Costa Rica's 1988 international youth conference which was attended by 120 people for a program to be aired in El Salvador. =Women= In early 1976 Bah√° º√≠ women from many northern Latin American countries including Costa Rica gathered in El Salvador for a women's conference sponsored by the Continental Counselors of Central America and the event included meetings among the Bah√° º√≠s only as well as invited non-Bah√° º√≠s. Some of the attendees called for further meetings and in 1977 the National Women's Committee decided to sponsor monthly teas in communities all over Costa Rica which continued into 1979. The purpose of the teas was to give Bah√° º√≠ and non-Bab√°'√≠ women a chance to discuss their changing role in society, and also for non-Bab√°'√≠s to hear of the religion. Men have asked to attend and help though the focus of the discussions remained the role of women and the equality of women and men. In early 1977 an unusual conference, composed of 1/3 indigenous believers from across Central America - and some non-Bah√° º√≠ family members of them were allowed to fully attend the meeting - held in M√©rida, Mexico. Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico were priority goal areas for them. In early 1980 the Bah√° º√≠ Committee for the Education of Women and Children organized a day-long institute where one hundred children ages 3 to 14 and 35 adults participated in a village. In 1985 fifty-eight people from six of the seven provinces attended a Bah√° º√≠ Women's Conference which was planned to help strengthen contact between Bah√° º√≠ women of various groups in Costa Rica and to clarify the role of women in the religion. Presentations were made on the lives of May Maxwell and Martha Root and mentioned local Bah√° º√≠ women who pioneered to Costa Rica when the religion was first being established in Costa Rica. =Demographics= By 1975 there were thirty-eight assemblies in Guanacaste and a total of 50 across Costa Rica. The national community is made includes both citizens of the , Guanacaste, Puntarenas and Lim√≥n provinces, and indigenous peoples Bribri, Cabecar and Guaym√≠. The Bah√° º√≠s estimate the membership in Costa Rica at 4,000 members and has organized communities in over 30 locations throughout the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 13402 Bah√° º√≠s.

It is located in the southwest part of the old city of Scarborough running along the shore of Lake Ontario atop the western part of the Scarborough Bluffs. Birch Cliff has a large Irish population. About one-third of Birch Cliff residents are of Irish origin. The area was first developed as the home of the Toronto Hunt Club in 1895 when the region was still mostly farms and woodland. Around the club and number of cottages were erected, and one of these was named \\"Birch Cliff.\\" The Victorian dwelling (believed to exist today but significantly altered) was built on Springbank Avenue for John Stark, who named it after the birch trees along the edge of the nearby Scarborough Bluffs. This name was also adopted by the local post office, and became the name for the neighbourhood. History As the Beaches neighbourhood was built to the west, the region became the first part of Scarborough to be developed as a suburb to the city of Toronto during the 1920s. Unlike the rest of Scarborough, which was developed after the Second World War as automotive based suburbs, Birch Cliff began as a streetcar suburb when the then Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company began operations on Kingston Road, transitioned in 1921 as TTC streetcar line running along Kingston Road to Birchmount Road. As the most populated part of the borough, Scarborough's municipal council met in a building on Kingston Road beginning in 1922. Kingston Road became a busy shopping district. The R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant was completed in Birch Cliff in 1941. In 1932 construction for the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant began along Birch Cliff's waterfront. Completed in 1932, the water treatment plant was fashioned in an Art Deco style. The facility continues to function, and is operated by the City of Toronto government. Streetcar service east of Victoria Park ended in 1954 and transitioned as suburban bus route but during the post-World War II boom Kingston Road become a major thoroughfare for those living further east in the newer suburbs. Most of the shops closed. The area by the lake and the ravines remained a wealthy residential district, while further north is a more middle class portion of Scarborough. This area further north is sometimes referred to as Birch Cliff Heights. The westernmost portion of the neighbourhood, west of the Hunt Club, is known as Fallingbrook. It is closely linked to the Beaches. A notable section of the neighbourhood is the former Birch Cliff Quarry. This area is a former quarry that was first used as a quarry by the Toronto Brick Company. It covers a large area south of the railroad tracks, north of Gerrard, and east of Victoria Park. From 1954 to 1960 the old quarry was used as a landfill. In 1960 the landfill was shut down and the site was sold to a development company. At the time the Scarborough Expressway was planned to parallel the rail line, and the site would have thus been next to a major interchange. It was thus zoned for high density apartment buildings with 1,450 units. The plan was a tower in a park scheme similar to what was built to the north at Crescent Town. The expense of cleaning up the former landfill delayed to project, and in the interim civic activism stopped the Scarborough Expressway. Modern Jane Jacobs new urbanism also firmly rejects such suburban tower plans, but the area retains the original zoning and under Ontario Municipal Board the city is not allowed to revoke such a zoning. As of November 6, 2012, the Ontario Municipal Board has approved the \\"tower in the park\\" style development, to the remorse of many living in the community. Education Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute is one of two public secondary school located in Birch Cliff. Two public school boards operate schools in the neighbourhood. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular public school board, that operates one secondary school, Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute. In addition to secondary schools, TDSB also operates several elementary schools in Birch Cliff, including Birch Cliff Public School, Blantyre Public School, and Courcelette Public School. The Toronto Catholic District School Board is a public separate school board that operates one elementary school in the neighbourhood, Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic School, and one secondary school, Neil McNeil High School. Recreation Water feature in Rosetta McClain Gardens, a municipal park in Birch Cliff. The area is home to several municipal parks, including Birchmount Park, Crescentwood Park, Harrison Properties, and the Rosetta McClain Gardens. Parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. In addition to municipal parks, the city also owns Birchmount Stadium, a multi-purpose outdoor sports facility on Birchmount Road. The Birch Cliff neighbourhood also features access to the Waterfront Trail at the bottom of Warden Avenue.

The film was directed by Sheldon Wilson and stars Lou Diamond Phillips.  Plot  The Jersey Devil appears in quick flash glimpses in the very beginning of the film as it growls. After Cap (Alan C. Peterson) kills the man who sold him the Jersey Devil, Cap and his assistant Quinn attempted to bring the Jersey Devil into the carnival of the truck. Cap shoots it with a tranquilizer dart to calm the Jersey Devil down. However, as Cap's assistant heaves on the Jersey Devil in chains, it slashes at his eye, causing it to bleed. Cap eventually shoots the Jersey Devil with more tranquilizer darts which causes the beast to finally pass out. When the sheriff Atlas (Lou Diamond Phillips) comes to investigate Cap's carnival under the local pastor's requests, Cap takes him into the tent where the Jersey Devil is being kept for the opening show. The Jersey Devil growls at Atlas from inside its cage and Atlas, shocked at the Jersey Devil's hellish appearance, suggests that the Jersey Devil is not safe. During the opening show, the audience is shocked at the sight of the Jersey Devil. All except for the pastor's son Taylor (Matt Murray) and his friend Jesse who throws peanuts at the Jersey Devil from the audience. This angers the creature and the Jersey Devil eventually escapes from its cage and begins terrorizing the carnival. It throws a man inside the cage that it had been locked in and escapes the carnival right before flying into the Ferris wheel and injuring itself. Later the following night, the Jersey Devil finds Taylor and his friend hiding in an old barn in the forest when it hears a dog barking at it. The Jersey Devil goes after the dog as Taylor and his friend escape the barn. However, the Jersey Devil eventually finds Taylor hiding under a bridge as his friend hides in an old car. The Jersey Devil lands on the bridge and then looks under it to find Taylor, who it kills and dismembers. Later when Taylor's friend, who survived the incident, and his mother are driving down a road in the forest, the Jersey Devil attacks him through the car window and flies off with him. As the mother is gazing at the skies trying to find him, the Jersey Devil drops his dead body on the car right before killing the mother. Cap and his assistant later try to recapture the Jersey Devil by using tranquilizer darts. They stab Atlas' deputy to attract the Jersey Devil with the smell of his blood. However, as the Jersey Devil approaches, the deputy shoots at the beast right before dying, which causes the Jersey Devil to retreat. The Jersey Devil then sets its sights on Cap's carnival once more and kills several of his carnies. Cap later tries once again to recapture the beast by stabbing his own assistant to death to attract the Jersey Devil with his blood. The Jersey Devil soon arrives and sneaks up from behind Cap. Cap then shoots the Jersey Devil with his new tranquilizer darts that \\"have enough drugs in them to put an elephant to sleep for a week\\", which knocks out the Jersey Devil once more. When Cap is arrested for murder after Atlas discovers part of a tranquilizer dart in his deputy's back, the Jersey Devil awakens from the tranquilizer darts and arrives at the police station where it kills Cap. The pastor, who wants revenge on the Jersey Devil and the carnival for the death of his son, stabs the Jersey Devil in its shoulders with two tranquilizer darts. This eventually knocks out the Jersey Devil. However, when the pastor and his followers arrive at the carnival, the Jersey Devil awakens right before the pastor's eyes. The Jersey Devil growls at the pastor and then kills him. When Atlas arrives at the now burning carnival, he attempts to rescue one of Cap's carnies, Samara (Simone-√âlise Girard), and the Jersey Devil arrives to kill them as it lands on one of the RVs. The Jersey Devil chases Samara to the Ferris wheel where the \\"Gentle Giant\\" attempts to stop it. However, the Jersey Devil attacks and kills him. Atlas eventually rams the Jersey Devil into the Ferris wheel with a car in attempts to kill him. As the Jersey Devil is rammed into the Ferris wheel by Atlas, it growls at him from the front car window until the Ferris wheel eventually collapses on both of them. This finally kills both the Jersey Devil and Atlas. Before the Jersey Devil dies, its hand is seen collapsing.  Cast  * Lou Diamond Phillips as Atlas * Simone-√âlise Girard as Samara * Alan C.

Specifically, if f(n) is an arithmetic function and m(n) is a non-decreasing function that is ultimately positive and :\\\\liminf_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(n)}{m(n)} = 1 we say that m is a minimal order for f. Similarly if M(n) is a non-decreasing function that is ultimately positive and :\\\\limsup_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(n)}{M(n)} = 1 we say that M is a maximal order for f. Here, \\\\liminf_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} and \\\\limsup_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} denote the limit inferior and limit superior, respectively. The subject was first studied systematically by Ramanujan starting in 1915. Examples * For the sum-of- divisors function œÉ(n) we have the trivial result ::\\\\liminf_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{n} = 1 :because always œÉ(n) ‚â• n and for primes œÉ(p) = p + 1\\\\. We also have ::\\\\limsup_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma(n)}{n \\\\ln \\\\ln n} = e^\\\\gamma, :proved by Gronwall in 1913.

The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, and is part of the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, created in 1996. Campus Father Purcell started the first Catholic ministry for African Americans in Alabama, opening a dispensary in a rented house on Holt Street in Montgomery starting on June 2, 1934. Purcell received funds from Bishop Thomas Joseph Toolen, head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile in 1936 and purchased between Hill and Oak Streets, soon afterwards building and dedicating a church at the site to Saint Jude the Apostle in 1938. By 1938, the City of St. Jude had already treated 8,000 unique patients. =Church (1938‚Äì)Social center (1939‚Äì)= The social center was built soon after the church, in 1939. The City of St. Jude proposed that a \\"Campsite 4 Experience\\" Museum would be housed at the social center while raising funds to build an interpretive center. =School (1947‚Äì2014)= The first classes at the City of St. Jude were held in the basement of the 1938 church. St. Jude Educational Institute was not explicitly segregated, even though Bishop Toolen did not support integration, and early classes featured predominantly African American classes with some white students. During the 25th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches, former Alabama Governor George Wallace stood in the doorway of the St. Jude Educational Institute to welcome civil rights activists. =Hospital (1951‚Äì1985)= The St. Jude Catholic Hospital, which opened in 1951, was the first integrated hospital in the southeastern United States. It is also the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King's two eldest children, Yolanda and Martin Luther III. After being shot following the Selma to Montgomery march, Viola Liuzzo was taken to the hospital at St. Jude, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life. Although the hospital closed in 1985, the building was converted to low-cost apartments in 1992. Stars for Freedom During the final night of the Selma to Montgomery marches on March 24, 1965, an estimated 10,000 marchers camped on an athletic field in the St. Jude campus and watched the Stars for Freedom rally, featuring many celebrities. Performances were held on a makeshift stage consisting of empty coffin shipping crates topped by plywood sheets. The next morning, the crowd that marched from the City of St. Jude was estimated at 25,000, and the tail of the procession did not reach the Alabama State Capitol building until nearly ninety minutes after the leaders of the march. The pastor of St. Jude asked Bishop Toolen for permission to allow the marchers to camp overnight, which was granted, but Toolen warned the pastor \\"there would be consequences.\\" After the march, donations to the City of St. Jude decreased precipitously, since the primary contributors were white Catholics who \\"agreed with helping blacks, [but didn't] agree with Martin Luther King.\\" Some of the hospital employees also resigned in the wake of the march, and white students left the school. In 2008, the National Park Service recommended taking an offer from Alabama State University over the City of St. Jude for the third Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail interpretive center. After a fundraising effort, the City of St. Jude opened its own interpretive center in 2015.

It is a retelling of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast and is set in modern-day New York City. The film was written and directed by Daniel Barnz and stars Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens. Plot Kyle Kingson (Alex Pettyfer) is the arrogant and vain son of news anchor Rob Kingson (Peter Krause). Kyle bullies Kendra Hilferty (Mary-Kate Olsen), not knowing she is a witch; she transforms him into a hairless, scarred, heavily tattooed shell of his former self. If Kyle does not find someone who loves him by the next spring he will stay altered, permanently. Kyle is taken to live in a private house with their maid Zola Davies (LisaGay Hamilton) and the blind tutor Will (Neil Patrick Harris). Both are comforts to Kyle when his father, unable to deal with his transformation, has abandoned him. As spring nears, Kyle finds himself infatuated with Lindy Taylor (Vanessa Hudgens), a former classmate he had avoided. He rescues her drug-addicted father from two dealers, shooting one; the other vows to kill Lindy. Kyle persuades Lindy's father (Roc Lafortune) to allow her to move in with him. At first, Kyle uses a false identity and introduces himself as Hunter. He also refuses to see Lindy and hides from her, which angers her to the point that she stops speaking to him. Kyle eventually reveals his face and the two begin to warm up to each other. Kyle writes a letter professing his love for Lindy but does not give it to her for fear of rejection. He visits Kendra to plead for more time; she refuses, but agrees to restore Will's vision and grant green cards to Zola's three children in Jamaica if he gets Lindy to fall in love with him. The surviving drug dealer lands in jail. Kyle and Lindy visit Lindy's hospitalized father. He gives her the letter but regrets it when she tells him she considers him a good friend. Lindy calls him after reading the letter, but a heartbroken Kyle does not answer the phone. Persuaded by Will and Zola, Kyle goes to meet Lindy one last time before she leaves on a school trip to Machu Picchu. Kyle tells her to go, but as she leaves, Lindy tells him that she loves him, breaking the curse. Kyle's former self is restored but Lindy does not recognize him and tries to call Hunter but Kyle's phone rings instead. When Lindy realizes what happened, the two share a passionate kiss on the side of the street. After the curse is lifted, Will wakes up with the ability to see and Zola receives the green cards. Kendra approaches Rob Kingson's office as a new intern, implying that she will test Rob like she did Kyle. An alternate ending was filmed where Lindy gets kidnapped by the drug dealer, and Kyle gets shot while in the process of saving her. As he lies injured in his arms, she confesses her love to him, breaking the curse in a fashion more closely based on the book and the original Beauty and the Beast story.https://www.j-14.com/posts/beastly-movie-secrets-141199 This ending was not used in the official release, however, it was used in the official video game for the Wii.

I thought there was this kind of rawness and visceral qualities of those years. Being 18 and 19 and what those years are like. So, I wanted to translate that into this film as well. \\\\- Daniel Barnz, director of Beastly on writing the screenplay } The film is based on Alex Flinn's 2007 supernatural romance novel Beastly, and has been in production since CBS Films bought the rights in December 2007. In February 2009, it was announced by Amy Baer, President and CEO of CBS Films, that Daniel Barnz would direct the film and write the screenplay. Susan Cartsonis produced the film through Storefront Films and Roz Weisberg co- produced it. Initially, the executives wanted a late 2008 theatrical release; however, the WGA strike prevented that possibility. Baer expressed excitement about the director, saying, \\"Daniel's fresh vision makes him one of the most exciting directors of his generation. We are thrilled to partner with him as he brings his unique voice to arguably the most universally resonant myth in storytelling.\\" Barnz anticipated bringing an indie sensibility to Flinn's story. \\"It's a very commercial idea that I get to tell in a highly artistic fashion,\\" he said. Barnz also said; \\"There was this sort of hyper-modern version of this story and that it was told from his perspective, which we'd never seen before and thematically, because it's all about beauty and how you look and inner beauty that this was such a great story set in the teenage world and for teenagers, because it has such a great message to it\\". Barnz's script was inspired by the film Say Anything.... He \\"immediately fell for it, because [he] saw that there was an amazing opportunity to tell a modern version of this fairytale and [he] loved the idea of it.\\" Barnz was happy that the story would be told from the beast's perspective and that it focused more on the romance elements than the supernatural. =Design= Alex Pettyfer in prosthetics as the beast. The makeup includes 67 pieces; seven on his head and 60 tattoos and individual scars in his whole body. It took seven hours to apply the full-body makeup. In his role as Hunter, Pettyfer's appearance was altered with heavy makeup and prosthetics. Hunter's appearance differs from the description in the novel; he has no fur or fangs. Pettyfer was pleased with the revision; he said, \\"I was very happy to know I wasn't going to be furry. Question is, were you happy I wasn't furry? Well, I think the audience will be happy. This beast make-up is phenomenal. You're talking to someone who is a fanatic about it [prosthetics and movie make-up] and I've never seen anything that looks remotely similar to this.\\" The makeup consisted of 67 pieces; seven pieces went on his head and 60 tattoos and individual scars were applied after the full-body makeup. The facial prosthetics and tattoos took almost three hours to apply and the full body makeup took the artists six hours to finish. About his transformation, Pettyfer said, \\"It really affected me because as soon as I shaved my head it kind of put me in this weird place, the same place [Kyle is in after his transformation] which really helped me with the role a lot. But at the same time, it kind of is a challenge because you are fighting personally with your own problems off set, but then onset you have a great resource to go to.\\" Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc. designed and created the prosthetics and tattoos. Jamie Kelman handled Pettyfer's daily makeup application. Hudgens described the beast's look as \\"crazy\\" and that it moved her in \\"a really weird and peculiar way.\\" Several days before the announced production date, several members of the cast were photographed en route to a wardrobe studio for fittings. The costumes and clothing used in the film were designed by Suttirat Anne Larlarb. =Filming= Beastly was one of the first feature films to be produced and distributed by CBS Films; it had a budget of $17 million for filming and marketing. Production began on June 13, 2009 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and ended in August that year. The first clip of the official Beastly trailer was filmed in Chicago, and used Walter Payton College Prep High School as Buckston Academy High School. Old Montreal and Laval were used as filming locations, and Mount Royal Park in Montreal served as Central Park in New York and other outdoor locations. Local Montreal diner Place Milton was also used as a location, and was renamed Cafe Santiago for the film. Filming was completed in 45 days. The Quebec government announced on June 12, 2009 that it would increase its tax credit for foreign TV and film producers filming there from 25 per cent of labor expenses to 25 per cent of the entire budget of productions shot there. The producers of Beastly chose to film in Montreal before the announcement of tax-paying increase. Hudgens left for Montreal to film following the MTV Movie Awards. \\"I'm laid-back about it,\\" she said. On June 4, 2009, Hudgens and Pettyfer arrived in Montreal. Neil Patrick Harris also went to Montreal to shoot his scenes, and concurrently for his lead role in an independent film. Hudgens was the first to finish shooting in order to promote the film Bandslam. Re-shoots were conducted in 2010 due to the delays to the film's release and in order to \\"emphasize the romantic relationship between the two main characters\\". =Music and soundtrack= The film score was composed by Marcelo Zarvos. Songs by Swedish indie band Marching Band were featured in the film. Also featured was Natalia Kills' second single, \\"Wonderland\\". The film's soundtrack was released on March 1, 2011, and the score album was released on March 15, 2011; both albums were released by Lakeshore Records.

The 23-second teaser received comments from commercial websites. Annie Barrett of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Alex Pettyfer is giving off more of a (Disney pretty-boy) Gaston vibe than the Beast here.\\" A holographic poster was displayed in selected theaters. The first official poster was then released in early April 2010. A featurette video which includes clips from the film, was released in early February 2010. The full-length trailer premiered on April 19, 2010. A new trailer, featuring a new logo, the new release date and the song \\"Broken Arrow\\" by Pixie Lott, was released in late 2010. Merchandising CBS Films announced that clothing and accessories, social expressions and games would be produced to market the film. Among the products were proprietary and co-branded games and puzzles by Fundex; figures and bobbleheads worldwide by Bif Bang Pow!; costumes, masks and accessories for the US and Canada from Rubie's; and video games worldwide from Storm City. Release Beastly was expected to be distributed to theaters by CBS Films on July 30, 2010. However, the film's release was delayed until March 18, 2011, in order to avoid a clash with the release of Charlie St. Cloud, which starred Zac Efron, Hudgens's then-boyfriend with whom she had a strong following at the time. In January 2011, the release was moved forward to March 4, 2011. Alliance Films, based in Montreal, released the film in Canada under a deal with CBS Films. Sony Pictures handled international distribution. The first planned release date was July 30, 2010, but a few weeks after Charlie St. Cloud moved to a July 30 release, CBS films released a statement through Beastlys official Facebook page. CBS films would delay the release of Beastly because it would cause a \\"real dilemma\\" to fans of Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens' relationship. The film's new release date was March 18, 2011 to avoid clashing with films opening during summer 2010. However, the new date was four weeks after Pettyfer debuted in American cinema in I Am Number Four, and three weeks before the release of Hudgens' other film Sucker Punch. CBS Films distribution head Steven Friedlandere said, \\"There wasn't much left in the summer that we could move it to. We didn't want to go in fall, and the holidays are for four-quadrant movies. So we figured if we went to March, we'd have some school breaks happening around that time.\\" After a successful test screening, CBS Films decided on an earlier release date, March 4, 2011. The movie was released on Blu-ray Disc on June 28, 2011. =Critical reception= Beastly received mostly negative reviews, earning a 20% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes from 94 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. The critical consensus read \\"Fundamentally misguided, poorly written, and badly acted, Beastly adds little to the legacy of its timeless source material.\\" Adam Markovitz gave it a D- in Entertainment Weekly, commenting, \\"Spectacularly poor judgment in everything from acting to costuming (Olsen's Harajuku-troll get-up is scarier than her curse) puts Beastly right on the cusp of the so-bad-it's-good Hall of Shame.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said the film \\" more than lives up to its name with ultra-campy performances, high-glucose direction (Daniel Barnz), laughable dialogue, cheesy effects and a back-lot simulation of a Manhattan street that wouldn't pass muster on an after-school special.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, while noting problems with the plot and script, argued that these problems were largely acceptable within the confines of the genre, and were alleviated by the charm of the actors and the direction. He remarked that Barnz \\"showed imagination and sensitivity in his feature Phoebe in Wonderland and hasn't lost those qualities now that he's entered the world of the big budgets.\\" Claudia Puig wrote in USA Today that \\"This modern reworking of Beauty and the Beast has none of the charm of the Disney animated version. It's dogged by awkward dialogue, a ridiculous plot and lackluster performances, especially by the leads ...\\" A number of reviewers criticized that Kyle did not look genuinely ugly in his beast form, and could even be regarded as more attractive, thereby compromising the film's moral about \\"inner beauty\\" shining through physical ugliness. Beastly was ranked number 45 in The Times predicted \\"50 Biggest Movies of 2010\\". The film was screened at ShoWest and it drew enthusiastic reactions from the luncheon crowd of exhibition officials. =Box office= Beastly had the third largest weekend gross earnings behind Rango and The Adjustment Bureau. As of May 25, Beastly's total US gross is $27.9 million. It garnered $15.3 million more in other regions, making the film's worldwide gross earnings $43.2 million. =Accolades= 2011 Teen Choice Awards * Choice Movie Lip Lock - Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens (nominated) * Choice Movie Breakout Actor - Alex Pettyfer (won) Hudgens and Pettyfer were honored as ShoWest Stars of Tomorrow for their roles in Beastly.

He is the hero of the second book of the anonymous Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, a contemporary history of the Alfonso's reign. He was also the inspiration and historical basis for the play Munio Alfonso, the second by Cuban playwright Gertrudis G√≥mez de Avellaneda, first staged in Madrid in 1844. At some point‚Äîthe Chronica does not say when‚ÄîMu√±o murdered his own legitimate daughter because she was \\"consorting with a certain young man\\".Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris [hereafter CAI], II, 185. After repenting of the act he sought to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem but, at Alfonso's urging, the Archbishop of Toledo, Raymond de Sauvet√¢t, forbid him to go, instead requiring him to engage in continual warfare with the Andalusian Muslims as a penance. Mu√±o is first recorded under the year 1131 as the castellan of the castle of Mora in the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris. In that year an Almoravid army under Farax, governor of Calatrava, and Ali, governor of San Esteban, penetrated the Tajo valley and captured the then governor of Toledo, Gutierre Arm√≠ldez, at Alam√≠n near Escalona, and killed him. The governors of Escalona, Domingo and Diego √Ålvarez, were killed in another skirmish, and the governor of Hita, Fernando Fern√°ndez was also defeated on the same campaign. Mu√±o was captured on this expedition and imprisoned in C√≥rdoba. There he was tortured and deprived of food and drink until he was able to ransom himself after a few days with a large sum of gold, silver, livestock, and arms. He returned first to Toledo, then to Mora.CAI, II, 110‚Äì3. The author of the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris accuses Mu√±o of neglecting the castle of Mora, keeping it insufficiently stocked to resist a large-scale attack. Sometime before 1139, the castle was taken in Mu√±o's absence by Azuel and Abenceta, the Almoravid governors respectively of C√≥rdoba and Seville, who re-fortified and re-provisioned it.CAI, II, 141. Mu√±o, disgraced, refused to appear before the emperor, who immediately ordered the construction of more powerful fortress opposite Mora: Pe√±a Negra (nicknamed Pe√±a Cristiana), which he entrusted to Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez, the son of Fernando Fern√°ndez and his successor as governor of Hita. Mu√±o responded to his fall from favour by increasing his raids on Muslim territory. With the militias of Toledo, √Åvila, Segovia, Guadalajara, Talavera, and Madrid, he took a large amount of booty and killed many Muslim leaders. On hearing of his successes Alfonso called Mu√±o to court and made him vice-governor of Toledo, placing all the cavalry and infantry of the Trans-Sierra under his authority.CAI, II, 143‚Äì4. In 1143 he led the municipal militias of √Åvila, Segovia, and Toledo the campaign against C√≥rdoba that culminated in the Battle of Montiel. He returned to Toledo in a triumphal procession, with an enormous booty.CAI, II, 162‚Äì74. In the same year Alfonso gathered a large army of infantry and archery and camped on the Tajo near Toledo in preparation for a campaign against C√≥rdoba. He left Toledo in the care of Mu√±o and Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez, commanding them to stay at Pe√±a Negra and prevent the Almoravids from fortifying Mora.CAI, II, 176. While Alfonso was in Andalusia, Farax of Calatrava allied with the Almoravid commanders along the Guadalquivir intending to re-fortify Mora and prepare an ambush for Mu√±o. Before sunrise on 1 August Mu√±o with forty knights left Pe√±a Negra under the command of Mart√≠n in order to scout enemy movements in the hills near Calatrava. They captured a solitary spy hiding in cave, who was divulging the details of Farax's expedition when the Muslim governor's vanguard appeared on the horizon. Battle was immediately joined and the Christians were victorious. Mu√±o then returned to prepare with Mart√≠n for battle the next day, when the main body of Farax's troops would arrive. The next day (2 August) the Christians encountered the Muslims near the springs of the river Algodor. Mart√≠n was wounded in the fighting, but both sides withdrew without victory. Mart√≠n then returned to defend Pe√±a Negra. Subsequently, a second battle was fought in the open field. Mu√±o, realising that he was at a disadvantage, ordered his men to retreat to a large rock called Pe√±a del Cuervo. There beset by enemy archers, he was wounded by an arrow and died during the Muslims' third offensive. All of those who had climbed the rock with him also died, as did many of the Muslim leaders. Mu√±o's corpse was beheaded, as were those of many Christians, and his right arm and shoulder and right leg were also severed. The head was sent to C√≥rdoba to the house of the widow of Azuel, then to Seville to Abenceta, and finally it was carried to the Almoravid sultan Texufin and all over Morocco to pronounce Mu√±o's death. His arm and leg and the heads of his comrades were hung from the towers of Calatrava. Mu√±o's body and those of his knights were recovered by the citizens of Toledo and buried in the cemetery of Saint Mary there.CAI, II, 178‚Äì84. The author of the Chronica blames Mu√±o's fate on the murder of his daughter: \\"He did not pity his own daughter as the Lord pitied him in all of the battles which he had fought.\\" Then follows a citation of the Gospel of John, 8:7. In his capacity as leader of the Reconquista along the front south of Toledo Mu√±o's immediate successor was Sancho Jimeno the Hunchback, the leader of the militia of √Åvila.Powers, 46.

Throughout its history, settlement in the San Fernando Valley (usually called simply \\"The Valley\\") was shaped by availability of reliable water supplies and by proximity to the major transportation routes through the surrounding mountains. Native peoples and the coming of the SpaniardsTopography and early settlement= Before the flood control measures of the 20th century, the location of human settlements in the San Fernando Valley was constrained by two forces: the necessity of avoiding winter floods and need for year-round water sources to sustain communities through the dry summer and fall months. In winter, torrential downpours over the western-draining watershed of the San Gabriel Mountains entered the northeast Valley through Big Tujunga Canyon, Little Tujunga Canyon, and Pacoima Canyon. These waters spread over the Valley floor in a series of braided washes that was seven miles wide as late as the 1890s,Gumprecht 1999, p. 134 periodically cutting new channels and reusing old ones, before sinking into the gravelly subterranean reservoir below the eastern Valley and continuing their southward journey underground. Only when the waters encountered the rocky roots of the Santa Monica Mountains were they pushed to the surface where they fed a series of tule marshes, sloughs, and the sluggish stream that is now the Los Angeles River.Gumprecht 1999, pp. 11‚Äì15, 135‚Äì136 By the time the Spanish conquest of Mexico reached Alta California in 1769, successive groups of indigenous peoples, or Native Americans, had inhabited the area for at least 7,000 years.Gumprecht 199, p. 31 These peoples tended to settle on well-watered and wooded areas at the Valley's margins. The Tongva, who spoke the Tongva language, a Uto-Aztecan or Shoshonean language, had a series of villages in the southern Valley along or near the river, including Totongna (near modern-day Calabasas), Siutcanga (near Encino; means \\"place of the oak\\" in Fernande√±o) and Kawengna (which the Spanish would write as Cahuenga; it means \\"place of the mountain\\"). In the north-central Valley was an apparently permanent village called Pasakngna (Fernande√±o: Pas√©knga, of unclear etymology), in the lower foothills of the mountains near natural springs and a tule marsh. Other characteristic place- names of Tongva origin in the Valley include Tujunga (Fernande√±o: tuxunga, which means \\"place of the old woman\\") and Topanga (in Tongva, Topaa‚Äônga, and in Fernande√±o, Tup√°‚Äônga, with a root topaa‚Äô-/tup√°‚Äô- that likely comes from Venture√±o). The Tataviam were established in the valleys to the north; Pacoima (Fernande√±o: pakoinga or pak…®ynga) is believed to be of Tataviam-Fernande√±o people's Tataviam language origin and means the entrance in the Fernande√±o dialect.Roderick 2001, p. 20Jorgenson 1982, pp. 34‚Äì35 The Hokan-speaking Chumash people inhabited Malibu, the Santa Monica Mountains, and the Simi Hills in the western area of the Valley, and much of the coastal areas to the northwest. At Bell Creek below the rocky outcropping called Escorpi√≥n Peak (Castle Peak), Chumash pictographs and other artifacts have been identified by archeologists at a site, Hu'wam, which is thought to have been a meeting place and trading center for the Tongva-Fernande√±o and Chumash-Ventura√±o.Roderick 2001, p. 25Jorgenson 1982, p. 33SSPSHP ethnohistory In the Simi Hills the Burro Flats Painted Cave pictographs are located on Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory property, inaccessible but well protected. The Tataviam- Fernande√±o people inhabited the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains in the Valley (and north in the Santa Clara River area). The Tongva-Fernande√±o inhabited the Valley, along the tributaries to the Los Angeles River. =Exploration= In 1769, the expedition led by explorer Gaspar de Portol√† reached the Los Angeles area of California overland from Baja California. Accompanying him were two Franciscan Padres, Jun√≠pero Serra and Juan Cresp√≠, who recorded the expedition and identified locations for a proposed network of missions, along which the royal highway (El Camino Real) was eventually built. After camping at and naming the location that would become the Pueblo de Los Angeles, the expedition proceeded westward before turning north through the Sepulveda Pass over the Santa Monica Mountains on the feast day of Saint Catherine of Bologna.Roderick 2001, pp. 20‚Äì4 The watering place was a pool fed by a perennial spring at what is now Encino, near the village of Siutangna. The name El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bononia de los EncinosBearchell and Fried 1988, p. 93 refers to the encinos or evergreen Coast Live Oaks that studded the area. The expedition proceeded northward, camping at a site in the northern Valley before crossing over the mountains into the Santa Clarita Valley. Father Cresp√≠ had identified a location along the Los Angeles River that would be perfect for a settlement, possibly a mission, but in 1781, King Charles III of Spain ordered that a pueblo be built on the site, which would be the second town in Alta California after San Jos√© de Guadalupe, founded in 1777. By royal edict, all of the waters of the river and its tributaries were reserved for the Pueblo de Los Angeles, a condition which would have a profound impact on development of the Valley.Link 1991, p. 17 =Mission San Fernando= Mission San Fernando c. 1900 By the end of the century, Spain had issued two grazing concessions north of the pueblo that included the southeastern corner of the Valley, Rancho San Rafael and Rancho Portesuelo. Francisco Reyes, alcalde or mayor of Los Angeles from 1793‚Äì1795, had set up a grazing operation which he called Rancho Encino located in what is now Mission Hills near the village of Pasakngna. Reyes's property had a substantial water supply from artesian wells and limestone for building, and was situated a day's walk from the existing missions San Gabriel and San Buenaventura. In or shortly before 1797 he was persuaded to cede this land to the Franciscans to be the site of a new mission, receiving in exchange a square league () of land in the southern valley by the perennial spring where the Portola Expedition had first entered the Valley. This property he also called Rancho Encino (also recorded as El Encino and Los Encinos).Bearchell and Fried 1988, pp. 28, 68-69, 93-95 Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a was founded at Reyes's original rancho site on September 8, 1797 by Father Ferm√≠n Lasu√©n. The mission's grazing lands extended over the flatlands of the valley, and it also claimed jurisdiction over several smaller valleys to the north and west. From this time, the valley began to be called after the mission. The fathers were charged with \\"civilizing\\" the native peoples, which they named according to the mission which had jurisdiction over them. The native peoples associated with Mission San Fernando were called Fernande√±os regardless of tribal affiliation or language,Jorgenson 1982, p. 32 as those associated with Mission San Gabriel were called Gabrielinos. As the 19th century dawned, 541 Indians did the heavy work of the Mission San Fernando, tending the livestock and working the farmlands watered by irrigation from the mission's wells. The mission was famed for its red wine, and also grew pomegranates, figs and olives. By 1826, 56,000 longhorn cattle and 1,500 horses grazed on the mission lands of the valley floor. Mexican ruleRanchos= Sketch map or dise√±o of the Scott Tract of Rancho Rafael in modern Burbank, 1870s. In 1821, Mexico achieved its independence from Spain, and California came under control of the Mexican government. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law established rules for petitioning for land grants to individuals in California. Regulations enacted in 1828 attempted to break the monopoly of the missions and also made land grants easier to obtain. The procedure included a dise√±o - a hand drawn sketch map.Cleland 1941, p. 24 The Mexican Governors of Alta California gained the power to grant state lands, and many of the earlier Spanish grazing concessions were subsequently patented under Mexican law. Many Californios in the Los Angeles area wanted the mission's rich grazing lands to be made available to private citizens, while those in the north, including Mexican governor General Manuel Victoria, preferred to keep the mission system intact. Late in 1831, the Californios rose in armed rebellion against the governor, who led a party of soldiers to the Valley to put down the rebellion. The southern ranchers rode into the Valley via the Cahuenga Pass and the two armies faced off in a skirmish (Battle of Cahuenga Pass) that left one man dead on either side. Although the rebels retreated to the pueblo, they were victorious in defeat; the wounded governor resigned and returned to Mexico. Popular pressure increased on the government to disestablish the missions, and laws were passed to secularize the missions on August 17, 1833.Roderick 2001, p. 24Yenne, pp. 18-19 In 1843, Don Vicente de la Osa (or del la Ossa) was granted one league of land along the Los Angeles River at the southeast corner of the Valley which he named Rancho Providencia. Brief History of Vicente de la Ossa and Family The nearby Battle of Providencia of February 20, 1845, was another face-off between Californios and an unpopular Mexican governor, Manuel Micheltorena, who proposed to return the mission lands to the control of the church. The only reported fatalities in the day-long cannon battle along the river were two horses and a mule, but Governor Micheltorena was captured and summarily shipped back to Mexico. He was replaced by P√≠o Pico, a native Californio, who would become the last Mexican governor of California.Roderick 2001, pp. 25‚Äì26Link 1991, p. 19 =Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War= Don Andr√©s Pico California was \\"land rich but poor in every other way, lacking cash, gunpowder, and support from Mexico.\\"Roderick 2001, p.26 Governor Pico prepared for the inevitable war with the United States, and in 1845 began dispersing the vast mission lands. A square of land at the west end of the Valley near the historic Chumash village Hu'wam was granted to three of the mission Indians under the name Rancho El Escorpi√≥n. The majority of the mission's grazing lands and mission buildings were leased to the governor's brother Andr√©s Pico. After the United States declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846, Pico sold the mission property outright to Eulogio de Celis for much-needed cash; Celis graciously extended the terms of his friend Andr√©s Pico's lease.Roderick p. 26 From this time the property was known as Rancho Ex- Mission San Fernando. On June 18, 1846 a small group of Yankees raised the California Bear Flag and declared independence from Mexico. United States troops quickly took control of the presidios at Monterey and San Francisco and proclaimed the Conquest complete. In Southern California, the Mexicans, for a time, resisted American troops, but when defeat became inevitable, P√≠o Pico fled to Mexico. Don Andr√©s Pico arranged the peaceful surrender of Los Angeles to American forces under Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Fr√©mont. The Treaty of Cahuenga ending the hostilities in California was signed at an adobe owned by the Verdugo Family at Campo de Cahuenga near the mouth of the Cahuenga Pass, at the southeast corner of the Valley, on January 13, 1847.Roderick 2001, pp. 26‚Äì27 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848, ended the war and ceded California to the United States, paving the way for California statehood in 1850. Gold Rush and statehoodCattle boom= The California Gold Rush of 1849 created a near-insatiable demand for beef, which was raised on the ranchos of southern California, including those in the San Fernando Valley, and driven on the hoof to northern markets serving the gold fields. In the southern Valley, de la Osa sold Rancho La Providencia to David W. Alexander and acquired the Rancho Encino, successfully raising cattle on the property.Bearchell and Fried 1988, p. 94-96 De la Osa took formal title to the Rancho under California law in 1851.Kielbasa, Historic Adobes of Los Angeles County, p. 34. Andr√©s Pico returned to his rancho in the Valley and made the former mission into \\"one of the most celebrated homes in the new California.\\"Roderick p. 29 After California became a state on September 9, 1850, Pico served as a state assemblyman and senator, and became a brigadier general in the state militia. In 1854, Andr√©s Pico's nine-year lease on the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando expired, and he purchased a half-interest in the property.Link 1991, p. 23 =Stage stops and the overland mail= Lopez Station in the 1860s. In 1851 the Los Angeles Court of Sessions recognized two rights of way through the Cahuenga Pass that connected Los Angeles with the Valley. One followed the old El Camino Real to Santa Barbara via Rancho Encino. The other, Tulare Road, joined El Camino Viejo (\\"the old road\\") north via Mission San Fernando, over the San Fernando Pass (now the Newhall Pass) to the Santa Clarita Valley, and through the Old Tejon Pass to the Central Valley and the gold fields beyond. In 1854, the Army established Fort Tejon in the Grapevine Canyon (La Ca√±ada de las Uvas) near Fort Tejon Pass. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors authorized funds to construct a deep cut to make the steep route north over the San Fernando Pass easier for stagecoach traffic, and a group of businessmen raised funds by subscription to complete the work. Young entrepreneur Phineas Banning's staging and shipping partnership with County Supervisor David W. Alexander acquired the contract to supply Fort Tejon, and Banning drove the first stage run over the new cut in December 1854.Ripley 1947, p. 43 Also the U. S. Army Pacific Railroad Surveys found the Fort Tejon Pass a much easier route for wagons than the old Tejon Pass, and this route became the Stockton - Los Angeles Road, the new wagon route to the southern goldfields on the Kern River and northward on the east side of the San Joaquin Valley to Stockton. The Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route between St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco, California via Fort Yuma and Los Angeles made its first run in the fall of 1858.Link 1991, p. 25 The original route entered the Valley through Cahuenga Pass and traveled northwest to the San Fernando Pass with a stage stop at Lopez Station north of the mission. In 1859, the California Legislature appropriated $15,000 (with additional funding provided by Los Angeles and Santa Barbara Counties) towards improving the old Santa Susana Pass wagon road into a new stagecoach road, now known as the Old Santa Susana Stage Road.Link, Tom: Universal City - North Hollywood, a Centenniel Portrait, Windsor Publications, 1991, , p. 25 The road ran over the Simi Hills between Santa Susana (now Chatsworth) and the Simi Valley. The precipitous portion of the route down from the summit on the San Fernando Valley side was called the Devil's Slide; horses were usually blindfolded and chains were used to augment brakes on the steep descent. Passengers debarked and walked. Southern California's boom market in beef had begun to decline as early as 1855 as it became profitable to drive cattle and sheep to California from the Midwest and Texas, and a drought in 1856 increased the pressure on the ranchos.Cleland 1941, p. 108‚Äì109 By 1859, with the cattle market in collapse and besieged by mounting debts, De la Osa converted his house at Rancho Encino into a roadside inn and began to charge patrons for his legendary Californio hospitality.Kielbasa, p. 35 The outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 disrupted mail service to California from the east via the old southerly \\"oxbow route\\". That year, Butterfield obtained a new contract to deliver mail between Los Angeles and San Francisco via a route diverging from the old road at the southeast corner of the Valley and traveling via the former El Camino Real as far as Rancho Encino before striking northwest across the valley floor for Santa Barbara via the recently improved Santa Susana wagon road over the Santa Susana Pass. This road became the main passenger route between Los Angeles and San Francisco,Bevill 2007 although traffic over the San Fernando Pass to the Central Valley continued. =Civil War years= Beale's Cut through the San Fernando Pass, c.1872 The devastation that ravaged the old rancho way of life between 1861 and 1865 had little to do with the Civil War raging to the east. The rains that started shortly before Christmas, 1861, continued for most of the following month. The flooding that followed drowned thousands of cattle and washed away fruit trees and vineyards. The Los Angeles Star reported that No mail was received at Los Angeles for five weeks. After the floods abated, grazing lands were turned into lush meadows and cattle flourished on the abundant grass. Surveyor General Edward Fitzgerald Beale had the damaged cut in the San Fernando Pass deepened to and named the slot-like roadway Beale's Cut. But the reprieve was only brief.Cleland 1941, pp. 131-37. The flood of 1861‚Äì62 was followed by severe droughts in 1863 and 1864. Cattle perished, or were slaughtered and sold for the salvage value of their hides and horn, and land values plummeted. Ravenous locusts and a major smallpox epidemic completed the devastation. The rancho economy of the Dons and the Californio way of life fell to a wave of overwhelming debt and unpaid taxes, never to rise again. After the DonsNew names on the land= In the decade after the Civil War, the majority of the old ranchos in the Valley changed hands. In 1867, David Burbank, a dentist and entrepreneur from Los Angeles, purchased Rancho Providencia and of the adjacent Rancho San Rafael. Burbank combined his properties into a nearly cattle ranch. That same year, De La Osa's widow sold Rancho Encino to James Thompson, who raised sheep on the rancho for two years. Thompson in turn sold the property to the Garnier brothers in 1869. The Garniers also raised sheep on the property, and were known for the fine quality of their fleece, but they in turn became overextended and lost the property to foreclosure in 1878. Home of Isaac Van Nuys, 1882 Eulogio de Celis had tried to sell his vast holdings in the Valley, but found no buyers. Squeezed by debt after the flood years, Andr√©s Pico had sold his half-interest in the Rancho ex-Mission San Fernando to his brother P√≠o Pico in 1862,Link 1991, p.27 retaining called the Pico Reserve around the old Mission. When De Celis died in 1869, P√≠o Pico, desperately in need of cash, sold his half-share to a group of investors assembled as the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association. The leading investor was Isaac Lankershim, a Northern California stockman and grain farmer, who was impressed by the Valley's wild oats and proposed to raise sheep on the property. Other investors included Levi Strauss. To complete the sale, the Valley was split lengthwise, with the Association purchasing the southern half and the northern half devolving to De Celis's heirs. The line of demarcation was a ploughed furrow across the Valley floor near the route of today's Roscoe Boulevard. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim's son and future son-in-law, James Boon Lankershim and Isaac Newton Van Nuys, moved to the Valley and took over management of the property. Van Nuys built the first wood-frame house in the Valley. Initially, the two men raised sheep, changing the name of the company to the San Fernando Sheep Company. Van Nuys, however, thought the property could profitably grow wheat using the dryland farming technique developed on the Great Plains, and leased land from the Association to test his theories. After a drought destroyed the majority of the sheep in 1875, the remainder of the property was given over to raising wheat and barley. In time, the Lankershim property, under its third name, the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, would become the world's largest wheat-growing empire.Roderick 2001, pp. 32‚Äì34, 44‚Äì45 =Railroads and boom towns= Map of the San Fernando Valley in 1880 by William Hammond Hall. A parcel of De Celis's property north of the great furrow was purchased in 1874 by state senator Charles Maclay of Santa Clara and his partner, George K. Porter of San Francisco. Porter's cousin Benjamin F. Porter subsequently purchased portions of Porter and Maclay's interests. Most of the land except the parcel northeast of the mission was used for wheat farming. Ben Porter's portion to the west (now Porter Ranch) remained one of the last parts of the Valley to be developed. In the eastern section nearest the San Gabriel Mountains, Maclay platted the Valley's first town, San Fernando, on September 15, 1874.Dumke 1944, p. 100 The town plan included land for a station for Leland Stanford's Southern Pacific Railroad from Los Angeles, which became the depot for the north Valley farmers to ship their wheat crops south to the port at Wilmington.Jorgensen 1982, p. 82 In 1876, Southern Pacific opened a tunnel through the pass at San Fernando and ran the first through train from the transcontinental railroad's western terminus in San Francisco to Los Angeles. From this time, rail travel superseded long distance travel by stagecoach in California.Link 1991, p.28 Map of the Lankershim Ranch properties, 1887 The world wheat market remained strong through the 1870s and early 1880s, but then supply began to exceed demand, and prices began to fall. When the rival Santa Fe Railroad reached Los Angeles in 1885, fare wars between the two transportation giants brought ever more settlers to Southern California, and pressure rose to subdivide the great ranches of the Valley. In 1886, David Burbank sold his ranch to Los Angeles land speculators who formed the Providencia Land, Water and Development Company, with Burbank as one of the directors. The land was surveyed and a business district was laid out, surrounded by residential lots. The outlying area was divided into small farms. They named the town Burbank and opened the tract for sale on May 1, 1887. In October 1887, J. B. Lankershim and eight other developers organized the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company, purchasing north of the Caheunga Pass from the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company.Link 1991, p. 31 Lankershim established a townsite which the residents named Toluca (later Lankershim, and now North Hollywood) along the old Tulare Road from Cahuenga Pass to San Fernando. On April 1, 1888, they offered ready- made small farms for sale, already planted with deep-rooted deciduous fruit and nut trees‚Äîmostly peaches, pears, and walnuts‚Äîthat could survive the rainless summers of the Valley by relying on the high water table along the Pacoima River (now the central or main branch of the Tujunga Wash) rather than surface irrigation.Link 1991, pp. 31, 33 In 1888, Ben Porter sold a portion of his property near the base of Santa Susana Pass to the Porter Land and Water Company, which platted it as the community of Chatsworth Park.Dumke 1944, p. 102 The land boom of the 1880s went bust by the 1890s, but despite another brutal drought cycle in the late 1890s, the fruit and nut farmers remained solvent for a time. The Toluca Fruit Growers Association was formed in 1894. The next year the Southern Pacific opened a branch line slanting northwest across the Valley to Chatsworth Park, which made one freight stop a day at Toluca, though the depot bore the new name of Lankershim. In 1896, under pressure from J. B. Lankershim, the post office at Toluca was renamed \\"Lankershim\\" after his father, although the new name of the town would not be officially recognized until 1905.Link 1991, pp. 34-35Roderick 2001. p. 46 A new Santa Susana Pass wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895 to the north. Initially called El Camino Nuevo (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until Santa Susana Pass Road (now Old Santa Susana Pass Road) was built in 1917. This was the first automobile route between the San Fernando and Simi Valleys. It also was the main northbound 'coast road' to Santa Barbara and San Francisco, until the Conejo Grade in Ventura County between Conejo Valley and the Oxnard Plain on \\"Camino Real Viejo\\" (the Old Royal Road, now U.S. Route 101), was improved. Rail traffic through Toluca and Chatsworth Park to Ventura County and points north was made possible by the opening of the Santa Susana Tunnels in 1904, and the new coast route soon superseded the old rail route to San Francisco via the San Fernando Pass for passenger travel, as that route had superseded the stagecoach route via Santa Susana Pass in the 1870s.Mullaly and Petty 2002, pp. 36, 44, 170‚Äì72 Late in the decade the City of Los Angeles sued all the ranchers of the Valley, claiming the rights not only to the surface water of the Los Angeles River and its tributaries, but to the groundwater as well. In 1899, the California Supreme Court sided with the city. Without a reliable water supply, it became impossible to sell farm sites in the Valley.Link 1991, pp. 36‚Äì38 The 20th centuryDevelopment in the new century= In October 1903, George K. Porter sold an option to purchase his last of land in the north Valley to a syndicate led by Leslie C. Brand of Glendale. In 1904, Brand's syndicate incorporated as the San Fernando Mission Land Company, whose major shareholders included Los Angeles businessmen Henry E. Huntington, E.H. Harriman, Edwin T. Earl, Joseph F. Sartori, and Harrison Gray Otis.Hoffman 1981, p. 126 One day after the city water commission, on which Moses Sherman sat, approved a proposal to build an aqueduct from the Owens Valley, the Company quietly exercised its option to purchase Porter's land.Roderick 2001, p.57 On July 29, 1905, the City announced its plans to bring water south from the Owens Valley‚Äîwater that would only be made available to city residents. Construction began in 1908 and water from the Los Angeles Aqueduct reached the San Fernando Valley in November, 1913.Jorgensen 1988 p. 121 Real estate development once again boomed. In the \\"biggest land transaction ever recorded in Los Angeles County\\",Roderick 2001, p. 48 a syndicate led by Harry Chandler, business manager of the Los Angeles Times, with Hobart Johnstone Whitley, Isaac Van Nuys, and James Boon Lankershim acquired \\"Tract 1000\\", the remaining of the southern half of the former Mission lands‚Äîeverything west of the Lankershim town limits and south of the old furrow excepting the Rancho Encino. As the Los Angeles Suburban Homes company, they laid out plans for the towns of Van Nuys, Marion (now Reseda) and Owensmouth (now Canoga Park, West Hills, and Winnetka), a system of highways, and eventual incorporation into the city of Los Angeles. In the \\"Sale of the Century\\" in November 1910 they sold the remaining livestock and non-land assets of the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company at auction. The Los Angeles Times called the auction \\"the beginning of a new empire and a new era in the Southland\\".Link 1991, p. 40 Van Nuys after the arrival of the Pacific Electric Railway 1911 Times were indeed changing quickly. The City of Burbank was incorporated in 1911,Roderick 2001, p. 63 and the Pacific Electric Railway reached Van Nuys on December 16, 1911, Owensmouth on December 7, 1912, and San Fernando on March 22, 1913. In 1912, Carl Laemmle broke ground on a permanent movie-making facility on the Providencia (Oak Crest Ranch) in the hills east of the mouth of the Cahuenga Pass that would become the first location of Universal City. Universal City moved to a new location, the Taylor Ranch in 1914.Motion Picture World August 29, 1914, page 1250 In 1914, Carl Laemmle broke ground on Taylor ranch for the New Universal City in the hills east of the mouth of the Cahuenga Pass that would become the second location of Universal City in the San Fernando Valley, Universal City.Link 1991, p. 45‚Äì46. =Annexation= Valley farmers offered to buy the surplus aqueduct water, but the federal legislation that enabled the construction of the aqueduct prohibited Los Angeles from selling the water outside of the city limits.Bearchell and Fried 1988, p. 121 For the Valley communities, the choice was consent to annexation or do without. On March 29, 1915, by a vote of 681 to 25, residents of of the San Fernando Valley (excluding Rancho El Escorpi√≥n and the communities of Owensmouth, Lankershim, Burbank and San Fernando) voted to be annexed by the City of Los Angeles. Owensmouth was annexed in 1917, West Lankershim in 1919, Chatsworth in 1920, and Lankershim in 1923. Small remote portions of the north and west Valley were annexed piecemeal even later: most of Rancho El Escorpi√≥n in 1958 and the remainder of Ben Porter's ranch as late as 1965.

He is widely believed to have been made the governor of the province of Awadh. He built Babri Mosque in Ayodhya in 1528, which later became the focal point of the Babri Masjid‚ÄìRam Janmabhoomi dispute. The historical evidence for these beliefs is a matter of debate. Identity Baburnama (Chronicle of Babur) mentions a commander called Baqi Tashkindi (Baqi of Tashkent). His name also appears with other suffixes: Baqi Shaghawal, Baqi Beg (commander) or Baqi Mingbashi (commander of a thousand troops). However, the chronicle does not describe him as a Mir (prince or noble). Police officer-turned-scholar Kishore Kunal believes that the appellation \\"Mir Baqi\\" was constructed in 1813‚Äì1814 in a forged inscription on Babri Masjid for the benefit of the British surveyor Francis Buchanan, and there was in fact no prince called \\"Mir Baqi\\" in Babur's regime. Career Baqi Tashqandi served as a commander in the Mughal force of Emperor Babur. In 932 AH (January or February 1526 AD), Baqi, described as \\"Shaghawal\\", was given Dibalpur in Punjab as a fief (near Lahore), and sent to help quell a rebellion in Balkh. After his return, Baqi appears to have been assigned as a commander in a force of six or seven thousand troops headed by Chin-Timur Sultan. In 934 AH (1528 AD) the force was sent on an expedition to Chanderi. The enemy fled and Chin-Timur Sultan was ordered to pursue them. The subordinate commanders were given instructions \\"not to go beyond this [Sultan's] word\\". In March 1528, the same force headed by Chin-Timur Sultan was sent in pursuit of Afghan nobles BƒÅyazƒ´d and Biban (formerly in the employ of Ibrahim Lodi) near Awadh. The duo however took control of Lucknow by May 1529 (935 AH), signalling a loss for the Mughal force. The defeat was attributed to Baqi, who was possibly in charge of the Mughal fort in Lucknow. Babur sent reinforcements under the command of Kuki and others. BƒÅyazƒ´d and Biban fled at the news of reinforcements. However, Baqi and his team could not catch hold of them. The temporary loss of Lucknow to the rebels as well as Baqi's inability to capture them annoyed Babur. The monsoon had set in and the horses needed rest. So Babur called a halt to the pursuit. On 13 June, Baqi called on Babur, who was apparently dissatisfied, and, on 20 June 1529, Babur dismissed Baqi (issued rukhsat) along with the army of Awadh that he was commanding. No more is known of Baqi Tashqandi until his mysterious reappearance on a supposed inscription on the Babri Masjid as \\"Mir Baqi\\", as reported by the British East India Company's surveyor in 1813. Babri Masjid inscriptions Francis Buchanan (also called Buchanan-Hamilton) did a survey of the Gorakhpur Division in 1813‚Äì14 on behalf of the British East India Company. Buchanan's report, never published but available in the British Library archives, states that the Hindus generally attributed destruction of temples \\"to the furious zeal of Aurangzabe [Aurangzeb]\\", but the large mosque at Ayodhya (now known as Babri Masjid) was ascertained to have been built by Babur by \\"an inscription on its walls\\". Buchanan had the said inscription in Persian copied by a scribe and translated by a Maulvi friend. The translation however showed two inscriptions. The first inscription said that the mosque was constructed by 'Mir Baqi' in the year 935 AH or 923 AH. The second inscription narrated the genealogy of Aurangzeb. The translator had a difficulty with the anagram for the date, because one of the words was missing, which would have resulted in a date of 923 AH rather than 935 AH. These incongruities and mismatches made no impression on Buchanan, who maintained that the mosque was built under the orders of Babur. The Babri Masjid stands at a location believed by Hindus to be the birthplace of Rama. There are no records of a mosque at the site till 1672 and no known association with Babur or Mir Baqi prior to Buchanan's discovery of these inscriptions in the 19th century. The Baburnama does not mention either the mosque or the destruction of a temple. The Ramcharit Manas of Tulsidas (AD 1574) and Ain-i Akbari of Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (AD 1598) made no mention of a mosque either. In 1611, an English traveller William Finch visited Ayodhya and recorded the \\"ruins of the Ranichand [Ramachand] castle and houses\\". He made no mention of a mosque. In 1634, Thomas Herbert described a \\"pretty old castle of Ranichand [Ramachand]\\" which he described as an antique monument that was \\"especially memorable\\". However, by 1672, the appearance of a mosque at the site can be inferred because Lal Das's Awadh-Vilasa describes the location of birthplace without mentioning a temple. In 1717, the Moghul Rajput noble Jai Singh II purchased the land surrounding the site and his documents show a mosque. Kishore Kunal states that all the claimed inscriptions on the Babri mosque were fake. They were affixed sometime around 1813 (almost 285 years after the supposed construction of the mosque in 1528 AD), and repeatedly replaced. In a petition filed by Syed Mohammad Asghar, the Mutawalli (guardian) of the Babri Masjid, with the Commissioner of Faizabad in 1877, it was stated that the word \\"Allah\\" above the door was the only inscription. The inscription mentioned by Buchanan was apparently not in evidence. In 1889, archaeologist Anton F√ºhrer recorded two inscriptions. One said that the mosque was erected by a noble 'Mir Khan' of Babur. Another said that the mosque was founded in the year 930 AH by a grandee of Babur, who was (comparable to) \\"another King of Turkey and China\\". The year 930 AH corresponds 1523 AD, three years before Babur's conquest of Hindustan. Moreover, the texts of these inscriptions were completely different from those documented by Buchanan.

Owing to its brevity and coherence, it has become widely known. The phrase is commonly used for touch-typing practice, testing typewriters and computer keyboards, displaying examples of fonts, and other applications involving text where the use of all letters in the alphabet is desired. History Item from the February 9, 1885, edition of The Boston Journal mentioning the phrase \\"A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\" Pictorial depiction of the pangram from Scouting for Boys The earliest known appearance of the phrase is from The Boston Journal. In an article titled \\"Current Notes\\" in the February 9, 1885, edition, the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing students: \\"A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it contains every letter of the alphabet: 'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'\\" Dozens of other newspapers published the phrase over the next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with \\"A\\" rather than \\"The\\". The earliest known use of the phrase starting with \\"The\\" is from the 1888 book Illustrative Shorthand by Linda Bronson. The modern form (starting with \\"The\\") became more common despite the fact that it is slightly longer than the original (starting with \\"A\\"). As the use of typewriters grew in the late 19th century, the phrase began appearing in typing lesson books as a practice sentence. Early examples include How to Become Expert in Typewriting: A Complete Instructor Designed Especially for the Remington Typewriter (1890), and Typewriting Instructor and Stenographer's Hand-book (1892). By the turn of the 20th century, the phrase had become widely known. In the January 10, 1903, issue of Pitman's Phonetic Journal, it is referred to as \\"the well known memorized typing line embracing all the letters of the alphabet\\". Robert Baden-Powell's book Scouting for Boys (1908) uses the phrase as a practice sentence for signaling. The first message sent on the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline on August 30, 1963, was the test phrase \\"THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG'S BACK 1234567890\\". Later, during testing, the Russian translators sent a message asking their American counterparts, \\"What does it mean when your people say 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'?\\" During the 20th century, technicians tested typewriters and teleprinters by typing the sentence. Computer usage The phrase being used in a BBC Ceefax test from 1972. In the age of computers, this pangram is commonly used to display font samples and for testing computer keyboards. In cryptography, it is commonly used as a test vector for hash and encryption algorithms to verify their implementation, as well as to ensure alphabetic character set compatibility. Microsoft Word has a command to auto- type the sentence, in versions up to Word 2003, using the command =rand(), and in Microsoft Office Word 2007 and later using the command =rand.old(). Cultural references Numerous references to the phrase have occurred in movies, television, books, video games, advertising, websites, and graphic arts.

Appointed on 30 July 1998, she was the first female president of an appellate court in Australia. She resigned effective 24 March 2017 after more than 18 years as a justice of the Court of Appeal. Education McMurdo was educated at Brisbane Girls Grammar School (1967‚Äì1971) and then at the University of Queensland. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1975. Career She was admitted as a barrister in 1976 and worked as a public defender from 1976 until 1989. McMurdo briefly worked as a prosecutor and a part-time member of the Criminal Justice Commission Misconduct Tribunal from 1990 until 1991. In 1991, she was the first woman to be appointed as a judge of the District Court of Queensland. She held a simultaneous commission as a judge of the Children's Court of Queensland from 1993 until 1998. =Queensland Court of Appeal= She was appointed directly as president of the Queensland Court of Appeal, without having previously been a member of the Supreme Court. She served from 30 July 1998 until she resigned in October 2016. She was the first woman appointed to lead an appellate court in Australia. In April 2015 McMurdo was involved in a dispute with then Chief Justice of Queensland Tim Carmody, which subsequently became public, concerning disclosure of a meeting between Carmody and Hetty Johnson, the founder and executive director of the children protection advocacy group Bravehearts. after McMurdo, Carmody and Justice Hugh Fraser had heard an appeal by Brett Peter Cowan against his conviction for the murder of Daniel Morcombe and before the decision had been handed down. McMurdo sent an email to Carmody stating that: > I am deeply concerned about this. The judgements in R V Cowan are not yet > delivered either in his appeal against conviction or in the Attorney- > General's appeal against sentence. In the circumstances it is our respectful > view that you should disclose immediately the fact of this meeting and what > was discussed at it to both parties and afford them an opportunity to make > submissions about it if they wish. Carmody responded five days later was that \\"Any suggestion that this would be sufficient to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias or prejudice ... is unsupported by precedent and utterly preposterous.\\" The response from McMurdo was to advise the Supreme and District Court executive director that she would not sit with Carmody. Carmody disclosed the meeting with Johnson and Cowan made an application that Carmody recuse himself for apprehended bias. Carmody proposed to deal with the recusal application himself, which promoted a further reaction from McMurdo and Fraser that there was a reasonable apprehension that in stating the recusal application was utterly preposterous, Carmody had prejudged the recusal application. Carmody subsequently withdrew from the case \\"instead of prolonging this bizarre sideshow\\". =Subsequent career= McMurdo was appointed Chair of the Legal Aid Board of Queensland in May 2017. Honours On 11 June 2007 McMurdo was made a Companion of the Order of Australia for \\"For service to the law and judicial administration in Queensland, particularly in the areas of legal education and women's issues, to the support of a range of legal organisations, and to the community.\\" Personal life In 1976 McMurdo married Philip McMurdo who would subsequently join her as a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. They have four adult children.

There were 875 students and 23 faculty members including principal, M. H. Griffin, a graduate of the University of Michigan. This connection is why Carver High School adopted the wolverine as its mascot. The curriculum consisted of the basic subjects and physical education. In subsequent years, Carver was expanded both physically and academically. Eight classrooms were added from 1951‚Äì1952. An elementary unit, consisting of 20 rooms and a gymnasium were added from 1952‚àí1953. By 1959, the enrollment had increased to nearly 1700 students; therefore, an 18-room extension was added. This extension consisted of science labs, home- making rooms, mechanic shops and workshops. In 1982, the Carver Creative and Performing Arts Center (CCPAC) was created. Athletics In 1964, Carver won the negro AAA (the largest division at the time) state football championship in 1964 with a record of 9-0-1, defeating Cobb Avenue of Anniston.

Solomon's knot (Latin: sigillum Salomonis, literally 'Solomon's seal') is a traditional decorative motif used since ancient times, and found in many cultures. Despite the name, it is classified as a link, and is not a true knot according to the definitions of mathematical knot theory. Structure The Solomon's knot consists of two closed loops, which are doubly interlinked in an interlaced manner. If laid flat, the Solomon's knot is seen to have four crossings where the two loops interweave under and over each other. This contrasts with two crossings in the simpler Hopf link. In most artistic representations, the parts of the loops that alternately cross over and under each other become the sides of a central square, while four loopings extend outward in four directions. The four extending loopings may have oval, square, or triangular endings, or may terminate with free-form shapes such as leaves, lobes, blades, wings etc. Occurrences The Solomon's knot often occurs in ancient Roman mosaics, usually represented as two interlaced ovals. Sepphoris National Park, Israel, has Solomon's Knots in stone mosaics at the site of an ancient synagogue. Across the Middle East, historical Islamic sites show Solomon's knot as part of Muslim tradition. It appears over the doorway of an early twentieth century AD mosque/madrasa in Cairo. Two versions of Solomon's knot are included in the recently excavated Yattir Mosaic in Jordan. To the east, it is woven into an antique Central Asian prayer rug. To the west, Solomon's knot appeared in Moorish Spain, and it shines in leaded glass windows in a late twentieth century CE mosque in the United States. The British Museum, London, England has a fourteenth-century AD Egyptian Qur'an with a Solomon's Knot as its frontispiece. University of California at Los Angeles Fowler Museum of Cultural History, USA has a large African collection that includes nineteenth and twentieth century AD Yoruba glass beadwork crowns and masks decorated with Solomon's Knots. Home of Peace Mausoleum, a Jewish Cemetery, Los Angeles, California, USA has multiple images of Solomon's knot in stone and concrete bas reliefs sculpted 1934 AD. Saint Sophia's Greek Orthodox Cathedral, \\"Byzantine District\\" of Los Angeles, California, USA has an olive wood Epitaphios (bier for Christ) with Solomon's knots carved at each corner. The Epitaphios is used in the Greek Easter services. Powell Library University of California at Los Angeles, USA has ceiling beams in the Main Reading Room covered with Solomon's Knots. Built in 1926 AD, the reading room also features a central Dome of Wisdom bordered by Solomon's knots. Name In Latin, this configuration was sometimes known as sigillum Salomonis, meaning literally \\"seal of Solomon\\". It was associated with the Biblical monarch Solomon because of his reputation for wisdom and knowledge (and in some legends, his occult powers). This phrase is usually rendered into English as \\"Solomon's knot\\", since \\"seal of Solomon\\" has other conflicting meanings (often referring to either a Star of David or pentagram). In the study of ancient mosaics, the Solomon's knot is often known as a \\"guilloche knot\\" or \\"duplex knot\\", while a Solomon's knot in the center of a decorative configuration of four curving arcs is known as a \\"pelta-swastika\\" (where pelta is Latin for \\"shield\\"). Among other names currently in use are the following: \\"Foundation Knot\\" applies to the interweaving or interlacing which is the basis for many elaborate Celtic designs, and is used in the United States in crochet and macram√© patterns. \\"Imbolo\\" describes the knot design on the textiles of the Kuba people of Congo. Paulus Gerdes, Mozambican Ethnomathematics Research Centre \\"Nodo di Salomone\\" is the Italian term for Solomon's Knot, and is used to name the Solomon's Knot mosaic found at the ruins of a synagogue at Ostia, the ancient seaport for Rome. sapere.it, Il nodo di Salomone Symbolism Multiple Solomon's knots in a mosaic in the Church of the Nativity (Bethlehem) Molecular Solomon's knot Quadruple Solomon's knot Since the knot has been used across a number of cultures and historical eras, it can be given a range of symbolic interpretations. Because there is no visible beginning or ending, it may represent immortality and eternity‚Äîas does the more complicated Buddhist Endless Knot. Because the knot seems to be two entwined figures, it is sometimes interpreted as a Lover's Knot, although that name may indicate another knot. Because of religious connections, the knot is sometimes designated the all-faith symbol of faith, but, at the same time, it appears in many places as a valued secular symbol of prestige, importance, beauty. Solomon's Knot appears on tombstones and mausoleums in Jewish graveyards and catacombs in many nations. In this context, Solomon's Knot is currently interpreted to symbolize eternity. Some seek to connect it with Solomon by translating the Hebrew word peka'im (◊§◊ß◊¢◊ô◊ù) found in the Bible at I Kings 6:18 and I Kings 7:24 as meaning \\"knobs\\" or \\"knots\\", and interpreting it to refer to Solomon's knot; however, the more accepted modern translation of this word is \\"gourd-shaped ornaments\\". In Africa, Solomon's knot is found on glass beadwork, textiles, and carvings of the Yoruba people. When the knot appears in this culture, it often denotes royal status; thus, it is featured on crowns, tunics, and other ceremonial objects. Also in Africa, the Knot is found on Kasai velvet, the raffia woven cloth of the Kuba people. They attribute mystical meaning to it, as do the Akan people of West Africa who stamp it on their sacred Adinkra cloth. In the Adinkra symbol system, a version of Solomon's knot is the Kramo-bone symbol, interpreted as meaning \\"one being bad makes all appear to be bad\\". In Latvia, when Solomon's knot is used on textiles and metal work, it is associated with time, motion, and the powers of ancient pagan gods. In modern science, some versions of the conventionalized sign for an atom (electrons orbiting a nucleus) are variations of Solomon's knot. The logo of the Joomla software program is a Solomon's knot.

He began working in the store when he was in grade school, performing odd jobs. He graduated from Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Career In 1979, he was recruited as a merchandising trainee by Target, where he moved up the organization ranks. He became the Executive Vice President of Merchandising in July 1994 and became Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2008. On May 2, 2014, Target executives issued a \\"him or us\\" ultimatum that forced Steinhafel to resign from his position as CEO on May 5, 2014 as a result of the data breach that affected 70 million to 110 million consumers. His tenure as CEO of Target also included a disastrous expansion of Target into Canada in which the company lost $2 billion in 2 years. On top of the cost burden from buying out 220 leases of discount retailer chain Zellers, the expansion was plagued by flawed execution, including inventory and restocking problems, poor locations and higher prices than Canadian shoppers expected. Gregg Steinhafel received a severance package of $61 million and agreed to \\"remain employed by Target in an advisory capacity to assist with the transition through no later than August 23, 2014.\\" Steinhafel is also Director, Member of Nominating and Governance Committee and Member of Compensation & Human Resources Committee for The Toro Company and Vice Chairman of the Retail Industry Leaders Association.

Titirangi Rudolf Steiner School provides a comprehensive Waldorf education Curriculum and environment which encourages and promotes independent thinking and social responsibility. The School understands children as beings of body, soul and spirit and guides them to develop compassion and reverence for themselves and the world community through realising their social, academic and artistic potential. The unique gifts and contributions of each child are honoured through a developmentally appropriate awakening of thinking, feeling and willing as indicated by Rudolf Steiner. Since the school‚Äôs motto includes ‚Äúto nurture truth‚Äù, it‚Äôs important that prospective parents are aware of certain aspects. The philosophy this school's pedagogy is based on is riddled with pseudoscientific notions such as demons http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA317/English/RSP1972/19240702p01.html, angels https://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0110/19090416p01.html, karma https://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA157/English/RSP1987/DesNat_index.html, and racism http://fvn- rs.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=3687:zehnter-vortrag- dornach-30-dezember-1922&catid;=246:ga-348-ueber-gesundheit-und-krankheit- grundlagen&Itemid;=19. Further, this Steiner Waldorf school has a reputation in the local area, which spans decades, of unchecked bullying. Many testimonials have been gathered about this going all the way back to the 1980shttp://titirangisteinermessenger.com/testimonials/index.html, and includes the personal and evidential experience of a family who had to take the school to Human Rights mediation http://titirangisteinermessenger.com/News/Entries/2013/1/three-and-a-half- years.html. This happened because the school expelled their then 8 year old daughter and her siblings without warning, rather than deal with the bullying she had been regularly suffering from for months. This culminated with her being threatened by a then 10 year old boy with an axe http://titirangisteinermessenger.com/videos/axed.html. In the legally binding mediation settlement, the school admitted that the bullied child's accounts were honest, ie, that she had told the truth about the accounts of bullying http://titirangisteinermessenger.com/News/ewExternalFiles/Settlement%20With%20TRSS%20%2814-Dec-2012%29%20v2.pdf.

It encompasses an area just north of downtown Nashua, roughly centered on the junction of Concord, Amherst, and Main streets. Its southern bound is the Nashua River and Railroad Square, its eastern bounds are Railroad Square, Clinton, Lock, Orange, and Concord streets, its northern bound is Mount Pleasant Street, and its western boundary is Abbott, Amherst, Concord, and Main streets between the northern and southern bounds. Today this area is known as French Hill, but the NRHP district takes its name from a time in the 19th century when the area was briefly separated from Nashua as the town of \\"Nashville\\". This was due to the placement of a new Town Hall in the southern half of the city (which was more populated at the time).Nashua history on city websiteHistory of the old township of Dunstable: including Nashua, Nashville, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimac, N.H.; Dunstable and Tyngsborough, Mass., by Charles James Fox, 1846 on Google books The northern contingent split themselves off, calling themselves \\"Nashville\\". The split came only six years after the town had renamed itself \\"Nashua\\", in 1836. The creation of a new railroad line from Lowell, Massachusetts, that ran along the northern length of the Nashua River had resulted in Union Square being renamed \\"Railroad Square\\" in 1838. However, the railroad brought new economic prosperity and increased communication with Boston, and in 1853 the two town committees resolved their differences and a new town charter for the \\"City of Nashua\\" was enacted.

It has been described as one of the first all-female rock bands. The members of Ace of Cups were Mary Gannon (bass), Marla Hunt (organ, piano), Denise Kaufman (guitar, harmonica), Mary Ellen Simpson (lead guitar), and Diane Vitalich (drums). Lead vocals were sung by all members of the band except Vitalich, and all five sang backup. The songwriting, too, was divided among the band members. Background Gannon was born in New York and moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s. She played bass for a short while in a band called Daemon Lover. Hunt, who had grown up in Los Angeles, had been playing the piano since she was three. Like Gannon, she also moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s. Hunt was introduced to Gannon through a mutual friend, and Gannon suggested that they form an all-female rock band. Simpson was from Indio, California. She began playing the guitar when she was 12. Like Gannon and Hunt, she moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s. Vitalich, a San Francisco native, was a veteran of several bands. She once played drums with Bill Haley and the Comets. Simpson and Vitalich joined Gannon and Hunt's band around the same time. The last woman to join Ace of Cups was Kaufman. She also had the most colorful background of the group. Kaufman had been arrested during the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, and she was involved with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters (who dubbed her \\"Mary Microgram\\"). In a 1995 interview, Hunt remembered her first impression of Kaufman: > I'll never forget when she walked in. She's wearing cowboy boots, a very > short skirt, a wild fur coat and a fireman's hat. Her hair's stickin' > straight out on the side. She's got these big glasses and this big guitar > case‚Äîshe's like 5'3\\" and it's almost as big as she is. Even in San Francisco > she stood out. Ace of Cups was named after the tarot card, shown here. The band was named Ace of Cups by their manager, astrologer Ambrose Hollingworth, after the Ace of Cups tarot card, which shows a cup with five streams of water. He told the women that the streams represented the five of them, and that they should \\"go with the flow\\" to see where the music would take them. Late 1960s Ace of Cups made their debut in the early spring of 1967. In late June, Jimi Hendrix invited the band to open for him at a free concert in Golden Gate Park. In London that December, Hendrix told Melody Maker: \\"I heard some groovy sounds last time in the States, like this girl group, Ace of Cups, who write their own songs and the lead guitarist is hell, really great.\\" In San Francisco, Ace of Cups‚Äîwhose new manager, Ron Polte, also managed Quicksilver Messenger Service‚Äîwere playing regularly, headlining at smaller clubs such as The Matrix and performing as the opening act at larger venues such as the Avalon Ballroom and the Fillmore. In mid-1968, the band appeared on a local television program, West Pole, along with San Francisco legends Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. In 1969, they opened for The Band's first concert as The Band along with The Sons of Champlin. Several record companies were interested in signing Ace of Cups, but Hollingworth and Polte felt the band was worth more than the record companies were offering. Also, some of the band members were concerned that a record contract might require the band to tour, and they were worried that family pressures would interfere. Consequently, Ace of Cups never made any professional recordings of their own, although in 1969 they contributed vocals to Jefferson Airplane's Volunteers, Mike Bloomfield's It's Not Killing Me, and Nick Gravenites' My Labors. At the Altamont Speedway Free Festival that December, Kaufman (who had married saxophonist Noel Jewkes and was pregnant) was hit in the head by a beer can. Nobody knows who threw the can, but Ralph J. Gleason wrote, \\"Hell's Angels played catch with full beer cans all afternoon\\". She suffered a fractured skull and needed emergency surgery to remove a piece of bone above her eye. 1970s Several factors led to the break-up of Ace of Cups. Some of the band members were frustrated at the group's lack of commercial success. Others were interested in other pursuits. Several members had children and found it difficult to balance motherhood and a musical career. In the early 1970s, several men joined the band to replace the women who had left. Kaufman was the last remaining member from the original line-up when the band folded in 1972. 2000s In 2003, Ace Records released It's Bad for You But Buy It!, a CD of \\"rehearsals, demos, TV soundstage recordings, and in-concert tapes\\" of Ace of Cups. The CD was generally well received. The band's performances on the 1968 television program West Pole were released on DVD in 2008 by Eagle Vision. 2010s As the decades passed, band members pursued various other personal and creative endeavors, occasionally playing music both individually and collectively when opportunities arose. On May 14, 2011, Ace of Cups played Wavy Gravy‚Äôs 75th birthday party and SEVA Foundation benefit. George Baer Wallace, founder of High Moon Records, was there to talk to the band about releasing archival concert recordings. He was so moved by their spirit and spark that he offered the Ace Of Cups the opportunity to record their first ever studio album. In 2016, the band began work on their debut studio album. Four of the band's original members took part in the recording: Mary Gannon (claps), Denise Kaufman (bass, harmonica), Mary Ellen Simpson (lead guitar), and Diane Vitalich (drums). The album was produced by Dan Shea (Mariah Carey, Santana, Jennifer Lopez), and features contributions from Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady (Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna), David Freiberg (Quicksilver Messenger Service), Barry Melton (Country Joe & The Fish), Pete Sears (Jefferson Starship, Rod Stewart, Hot Tuna), David Grisman, Steve Kimock (Zero, RatDog), Terry Haggerty (Sons of Champlin), Norman Mayell (Sopwith Camel), Sid Page and Charlie Musselwhite, as well as lead vocal turns by Bob Weir (Grateful Dead), Taj Mahal, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Peter Coyote. On November 9, 2018, the band released Ace of Cups on High Moon Records. The Ace of Cups today is Mary Gannon, Denise Kaufman, Mary Ellen Simpson, Diane Vitalich, and Dallis Craft. The Ace of Cups will release their sophomore album Sing Your Dreams on October 2, 2020 via High Moon Records. Sing Your Dreams is a new collection of 12 songs and stories, produced by Dan Shea (Santana, Mariah Carey, Phil Collins, Bruce Hornsby), and features collaborations with Jackson Browne (who duets on album closer ‚ÄòSlowest River‚Äô), Sheila E. and the Escovedo Family, Bakithi Kumalo (whose iconic bass-playing was integral to the sound of Paul Simon‚Äôs Graceland), jam-band guitar luminary Steve Kimock (Jerry Garcia named him his ‚Äòfavorite unknown guitarist‚Äô), peace activist and counterculture icon Wavy Gravy, Jack Casady (Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna), and David Freiberg (Quicksilver Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane/Starship).

History Mongol Empire c.1207, showing Bargujin-Tukum In the 7‚Äì8th centuries, the Barga Mongols appeared as tribes near Lake Baikal, named Bargujin. In \\"Old Tangs Book\\", it was called \\"ÊãîÈáéÂè§\\", \\"ÊãîÈáéÂõ∫\\", \\"ÊãîÊõ≥Âõ∫\\". Genghis Khan's ancestor Alan Gua was of Barga ancestry. In the Mongol Empire, they served the Great Khans' armies. One of them named Ambaghai commanded the artillery. Manlaibaatar Damdins√ºren was the famous military commander from Barga in the early 20th century. = Xianbei Period = The Barga supported the XianBei invasion of China and provided 8,000 horse cavalry. = Second Turkic khaganate Period = The Barga (Bayegu) had revolted in 707. These revolts continued until 716 and Qapaghan Qaghan, on his way back from suppressing revolts by the Uyghur, Tongluo, Baixi, Barga (Bayegu) and Pugu, was ambushed and killed by a Barga tribesman named Sijelu on 716 July 22. =14th to 17th centuries= After the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Barga joined the Oirats against the Genghisids. However, they were scattered among the Mongols and Oirats. The Barga share the same 11 clans into which the Khori-Buryats were divided. The main body of Khori-Barga moved to the area between Ergune river and the Greater Khingan Range where they became subject to the Daurs and Solon Ewenkis. A large body of Barga Khoris fled back east to the Onon river in 1594. While some came under Russian rule, others became tributary to the Khalkha. =Qing dynasty Period= When the Qing dynasty attacked the Cossacks in the Ergune and Shilka rivers in 1685‚Äì89, those Barga Mongols east of the Ergune River were deported to Manchuria. The Qing court dispersed them among the Chahar banners. They predominantly live Hulunbuir since the 17th century. In 1900~1901 Russia-Manchuria Railway conflict, Manchurian commander QuanFu led local defensive force and fought against Russian soldiers at Ongon railway station and Hargantu railway stations. 800 Barga/Solon native soldiers were killed in the event.  Relocation - Old Barga (\\"Hvqin Barg\\" in Mongolian)  After the Treaty of Nerchinsk, Qing dynasty decided to increase the defensive line of HulunBuir against Russian influence. In 1732, under the command of Qing commander Tabhan and Bulbantsa, total 3000 (1636 Solon soldiers, 730 Dagur soldiers, 275 Barga soldiers and 359 Orqon soldiers) were selected and stationed in Hulunbuir mostly from non Muren area. After 2000 soldiers were forced to join Dzungar-Qing wars in 1733, mostly Barga soldiers were left to protect this area. They became \\"Old Barga\\", since they arrived before New Barga.  Relocation - New Barga (\\"Xin Barg\\" in Mongolian)  In order to support Dzungar‚ÄìQing Wars, 2000 Solon Barga soldiers were selected by Qing commander Jorhai in 1733 to fight against Dzungar and local defence was left with merely 1,100 soldiers. Thus it became extremely important to increase local defense against Russian Cossack. In 1734, the Barga Mongols who had been left under the Khalkha noyans complained of the mistreatment of their lords and the Qing authority selected 2,984 Barga Mongolian soldiers in Khalkha and stationed them with their families in Kh√∂l√∂nbuir, Dornod. They became \\"New Barga\\", since they arrived after Old Barga.  Military Support to Qing dynasty  In 1733, 2000 soldiers (mostly Solon Barga soldiers from the forest tribes) were forced to join Dzungar-Qing Wars. They never returned. In 1755, 3000 Barga soldiers were forced to join Dzungar-Qing Wars. They never returned. In 1758, 3000 Barga teenagers were forced to join Dzungar-Qing Wars, since there were not enough adults. They never returned. In 1840, some Barga soldiers (numbers unknown) joined First Opium War, and some of them returned home in 1841. In other occasions, 750~50 Barga soldiers were selected to support Qing dynasty campaigns for around 20 times. In 1901, 800 local Barga soldiers were killed in Chinese Eastern Railway construction. = Japanese Occupation Period = In 1939, local Barga people were forced to join Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts. The unclear border definition between New Barga Left Banner and Dornod (where Barga originally lived) was the major excuse for the start of Battles of Khalkhin Gol. = PRC China Period = Economy  The Barga economy is mostly nomadic based from 8th century to now. After 2010, Barga economy starts to have some sign of early industrialization. = 1907 statistics by Mairan Jangi Somonsurong = In 1907, there were over 1,764,457 domestic animals were raised by Barga, including 170,172 horses, 124,398 cattle, 9,011 camels, 1,407,586 sheep and 53,290 goats. New Barga took 76.8% of domestic animals and Old Barga took the rest. = Other records = Local folks have a lot of tales about Bayan Barga Rich families. * Dimin Ogorda had 10,000 horses during Qing dynasty period. * Jingdi Jangi had 12,000 horses during Japanese occupation period. * Yorong Jangi had 20,000 sheep. * Bosang Hafan had 1,000 white cows.

(1909). Letter to the Academy of Sciences, No. 7527, August 30 (cited by Lane and Tranel 1971 page 678). He was at the Lariboisiere Hospital, the first \\"oto-rhino-laryngologiste des Hopitaux\\" in France. He developed new surgical techniques and a new form of bone forceps. During World War I he researched the effects of air blasts upon 600 aviators but was unable to continue this research due to an illness that resulted in his early death. The \\"symptom of the raised voice\\" was discovered in 1909. It was made possible by the invention of a device by the Viennese physician Robert B√°r√°ny that delivered an intense noise to only one ear and so allowed the monaural examination of the other ear. Using this device Lombard asked a person to start talking in conversation while hearing noise. He found that when the noise began, the person spoke louder, and when the noise stopped, the voice returned to a normal level.pp. 678‚Äì680 The finding was reported to the French Academy of Sciences in August 1909, and the following year in April to the French Academy of Medicine.Lombard √â. (1910). Sur un travail du Dr. Lombard, intitul√©: Contribution √° la Sem√©iologie de la Surdit√©e, Un Nouveau Signe pour en Devoiler la Simulation, par M. Weiss, rapporteur. Bull. Acad. Nat. Med.

Acta Oto-Laryngologica, 56: 490-492. ) However, in 1910 German publications attributed this discovery to Robert B√°r√°ny, which led to a dispute in print between them. Priority was established when the English physician, Donald Schearer, described how he carried news of the discovery from Paris to Vienna in November 1909.pp. 677‚Äì678 B√°r√°ny received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1914, for other work. Lombard's discovery is important for four reasons. * It provides a means of detecting malingering by simulated hearing loss * It underlies research into speech communication in noise (an important practical problem) * It helps researchers understand how imitation and speaking are altered by auditory feedback * It identifies a role in speech of processes involving servomechanism.

Formed in 1996, they are best known for their stand-up acts and TV tarento activities in variety and quiz shows. Ujihara is known as one of the most competitive quiz show contestants. Having attended highly ranked public universities, the two are broadly recognized as \\"highly educated comedians\\". However, Suga eventually dropped out of Osaka Prefecture University while Ujihara graduated from Kyoto University spending 9 years to earn satisfactory credits to graduate. As the boke, Suga is prone to strange comments, while Ujihara is the more reasonable of the two, often criticizing Suga's remarks. As their talk material, they often use current affairs and items that Japanese students learn in high school and middle school. Suga writes almost all their material while Ujihara types them out since Suga cannot touch-type. In Yoshimoto Kogyo's annual \\"Most Handsome Yoshimoto Kogyo Entertainer\\" awards, Suga won 7th place and Ujihara won 14th in 2009 (8th and 20th in 2008 respectively).  Biography  The comedians first met through basketball club activities when they were students at Osaka Kyoiku University - Tennoji high school. Though never in the same class, they were always together at lunch and commuting time. As Suga wanted to be with Ujihara all through his life, he asked Ujihara to be his manzai partner. Suga also recommended Ujihara to take the entrance exam of Kyoto University, one of the top-tier universities in Japan, for the school name would be a help when they become comedians. Ujihara accepted the offer, and after both of them became university students, they formed Rozan in 1996. While attending university, they went to manzai auditions and failed 12 times in a row. After nearly a year and a half, they finally passed one and made their debut in February 1998 at a manzai live \\"WaChaCha LIVE Jr.\\".

It was inspired by the education system started by Rabindranath Tagore as well as the more progressive features of the national movement. It was also influenced by the Bratachari movement of Gurusaday Dutt, The school was founded by the Patha Bhavan Society under the presidency of Satyajit Ray. Susobhan Sarkar, Tarun Bose, who was a judge of the High Court of Calcutta, and Amiya Bose, an eye specialist helped Ray set up the school. Ray even designed the school's logo. Jyotirindra Moitra, an exponent of Rabindrasangeet, wrote the school's song, Amader Patha Bhavan. Others who played a pivotal role in the school's establishment included Mira Datta Gupta, Uma Sehanobis, under whose guidance a group of teachers came forward to found the school, Nandita Mitra, who was appointed as the school's first-principal and Manjushree Dasgupta, who became its first-vice principal. In later years, the management of the school was in the hands of the economist, Santosh Bhattacharyya, and Barun De, both of whom were its general secretary. Objectives The objectives of the founders of this school, which aims to prepare its students for undergraduate level college education, was twofold from the beginning: the founders wanted to establish a co-educational school in Calcutta which would offer education in both Bengali and English. In the early years of the founding of the school it was the school management's policy not to give excessive importance to examinations, although half-yearly and yearly tests were held from the school's inception. The first batch of students from the school took the Madhyamik (Secondary) Examination in 1972. Another aim of the school was to impart an education to its students in an open atmosphere which was favourable to the sensitive mind and was similar to the method of teaching initially followed by Tagore in his school in Santiniketan, although the medium of instruction in the school in Calcutta has always been more formal in nature. While paying heed to the importance of traditional methods of learning, the founders of the school do not allow excessive emphasis to be laid on the rote method. This institution follows the principle of secular education evident in Tagore's Brahmacharya Ashram in Santiniketan. Logo The logo of the school representing a \\"flame\\" is designed by Satyajit Ray, the world-renowned film maker who was also a commercial artist. Academic The school has a montessori, primary, secondary and higher secondary/junior college branches at different locations. The higher secondary branch offers subject combination in science, arts and commerce. =Language policy= The school offers education in the mixed medium. At the start of primary school, a student is streamlined into the Bengali or the English medium. Each standard used to have four sections, of which two were held in Bengali and two in English. Now, there are five sections, of which one is held in Bengali and four in English. The two other languages taught were Sanskrit and Hindi, which were offered as third languages from the seventh to the ninth standards. But now the only third language is Hindi. Third language is compulsory for all students. Cultural activities Since one of the main objectives of the school is to encourage education in Bengali both inside and outside the classrooms, it culturally identifies itself with the Santiniketan Patha Bhavana and holds programmes which have been traditionally held in that school, such as the Sahitya Sabhas. The Sahitya Sabhas are annual meets where the students of the school participate in the writing, reading and recitation of Bengali short stories and poems. Baishey Sravan is also celebrated and observed every year. Satyajit Ray allowed the holding of the premier of his film Joy Baba Phelunath (The Elephant God) in the school. Proceeds from the viewing of his other films were also donated to the school for its development. The school also organise an annual function where students of various classes perform, plays in English and Bengali are also performed. The school observes International Mother Tongue Day on 21st February and also events like \\"Basanto Utsav\\" and Shakespeare Day. Houses Students of the school are placed in houses named after four ancient Indian universities. They are: *Nalanda (Green) *Takshashila (Yellow) *Ujjaini (Blue) *Vikramshila (Red) Sports Students play sports such as cricket, football, table tennis, badminton, etc. The school has its own cricket team and football team representing in various tournaments. Its sports ground is located on Fern Road which is close to all the four buildings of the school. It organises a sports day at the Rabindra Sarovar stadium in Kolkata. Administration Administration of the branches of the school is carried out separately. The high school is administered by an executive council which has a president and a general secretary. The daily administration of the school is in the hands of the principal. Branches There are two independent branches of the school. The first one, in Ballygunge, Kolkata and the second one, a new branch opened in 1992, at Dankuni, Hooghly, are both administered by Patha Bhavan Society. Affiliations At the time of the founding of the school, the secondary branch of the school was affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, while the higher secondary branch was affiliated to the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. Patha Bhavan, 8/2, Gariahat Road, Kolkata. Reputation According to a National school survey in 2008,'Cover Story' in 'EW Day School Ranking', 2008 Patha Bhavan was placed 7th in 'Academic Reputation', 7th in 'Honesty/Integrity', 10th in 'Quality of Alumni' and 4th in 'Value for Money'. Location The four branches of the school are located at four different sites of Ballygunge, Kolkata: the montessori and primary wings, which function under a single administration, are located at premises on Swinhoe Street and Palm Avenue, Kolkata, respectively. The High School and the humanities wing of the Higher Secondary branch are located at 103, A and C, Bondel Road, Kolkata, although the main gate of the school opens on Ballygunge Place (now Amiya Bose Sarani), while the science wing of the Higher Secondary branch is now located at 8/2, Gariahat Road (formerly Merlin Park), Kolkata. The Merlin Park house used to be the residence of Smt. Lakshmi Ray, a former principal of the primary branch of the school. This house, an example of late colonial architecture, was given by its owner for the establishment of the school. The building in which the high school is located, another example of late colonial architecture and popularly called 'Delta House', is a colonial two storied building. Work for the construction of a new and more modern building, meant to accommodate all the branches of the school, has started at Merlin Park.

(ed.) Catastrophe Remembered: Palestine, Israel and the Internal Refugees. Zed Books, 2005. The group's director is Eitan Bronstein. Its slogan is \\"To commemorate, witness, acknowledge, and repair\\".Zochrot, the website in English, accessed 9 February 2010. Zochrot organizes tours of Israeli towns, which include taking displaced Palestinians back to the areas they fled or were expelled from in 1948 and afterwards. The group erects street signs giving the Palestinian history of the street or area they are in. Zochrot sees this as causing \\"disorder in space\\", raising questions about naming and belonging. A key aim is to \\"Hebrewise the Nakba\\" by creating a space for it in the public discourse of Israeli Jews. The word \\"Zochrot\\" uses the feminine plural present tense form of the Hebrew verb \\"to remember\\", whereas it is customary in Hebrew to use the masculine plural form when referring to a group of people. The feminine form was chosen to signal Zochrot's approach toward the Nakba, which the group says challenges what it sees as the masculine historical narrative by focusing on compassion and inclusion.  Publications  The magazine of the group bears the name Sedek (English: rupture/rift) and was published for the fourth time in spring 2010. This issue contains more than 40 poems by Israeli poets, which were published in the period between 1948 and 1958. The poems reflect the views of the authors on the displacement of the Palestinians in the years around the foundation of Israel. In 2012, Zochrot and Pardes Publications published a guidebook Omrim Yeshna Eretz (\\"Once Upon a Land ‚Äì a Tour Guide\\") in Arabic and Hebrew, which is \\"designed to educate Jewish-Israelis about how their towns and cities were founded in an effort to reconcile them with the original inhabitants of the land\\". It provides tours of 18 localities, mostly the sites of Palestinian villages depopulated in 1948. While Zochrot translates the title \\"Omrim Yeshna Eretz\\" into English as \\"Once Upon a Land\\", a more literal translation would be \\"They Say There Is a Land\\". \\"Omrin Yeshna Eretz\\" is a popular song and Israeli folk dance based on a poem by Shaul Tchernichovsky first published in a 1929 collection.

Its boundary is made up of the Alexandra Canal in the north; Kim Seng Road and Outram Road in the east; Zion Road and Jalan Bukit Ho Swee in the south; Delta Road and Lower Delta Road in the west.Bukit Merah Etymology Bukit Ho Swee means ‚ÄúHo Swee Hill‚Äù in Malay. The name was derived from Bukit (Malay for hill) and Ho Swee from Tay Ho Swee (1834- 1903), an influential Chinese opium and spirit farmer, timber merchant and ship owner.Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), Toponymics ‚Äì A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern Universities Press, He was also the son of Tay Han Leong, the first opium and spirit dealer in Singapore. When Bukit Ho Swee got its official name in 1907, it was an area with many plank and attap houses. History Bukit Ho Swee had a prominent Chinese community dating back to the days when Singapore was under British rule. Built over with wood frame huts with thatched roofs, it was an unplanned self-built township of about 20,000; although, like favelas everywhere, no census was ever taken. Its rabbit warren of narrow lanes, passable only to pedestrians, made it an ideal base for gangs who could escape police pursuit which was too dangerous. A major fire, the Bukit Ho Swee Fire, broke out on 25 May 1961 and the wooden huts were completely destroyed. Unlike previous kampong fires, the inferno managed to spread across two roads, and destroying the homes of nearly 16,000 people. The scale of this fire far surmounted all the previous fires. This includes the great fire of February 1959 at Kampong Tiong Bahru, which happened just across the main road from Bukit Ho Swee, which had rendered 5,000 people homeless. Thereafter, a second fire broke out seven years later that wiped out the remaining of Kampong Bukit Ho Swee.Khoo, P., Abul Fazil, &Yong;, J. (1968, November 24). Chaos as homes go up in flames. The Straits Times, p. 1. Retrieved from NewspaperSG. It swept across some 200 houses and caused 3,000 people to lose their homes. The recently constituted Housing and Development Board (HDB), moved in quickly to construct low-cost housing in the form of apartment blocks. Since these were easily patrolled by the police, gang power and influence waned. As part of the HDB's plan to move locals out of squatters into \\"estates\\", a school was opened to serve the residents. Bukit Ho Swee Secondary School opened in 1967 and was located at Lower Delta Road. In 1991 it merged with the now defunct Tiong Bahru Secondary School (est. 1966), located several minutes' walk away.Bukit Ho Swee Secondary School (between 1961 and 1967). NLB The site is now occupied by PSB Academy Delta campus. = Dwellings = Much of the housing in Bukit Ho Swee that existed at that time consisted of mainly one-room emergency flats and slightly bigger self- contained two room flats. A one-room rental emergency flat would cost roughly 20 dollars a month while a bigger two-room would cost only 4,000 dollar to buy.Mdm Chan Yoke Yue, First Hand Account: Growing up in Bukit Ho Swee, 2016 Citizens often squeezed their entire families in these tiny flats - studies have shown that at one time there could be up to 10 people living in the small space. Other bigger families would resort to splitting the family between two flats.Loh, Squatters into Citizens. Present Bukit Ho Swee is now a residential estate and little remains of its chaotic past.

It is a shrub or small tree with egg-shaped to oblong leaves with a wavy margin, yellowish green male and female flowers on separate plants and fleshy orange-red fruit. Description Elaeodendron australe is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of and has separate male and female plants. The leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs and are egg-shaped to elliptic or oblong with a wavy edge, long and wide on a petiole long. Male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. The flowers are arranged in cymes in leaf axils, on a peduncle up to long, each flower on a pedicel long. The four petals are yellowish-green, about long. Male flowers have four stamens and female flowers have four staminodes. Flowering occurs in spring and summer and the fruit is a fleshy, oblong to oval, orange-red drupe long. The fruit is ripe from March to July and often persists on the tree for many months. Taxonomy Elaeodendron australe was first formally described in 1805 by √âtienne Pierre Ventenat in his book Jardin de la Malmaison. In 1825, de Candolle descibed two varieties in Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Elaeodendron australe Vent. var. australe that has leaves less than four times as long as broad, and mostly more than wide; * Elaeodendron australe var. integrifolium (Tratt.) DC. (previously known as Portenschlagia integrifolia) that has leaves more than four times as long as broad, and less that wide. Distribution and habitat Red olive- berry grows in eucalypt and rainforest ecotone areas, and in littoral or dry rainforest. It is found in north-eastern and central eastern Queensland and as far south as Moruya in New South Wales.

Background Witnesses said the gunmen arrived at about 10:30 a.m. in two Ford Escorts, a red one that remained out front and a white one that entered the driveway. The car aroused the suspicions of a Portuguese security guard because it had been there the day before. On that occasion, two men who arrived in the car were challenged by the Ambassador's bodyguard. They said they had come for visas, but when asked to produce their passports, they left hurriedly. Because of this incident, the Turkish Embassy requested extra police protection from the Portuguese authorities, and one additional policeman was stationed on the road outside of the embassy on the day of the attack. Attack The Turkish bodyguard was alerted by the Portuguese policeman when the white car returned the next day. When the policeman approached it, an armed man opened fire with a submachine gun, wounding the policeman, but the attacker was in turn shot dead by the Turkish bodyguard. As Portuguese police hurried toward the scene, four other intruders, failing to gain entry to the embassy building, raced into the adjacent ambassador's residence and seized its only occupants, Cahide Mƒ±h√ßƒ±oƒülu, 42, the wife of the embassy's charg√© d'affaires, and her son Atasay, 17. The gunmen held the hostages in a room around which they planted plastic explosives. They threatened to blow up the building if the police tried to storm it. A force of some 170 riot policemen surrounded the building, cordoning off the area and hiding behind cars and trees to avoid sporadic gunfire from within the embassy compound. The Portuguese Cabinet under the Prime Minister M√°rio Soares went into an emergency session during the siege and decided to use for the first time the newly formed, British SAS-trained elite police detachment, the GOE (Grupo de Opera√ß√µes Especiais). However, before the special forces could start the operation, the attackers detonated a bomb, setting the building ablaze. When anti-terrorist police stormed the building, they met no resistance and found six burned corpses. The dead included 4 attackers, the Turkish diplomat's wife, and a Portuguese policeman, identified as Manuel Pacheco. Officials suggested that unforeseen developments may have led the assailants to fear a major police intervention was imminent and caused them to prematurely detonate their explosives. It turned out that the dead policeman, Pacheco, was familiar with the embassy. He had rushed to the scene after hearing about the attack over the radio and climbed into the room where the gunmen were holding hostages. He was killed in the explosion. Around the same time, one of the hostages, 17-year-old Atasay, jumped through the first-floor window of the residence, but was wounded in the leg by attackers as he fled.The Associated Press, July 28, 1983. Attackers Planned Long Siege. Escape of the hostage and interference of Pacheco might have prompted the gunmen to detonate the explosives. The Portuguese Interior Minister Eduardo Pereira said that \\"the terrorists clearly planned to occupy the embassy for a number of days, seizing a large number of hostages in order to make a major impact on public opinion.\\" Police officials revealed that the two cars were filled with food and explosives, suggesting that the gunmen were prepared for a long siege. Aftermath The Armenian Revolutionary Army claimed responsibility for the attack. A typewritten message signed by the Armenian Revolutionary Army delivered to The Associated Press office in Lisbon said: \\"We have decided to blow up this building and remain under the collapse. This is not suicide, nor an expression of insanity, but rather our sacrifice to the altar of freedom.\\" The group said the attack had been carried out because \\"Turkey and its allies refused to acknowledge the genocide of Armenians\\". The attackers entered the country through Lisbon Airport as tourists bearing Lebanese passports. They reserved hotel rooms from a public telex in Beirut and rented three cars in Lisbon. From the documents found in the hotel rooms, the police identified the five as Setrak Ajamian, 19 years old; Ara Kuhrjulian, 20; Sarkis Abrahamian, 21; Simon Yahniyan, 21, and Vache Daghlian, 19The Associated Press, July 28, 1983. Portuguese Suspected Armenian Terror Attack. (known in Armenian sources as \\"The Lisbon five\\"). They were buried in Beirut at the Armenian national cemetery in Bourj Hammoud. In addition to impacting relations between Armenians and Turks, the Lisbon attack also prompted changes to U.S. national security strategy. Namely, Ronald Reagan reportedly took note of the embassy attack and reacted emotionally, because it involved a female victim (i.e. Cahide Mƒ±h√ßƒ±oƒülu). Reagan is quoted as saying: \\"That's it. We're going to work with other governments and put a stop to this once and for all.\\" U.S. National Security Council member Oliver North then began drafting a National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) that authorized covert operations that were intended to \\"neutralize\\" terrorists. This prompted some discussion as to the directive's legality vis-a-vis Executive Order 12333, which proscribed \\"assassination.\\" While the neutralization terminology was ultimately scrapped in the signed NSDD 138, the directive nevertheless marked a significant shift in U.S. security policy in that it explicitly articulated America's right to defend itself against terrorists.  Commemoration  The attack on the Turkish embassy in Lisbon is commemorated by Armenians and Turks around the world. Every year the Armenian community in Lebanon holds memorial services to commemorate the deaths of the 5 attackers. The Armenian community of Glendale, California, held a vigil at a local church to \\"commemorate and honor the sacrifice\\" of the five attackers. The Armenian-American newspaper Asbarez in its editorial referred to the attackers as \\"freedom fighters and the heroes\\". In 2011 the Turkish embassy in Lisbon held a ceremony to commemorate the deaths of the wife of the Turkish diplomat and the Portuguese policeman who died in the attack.

She spent her entire career on Lake Malawi (formerly more widely known as Lake Nyasa) and was regarded as the oldest ship afloat in Africa. After more than one hundred years' service it was intended to restore her for use as a floating medical clinic to support the several million lakeshore dwellers whose average life expectancy is 44 years. The Government of Malawi offered support for this in 2009 and charity fundraising was sufficient to make progress. The hull was found to be beyond repair at a viable cost so a more practical modern craft was proposed to give ambulance service around the lake. Shipbuilders Alley & McLellan, Polmadie The Alley & McLellan shipyard in Polmadie, Glasgow, was a considerable distance from the River Clyde, with the final approach into Glasgow Central Station posing just one of many barriers between it and the Clyde. The company specialised in supporting the far reaches of the British Empire by building vessels that were dismantled into kit form once they had been completed. The resulting set of parts was frequently enormous and a daunting logistical task to transport. Re- assembly also depended heavily upon the availability of skilled labour at the customer's premises. As in the case of the Chauncy Maples, this was frequently the only viable option when the ultimate destination was very far inland, away from any semblance of modern communications. Purpose and delivery The SS Chauncy Maples was designed to steam the extensive waters of Lake Nyasa, the most southerly lake in East Africa. At long and wide it is the eighth largest lake in the world. It is also the second deepest lake in Africa and home to more fish species than any other lake on Earth, giving an easy source of food for those who live around its shores. Conceived and commissioned by the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), the 150 ton ship was one of the last designs produced by Henry Marc Brunel, son of the Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Once dismantled, the complex kit of almost 3,481 parts was transported by cargo ship to Portuguese East Africa, then towed by barge up the dangerous waters of the Zambezi. The boiler was built by Abbott of Newark. It weighed 11 tons and was transported in one piece on a special wagon fitted with Sentinel wheels, to be hauled overland by 450 Ngoni tribesmen for through uncharted malarial land to the East African Rift. The other parts of the ship were man-handled or carried on the heads of men and women over difficult terrain and across river beds: they averaged only a day. David Livingstone Archdeacon Chauncy Maples (left) with fellow missionary Rev. W.P. Johnson in 1895 David Livingstone, the first European to reach the lake and an evangelist for steamboat missions, had made much quicker progress in 1859, claiming much of the area surrounding the lake as part of the British Empire, forming the colony of Nyasaland. Although Portugal took control of the eastern shores of the lake, the islands of Likoma and Chizumulu were colonised by Scottish missionaries and, as a result, became part of Nyasaland rather than Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique). Reassembly Re-assembly of the Chauncy Maples proved to be even more arduous than the journey‚Äîin error, the part numbers had been stamped on each section prior to the galvanising process, making the task for the African engineers even more complex. It took two years to re-assemble; the vessel was finally launched on 6 June 1901 and named after Bishop Chauncy Maples, an Anglican missionary, later Bishop of Nyasaland. Tragically while on the way to take up his duties, his boat capsized during a storm on Lake Nyasa and he drowned because of the weight of his cassock. Hospital ship, missionary school and the extinction of the slave trade Missionaries brought to Africa far more than religion and the UMCA had a very clear vision for their ¬£9,000 investment. The ship had three overt tasks ‚Äì to give the lake a hospital ship, a missionary school and an emergency refuge from Arab slave traders. In reality, the goals were of more global importance; as one of the Mission's founding supporters, the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, had made clear, the prime task was \\"the work of civilising commerce, the extinction of the slave-trade and, if possible, the colonisation of Africa\\". Lake Nyasa was a long way from the sea, and initial progress with medical provision at Likoma was erratic. The programme had been introduced in 1894, during the brief stay of a UMCA physician. His replacement was the Rev John Edward Hine, who although also a medical doctor was ultimately little interested in this aspect of his duties. When Hine was appointed Bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa in 1896 he chose to concentrate on spiritual rather than health-related matters. SS Chauncy Maples at anchor on Lake Nyasa four years after her launch The arrival of the Chauncy Maples and Dr. Robert Howard produced a radical change in the level and quality of medical provision to the lakeside inhabitants. Howard quickly laid the foundation of a robust health system with the Chauncy Maples fulfilling a central role. By the 1930s many stations, including those on the periphery, had health clinics run by missionary nurses or by African assistants. With the advantage of details on local diseases gathered by other doctors in the area, mainly from the Scottish missions, Dr. Howard adopted an anti-malaria strategy, and in conjunction with colleagues at Blantyre mission, embarked on an anti-smallpox vaccination program. For a poorly-resourced mission, the cost of maintaining the steamer required a strong focus on local provisioning. With a draught permitting access to all areas of the lake, the ship was largely self-sustaining, her steam engine powered by wood scavenged from the shore areas. But the matter of slave raiding was more problematic, requiring not only manpower for site security, but also an appreciation of the uneasy boundaries that lay between the worlds of evangelism, medicine and trade. Finding appropriately qualified crew prepared to accept low pay and the tribulations of life on the lake was one thing; the Mission's unyielding insistence on celibacy among its European staff was an even greater recruitment challenge. Behind all this lay the tensions arising from the Mission's intentional policy of overextension of its mission surrounding Lake Nyasa. The Chauncy Maples operated in the contradictory world of an evangelical mission which offered desperately needed medical support to the poor in an environment of political instability and unfettered imperial capitalism. Apart from a period of service during the First World War as a troop carrier and gunboat, the ship served the inhabitants of Nyasaland for half a century until 1953, when she was sold and converted into a trawler. In 1967 the Malawian government bought her, refitted her as a passenger and cargo ship and replaced her steam engine with a Crossley in-line diesel engine. Her steam engine is preserved in the Lake Malawi Museum at Mangochi. The ship is currently laid up at Monkey Bay. Controversies of European Christian missions Although work in the field of health was conducted out of the conviction that western medicine was good for Africans, it was not an entirely altruistic programme. The missionaries were to reflect the emerging Victorian view of Africa and African peoples, that African thought and behaviour needed radical change if they were to be converted to western values. Like missionary work in other parts of Africa, it was viewed as a key means to prove the power and mystery of the Christian message. In retrospect there is evidence of a lack of missionary sensitivity to many aspects of African culture, the injustices of early colonial land policies, the low priority given to theological education, and the slowness to ordain African clergy. But much as missionaries must be viewed as principally propagators of basic religion, their work in introducing ideas of western medicine and technology undoubtedly had a profound impact on the foundations of modern public health in the region. By 1965, churches provided around 45 per cent of all hospital beds in Malawi. Some of the missionaries who spent time on the ship recognised the ironic nature of elements of their work. The Rev. George Wilson recorded in his diary: > \\"Wherever a European goes he seems to carry some subtle power of change; > whether it be the government official, the missionary, the planter or the > trader, each is working for change, whether he knows it or not. This is a > matter of great anxiety to all who love Africans, for I cannot feel at all > certain that this change must necessarily be for the better.\\" Most commentators would have accepted that radical change was now an urgent requirement, as was made clear by the Rev. Robert Keable a missionary in Zanzibar: > \\"We walked into the partially walled compound or court representing the > slave-market a bona fide affair, not like the caravanserai which used to be > fitted up and furnished by the Cairene Dragoman for the inspection of > curious tourists. A wooden cage, about twenty feet square, often contained > some one hundred and fifty men, women, and children, who every day were > 'knocked down' to the highest bidder in the public place.\\" The personal cost was high. In the gardens of St. Michael's church at Blantyre, the city named after Livingstone's birthplace in Scotland, is a memorial plaque to fourteen members of the Nyasaland Mission who died in the service of the Church of Scotland's African missions. The dates of death given on the plaque range from 1890 to 1919.

The last formal inspection in 1992 revealed little damage to the riveted steel hull; although a single skin hull no longer complies with current regulations, she has been granted an exemption on the grounds of historical importance. The higher quality of steel produced in 1899 no doubt also played a part - after placing the vessel in a dry dock at Monkey Bay in May 2009, marine engineer Pieter Volschenk concluded that more recently constructed ships looked in worse condition after only twenty years at sea. In January 2012, she was brought ashore for the continuing restoration work. The restoration is led by the Government of Malawi and supported by the Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust in Britain. It was expected that the vessel would return to the task for which she was conceived in late 2014. Once the Chauncy Maples had been restored to a floating clinic a medical team would provide support and treatment to people living around the shores of Lake Malawi. The country's lake dwellers currently have no access to health care services and face high rates of malaria, HIV- AIDS and tuberculosis. Life expectancy at birth is just under 53 years. In 2017, the trust announced that the restoration had been abandoned. \\"The Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust (CMMT) based in the UK together with Portuguese construction company, Mota-Engil, regret to announce that their joint project to renovate the 100 year old missionary vessel, Chauncy Maples, to operate as a mobile clinic on Lake Malawi, will not be proceeding. As work has progressed on the vessel, unforeseen technical problems have come to light regarding the integrity of the hull, which mean that the costs of refurbishment have escalated beyond what can be regarded as economically viable ‚Äì particularly noting that the object of the charity is delivery of healthcare and the vessel was only to be the means of delivery.\\" References The stern of MV Chauncy Maples at Monkey Bay, Lake Malawi, 2008 External links *Chauncy Maples Malawi Trust Category:Lake Malawi Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1901 ships Category:Ships of Malawi Category:Health in Malawi Category:Christian missions in Africa Category:Christianity in Malawi Category:Missionary ships ","title":"MV Chauncy Maples"},{"id":"22831097","text":"Arthur George Leslie Legge (5 October 1881 ‚Äì 5 January 1941) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Williamstown in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) and for Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL).Holmesby & Main (2014).It is important to note that, without providing any justification or supportive evidence for his extraordinary choice, Maplestone (1996), consistently lists \\"Arthur Legge\\" as \\"V.F. \\"Arthur\\" Legge\\" (i.e., at pp.404, 447-452).

Its roots can be traced to the 19th century encyclical Rerum novarum of Pope Leo XIII. Labor union movement The Catholic Church exercised a prominent role in shaping America's labor movement. From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican politics, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party. The Knights of Labor was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, it was the largest labor union in the United States. and it is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including Terence Powderly, its president from 1881 onward). Effects of Rerum novarum This was the context in which Pope Leo XIII wrote an encyclical letter that articulated the teaching of the Church with a view to the ‚Äúnew things‚Äù of the modern world. In Rerum novarum (1891), Leo criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations. He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church‚Äôs defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies. Rerum novarum provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism. Fr. Edward McGlynn's work first in St. Stephen's Parish in New York and his later alliance and support of and activity with Henry George and the land value taxation for social justice movement. The onset of industrial organizing in the 1930s, particularly with the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) led to a renewed activism by Catholics in the labor movement. Catholics such as Phillip Murray and Jim Carey led CIO unions. Over one hundred \\"Catholic Labor Schools\\" were founded by the Catholic Church to teach workers both Catholic social principles and the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of union organizing, contract negotiation, grievance handling, and union administration. The most famous of these schools are the Boston Labor Guild and New York's Xavier Labor School. The Catholic Church's teaching in support of labor unions is not just something of the past. The Church teaches that in today's situation, unions are an indispensable part of a just social order. German Catholic Central-Verein  The German Catholic Central-Verein was founded in 1855 as a federation of parish mutual aid societies. Although the German Catholic community had a strong reputation for conservatism, by 1900 it took the lead as the most reform-oriented of American Catholic societies under the leadership of Nicholas Gonner of Milwaukee (189-1903) and Frederick P. Kenkel (1908-1952).Philip Gleason, The conservative reformers: German-American Catholics and the social order (1968). Today its main role is to publish the Social Justice Review, a journal which was founded in 1908 to promote Christian humanism with respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings. National Catholic War CouncilBishops' Program of Social Reconstruction On February 12, 1919, the National Catholic War Council issued the \\"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction,\\" through a carefully planned public relations campaign. The plan offered a guide for overhauling America's politics, society, and economy based on Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum and a variety of American influences. The Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was thus questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some opposed it, including Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backing it, for example, and business groups criticizing it. New Deal era Catholics provided a major component of the New Deal coalition, with a significant presence in the Democratic Party, local big-city political organizations, and rapidly enlarging labor unions. Historian John McGreevey notes: \\"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraging their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsburgh's Charles Rice, Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and Buffalo's Monsignor John P. Boland, served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\\" The Catholic Worker Movement and Dorothy Day grew out of the same impetuses to put Catholic social teaching into action.  National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs More recent examples of Catholic social justice in action is the Catholic Campaign for Human Development created in part as an outgrowth of the work of Msgr. Geno Baroni, who founded the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs (NCUEA). NCUEA spawned, funded and trained hundreds of parish, neighborhood and community-based organizations, organizers, credit unions, and local programs. Baroni's Catholic social justice in action included notable prot√©g√©s, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-OH, currently the longest serving woman in Congress and Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-MD. President Barack Obama's first community organizing project was funded by the Campaign for Human Development.KROMKOWSKI, J. A. and KROMKOWSKI, J. D. (2012), An American Catholic Perspective on Urban Neighborhoods: The Lens of Monsignor Geno C. Baroni and the Legacy of the Neighborhood Movement. American Journal of Economics and Sociology, 71: 1095‚Äì1141. doi: 10.1111/j.1536-7150.2012.00848.x Catholic worker movement With the twentieth century and World War I, American Catholics began to emerge from their isolation. The immigrant church, in fact, began to go out of its way to assert its Americanness and ultra- loyalty. There was little Catholic protest against World War I. In May 1933 in New York City two American Catholics, Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, founded a new Catholic peace group, the Catholic Worker that would embody their ideals of pacifism, commitment to the poor and to fundamental change in American society. Opposition to World War II By 1941, just before Pearl Harbor, 97% of all Catholics polled opposed U.S. entry into World War II, far greater than the percentage of any Protestant denomination. Opposition to war, including pacifism, had a respectable and widespread appeal among American Catholics. This opposition took several forms, including the internationalist approach of CAIP (Catholic Association for International Peace). The Catholic hierarchy was almost universally opposed to the Burke-Wadsworth Act conscription bill of 1940. With the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 Catholic opposition to the war and the draft evaporated. Catholics, like most Americans, became fervent supporters of the war, both out of patriotic duty and from a sense of the justness of the struggle. Post World War II After the war Catholic peacemaking narrowed down to a very few institutions, including the Catholic Worker,See Interactive Map of Catholic Worker houses at: http://www.peacedocs.com/Site/Maps_%7C_Timelines_%7C_Catholic_Worker_USA.html and individuals, including Dorothy Day, Robert Ludlow, Ammon Hennacy, and Thomas Merton. By the late 1950s, however, these small beginnings began to bear fruit in a more widespread religious peace movement that then blossomed during the Vietnam War. The impetus of the war and the reform impulse of Vatican II created a new Catholic peace movement that included the Catholic Worker, the Catholic Peace Fellowship, the Daniel Berrigan, Philip Berrigan, Elizabeth McAlister and the Catonsville Nine. After the war activities were carried on by such individuals as Joseph Fahey and Eileen Egan who were instrumental in the creation of Pax Christi and continuing Catholic peace efforts into the 20th century. Other Catholic peacemakers have included Cesar Chavez, the Sanctuary movement, and Witness for Peace. Opposition to capital punishment The U.S. Catholic Bishops' Statement on Capital Punishment of 1974, declared a commitment to the value and dignity of human life. Bishop John May, of Mobile, Alabama, proposed a brief resolution which said simply: \\"The U.S. Catholic Conference goes on record in opposition to capital punishment.\\" Catholic teaching accepts the principle that the state has the right to take the life of a person guilty of an extremely serious crime, and that the state may take appropriate measures to protect itself and its citizens from grave harm, nevertheless, the question for judgment and decision today is whether capital punishment is justifiable under present circumstances. The Catechism of the Catholic Church (no. 2267) states: \\"If...non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and more in conformity with the dignity of the human person\\". Catholic Relief Services As the international humanitarian agency of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic community of the United States, Catholic Relief Services draws upon a rich tradition of Scripture and Catholic social teaching, which serve as the foundation for CRS' Guiding Principles. Acting as a guide to what a just world might look like, these Principles are shared across religious and cultural boundaries and articulate values that are common among people who seek to promote and work towards true justice and lasting peace. See also Catholic Relief Services Guiding Principles. \\"New\\" Catholic social activism Andrew Greeley describes the mid-70s as a demarcation between the ‚Äúold\\" Catholic social activist and the ‚Äúnew\\" Catholic social activist or the ‚Äúpre-Berrigan‚Äù and ‚Äúpost-Berrigan‚Äù approaches to activism. Both traditions appear to co-exist, today. In ‚ÄúCatholic Social Activism ‚Äì Real or Rad/Chic?‚Äù, Greeley saw the old social justice action in labor schools, labor priest, and community organizing that ‚Äúmastered the politics of coalition building with the system.‚Äù Leading figures in that ‚Äúold‚Äù tradition for Greeley were Ryan, Higgins, Egan and Baroni. On the other hand, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Catholic action came out of the Berrigan experience and the peace movement and was heavily involved in confrontation and protest.KROMKOWSKI, J. A. and KROMKOWSKI, J.

In 1992, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Early years Wieghorst was a stunt rider (horse) for a Danish circus (Tivoli Theater in Copenhagen) before migrating to the United States at the age of 19. He also worked on a farm where he often rode horses. Later years Wieghorst emigrated to the United States from Denmark in 1918 and lived the rest of his life there. He spent his working career on mounted patrol with the U.S. Cavalry, with occasional interludes as a wrangler on ranches in the western states. Wherever he went, he sketched and painted the Western culture he loved, often selling his work as calendar and magazine illustrations (such as Zane Grey's Western Magazine and Hoofs and Horns, an honor he shared with other cowboy artists such as Dan Muller). In 1924, Olaf Wieghorst married a Brooklyn girl named Mabel Walters and they had a son. In the same year, he joined the New York City Police Department (1924-1944) where he became a Mounted Police Officer with the Department. Due to his knowledge of horses, he was quickly sent to the Remount Section of the Mounted Unit where he broke and trained horses for the Unit. In 1945, Wieghorst eventually settled in El Cajon, California, San Diego County, California and spent the rest of his life there working on his art. He was a self-trained artist and learned to work with oil painting and water colors himself. Over time he became a proficient painter and as a result, Grand Central Art Galleries of the Biltmore Hotel chose to display his paintings. He also painted horses and studied their nature.

The Wall of Severus is believed to be a defensive fortification built by the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (reigned AD 193‚Äì211) during his military campaigns in northern Britannia in the early 3rd century. Although the structure is mentioned in several classical texts, its precise locations is academically disputed due to inconsistencies between sources. Scholarly consensus believes they are most likely referring to the Antonine Wall. However, Hadrian's Wall and Offa's Dyke have both been suggested as possible candidates. Archaeological evidence has been discovered showing parts of Offa's Dyke, on the England-Wales border, is at least as old as the mid-5th century predating the 8th-century reign of the Saxon King Offa of Mercia by 300 years. Historiography Septimius Severus arrived in Caledonia in 208 after Picts began making a series of attacks and incursions since 197. During these military operations in Scotland, the Wall of Severus was reportedly built. Cassius Dio, a Roman historian who lived at the time of Severus, makes no direct mention to any new fortification but does allude to the existing Antonine and Hadrian Walls. Late Roman historians interchange the name Severan Wall with the Antonine Wall. Other historical writers like Bede ‚Äì an 8th-century English monk in the Angle Kingdom of Northumbria, link the fortification with Hadrian's Wall. Texts that refer to the wall include: # Eutropius (late 4th century) writes: \\"He had his last war in Britain, and to fortify the conquered provinces with all security, he built a wall for 132 miles from sea to sea. He died at York, a reasonably old man, in the sixteenth year and third month of his reign.\\" (Eutropius, Historiae Romanae Breviarium viii 19.1, written in AD 369). # Historia Augusta (probably late 4th century), within the Life of Severus, mentions: \\"He built a wall across the island of Britain from sea to sea, and thus made the province secure ‚Äî the crowning glory of his reign; in recognition thereof he was given the name Britannicus.\\" (Historia Augusta, Life of Severus, 18:2, written around AD 395). # Bede (8th century) writes: \\"In the year of our lord 189 (AD), Severus became emperor (of Rome)... being of a harsh disposition and engaged in many wars, he governed the state vigorously, but with much trouble, having been victorious in all the grievous civil wars that occurred in his time, he was drawn into Britain by a revolt of almost all the confederated tribes, and after many great and severe battles, he thought fit to divide that part of the island that he recovered from the other unconquered nations, not with a wall as some have imagined but with a rampart, for a wall is made of stones. A rampart for which camps are fortified to repel enemies is made of sods cut out of the ground and raised high above the ground like a wall, having in front of it a trench from whence the sods were taken, with strong stakes of wood afitted above it. Thus Severus drew a great trench and rampart fortified with several towers from sea to sea, and there at York afterwards he fell sick and died.\\" # Asser (9th century), writing in The Life of King Alfred: \\"The wall was a good defence as long as Roman soldiers remained to guard it. But in process of time ‚Äì about two centuries after Severus's day ‚Äì the Roman empire itself began to decline, even in the very seat and centre of its power; and then, to preserve their own capital from destruction, the government were obliged to call their distant armies home.\\" # Nennius, History Of The Britons (Historia Brittonum), (9th Century), Chapter 23. ‚ÄúSeverus was the third emperor who passed the sea to Britain, where, to protect the provinces recovered from barbaric incursions, he ordered a wall and rampart to be made between the Britons, the Scots, and the Picts, extending across the island from sea to sea, in length one hundred and thirty-three miles: and it is called in the British language Gwal.* Moreover, he ordered it to be made between the Britons, and the Picts, and Scots; for the Scots from the west, and the Picts from the north, unanimously made war against the Britons; but were at peace among themselves. Not long after Severus dies in Britain.\\" * Or, the wall. One MS. here adds, ‚ÄúThe above-mentioned Severus constructed it of rude workmanship in length 132 miles; I.e. from Penguaul, which villiage is called in Scottish Cenail, in English Penteltun, to the mouth of the river Cluth and Cairpentaloch, where this wall terminates; but it was of no avail. The emperor Carausius afterwards rebuilt it, and fortified it with seven castles between the two mouths: he built also a round house of polished stonesThis is a reference to Arthur's O'on, since demolished on the banks of the river Carun (Carron): he likewise erected a triumphal arch, on which he inscribed his own name in memory of his victory.‚Äù # William of Malmesbury's Chronicle of the Kings of England (early 12th century), a translation of William of Malmesbury's Gesta regum Anglorum, and a reading of the original Latin both assert: \\"Severus and Constantius, two of their greatest princes, died upon the island, and were there interred with the utmost pomp. The former, to defend this province from the incursions of the barbarians, built his celebrated and well-known wall from sea to sea.\\" (Chapter 1/Cap I) AD1096/IC CVI Existence As the location of the wall remains undetermined, its existence was academically questioned in the early 20th century because there is no evidence that Severus built any fortifications during his time in Britain. Current academic consensus believes that Severus' campaigns involved repairing and strengthening the abandoned Antonine Wall before falling back to Hadrian's Wall.

Football career Sharp was born in Hereford and after playing his youth football with Hereford Comrades, played for Hereford Town and Hereford Thistle in the Birmingham & District League. From there, in June 1897 he joined Aston Villa who had won \\"the Double\\" in the previous season. He was joined at Villa Park by his brother, Jack. During the opening month of the 1897‚Äì98 season, Sharp took over at full- back from Howard Spencer who had sustained a serious leg injury, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. Sharp made 19 appearances during the season, before losing his place to Tommy Bowman who had been signed from Blackpool. Villa finished the season in sixth place, a disappointment after the two previous Championship winning seasons. For the following season, Spencer returned to the side and Sharp only made four further appearances as Villa once again took the league title. In the summer of 1899, Sharp and his brother were both transferred to Everton.

He made his debut playing at left-half in a 4‚Äì3 victory at Luton Town; after seven matches he switched to right-back, replacing Arthur Blackburn who was out with an ankle injury, with Bert Lee taking over at left- half at the start of an association with the Saints that would last until 1935. Sharp performed consistently during his one season at The Dell, at the end of which Southampton claimed the Southern League title for the fourth time in five years. In December 1900, Southampton acquired the services of C. B. Fry, the celebrated amateur footballer ‚Äì whenever Fry was available to play, Sharp was required to give way, thus missing several important games, including the FA Cup First Round defeat by Everton. Sharp returned to Goodison Park in the summer of 1901, where he made a further six appearances towards the end of the season, before retiring from professional football. In 1904, his amateur status was restored and he turned out for Kirkdale and then Southport Central of the Lancashire Combination. Career outside football Sharp was also a good cricketer and in the summer of 1900 averaged over 40 for Herefordshire. In 1904, he became the landlord of a public house situated opposite Goodison Park. He later joined the Everton board of directors, along with his brother.

In 1990, Sabrina was the hostess of the daily morning TV show Ricomincio da 2 with Raffaella Carr√† on Rai Due, and appeared on the popular music show Festivalbar with a new single called \\"Yeah Yeah\\". 1991 marked a turning point in Sabrina's career: she performed a duet with Italian singer Jo Squillo in singing \\"Siamo Donne\\", her first release in the Italian language. They performed together at 1991's Sanremo Music Festival to much acclaim. Sabrina's third studio album, Over the Pop, was released that same year, and for the first time she was allowed to co-write and produce some of the songs. It was clear that Sabrina's will to mature as an artist were emerging, and this desire for independence led to conflict with her management. As a result, the album promotion was interrupted and only one more single, \\"Shadows of the Night\\", was released from the album. A picture disc edition of Over the Pop was released later in 1991, now including \\"Siamo Donne'\\". Also on this version of the album an album version of \\"Yeah Yeah\\", was replaced by the remix version of this song.

Credited with killing over 200 Japanese attackers during a night-long assault, he was blinded in action by a grenade blast and endured multiple surgeries and extended rehabilitation upon his return to the U.S. His life story appeared in the American news magazines of the time, the book Al Schmid, Marine by Roger Butterfield, and the 1945 film Pride of the Marines, in which he was played by American actor John Garfield. Early life Albert Andrew Schmid was born in the Burholme neighborhood of Philadelphia, the second son and third child of Adolph and Marian Schmid who both came from Germany to Philadelphia in the early 1880s. His father worked as a truck driver and baker. His mother died around 1932, and his father remarried in 1934. Albert (Al) moved out around 1938, eventually becoming an apprentice steel burner at the Dodge Steel Company in Philadelphia in 1940. World War II Schmid enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on 9 December 1941 after hearing on the radio of the December 7 attack on Pearl Harbor. He received recruit training at Parris Island South Carolina, and further training at New River North Carolina where he was assigned to the 11th Machine Gun Squad, Company H, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. While on leave, he used a $60 bonus () from his employer to purchase an engagement ring for his girlfriend Ruth Hartley, a salesgirl he first met in May 1941. The 1st Marines landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, the largest Marine force ever engaged in landing operations up to that time and first American offensive against the Japanese. Schmid a private, was assigned as an assistant gunner/loader of a three-man crew manning a M1917A1 Browning heavy machine gun (water cooled, 30 caliber)Weapons of the World War II Gyrene, M19171A Heavy Machine Gun led by the crew's commander Corporal Leroy Diamond, with Private First Class Johnny Rivers as gunner. Schmid refused medical treatment for a serious foot infection in order to remain in combat with his team and fellow Marines.p.114 Gerber, David A. In Search of Al Schmid quoted in Mitchell, David T. & Snyder, Sharon L. The Body and Physical Differences: Discourses of Disability 1997 University of Michigan Press On the night of 21 August, an assault force of 800 Japanese crack infantry troops sent from Rabaul on August 18 under the command of Japanese Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki attempted to break through the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines's perimeter and recapture the hotly contested Henderson Field airstrip. To reach it, Ichiki's infantry regiment had to cross the Ilu River. Cpl. Diamond's team was entrenched and posted on its west bank. The Japanese attack began under the light of flares at 3 AM. Part way into the assault, Pfc. Rivers was killed. Pvt. Schmid took over the gun and fired it for over four hours. As the assault progressed, Diamond was seriously wounded in the arm, and several bullets hit and shredded the Browning's water jacket. Guided by Cpl. Diamond's fire direction, Schmid kept shooting the gun by himself and loading 250-round belts of ammunition with and without help. Utilizing short bursts to avoid overheating and jamming, Schmid kept firing the machine gun even though it glowed red hot. Ultimately, a crawling Japanese soldier threw a grenade into their machine gun position, wounding Schmid in the shoulder, arm, hand, and face. In spite of being blinded by the blast, Schmid resumed manning the gun, both firing and replacing ammunition belts in response to physical and verbal cues from Diamond as the Japanese continued to pour across the Ilu firing their weapons at the gun emplacement covered by a sniper firing from a tree across the river. The next morning, over 200 dead Japanese were counted in front of Schmid's position. Only 15 of the original attackers survived the assault, a solitary soldier among the 800 escaping unwounded. Colonel Ichiki committed suicide. =Navy Cross= All three Marines‚ÄîRivers, Diamond, and Schmid‚Äîwere awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism, Schmid receiving his medal at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 18 February 1943. He was also promoted to corporal (he was later promoted to sergeant). *Service: Marine Corps *Rank: Private *Battalion: 2d Battalion *Division: 1st Marine Division Citation: Post World War II In June 1946, Schmid was named Father of the Year in Pennsylvania, and the Democratic Party nominated Schmid as a candidate for the Pennsylvania Secretary of Internal Affairs, but he lost the election.Gerber, p. 116 Schmid eventually recovered partial sight in one eye, but problems with his leg during the cold winters led him to retire in 1957 and move to St. Petersburg, Florida with his wife and two sons. Schmid married Ruth Hartley on April 4, 1943. They had a son, Al Schmid, Jr., in June 1944. Schmid spoke at war bond rallies across the nation before being honorably discharged from the Marine Corps on December 9, 1944. He remained in the public's eye throughout the war largely through Roger Butterfield's book, Al Schmid, Marine and the Warner Bros.' film released in August 1945, Pride of the Marines.

It is a Grade I listed building. The tower, which was built around 1443, is in four stages, includes corner buttresses with shafts and pinnacles, and is connected across the angle. The tower contains a ring of six bells, the heaviest being a tenor of 21 cwt. There are traceried 3-light bell-chamber windows with a dense quatrefoil interlace and blank 2-light windows on the two lower stages. The flanked niches were for statuary, however this is now missing. The churchyard has a triangular lychgate designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Several of the chest tombs and headstones in the churchyard are also listed buildings. In 2013 the church was added to the Heritage at Risk Register because of the repairs needed to the roof and tower. In November 2013 a bell fell through two floors of the tower, but came to rest on rafters above the bellringers.

Cover versions and usage The song has been covered by pop punk bands Limp, the Aquabats, Whippersnapper, Matt Pond PA, and Dirt Bike Annie. The indie rock band the Walkmen performed a version of the song in November 2010 for The A.V. Club Holiday Undercover series. In 2015, country group the Zac Brown Band covered the song for the soundtrack to the sequel Vacation. In 2013, \\"Holiday Road\\" was adopted as the unofficial playoff victory song of the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks, who went on to win the Stanley Cup on June 24, the 30th anniversary of the song's release. In 2014, the song was used as the music on television advertising for Teletext Holidays, a British travel agency. The song appears under the closing credits of National Lampoon: Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead, a 2015 American documentary film directed by Douglas Tirola about the magazine and its related franchises and influence.

John Chevallier Cobbold - English brewer and railway pioneer Background Cobbold was the son of John Cobbold and Harriet, daughter of Temple Chevallier (a priest). Business career Cobbold was a member of an established brewing family who had been brewing beer in Ipswich since 1746. He was one of the driving forces behind the establishment of the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) which saw Ipswich connected to Colchester (and thus London) by rail in 1846 and the Ipswich and Bury Railway which saw the railway open to Bury St Edmunds in 1847. The two railways merged and a line to Norwich was opened in 1849. The EUR was taken over by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) in 1854 with ECR chairman David Waddington leading the negotiations and driving a hard bargain leading Cobbold to remark \\"a strong minority of our Board consider that you have done us\\". He also had shipping interests and between 1820 and 1865 more than 20 ships of up to 350 tons were acquired for regular trading with India and China. Political career Cobbold was Mayor of Ipswich between 1842 and 1843. He entered Parliament as one of two representatives for the Ipswich constituency at the 1847 general election, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1868 general election. Family Cobbold married Lucy, daughter of Henry Patteson (a priest), in 1827. They had eight sons and five daughters. Their sons included John, Thomas, Felix and Nathaniel, grandfather of Cameron Cobbold, 1st Baron Cobbold. Lucy died in 1879. Cobbold survived her by three years and died in October 1882, aged 85.

The closure of the consulates occurred in spring of 2018, a couple of months after the graduation of the 2018 class which happened to be the biggest graduating class in school history with 15 students. In the summer of 2018 the school received a permission to work for another school year (2018-2019) with a condition that it registers according to local legislation. In September 2018 the decision was reversed and the school was ordered to shut down within 3 days.

Sinclair, (March 17, 1932 - May 10, 2009) was an American automotive industry executive who served as Chief executive officer of Saab-Scania of America from May 1979 until September 1991, where he helped improve the popularity of Saab's cars by convincing the parent company to manufacture cars with high-end options such as turbochargers and a convertible version of its Saab 900 that was designed to appeal to American consumers. Biography Sinclair was born on March 17, 1932 in Philadelphia. As a child he helped in his father's grocery shop and attended Haverford High School in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania. He met the woman who was his wife-to-be while performing in an operetta there, and his plans to pursue a career as a concert pianist were cut short after his hand was injured by a meat slicer in his father's grocery store. He attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania and later took a job selling medical equipment.Weber, Bruce. \\"Robert Sinclair, Who Found a Niche for Saab, Dies at 77\\", The New York Times, May 16, 2009.

By 1983, under Sinclair's management, the 25,833 Saab vehicles sold exceeded the previous year's record-breaking sales by 42%.via Associated Press. \\"Saab's Sales At High in U.S.\\", The New York Times, January 4, 1984. Accessed May 17, 2009. In lieu of the annual allotment of 1,000 two- door economy-model sedans, Sinclair pushed the parent to manufacture vehicles equipped with high-end specifications including fuel injection, turbocharger, a five-speed gearbox, and also that the car would be available as a convertible, a body style that other car manufacturers had stopped producing expecting that safety rules would ban them. The convertible came in 1986 and was a great success. Some 250,000 of the Saab 900 convertible were sold (including the NG900) over the succeeding two decades. In a 2007 interview, Sinclair stated that his approach in introducing the new vehicles was that Saab \\"should add content, add performance, add sparkle and luster to the brand\\" in order to move to a higher niche market in the United States while the firm was focusing on a \\"no-frills market\\" in Europe. Sinclair initiated an effort to construct buses at a manufacturing plant near the firm's Connecticut headquarters in 1984, but terminated the program in the face of \\"low bid\\" contracts that made the sale of buses unprofitable.via Associated Press. \\"Connecticut Bus Plant to Be Closed by Saab\\", The New York Times, May 1, 1988.

It was the fourth depression and the first typhoon of the season. The disturbance dissipated later that day however it regenerated early on April 30 within the southern islands of Luzon. It was then designated as a Tropical Depression during the next morning by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), with PAGASA assigning the name Dante to the depression. However the JTWC did not designate the system as a depression until early on May 2 which was after the depression had made landfall on the Philippines. Later that day Dante was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and was named as Kujira by the JMA. The cyclone started to rapidly intensify becoming a typhoon early on May 4, and then reaching its peak winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) (10-min), 215 km/h (135 mph) (1-min) later that day after a small clear eye had developed. Torrential rains produced by Typhoon Kujira in the Bicol Peninsula triggered severe flooding and mudslides which killed 28 people and one missing. Meteorological history On April 28, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that an area of convection had persisted about to the northeast of Puerto Real in the Philippines. The disturbance had deep convection which was flaring in association with a mid level circulation center and was in an area of low vertical wind shear. However the disturbance then dissipated later that day. The disturbance then regenerated early on April 30, with a broad low level circulation center and was nestled within the islands of southern Luzon. An upper level anticyclone just to the northwest was enhancing pole ward outflow. During that day the disturbance developed further with improved convective banding in the northern quadrant, however interaction with land was a major hindrance. Early on May 1, the disturbance was designated as a Tropical Depression by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency, with PAGASA assigning the name Dante to the depression. Later that day PAGASA declared that Dante had made landfall on the Bicol Region in Southeastern Luzon. Early the next day the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance as whilst the low level circulation center had remained slow moving over southeastern Luzon the disturbance had a good outflow with convection starting to improve in terms of organization. Later that morning the JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression 01W. The Depression was being moved by the reverse oriented monsoon trough with a well formed low level circulation center with deep convective banding wrapping around the northern quadrant despite being close to land. Later on May 2, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Dante to a Tropical Storm, with the JMA assigning the name of Kujira to the cyclone. During the next day Kujira quickly intensified due to favorable sea surface temperatures with the JMA upgrading it to a Severe Tropical Storm later that day, before becoming a Typhoon early on May 4 by both the JMA and the JTWC as animated infrared imagery was showing the development of an eye feature. Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC declared that Kujira had reached its peak wind speeds of 155 km/h (100 mph) (10-min) 215 km/h (135 mph) (1-min) after Kujira had formed a small round eye. PAGASA then released their final advisory as Typhoon Kujira had moved out of the eastern edge of their area of responsibility as the typhoon had started to weaken due to convective banding around the low level circulation center beginning to unravel. After moving out of PAGASA's area of responsibility Kujira continued to weaken as it developed a cloud filled eye with the cyclone starting its extra tropical transition during May 6. Early the next day the JTWC downgraded Kujira to a Tropical Storm, while the JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm, as it had rapidly lost its vertical organization and was beginning to take on frontal characteristics, a sign that the cyclone was becoming extratropical. As a result of this, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Kujira; however, the JMA kept issuing advisories on a weakening Kujira, until the agency downgraded it to an extratropical low later that day. The extratropical low that was Kujira was then tracked by the JMA, until early on May 13, when the JMA reported that Kujira had dissipated. Preparations Tropical Storm Kujira affecting the Philippines on May 3 Early on May 1, PAGASA placed Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Albay, Sorsogon, Catanduanes, Masbate, Burias Island and Southern Quezon in Luzon and Northern Samar in Visayas, under Public Storm Warning Signal number 1 which meant that winds off 30‚Äì60 km/h (20-35 mph) were expected to affect the provinces within 36 hours. They kept the same eight provinces under public storm signal 1 until late the next day, when they placed the Catanduanes under Public Storm Warning Signal number 2, which meant that winds of 60‚Äì100 km/h (35-60 mph), were expected to affect the Catandaunes within 24 hours. They kept these signals up until later that day, when they lowered them for all provinces. Impact While in the Philippine area of responsibility, Kujira caused some 625,709,464 worth of damage to crops and livestock in Albay, Camarines Norte, Masbate and Sorsogon. It also caused some 102 million pesos worth of damage to communal irrigation systems in the region. The NDCC damage report update as of 6am PST May 12 declared 28 dead, one missing and 5 injured. Further, 383,457 people in 609 barangays of 60 municipalities and 4 cities in 5 provinces of Region V were affected by the storm. Damages are worth PhP1,228,422,344 Million or PhP1.228 Billion of which PhP 625,709,464 were in agriculture and PhP529.525 Million in infrastructure. Houses destroyed were at 2387, of which 138 were total and 2249 partial. Aftermath President Arroyo instructed the local government to provide relief with water, foods, and clothes. In the aftermath of Kujira moving away from the Philippines, a state of calamity was declared in Albay, Camarines Sur and Sorsogon after 28 people had been killed and 8 had been injured. Over 3757 houses were damaged with 297 fully damaged.

It is now privately owned but was once a monastic site, built around the 12th century. The abbey was burned in 1360 but was soon restored. It escaped the worst excesses of religious persecution, and was handed over to the Franciscan order in 1583. Irish historian and scholar M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh stopped there in 1631 and compiled the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, the book of invasions, a narrative in Gaelic, together with O'Mulcrony, Cucoigry O'Glery, O Duigenan and Gilla Patrick O' Lennon. It has subsequently had many uses, including an orphanage in the 19th century, and a base for American army divisions during the Second World War. Foundation Lisgoole Abbey, or the Abbey Church of Saint Peter, Saint Paul and Saint Mary, was formerly located on the southern banks of upper Lough Erne, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The site occupied the old Irish monastery of St Aid but was taken over by the Canons Regular of St. Augustine in 1106 or 1145 and was dedicated by Mc'Noellus Mackenlef, King of Ulaid. The sight has also been referred to as Lesa Gabail/Lesa Gabhail (1275), Lisngabail (deanery de Loghermy)(1306), Lesa gabhail/lios gabhail (1329), Leasa Gabhail/lesa gabail (1348), Lisgabhail (1395) and Lis Gabhail (1425). History The abbey was burned in 1360 together with those in Devenish, Roscommon, Sligo, Fenagh and Drumlias but was soon restored. During the reign of King Richard of England there is reference to the wife of Abbot of lisgooles Einri Mac Caba and their daughter Aine. Escaping the worst excesses of religious persecution, the abbey remained in use until its community eventually dwindled, so much so that an agreement was drawn up by the then abbot Cahill McBrien McCuchonnaght Maguire in 1583 to hand over the abbey to the Franciscan order. Even though reconstruction of a new abbey was taking place the monks were forced to leave in 1598. =Plantation era= During King James's inquisition into the designation of the lands of Fermanagh (September 1609), the lands of Lisgoole Abbey were given to Sir Henry Brunckar (12 November 1606). The allocation covered the abbey and the area of the late Abbey of Cannons in Lisgoole, which in turn included the old church and yard. The specific area was designated as 6 \\"quarters\\" of land containing 24 parcels known as tithes, each tate estimated to contain in \\"country measure\\". Associated with these lands were other traditional payments given to Ballinsaggart and other associated islands, together with the ownership of the late Abbey of St Francis, which is situated near Lisgoole Abbey. Lisgoole was recommended as the site of a new colonial-plantation settlement (later to be Enniskillen) by the Lord Deputy, Chichester. There were two sites under consideration for the proposed settlement, the first being Ballyshanon (now Ballyshannon) and the other at \\"Lysgoule which lies about the midst of the county\\". Lord Chichester expressed the view that he wanted to construct the \\"beginning of a town where he would build both sides of the river, whereby the bridge could be defended and the passage secured\\". Chichester was so taken by the location of Lisgoole he immediately ordered houses to be constructed to billet soldiers stationed at Devenish, together with a gaol and house of sessions, and a weekly market. The owners of Lisgoole ignored this offer from the Lord Deputy. The location eventually chosen by the commissioners for a town was Enniskillen. In 1608 Chichester recommended this position in his notes of remembrances but seems to have forgotten Lisgoole, saying \\"Inishkellin is the fittest place for a shire town and shall be made a corporation\\". The free school originally intended to be built at Lisgoole was eventually built at Portora. Eventually, the monks returned in 1616. =Gathering of the Four Masters= Irish historian and scholar Brother M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh stopped there in 1631 and compiled the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn ,translated in English,the book of invasions, a narrative in Gaelic together with O'Mulcrony, Cucoigry O'Glery, O Duigenan and Gilla Patrick O' Lennon. (O Luin√≠n) This was the first documented assembly of the Four Masters who later went on to document the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland (Annals of the Four Masters). It is written that the task, under the patronage of Brian Roe Maguire, commenced on 22 October 1631 and was finished by 22 December the same year.[The Fermanagh Story': a documented history of the County Fermanagh from the earliest times to the present day - Enniskillen: Cumann Seanchais Chlochair , 1969.] Later in 1644, Connor, Lord Maguire, was hanged for treason at Tyburn, London, His last will and testament was kept in a strong box, in the custody of the friars which amongst other things bequeathed ¬£20 to the abbey for prayers for his soul. In 1671, it is reported that the friar of Lisgoole (Paul O Feararan) met Oliver Plunkett at the abbey. In his report at this time (25 September 1671) the Primate states that there were five friars at Lisgoole, two of whom were good preachers, (Frs Feararan and Mcmulkin). =17th‚Äì18th century= In 1698 the abbey was sold to Mr. Thomas Smith by Charles Wallis and his wife, who succeeded the Earl of Huntingdon. Not much is noted about Lisgoole until 1739 when a chalice was presented by Sir Bryan Maguire. The land which used to belong to the abbey was leased in 1724 to John Armstrong, then James Armstrong (1750), James Armstrong (1758), then James, Thomas, and Jane Armstrong (1800). There was a notable raid on the abbey in 1780 by Black Francis McHugh and his gang (Pronsias Dhu). The monks continued worshipping until well into the 18th century, but their work in the local parishes was eventually responsible for their depletion. The last recorded friar from the area was Fr. Stephen Keenan, who died in Enniskillen in 1811. =19th‚Äì20th century= In 1819, John Armstrong, a lieutenant in the Fermanagh Regiment of Militia, sold the abbey to Michael Jones of Cherrymount, Donegal (also stated to be of Camlin), for ¬£12,300. In 1892, his wife, Mrs. Isabella Diana Jones, bequeathed the abbey to local charities including the Fermanagh Protestant Orphan Society. It was later purchased by Mr. Robert Johnston of Stuttgart and New York, who died in 1913. It then passed to his nephew Robert William Johnston. At this time only a remnant of the abbey remaining was incorporated into the house. During the Second World War, American army divisions used this area as a base. These units included the 109th Medical Battalion (34th Infantry Division) in 1942 and the 8th Medical Battalion (minus Companies A and B) (8th Infantry Division) from 16 December 1943 to 1944.

Set in the Philippines during the start of the American Occupation in the early 1900s, the film revolves around three generations of a family who flees the impending conflict in the city and tries to survive in the jungle. The grainy, black and white quality, primitive editing techniques and painted backdrops evoke the mode of filmmaking pervasive during that era. It was the first Filipino film to be screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the Cannes Film Festival when it was shown at the 2009 festival. Plot The film starts in a street scene. The people are in jovial spirits and are eager to celebrate the Philippines' newfound independence from Spain. The music and festivities then stop abruptly and they look up to the horizon. In few whispered words, the townspeople remark that \\"they are coming,\\" referring to the American forces. Wary of the terror the soldiers might bring upon them, a mother (Tetchie Agbayani) decides to flee to the mountain jungles with her son (Sid Lucero). Deep in the jungle, they find an abandoned wooden hut and decide to settle there away from civilization and the perceived oppression that could come from the Americans. One day, the son finds a young woman (Alessandra de Rossi), exhausted and lying on the road after an American soldier rapes her. He tends to her, much to the reluctance of his mother. However, his mother eventually falls ill, then dies; he buries her in the middle of the forest. Afterwards, the woman gives birth to her child from the rape. At this point, the film's narrative is interrupted. The celluloid reel is removed and replaced. This time, it is a newsreel narrated by an American broadcaster at first describing the Philippines in general, then proceeding to an event that occurred in a marketplace in an unnamed town. A young boy is shot by an American soldier, who thought he was stealing, although the vendor said that the boy was just being playful. However, the other passersby said that the boy was indeed about to commit a crime, justifying the soldier's action. The soldier then poses beside the dead body for the camera. The newsreel ends with a warning to all people who do questionable things: \\"Our brave troops are everywhere, ensuring that the streets are safe in this time of crisis.\\" The newsreel ends just as abruptly and the narrative resumes. The woman's little boy is now grown up and living very comfortably in the jungle. His makeshift family has discarded the few things that remained from their civilized life in the city. The child, not knowing about life below the mountains at all, is not afraid to roam in the jungle. He keeps telling the man and the woman of the white ghosts he sees between the trees. The man and the woman realize these are the soldiers and that it is only a matter of time before they are found. One night, while the man and the boy embark on a hunting expedition, a storm begins to rage across the jungle. It blows away their makeshift hut, killing the woman inside. The man also dies protecting the boy and keeping him dry. The boy wanders the jungle alone, until American soldiers find him. Terrified, he runs away from them, and the soldiers promptly shoot at him. The boy climbs up the mountain. His shirt slowly becomes hand-painted as he jumps off a cliff to his death. The sky in the backdrop also becomes hand-painted, first a faint yellow, to a bright orange, then finally a deep red. Cast *Tetchie Agbayani as the mother *Sid Lucero as the man *Alessandra de Rossi as the woman *Mika Aguilos as the boy Production Raya Martin developed the film as an homage to the early Hollywood studio system, which has greatly influence Filipino cinema. He wanted to capture the feel of films shot in the early 20th century, and this involved shooting entirely inside a studio, a practice that was popular in the early days of Hollywood cinema. Since most of the film was set in the jungle, they basically had to reconstruct a jungle location indoors. Martin's production design team, headed by Digo Ricio, placed trees and plants both fake and real, and painted all of the backdrops for the scenes. Film critic Graham Fuller said that the film \\"harnesses the aesthetics and artifice of silent films and early talkies: their grammar, look, acting, and cinematographic tricks.\\" Reception Independencia was one of two films from Raya Martin that were screened as official selections at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, and was the first Filipino film to be selected for the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival. He has since garnered critical acclaim in European and Asian Film circles. Film critic Antoine Thirion considered him one of the 50 best filmmakers under 50 in the 50th issue of Cinemascope: \\"There‚Äôs no Filipino director who can deny that he‚Äôs trying to portray the particularly tragic condition of their people. But only Martin has succeeded in advancing a contemporary image, solidly set in the present yet permanently floating between ages. The mixture of fantasy and determination, of naivet√© and irony necessary (as in the exotic colonial/Hollywood pastiche of Independencia) is only his.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2009 films Category:2009 drama films Category:2000s historical drama films Category:Philippine films Category:Philippine historical drama films Category:Tagalog-language films Category:Philippine black-and-white films ","title":"Independencia (film)"},{"id":"22831815","text":"Alexandra Sicotte-Levesque, M.S.M, founded Journalists for Human Rights (JHR) in 2002 with Benjamin Peterson.

The village is on the B158 road above sea level and has a view of the Lea Valley to the north. Although on an ancient site, St Mary's parish church dates mainly from the 17th and 18th centuries and was restored in 1883. The west tower dates from the 15th century and has eight bells, the oldest cast in 1681. The church contains an unusual Wedgwood ceramic font dated 1780 and several brasses and monuments. In 1916 the east end of the church was damaged by a bomb dropped by the German Navy Zeppelin L-16; two sisters were killed. There is a village pub named The Rose and Crown. Historic houses in the parish include Camfield Place which was the home of the novelist Barbara Cartland and visited by Beatrix Potter. Nearby is Holwell Court, a Grade II listed building, built in about 1900 for Sir Ernest George; it is now converted to private apartments. Essendon Place was the seat of the Barons Dimsdale of Russia; Thomas Dimsdale was an expert on the treatment of smallpox by inoculation and in 1768 he was invited to Russia to inoculate Catherine the Great. For his services there he was made a baron of the Russian Empire. Bedwell Park is another manor house near to the village and is also the site of Essendon Country Club golf club. Bedwell End was the home of Deneys Reitz, High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa, until his death on 19 October 1944. At the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War he joined the Boer forces at the age of seventeen and accompanied General JC Smuts on his famous raid in the Cape Colony, of which Reitz wrote in his autobiography, Commando. In World War I, as a lieutenant-colonel, he commanded the 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front in France. In the early hours of the 2 and 3 September 1916 during World War I, Essendon was bombed by a Schutte-Lanz airship returning from a bombing raid on London. Two people were killed and a plaque commemorating the event is on the wall of the church.

The temple is located on the banks of Vaigai River. Shiva is worshipped as Edaganathar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Visalakshi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple complex covers five acres and it houses two gateway towers known as gopurams, each facing the Edaganathar and Elavrkuzhali shrine. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Edaganathar and his consort being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Muthu Pandal festival is celebrated during the day of the Magam (February ‚Äì March) is the most prominent festival. The original complex is believed to have been built by Pandyan Empire, while the present masonry structure was built during the Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, Jainism was the most prominent religion in the region. Sambandar challenged the Jainist scholars to compete against him. As per the rules of the competition, the scholars had to write their verses in palm leaf, float them in the river and the winner is decided when the leaf floated, while the lower work sunk. Sambandar's verses on a palm leaf (Edu) is said to have gone against the current of Vaigai and settled here, as opposed to the leaf floated by the once dominant Jains here, hence the name Tiruvedakam. It is believed that Shiva appeared at the place as Eduganathar, the one who let the leaf float. Vaaduvenra Vinaayakar here is said to have stopped the movement of the palm leaf in the guise of a fish, in response to Sambandar's patikam. Shiva here is believed to have been worshipped by Garuda, Adiseshan and Vishnu. As per local legend, the place was called Cetanur as Adisesha, the serpent snake of Vishnu worshipped Shiva and later went on the become Edakam. Architecture The temple is located on the Madurai ‚Äì cholavandan bus route and the nearest railway station is cholavandan. The present structure with spacious corridors and imposing gopurams occupies an area of about . Images related to Sambandars episode are seen carved on the stone steps leading to the Vaikai river. The presiding deity lord shiva is called as Edakanatheswarar and the Ambal his consort mother Parvathy is called as Elavaarkuzhali, Sugandha Kundalambika. The sthala vriksham is Vilvam(Aegle marmelos) and the Theertham is called Bhrama Theertham. Inscriptions from the period of Jatavarman Kulasekhara Pandyan (12th century AD), and Krishna Deva Raya are seen in this temple, speaking of their endowments to this shrine. As per tradition, a Pandyan queen wanted Sambandar to reconvert the king Arikesari Nedumaran to Saivism from his Jain beliefs. Sambandar accepted the plea of the queen and influenced the king to convert to Saivism. It is also believed that the king slayed around 8,000 Jains in his kingdom. The stone carvings in the temple narrate the tradition. Worship, religious practises and literary mention The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Kalasanthi at 6:00 a.m., Irandam Kalm at 9:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m, Irandam Kalm at 7:30 p.m., and Arthajamam at 9:00 p.m.. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Edaganathar and Elavrkuzhali. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham, and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Sambandar's miracle is celebrated every year as Edu Ethireriya Utsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi. Other festivals include Vinayaka Chaturthi, Aadi Pooram, Navaratri, Aippasi Pournami, Skanda Sashti, Kartikai Deepam, Arudra Darisanam, Tai Poosam, Maasi Magam, Panguni Uththiram and Vaikasi Visakam. During the Edu Ethireriya Utsavam, the act of Sambandar is reenacted in the temple. Sankabisheka, performed during Karthikai (November ‚Äì December) is considered very sacred in the region. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams ‚Äì Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Sambandar.

It is said to have been built by Henry VIII of England for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. The family seat of the Shaw family for over a century, by the late 19th century it was used as a Freemasons Hall and was later used during World War II. After the war, the hall was too costly to run and was opened to the public until a fire gutted it in 1965. It was made a Grade II listed building on 11 June 1954. History The site had been a late medieval courtyard building, the residence of the manor of Andrews. The house was built in the latter part of the 15th century and was two storeys high with a tiled roof. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey owned the manor from 1519 until 1529. By the 18th century, the manor was owned by the Shaw family. In 1750, lord of the manor, William Shaw, saw that the exterior of the house was encased in Georgian brick and expanded, except the north front. In 1801, much of the house was in a state where it needed to be demolished, and around 1820 the south side was demolished by John Shaw, who was the owner around this time. In the late 19th century the house was used on several occasions for conferences. On 8 July 1876, the Provincial Grand Lodge of Hertfordshire was held at the manor, and until the 1930s it served as a Freemasons hall. In 1906, Cheshunt Great House and its of land were put on the market for roughly ¬£2,000, which was later reduced to ¬£900. It was purchased by Great House Co. Ltd, although most of the lodgers bought shares in the company. From August 1939 until 1944, the house was used for wartime requirements. After World War II, Cheshunt Great House was considered too expensive to renovate and was opened to the public until destroyed by fire in 1965. It was excavated in 1969. Later the site was turned into a landscaped garden. Structure The hallway In an early 18th-century print of the house, it was quadrangular, inclosing a courtyard, and there was some evidence that a wing had been removed from the north end of the west front. The south, west, and east fronts of the house still remained in the early 20th century and were built of plain red brick with tiled roofs. The south front entrance of the building had a four-centred stone arch with a very large round arched window above it which was dated to around 1850. The bases of three diagonal brick chimneys are believed to have dated to the early 17th century. Cheshunt Great House had a large hallway and basement; the hallway received some light from built-up windows in the west wall. The main entrance door opened directly into the south end of the old hall. The hall measured 37 feet 6 inches long by 24 feet 6 inches wide and was paved with square slabs of black and white marble with a stone fireplace and 18th-century panelling. A portrait and heraldry hung above the fireplace. The ceiling was adorned with carved corbels, representing angels holding shields with two human heads. A doorway at the north-west corner of the hall led to a corridor which led to an oak staircase dated to around 1750, with three balusters to each step. The kitchen was located in the room to the north of the hallway, with a lath and plaster. The adjacent room featured a large, placid-looking fireplace, with the ceiling above supported by three old oak beams supported by a circular pier without capitals in the centre. In 1912 it was reported that one of the piers had been replaced by a simple wooden post. Two windows were located in the east wall, with two openings in the south wall. At the western end was a vaulted passage, which by the early 20th century had been partially bricked up. A fireplace was located in the north wall, with moulded four-centred arch and jambs. The upper floor to the hall was relatively placid, with little of note except for an 18th-century fireplace.

At the foot hill, there are traces of a moat and Fort Marudhu, which was pulled down in early 19th century. One of the seven Vallals, Paari ruled this area. The barren hill is believed to have been covered with dense jungle in the days of Maruthupandiar's rule from late 17th century to 1801. It was part of a large jungle that extended from the Eastern Ghats to the Palk Straits. This is a vast hill temple reached by a flight of steps in the Pandya Kingdom. The Marudu brothers of Sivagangai associated with Kalayar Kovil have made several contributions to this temple. The hilly village includes five areas (Piranmalai Main, Mathagupatti, Pudupatti, Pappapatti, Adiyarkulam). Mythology Piranmalai is said to have been ruled by Paari Vallal. Piraanmalai is said to be a block of Mount Meru, which got blown off during a fierce tussle between the serpent king Aadiseshan and the wind God Vaayu(as in Tiruchengode).

Shiva is believed to have revealed a vision of his marriage with Parvati to Agasthya Muni here. Lord Shiva in this hill temple is known as Mangaibaagar(also called MangaiNayagar) and Goddess Parvati is known as Thenammal.

Her presidency of the organization was during the Vietnam War. Hasegawa organized protests against the war and led a peace delegation to North Vietnam. Hawegawa received the Niwano Peace Prize in 1996. She moved to South Hadley, Massachusetts in 2001, where she continued to be active in working for peace and inter-religious cooperation until her death on July 1, 2012. She was named one of the Library of Virginia's Virginia Women in History in 2018.

It is a cognate of Birger;Elof Hellquist, Svensk etymologisk ordbok. Lund 1922. B√∂rje is the form that has developed naturally according to the sound change laws of Swedish, whilst Birger is a literary form that has been common since the nineteenth century, when archaic forms of names became fashionable. Etymology The etymology of B√∂rje is uncertain. Probably it is a short form of names beginning with Berg‚Äê. Less likely it means ‚Äùhelper‚Äù, from the verb b√§rga. It has also been suggested that it is derived from the name element ‚Äëger (spear). Sound changes B√∂rje developed from Old Swedish Birghir which was pronounced with a voiced velar fricative […£]: [bir…£ir]. The voiced velar fricative was spelled ‚ü®gh‚ü© i Old SwedishElias Wess√©n, Svensk spr√•khistoria I: Ljudl√§ra och ordb√∂jningsl√§ra. Fourth edition. Stockholm 1955. and changed to /j/ after /r/ in modern Svenska. B√∂rje is an ija‚Äëstem.Ragnvald Iversen, Norr√∏n grammatikk. Seventh edition, revised by Eyvind Fjeld Halvorsen. Oslo 1973. Ija‚Äëstems ended in ‚Äëir i Old Swedish, which regularly developed into a word final ‚Äëe in modern Swedish. This explains why B√∂rje has accent 2 today: since the synkope at the transition from Proto-norse to Norse the name has been disyllabic, which leads to a word being pronounced with the grave accent in modern Swedish. Hence, the vowel in the second syllable of old Swedish Birghir or Birgher was no svarabhakti vowel like the ‚Äëe‚Äë in modern Swedish words such as the a‚Äëstem dager, which at one stage was monosyllabic (dagr) and therefore has accent 1. The first vowel ‚Äëi‚Äë of Birghir between a b and an r changed into an ‚Äëy‚Äë and then into an ‚Äë√∂‚Äë. The vowel was ‚Äëi‚Äë labialised by the influence of the initial /b/. The form Birger The form Birger has been revived from the old language within the last 200 years. This \\"revived\\" form has accent 1, like an a‚Äëstem with a nominative suffix consisting of the svarabhakti‚Äêvowel ‚Äëe‚Äë plus ‚Äër. Swedish names revived during romanticism commonly take a historically unjustified pronunciation. Popularity B√∂rje was very common as a given name in 1930‚Äì49.

It was filled with water on 2 December 1808. Located in the 19th arrondissement of the capital, it links the Canal de l'Ourcq to the Canal Saint-Martin, and it represents one of the elements of the R√©seau des Canaux Parisiens (Parisian Canal Network), a public-works authority operated by the city. The other components of the network are the Canal de l'Ourcq, the Canal Saint-Denis, the Canal Saint-Martin, and the Bassin de l'Arsenal. Together, these canals and basins extend roughly . Rectangular, eight hundred metres in length and seventy metres in width, it begins at the Rue de Crim√©e lifting bridge, the last bridge in Paris that can be raised and lowered hydraulically to permit the passage of ship and barge traffic beneath it, and it ends at the Place de la Bataille-de-Stalingrad near the Rotunda de la Villette. River cruise boats tie-up here and the shores of the basin are also the location of the MK2 Quai de Loire and MK2 Quai de Seine theatre complexes which are the most modern in France.MK2 Quai de Loire / Quai de Seine A small electric passenger ferry, the Z√©ro de conduite, is available for transporting people from one side of the basin to the other. The basin is bordered in the north by the Quai de la Seine and in the south by the Quai de la Loire, which are linked in the middle of the basin by a footbridge, the Passerelle de la Moselle. History The Saint-Martin barrier and the canal at the beginning of the 19th century, by Christophe Civeton. View from the Rotonde de la Villette towards the old warehouses The Lifting bridge at Rue de Crim√©e The end of the basin at the Rotonde de la Villette (Place de la Bataille-de- Stalingrad). On this postcard from the beginning of the twentieth century the southern end of the basin where it becomes the Canal Saint-Martin can be seen. Over the opening to the canal is a kiosk for the General Omnibus Company which was a part of the tramway and the bus system of Paris. Above it is the viaduct built for the Paris M√©tro Line 2, then operated by the Compagnie du chemin de fer m√©tropolitain de Paris (CMP). =The First Basin= The first Bassin de la Villette is 699 metres long and 70 metres wide. It has served several functions. Its original function was to serve as a reserve of drinking water for Parisians. Its secondary function, in association with the second basin, was to provide water for navigation on the canals of Saint-Denis and Saint- Martin. At the beginning of the 19th century the first basin was surrounded by gardens where Parisians came to spend pleasant interludes (walking in summer, skating in winter). But the industrial era of the 1850s saw the disappearance of this aspect of recreation. Goods depots were built on the banks. In 1832 Paris was hit by a great epidemic of cholera. Parisians using water from the Bassin de la Villette were less severely affected than those using water from the Seine (the Javel and Samaritaine steam pumps) because of waste waters being discharged into the river by the city - especially the waste of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris, where there were many sick, which spanned the small arm of the river between the Ile de la Cit√© and the left bank. In the late 19th century, commercial activities developed at the basin. In the same period the Moselle footbridge (13 metres high and a span of 85 metres) was built by Armand Moisant.Iron in Paris, Bernard Marrey, Paris, Picard / Pavillon de l'Arsenal, 1989, p. 82, 209 pages, .Bernard Marrey and Paul Chemetov, Colloquially unknown, Architectures, Paris, 1848-1914, 1976, Secr√©tariat d'√âtat √† la culture, Ministry of Culture (France), Paris, p. 58, 168 pages . It was decorated with a clock 3 metres in diameter. This bridge was replaced in 1966. =The Second basin= The Lifting bridge of the Rue de Crim√©e or Pont de Flandre, a lifting bridge weighing 85 tons built in 1885, separates the two basins. It allows traffic on the Rue de Crim√©e to cross the canal and connects the Quai de l'Oise on the north-west side to the Quai de la Marne on the south-east side. When the bridge is raised pedestrian traffic can still continue on a fixed elevated walkway. At the time of its construction it was the third largest lifting bridge to be built in France.L.

Charles Dunod, Paris, 6th, Vol. XI, 1886, 1st sem., p. 711‚Äì712. It is now the last one in Paris and is registered as an historical monument.Ministry of Culture, M√©rim√©e The second basin measures 30 m wide and 730 m long. This basin, which is often prematurely named the Canal de l'Ourcq, originally ran along the back of the old village of La Villette. At its northern end is the \\"roundabout of canals\\" where the Bassin de la Villette converges with the Canal de l'Ourcq (which brings water for more than 100 km from the river Ourcq) and the Saint-Denis canal which, with a length of 6,647.50 m and a slope of 28.45 m, joins the Seine at Saint-Denis, as well as the small Darse du fond de Rouvray canal (a port for the canal ferry boats). Warehouses There are two buildings at the end of the Bassin de la Villette that were built between 1845 and 1853 as commercial warehouses, but which had a certain utilitarian beauty. They were known as \\"general merchandise warehouses\\" and they were first used to store grain and flour. Their design, execution, and placement were based on the urban plans originally conceived by Claude Nicolas Ledoux in the eighteenth century, and they operated in perfect symmetry at the Bassin de la Villette, one on the Quai de la Seine side, and one on the Quai de la Loire side. Later, they gradually lost their original purpose and at the end of the 20th century were transformed into artists' studios and workshops, small offices, and other small enterprises. In 1990 the building on the Quai de la Seine side was burned beyond repair. For security reasons the storehouse on the quai de la Loire side was also closed. These warehouses have now been replaced by the MK2 cinema complexes. =River transport and the economic role of the basin= Loire Quay around 1903-1908 Intensive freight and port activity developed around the canals from the second quarter of the 19th century. In the last half of the same century there was a great deal of industrialization in Paris in the area of the present Seine-Saint-Denis. At the same time port traffic in the Bassin de la Villette was at its peak and equal to the port of Bordeaux. During the 20th century this freight traffic experienced significant peaks mainly related to construction activity after the world wars. Steadily declining since the middle of the 20th century this traffic disappeared for the Bassin de La Villette and is currently at its lowest level in history for all Parisian canals (around 1 million tons in 2000). At the same time tourism-related passengers from the Bassin de la Villette slowly began to increase. Cultural and leisure activities The buildings at the north-east of the Bassin de la Villette Barges are moored along the banks of the basin throughout the year offering cultural activities such as theatre, cinema, concerts, etc. In summer the banks of the basin are used by fishermen, bowls players, and picnickers. On summer evenings it is not unusual for the left bank (exposed longer to the sun) to be occupied from one end to the other. Every year in June is the festival of the basin. There are festive activities on both sides (concerts, mini-shows, exhibitions). The celebration ends with a big fireworks display from the bridge. Since 2007 an extension of the Paris-Plages has taken possession of a large part of the quay of the Seine and offers taverns, restaurants, boat rides, children's play area, petanque, etc. Rowing is practiced throughout the year on the water. On the Quai de la Seine there are the Sup de Pub and Sup Career schools which are both INSEEC Business Schools.

The eponymous \\"Just Men\\" appear in several sequels. Publication Edgar Wallace formed the idea of The Four Just Men ‚Äî four wealthy gentleman vigilantes (including a European prince) who punish wrong- doers who are beyond the reach of the Law ‚Äì while returning to England in 1905. He had to create his own publishing company, Tallis, to publish it and decided to manage a 'guess the murder method' competition in the Daily Mail with a prize of ¬£1,000 (equivalent in purchasing power to at least ¬£93,000 in 2013). Wallace intended to advertise the book on an unprecedented scale, not just in Britain itself but across the Empire. He approached the proprietor, Lord Harmsworth for the loan of the ¬£1,000 and was promptly refused, but Wallace pressed ahead anyway. His alarmed workmates at the Mail prevailed upon him to lower the prize money to ¬£500: a ¬£250 first prize, ¬£200 second prize and ¬£50 third prize, but were unable to restrain him in the privacy of his home. Wallace had advertisements placed on buses, hoardings, flyers, and so forth, running up an incredible bill of ¬£2,000. Though he knew he needed the book to sell sufficient copies to make ¬£2,500 before he saw any profit, Wallace was confident that this would be achieved in the first three months of the book going on sale, hopelessly underestimating the expenses. Enthusiastic, but without any substantial managerial skill, Wallace had also made a far more serious error. He ran the FJM serial competition in the Daily Mail but failed to include any limitation clause in the competition rules restricting payment of the prize money to one winner only from each of the three categories. Only after the competition had closed and the correct solution printed as part of the final chapter denouement did Wallace learn that he was legally obliged to pay every person who answered correctly the full prize amount in that category; if six people got the 1st Prize answer right, he would have to pay not ¬£250 but 6 √ó ¬£250, or ¬£1500, if three people got the 2nd Prize it would be ¬£600 and so on. Additionally, though his advertising gimmick had worked as the novel was a bestseller, Wallace discovered that instead of his woefully over- optimistic three months, FJM would have to continue selling consistently with no margin of error for two full years to recoup the ¬£2,500 he had mistakenly believed he needed to break even. Unfortunately during this period the number of entrants correctly guessing the right answer continued to rise inexorably. Wallace's response was to simply ignore the situation, but circumstances were ominous. As 1906 began and continued without any list of prize winners being printed, more and more suspicions were being voiced about the honesty of the competition. In addition, for a working-class Edwardian family, ¬£250 was a fortune and since those who were winners knew it (courtesy of the published solution) they had been waiting impatiently for the prize to be paid out. Harmsworth, having refused the initial ¬£1,000 loan, was furious at having now to loan over ¬£5,000 to protect the newspaper's reputation because Wallace couldn't pay. Wallace went bankrupt and hastily sold the rights to the novel for ¬£75 to Sir George Newnes to provide token amounts to his creditors. In 1910 the murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen was reading a copy of the novel during his journey on the SS Montrose prior to his arrest. Wallace covered his subsequent trial and execution for the Evening Times.Clark p.126-27 Sequels The Four Just Men is best known as a stand-alone novel, but Wallace wrote five sequels: * The Council of Justice (1908) * The Just Men of Cordova (1918) * The Law of the Four Just Men (1921) * The Three Just Men (1924) * Again the Three (1928) In 2012 Wordsworth Editions published The Complete Four Just Men, a volume compiling all six books. () Characters The four Just Men of the original novel are George Manfred, Leon Gonsalez, and Raymond Poiccart, who recruit a fourth, Thery, in their campaign to punish wrong-doers who are beyond the reach of the law. In later books, Wallace develops their backstory. The original fourth man, Merel, had died in Bordeaux, and the remaining three either recruit a fourth ad hoc or operates as a team of three. After The Great War, they are pardoned on condition that they remain within the law, and Poiccart retires to Spain. Gonsalez and Manfred continue to operate a legitimate detective agency. Adaptations The Four Just Men was adapted as a silent film in 1921, a film in 1939 and as a British television series in 1959. References * * Bibliography * Clark, Neil.

According to official 2019 data, they numbered 197,373, making them the tenth-largest emigrant community in Spain and the second- largest among Central and Eastern European emigrant communities. History The bulk of Bulgarians in Spain consists of recent economic immigrants. Until recent years, Bulgarian emigration to Spain was scarce and unorganized. According to historian Ivan Dimitrov, an unknown number of Bulgarians fled to Spain after the Ottoman conquest of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the late 14th or early 15th century. Dimitrov claims that around 300 families in Spain retain memories of their Bulgarian origin from that period. Among Bulgarians are Banat Bulgarians from Romania, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians who became adjusted to Spanish society because of the linguistic similarities between Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Spanish, as well as Latin identity of Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, and Banat Bulgarians are predominantly Roman Catholic. With the upsurge of Bulgarian economy in the 18th and 19th centuries, individual Bulgarian merchants reached the markets of Spain, though a colony was never formed even after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878. Only after World War I did Bulgarian gardeners reach Spain and Catalonia specifically. According to a 1930 statistic, 88 Bulgarian gardeners worked in Spain. However, the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì39 and World War II that followed hindered the formation of a gardening colony. After World War II, a small number of Bulgarian political emigrants fleeing the communist regime settled in Spain. Among those emigrants was a large part of the Bulgarian royal family, including the deposed child monarch Tsar Simeon II of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha, who was granted asylum by Francisco Franco in 1951. Simeon II lived in Spain for 50 years, until his return to Bulgaria in 2001. Around 1998, the number of Bulgarians in Spain was only around 3,000. By 2002, around 10,000 people had been officially registered as legal Bulgarian emigrants, though the number of illegal immigrants was thought to be much larger. In the early 21st century, substantial Bulgarian communities were formed in Madrid, Barcelona, M√°laga, San Sebasti√°n, Valladolid, Palma de Mallorca and other cities.

Preparations By mid August 1549, Humphrey Arundell, the leader of the rebel troops, regrouped his forces at Sampford Courtenay, Devon, when he received a promise that 1,000 men from Winchester would join his force. This would be the site of the fifth and final battle of the Prayer Book Rebellion. Unknown to Arundell, there was an informer in his camp ‚Äì his own secretary John Kessell, who had been supplying intelligence of Arundell‚Äôs movements and plans to President of the Council of the West, John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, from the start. Russell was under the impression that the rebels from Devon and Cornwall had been defeated already and the news interrupted his plans to send 1,000 men into the South West by ship to cut off his enemy‚Äôs retreat. His own forces had been further strengthened by the arrival of a force under Provost Marshal Sir Anthony Kingston. He now had an army of more than 8,000, vastly outnumbering what remained of his opposition. Russell moved his forces out on 16 August, camping overnight at Crediton. On the next morning, scouts from both sides bumped into each other, resulting in a skirmish and the capture of a Cornish captain named Maunder. With the 1,000 men from Winchester failing to materialise, the main force of the rebel army had dug in on high ground just outside Sampford Courtenay, while a detachment led by Humphrey Arundell waited in the village itself. They knew that this was to be their last stand and the rebels were on their own against Russell‚Äôs army, which outnumbered them greatly. Events of the battle and its aftermath Lord Russell opted for a three-pronged approach. Heavy divisions led by Lord Grey and Sir William Herbert stormed the rebel encampment, while Russell himself would follow behind. This was not as simple as Russell had envisaged: the rebel camp being more strongly manned than he had thought. A vicious gun battle, lasting roughly an hour, gave time for Russell‚Äôs two other divisions to make their move. One consisted of the Italian arquebusiers under Spinola, the other being the German Landsknechte. With almost the entire government force ranged against them, the rebels withdrew into the village where they came under heavy bombardment. Once again, the battle might have been won for the Cornish and West Devonians had they possessed any cavalry. Contemporary Exeter historian John Hooker wrote that the rebel army would not surrender until most of their number had been slain or captured. Lord John Russell was quoted that his army had killed between five and six hundred enemy and his pursuit of the rebel retreat killed a further seven hundred.Philip Payton. (1996). Cornwall. Fowey: Alexander Associates The Devon men made a vain attempt to find safety in Somerset but, one by one, they were caught and mostly hanged, drawn and quartered by troops led by Sir Peter Carew and Sir Hugh Paulet. The Cornishmen headed for home but tried one final time to stand against Russell at Okehampton. Russell planned another attack but in the morning, he received news from the informer, Kessell, that the Cornish forces had been decimated and that the remaining Cornishmen were now back across the River Tamar.

Most of the ditch has been lost to agriculture over time, but its line its marked throughout by both hedgerow and the route of the Harcomlow Way and Icknield Way paths. It would have consisted of an earth bank and ditch running for approximately 5 km (~3 miles) north-west from higher land at Heydon through what is now the golf course at Heydon Grange, crossing the A505 road and to Black Peak at the southernmost tip of Fowlmere RSPB reserve. At this northern terminus of the ditch is an iron-age enclosure. This whole length of the ditch, and the enclosure, is classified as a scheduled ancient monument. Beginning on the fringes of Heydon Village, the ditch's course quickly descends from the higher ground (120m) to the flatter agricultural landscape below (55m). On the hill the earthworks are lightly wooded and it is at this higher point at which the dyke's course and workings are best viewed. Its line to the north can be seen through gaps in the trees in the fields below and what remains of its banks are best preserved there. For a short distance the workings are several metres high as the footpath descends the hill through the ditch and onto the flatter ground below. Down here only a slightly raised straight path and a hedgerow line are clues to former glories.  History  Using data from the other dykes, archaeological Carbon-14 dating suggests that work on the dyke(s) made during the 6th and 7th centuries. It would have been used as a defensive structure as well as a means controlling trade along Roman roads that cross the dyke, including the Icknield Way. Like the other works to the East, it fell from use within a few hundred years of concept. At a much latter date it is assumed that much of its length would have been flattened as part of agriculture reforms. The dyke is one of the shorter of several earthworks in south Cambridgeshire designed to control movement along the ancient Roman roads. The others are Devil's Dyke, Fleam Dyke and Brent Ditch. Black Ditches, Cavenham is a fifth earthwork guarding the ancient Icknield Way and can be found in Suffolk just north west of Bury St Edmunds. Much of the substance of Bran Ditch has been lost over time and it is the least preserved and least impressive of the five structures.  Heritage  The ditch offers shelter to wildlife, in what otherwise would be an open and agricultural landscape. It is best accessed from the south at Heydon (OS map reference TL431405).

Located in District III, it is a popular recreational area, year round. It is the home of the international Sziget Festival every August.  Location and geography Haj√≥gy√°ri was created from the debris carried by the Danube River. It was originally a reef island made up of two adjoining land masses. The coast of √ìbuda lies between the 1651 kilometer and 1654 kilometer river markers. It has an area of 108 hectares, a length of 2750 meters, and a maximum width of 500 meters, which is directly in line with the 1653 kilometer river marker. Obuda Island is separated by a 70- to 80-meter wide branch of the Danube. Not far from the northern end of the √öjpest railway bridge, the southern end of the √Årp√°d Bridge connects Buda and Pest.  History Early period= Originally known as Aquincum, by AD 89 it was home to a Roman legion of 6,000 men. A city grew around their fortress and became the capital of Pannonia Inferior in 106. By the end of the 2nd century, the population had reached 40,000. After 409, the Romans abandoned the area. A thousand years later, in the time of King Matthias Corvinus, it was a wooded hunting preserve, although many Romans ruins remained (and can still be seen there). In the 17th century, ownership passed to the Zichy family. =19th century= thumb Its importance grew again in the 19th century, when Count Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi established the √ìbuda Shipyard. The first ship made there was launched in 1836 and was called the √Årp√°d-steamboat. It became the first industrial scale steamship building company in the Habsburg Empire.Victor-L. Tapie: The Rise and Fall of the Hubsburg Monarchy PAGE: 267 Roman perimeter walls were first found in 1836 when the Otter Bay dredge deepened the shipyard. Twenty-eight hectares (69 acres) of the island's area was occupied by the shipyard. The remainder of the island was converted to agricultural use. For a long time, access to the island was by ferry only. A pedestrian bridge was later constructed, and the first permanent bridge was built in 1858. =20th century= Around the 1900s Haj√≥gy√°ri was called the \\"Big Island\\". It got the nickname Shipyard Island because it was once the southern end of the √ìbuda Shipyard. Industrial activity in these buildings ended and moved to different companies. The island's port is operated by the Yacht Club of Hungary. The former shipyard area was found at Hadrian's Aquincum of the Roman governor's palace, which was uncovered and presented to wait. Carrot farms were still there as late as 1960. In 1967, the current reinforced concrete bridge was built. In 1973, for the centennial of the √ìbuda-Pest-Buda union, \\"May the 9th Park\\" was created, requiring the use of of soil. The park contained many playgrounds, which were burned down in 1999 and replaced in 2004. The six tennis yards are currently in a state of disrepair.  Present  The island hosts the annual Sziget Festival which has helped the island to achieve international fame.Budapest-city-guide.com Hajogyari Island After the fall of the Communist government, there were no longer any organized camps for musicians to meet up and play, hence a music festival was proposed as a way to bridge this gap.

Future  Recently, construction of a massive Ft 400 billion (‚Ç¨1.5 billion) hotel and recreation complex on the island has begun. To be developed by an international consortium by 2012, the complex will be the largest of its kind in Europe. The new complex will feature a conference center capable of hosting 3,500 people; three five-star hotels and four apartment hotels; a spacious, American-style casino offering many different kinds of games; and an entertainment complex, including a swimming pool. The total built-in area of the complex will be 32,000 m2, which is 10% of the total area of the island.

Featuring IBM and Amdahl mainframes, disk and network processors, alongside StorageTek tape devices, CSG was the largest, followed by Datacrown, whose owner at the time was Crown Life Insurance, and IP Sharp (eventually acquired by Reuters, now Thomson Media). Canada Systems Group (EST) Limited was a data processing service bureau based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Key dates * October 1970 - CSG created by Eatons, Stelco & London Life with office in TD Tower Floor 37, Toronto * Spring 1971 - Office moved to Sheridan Mall, Mississauga * September 1971 Labour Day - Office moved to 2599 Speakman Drive, Mississauga, Ontario. * Mid November 1971 - Stelco production started at Speakman * Late January 1972 - Eatons production started at Speakman History CSG was originally created by the divestiture of the data processing departments of Eaton's, (Canada's largest department store chain), Stelco (Canada's largest steel producer), and TRW. The latter company dropped out of the triumvirate shortly after CSG was formed, to be replaced by Royal Trust, Canada's largest Trust company. CSG's head office and main datacentre was located in the Sheridan Park Research Community in Mississauga Ontario. CSG maintained smaller datacentres in Ottawa, Ontario and Calgary, Alberta. Sales offices were maintained in Vancouver (BC) Calgary (AB), Edmonton (AB), Winnipeg (MA), Toronto (ON), Montreal (PQ), Saint John (NB) and Washington, DC (USA). Early in its history, CSG acquired Multiple Financial Services, a financial service bureau, at time the largest in Canada, which provided outsourcing of the processing and accounting functions for the brokerage and mutual funds industries. The Mississauga datacentre was one of the largest in North America, consisting of two raised floorspaces of each. The second floor housed the multiple mainframe processors and hundreds of disk units. The first floor housed the network processors, switches, and utilized the first fibre-optic cables available in Canada. In addition, over 200 tape drives, a tape library of over one hundred and thirty thousand serial tape volumes on moveable shelves before disk-packs began to overtake tape data storage and the main console areas (the 'Dais') were on the first floor. To achieve the required efficiencies, CSG developed its own Pre-Scan software for the IBM MVS Operating System. This software facilitated tape drives being pre- allocated and tape files pre-mounted by tape operators as a job was read into the job scheduler. Two Job Execution Schedulers were available from IBM; JES2 which read in the job, created a job address space in memory, and then waited for the requested job resources (tape drive, tape file mounted on drive, ready to read/write) were physically available before starting job execution; and JES3, where the job would be read in by the system, then wait until the requested job resources were physically available and allocated before creating a job address space in memory to begin execution. CSG's Pre-Scan would read in the job control language statements, parse the necessary resources required to execute the job, then dynamically allocate the physical devices, request the tape mounts, all while the system created the job address space in memory. The net result was significantly faster and more efficient throughput by eliminating / minimizing wait times. CSG then built on this foundation by being one of the first to use StorageTek's Tape Accelerator devices, which buffered tape read and write operations to disc, which in turn improved job throughput even more. To control such a behemoth, where typically over 160 copies of CICS, IMS and DB2 were executing at any given moment, alongside timeshare and batch processing, required a staff of network and mainframe operators with specialized knowledge, and over two hundred operator consoles. Console automation was brand new technology at the time (late 1970s) and CSG became an industry leader in this specialty by controlling automatically approximately 95% of the console traffic and operator interventions, using IBM's NetView for network consoles and Candle Software's AF/Operator for system consoles. Gartner Group recognized this achievement, and papers were presented at two annual major IBM Technical conferences, known as SHARE and GUIDE on the automation efforts and achievements. CSG was an innovator in many ways, providing the compute power and technical expertise to develop an election results prediction system for Canadian TV networks; a computerized taxi dispatching system with remote terminals installed in the vehicles, first installed in BlueLine Taxis in Ottawa, Ontario, and also the dispatch system for Pizza Pizza, which optimized phone ordering, product production and delivery, which resulted in exponential growth for Pizza Pizza, and enhanced customer satisfaction. CSG was acquired Singer Business Machines in the 1980s, and renamed STM Systems Corporation. It was then sold to IBM (minority ownership) and renamed Information Systems Management Corporation. IBM completed the takeover in the early 1990s, and it is now a division of IBM Canada, that provides outsourcing solutions to many companies in the private and public sector.

Noadswood School is an academy school and specialist Sports College in Dibden Purlieu, Hampshire, England. It provides state funded education for children from ages 11 to 16. Background Noadswood School serves Dibden Purlieu and Hythe on the Southampton Waterside. In 2006 the school became a specialist Sports College and this led to the development of sports facilities and opportunities for all students. This included the recruitment of further PE teachers. The school has an on-site gymnasium, sports hall, all-weather pitch and playing courts. In 2010, 81% of Noadswood's Year 11 students attained at least five GCSEs at A*-C grade. 67% attained at least five A*-C grades including English and Maths. These results place the school in the top 25% nationally. Noadswood has a non-selective exam entry policy. Ofsted (2009) graded Noadswood School as \\"good with outstanding features\\".The school's provision of care, guidance and support was rated as being 'excellent'. In 2013, the school was graded as \\"good with outstanding features\\". In 2008, the school replaced the traditional Year Head role with Progress Managers and specialist, non-teaching Guidance Managers. This provides a very personal approach to learning with students benefiting from close support with their academic progress and personal development. In June 2009, the school switched to a system of vertical tutoring, and a new curriculum was introduced in September 2009. Noadswood School is one of 15 schools in England, to be selected as a partner school in the Innovation Unit/Paul Hamlyn Foundation Learning Futures programme. The school's Science Department is at the centre of the school's involvement in the Films for Learning initiative. Under the new system of vertical tutoring each child is placed in one of four houses - Anderwood, Knightwood, Deerleap or Wilverley - and assigned to a tutor group of between 20 and 25 students. Each student Year 8 or above is placed in a vertical tutor group that contains several students from each year group. Year 7 pupils are split into two tutor groups per house for the majority of their first year, and are later eased in to the vertical tutoring system. Noadswood School has a Learning Support Department for students with Special Educational Needs. The school is one of four in Hampshire equipped to support the learning of physically disabled children and there are on-site physiotherapy and occupational therapy facilities. In addition to the Learning Support Department, Noadswood has a Pupil Support Centre staffed by the team of Guidance Managers. Several residential trips are organized at the school, including excursions to Bude, Cologne, Paris and to Ypres & the Somme. The school sponsors children in Zimbabwe and a secondary school in the Limpopo. The school has run trips to Sefoloko High School in South Africa every other year since 2009. The pupils that are selected for the trip fundraise the money themselves. The next trip date has yet to be confirmed.

When it opened in 1949, the main purpose of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana was to promote the work of Mexican artists, creating a larger and more active market for Mexican art with emphasis on contemporary works.dead link The works are often offered at discount prices and include drawings, engravings and watercolors as well as oils. The idea is to promote art to the general public as well as to large collectors. Among its initial objectives was to sell artists‚Äô work without charging a commission. However, today the mission of the institution is to promote the work of its members without being involved in actual sales. It is a dependency of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes but operates autonomously. It has control of two locations, its original building in the historic center of Mexico City on Donceles Street and a former mansion in Colonia Roma on Colima Street which it operates out of. The Sal√≥n has been an important source of works for institutions such as the Museo de Arte Moderno has its own important collection of contemporary art which increases each year.

All of the members are well-established artists who are selected based on application which consists of samples of their work and curricula. The general coordinator is Cecilia Santacruz. The Sal√≥n has maintained a list from its beginning of the best Mexican artists which include Ignacio Aguirre, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Ra√∫l Anguiano, Luis Arenal, Dr. Atl, Abelardo √Åvila, Angelina Beloff, Alberto Beltr√°n, √Ångel Bracho, Celia Calder√≥n, Federico Cant√∫, Fernando Castro Pacheco, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Erasto Cort√©s Ju√°rez, Olga Costa, Dolores Cueto, Germ√°n Cueto, Gonzalo de la Paz P√©rez, Francisco Dosamantes, Jes√∫s Escobedo, Arturo Garc√≠a Bustos, Jorge Gonz√°lez Camarena, Jes√∫s Guerrero Calvan, Xavier Guerrero, Frida Kahlo, Agust√≠n Lazo, Amador Lugo, Leopoldo M√©ndez, Carlos M√©rida, Gustavo Montoya, Tosia Malamud, Francisco Mora, Nicol√°s Moreno, Nefero, Luis Nishizawa, Juan O'Gorman, Pablo O'Higgins, Carlos Orozco Romero, Luis Ortiz Monasterio, Feliciano Pe√±a, Fanny Rabel, Everardo Ram√≠rez, Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira, Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano, Diego Rivera, Antonio Ruiz, Juan Soriano, Rufino Tamayo, Cordelia Urueta, H√©ctor Xavier, Desiderio Hern√°ndez Xochitiotzin and Alfredo Zalce. The Sal√≥n has multiple exhibitions during the year, often in collaboration with other institutions such as the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana and the Secretar√≠a de Gobernaci√≥n. It has also sponsored exhibitions outside of its Colonia Roma site such as ‚ÄúUniverso Gr√°fico‚Äù at the Universidad Americana de Acapulco. Most exhibitions are dedicated to a particular artist but there are themed exhibits as well. These have included one dedicated to the historic center of Mexico City, the 16th century Tembleque aqueduct or Arcos de Zempoala in Otumba and a 2009 exhibition dedicated to Mexico‚Äôs Day of the Dead . It participates in the annual ‚ÄúCorredor Cultural Roma-Condesa‚Äù an event to promote the cultural and gastronomic offerings of Colonia Roma and Colonia Condesa area.  History  View of the Origen de un Acervo exhibition, a group of works by members of the Sal√≥n in order to support workers of the Pascual Boing enterprise It was founded in 1949, with the aim of exhibiting works representative of Mexican fine arts. It was the result of government efforts to promote Mexican fine arts with fifty two founding members. Of these Fernando Castro Pacheco, Arturo Garc√≠a Bustos, Rina Lazo and Luis Nishizawa remain active with the organization. Over its history, it has exhibited works by hundreds of painters, sculptures, engravers, sketch artists, ceramists and photographers from many different movements and generations. It has had exhibitions by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Gerardo Murillo ‚ÄúDr Atl‚Äù, Frida Kahlo, Rufino Tamayo, Jorge Gonz√°lez Camarena, Leopoldo M√©ndez, Carlos M√©rida, Pablo O¬¥Higgins, Francisco Moreno Capdevila, Juan O¬¥Gorman, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Adolfo Mexiac, Alfredo Zalce, Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo and H√©ctor Garc√≠a y Francisco Z√∫√±iga. The Sal√≥n was located physically outside the Palacio de Bellas Artes, at first at the former Mont-Orend√°in Gallery in the historic center of Mexico City, with extended hours, open until 10 p.m., everyday but Monday.(historia) Catalogs of the Sal√≥n were often done by its first director but a number were also designed by artists such as Justino Fern√°ndez, Dr. Atl, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Leopoldo M√©ndez and some with text by Octavio Paz . Its first director was Susana Gamboa and its first exhibition was of paintings by Feliciano Pe√±a, one of the first artists to break from the Mexican muralist school of painting. This was shortly followed by exhibitions of works by Celia Calder√≥n and Fernando Castro Pacheco. Its original rules were strict with the aim of quality control, with pieces submitted judged by a panel with included the head of the Departamento de Artes Pl√°sticas, the directors of the Escuela de Pintura y Escultura and the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas the president of the Asociaci√≥n de Cr√≠ticos e Investigadores de las Artes Pl√°sticas and the director of the Sal√≥n itself.(historia) In its first three years, sales surpassed a half a million pesos, with the main beneficiaries being Rufino Tamayo, Luis Nishizawa, Guillermo Meza, Carlos Orozco Romero, Ra√∫l Anguiano, Ignacio Beteta, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado, Juan Soriano, Juan O'Gorman, Olga Costa, Federico Cant√∫, Gustavo Montoya and Fanny Rabel. Two notable painter who did not have success here were Alberto Beltr√°n and Leopoldo M√©ndez. Some of the first works to be collected by the Sal√≥n include El abrazo de Amor by Frida Kahlo, El pescador by Alfredo Zalce, El pintor by Agust√≠n Lazo and La ni√±a con vestido a cuadros by Gustavo Montoya. In the 1970s, there were rivalries, new generations of artists challenging the old and a competitive art market, which forced the institution to reorganize. It also opened a second site in Colonia Roma. In 2009, for its 60th anniversary, the Sal√≥n reorganized again, as Cecilia Santacruz indicated that it had ceased to be the main indicator of the Mexican art scene and needed to be made over. She also added that it was not longer as open to new artists and markets as it used to be, rather a forum for promotion and publicity. The reorganization included the integration of new technologies for promotion and the unification of catalog design.

Reliable methods of predicting the crystal structure of a compound, based only on its composition, has been a goal of the physical sciences since the 1950s. Computational methods employed include simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, distributed multipole analysis, random sampling, basin-hopping, data mining, density functional theory and molecular mechanics. History The crystal structures of simple ionic solids have long been rationalised in terms of Pauling's rules, first set out in 1929 by Linus Pauling. For metals and semiconductors one has different rules involving valence electron concentration. However, prediction and rationalization are rather different things. Most commonly, the term crystal structure prediction means a search for the minimum-energy arrangement of its constituent atoms (or, for molecular crystals, of its molecules) in space. The problem has two facets: combinatorics (the \\"search phase space\\", in practice most acute for inorganic crystals), and energetics (or \\"stability ranking\\", most acute for molecular organic crystals). For complex non- molecular crystals (where the \\"search problem\\" is most acute), major recent advances have been the development of the Martonak version of metadynamics, the Oganov-Glass evolutionary algorithm USPEX, and first principles random search. The latter are capable of solving the global optimization problem with up to around a hundred degrees of freedom, while the approach of metadynamics is to reduce all structural variables to a handful of \\"slow\\" collective variables (which often works). Molecular crystals Predicting organic crystal structures is important in academic and industrial science, particularly for pharmaceuticals and pigments, where understanding polymorphism is beneficial. The crystal structures of molecular substances, particularly organic compounds, are very hard to predict and rank in order of stability. Intermolecular interactions are relatively weak and non-directional and long range. This results in typical lattice and free energy differences between polymorphs that are often only a few kJ/mol, very rarely exceeding 10 kJ/mol. Crystal structure prediction methods often locate many possible structures within this small energy range. These small energy differences are challenging to predict reliably without excessive computational effort. Since 2007, significant progress has been made in the CSP of small organic molecules, with several different methods proving effective. The most widely discussed method first ranks the energies of all possible crystal structures using a customised MM force field, and finishes by using a dispersion- corrected DFT step to estimate the lattice energy and stability of each short- listed candidate structure. More recent efforts to predict crystal structures have focused on estimating crystal free energy by including the effects of temperature and entropy in organic crystals using vibrational analysis or molecular dynamics.

He was a recipient of the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan. Birth and education Pammal Sambandha Mudaliar was born in Pammal, Madras to Vedharangam Mudaliar and Rukmani Ammal in 1873. He was educated at Pachaiyappa's College. Theatre Influenced by his father, who had a large library and instilled in his son a love of books, and by his mother's telling of folktales and Indian epics, Mudaliar developed an interest in drama as a child. His father also encouraged him to see theatrical productions at a time when the theatre was considered to be a disreputable environment. Influenced in particular by his childhood reading of works written by William Shakespeare, Mudaliar wrote his own plays from an early age. He staged these at his home, along with his brother and sister, for audiences comprising family and neighbours. According to a theatre review written by Kausalya Santhanam, Mudaliar founded the theatre company known as Suguna Vilasa Sabha to \\"revive and reform Tamil drama.\\" S. Muthiah considers him to have been a co-founder, along with six other people. The company was established in July 1891 when Mudaliar was a 19-year-old student. It was inspired by his witnessing of the excitement caused when Sarasa Vinodini Sabha, an amateur theatre company headed by a lawyer, Bellary Krishnamacharlu, visited Madras to perform several Telugu productions in that year. The first of his plays to be staged by the company was the unsuccessful Pushpavalli, in 1893 at the Victoria Public Hall in Madras. The lack of success did not deter him and nor did his full-time work as a lawyer and, later, as a judge: Mudaliar maintained his involvement in drama thereafter, as a writer, director, producer and actor. His initial effort was followed by Sarangadhara and before long his productions were being watched throughout the Madras Presidency. According to Santhanam and also Scharada Bail, he wrote 96 plays, while S. Muthiar puts the figure at \\"over 100\\". In later life, and following the successful introduction of talkies to Tamil cinema in 1931, Mudaliar's output was also adapted for film. Among those are Sati Sulochana, Vedala Ulagam, Ratnavali, Manohara and Sabapathi. Manohara had originally been published by Mudaliar as an adaptation of Hamlet. Entitled Amaladhithan, it was not well received because it followed too closely the values of Western theatre; its rewriting as Manohara, which reflected more closely the values of Indian society, changed its fortunes. The original adaptation of Hamlet, published as Amaladhithan in 1906, took Mudaliar six years to complete and he studied many references in an attempt to do justice to the original Shakespeare work. It was one of five Shakespearean adaptations that he translated, directed and then acted. Not all of Mudaliar's works were performed by the Suguna Vilasa Sabha, with one of the exceptions being his only work in the burlesque style, 1923's Chandrahari. It was his involvement with the company, which developed Tamil theatre as a respectable art form, that gave rise to the epithet of him being the founding father of Tamil theatre. Professional people such as lawyers and teachers took an interest in the company, including as actors, and thus he caused a shift whereby the old derogatory term for actors \\\\- Koothadi - was replaced by that of Kalaignan. He also changed the structure of dramatisations by emphasising the function of acts and scenes and also placing more stress on dialogue rather than song. Works of playwright Mudaliar's work included adaptations of English and Sanskrit plays, as well as original output. These received with much enthusiasm. Educated people turned their attention to the potential of theatre. Some even joined the Sabha and began acting. It became a centre of great moral and educational value. Songs were given a back seat, prose gained significance, and realistic acting was stressed. Mudaliar changed stage conventions, creating new sets and scenery that surprised viewers. T. P. Krishnaswamy Pavalar, hailed as a great teacher of Tamil drama, was a product of the Sabha. After retiring as a judge, Mudaliar continued acting for it. He acted the lead in many of his own plays. Subsequently, other sabhas or groups produced their own versions. His Lilavati-Sulochana in 1895, Manoham which was published in 1907, Makapati i.e. Shakespeare's Macbeth, published in 1910, and Sabhapati that published in 1918 were the first Tamil plays in prose dialogue while others still performed Puranic musicals. He gave equal importance to narrative and aesthetics in drama. He composed scripts that could be performed within three hours, a revolutionary concept when Tamil productions normally took twice that time. Quite a few were cinematised later, such as Yayati in 1908, Ratnavali was adapted from Harsha in 1910, and the originals mentioned above. Death Pammal Vijayaranga Sambandha Mudaliar died in 1964. Aside from his theatrical works, Mudaliar left a record of his own life that, according to theatre historian Kathryn Hansen, is a \\"treasure house of information on late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Tamil theatre\\". These memoirs were originally published weekly in serial form by the nationalist-oriented Tamil newspaper, Swadesamitran, and have since been translated into English, in which form they comprise six volumes and are entitled Over 40 Years Before The Footlights. Their original title, when published in book form in 1938, was Natakametai Ninaivukal (Reminiscences of the Stage). He also wrote a short autobiography concerning his legal career, published in 1963 as En Chuyacharitai (My Autobiography).

In addition to cinema advertising sales and media management, the company provides production services, high definition digital network installation and management, digital entertainment preshow production, alternative content services and other associated products and services.  Structure  Screenvision was a joint venture between ITV plc (LSE: ITV), a UK-based free to air commercial television broadcaster and Technicolor SA, a provider of technology, services, systems and equipment to the media and entertainment industries.  History  On 28 September 2010, ITV plc sold their stake to Shamrock Capital Growth Fund II, in a deal worth a reported $80m. Later on, Carmike Cinemas acquired 20% of Screenvision; today, that 20% stake is owned by AMC Entertainment. AMC's acquisition of Carmike Cinemas resulted in the transfer of 384 AMC Theatre screens into the Screenvision Media exhibitor network. In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with National CineMedia (NCM) for US$375 million. The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters. In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.

This period was characterized by political instability brought about by increased partisanship within Parliament and frequent elections. Eleven Parliaments met in this period, partly as a result of the Triennial Act, which meant a general election had to be held every three years. In fact, on average an election was held every two and a half years.The Rage of Parliaments: The House of Commons, 1690 ‚Äì1715, The Historical Journal, 48, 2 (2005), pp. 567‚Äì587, http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid;=307221&jid;=HIS&volumeId;=48&issueId;=02&aid;=307220 The period ended with the Hanoverian succession and the passage of the Septennial Act 1716 allowing up to seven years between elections. Political Divisions There were two main axes of political conflict during this period. The Whigs, who supported the Glorious Revolution and the Protestant succession, opposed the Tories, who, although supporting the new monarchs in a de facto sense, were disturbed by the disruption to the divine succession which the Glorious Revolution entailed. Outside of this division was the Court/Country axis. Court politicians were either in government or sought to be, and were thus supportive of centralized power and the dominance of Parliament by the executive. Country politicians distrusted centralized power and were keen to secure the independence of Parliament.Frank O'Gorman, The Long Eighteenth Century, British Political and Social History, 1689‚Äì1832, (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2016) pp. 42‚Äì44.

He is the last original member of Rough Silk, which he founded in 1989. He has also performed with Helloween and Holy Moses. Since 1997, he has been the keyboardist for Axel Rudi Pell's band. From 2006 to 2009, he played the keyboards for Eden's Curse, which was founded by Michael Eden (Lead Vocals) and Paul Logue (Bassist). Family The English/German slide guitar/keyboards-player and singer/songwriter Ferdy Doernberg was born in 1967 as the son of the British composer and violin-player Martin Doernberg and the German teacher and writer Dr. Gesine Doernberg. When he was three years old, his parents moved to Barsinghausen, Germany, but he spends some time in England, too. When he was six years old, he started with piano lessons. At the age of 12, he also started playing guitar and trumpet. First recordings After playing in several school and local bands, he became the lead guitar player of the locally successful punk band \\"The Wabbles\\", with whom he played his first over-regional gigs and did his first recordings for a vinyl single. He also played trumpet and piano in a local jazz ensemble for years. His first professional band, Rough Silk, was founded in 1989. Through the years, Ferdy found his own style of playing. As a keyboard player, his favourite instrument is the Hammond organ, the piano and vintage keyboards like the Wurlitzer- piano, accordion and the monophonic Moog synthesizer. As a guitar player, Doernberg fell in love with the slide guitar and all her relatives like lap and pedal steel, dobro and the Hawaiian guitar. Rough Silk have recorded 8 albums (the last one, A new beginning, was released in April 2009), and toured a lot (as headliner and supporting for example Helloween, Deep Purple, Savatage, Saxon, Accept, Whitesnake and Dio) all over Europe. Since 2007, Doernberg is also the lead-vocalist of the band. Doernberg also works a lot as a studio musician (keyboards and slide guitars) and has played on more than 100 albums by Roland Grapow (Helloween), Destruction, Freedom Call, Metalium, Tom Angelripper (Sodom), Howard Carpendale, Crimson Glory, John Wesley Harding, Chris Caffrey (Savatage), Powergod, Sweet, Jane, Seven Witches, Sargant Fury, Masterplan, The Traceelords and many others. Axel Rudi Pell Band Besides Rough Silk, he is also a member of the Axel Rudi Pell band (he did 12 albums, 3 DVDs and several tours with him so far). Ferdy has shared the stage with many different musicians like John Wesley Harding, Jason Ringenberg (Jason & The Scorchers), ex-Scorpions musicians Uli Jon Roth and Francis Buchholz, Julian Dawson, Joseph Parsons, Jeff Kollman (U.F.O., Glenn Hughes), Warren De Martini (Ratt), Robbie Krieger (The Doors), Roy Z., Tony Franklin (Whitesnake, Blue Murder), David Paich (Toto), Jeff Scott Soto, Don Dokken, Chris Poland (Megadeth), Therion, Snowy Shaw, (Merciful Fate, Notre Dame), Messiah Marcolin (Candlemass), Gamma Ray, the award-winning country act Autumn Leaves, Freedom Call, Jon Oliva (Savatage), Al Pitrelli (Alice Cooper, Megadeth, Savatage), Emma Bunton (Spice Girls), Olivia Newton-John (TV-show \\"Wetten Dass...\\"), the legendary drummer Max Weinberg of Bruce Springsteen's \\"E-street-band\\" (Frankfurt-music-fair), Axxis, Ana Popovic and many others. He has toured in Europe, South-America and the US so far. Doernberg had the honor of being asked by the legendary German thrash metal band Destruction to add a slide guitar solo to their all-star song \\"The Alliance Of Hellhoundz\\". Other artists appearing on this song are Biff Byfford (Saxon), Doro Pesch, Paul Di Anno (ex-Iron Maiden) and Messiah Margolin (Candlemass). He also appears in the video to this song. Ferdy Doernberg also runs a recording studio, the \\"Droehnwerk\\", at Bad Nenndorf, nearby Hanover/ Germany, where he lives. Since 1998, he has produced and engineered albums (or tracks) by Rough Silk, John Wesley Harding, Destruction, Mike Terrana, Taraxacum, Brainstorm, It's M.E., Heavenly, A.O.D., Freedom Call, Masterplan and many more in his studio. Solo work So far, Ferdy Doernberg has released five solo-albums as a singer/songwriter. The first one, Just a piano and a handful of dreams, was released in 1995 on SPV-Records. The second one, Storyteller..s Rain - a rock musical was released in 2000 on Massacre-records / Sony. The lyrical concept presented 12 ghost stories with philosophical and ironic undertones, told by the main character called \\"the Storyteller\\". The music follows the \\"ups and downs\\" of the stories through progressive rock, classic, jazz, heavy metal, folk, country and bombast rock elements. Many unusual acoustic instruments like dobro, violin, sitar, didgeridoo, trumpet, trombone or zither can be heard on the album. Mike Terrana (Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony MacAlpine, Steve Lukather), Axel Rudipell, Roland Grapow, Uli Kusch And Michael Weikath (Helloween), Tom Angelripper (Sodom), Tobias Exxel (Edguy) and all the members of Rough Silk participated on the album. To promote \\"Storyteller..s Rain\\" Doernberg played many shows as a solo artist. Besides solo performances - the largest was on the Wacken-open-air 2000, where Doernberg performed solo just with a Dobro, a lap steel and a piano, between all the louder heavy-metal acts - he also did a tour through Germany supporting John Wesley Harding in 2002. After his solo performance, he and Joerg Ohlsen were also Harding's backing- band (aka \\"the Barkins\\"). He also opened for the legendary Thin Lizzy, Jason Ringenberg, Nils Lofgren, Bryan Adams, Jeff Kollman, country singer Rick Monroe (USA) and the German pop-metal band Axxis. With his dark English humor and his intelligent songwriting, Doernberg seems to be able to work with bigger rock-crowds as well as with seated audiences in small folk clubs. In May 2007 Doernberg's third solo album \\"..till I run out of road\\" was released on Rebellion-Records. It is a singer/songwriter album with guest appearances by John Wesley Harding, Jeff Kollman, Mike Terrana, Andre Hort (Rough Silk) and Doernberg's brother Curt (Treibhaus). Doernberg again played countless solo shows to promote the album and reactivated his first band Rough Silk with new members. They released a new album called \\"a new beginning\\" in 2009 and played on several festivals and opened for bands like Sick Of It All, Agent Steel, W.A.S.P. and Demon. Doernberg also continued working as a studio musician and went on tour as a sideman with different artists. He is still a member of the Axel Rudi Pell band. Doernberg's fourth solo album travelling light was released in December 2009 and is again a singer/songwriter album with a lot of slide guitar and piano features. Parts of the album were recorded in New York City and this melting pot of cultures greatly inspired the music on the album. The album before, .....till I run out of road, was more \\"earthy\\" but many songs on travelling light have some kind of \\"big city atmosphere\\". Doernberg also integrated more jazz and soul influences into the music. His third instrument, the trumpet, is also more in the focus than on the previous albums. Johnny Gioeli (Hardline, Axel Rudi Pell) sang a duet on \\"Mutants at the shopping-mall\\" The drums on the album were played by Mike Terrana, Alex Wenn (Rough Silk) and Doernberg¬¥s brother Curt. The bass tracks were performed by Anke Sobek (Nikki Puppet), who also played upright bass, Ecki Huedepohl and Andr√© Hort (Rough Silk). Doernberg played everything else apart from one song \\"integrity\\" where Michael Hankel (Holy Moses) played electric guitar. On the same track, Holy Moses' lead singer, Sabina Classen, did some growling and - this may be a surprise for many of her fans - clean vocals as well! The song \\"May God save us from religion\\" is a duet with Joseph Parsons, who contributed an incredible vocal performance and co-wrote the lyrics to this song. Travelling light is a singer/songwriter album with folk, jazz, rock, soul, pop and even classical and world music influences and intelligent lyrics. Doernberg released his fifth solo album titled a bridge to Dobroland in December 2011.

Early life Goodwin was born and raised in London. She is the daughter of the film producer Richard B. Goodwin and the interior decorator Jocasta Innes. Her parents separated when she was five and then divorced. She is of Irish and Argentinian ancestry. Her half-brother is the writer Jason Goodwin, whom her father adopted. Interviewed by Rachel Ward of The Daily Telegraph in 2019, she said: \\"I grew up surrounded by creative people\\", and she would return home \\"to find Lauren Bacall and Ingrid Bergman sat on the sofa having tea\\". Her great- great-great-grandfather was Irish clergyman Robert Traill, whose character she included in an episode of the second season of her TV drama Victoria which addressed the Irish famine in the 1840s. Traill was played by Martin Compston. Career After attending Queen's College, London and Westminster School, Goodwin studied history at Trinity College, Cambridge. After attending Columbia Film School, as a Harkness Scholar, she joined the BBC in 1985 as a trainee television assistant producer in arts, and a producer-director in 1987, working on programmes like Bookmark. Her contract was not renewed in 1989, but Goodwin rejoined the BBC in 1992, and worked on Omnibus, and created Bookworm, The Nation's Favourite Poems and Home Front. In 1998, Goodwin moved to Talkback Productions as head of factual programmes, becoming editorial director by 2003. In 2005, Goodwin founded Silver River Productions.

She has presented television shows including Essential Poems (To Fall In Love With) (2003) and Reader, I Married Him (2006). Jane Thynne, in The Independent described her as proving to be \\"triumphantly telegenic\\" in the former which was Goodwin's front of camera television debut.

L√©pine joined Riel's provisional government in Red River in 1869. A founding member of the Union Saint- Alexandre, L√©pine sought to bring together M√©tis of French Canadian and Catholic origins. Later, L√©pine represented St. Francois Xavier East in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1874 to 1878.  Early Life  He was born in Saint Boniface, Manitoba, the son of Jean-Baptiste B√©rard, dit L√©pine and Julia Henry. L√©pine married Josephte Lavall√©e and together they had six children, who all grew into adulthood. It is also known that Maxime L√©pine studied with the Christian Brothers in St Boniface . L√©pine lived in St. Francoise Xavier in the 1870s and managed a Red River Cart freighting company which transported goods west to Fort Carlton, Saskatchewan and Ile-a-la-Crosse and south to Pembina and St. Paul, Minnesota.  Provisional Government  Maxime L√©pine along with his brother Ambroise-Dydime, served in the provisional government established in 1869. He served as a councillor in the provisional government created by Riel during the Red Rive Rebellion. The provisional government was established by Louis Riel, along with other M√©tis leaders from the Red River Settlement, in 1869 . The government was established in order to stop the Canadian government from annexing Rupert's Land . At the time, Rupert's Land was under the control of the Hudson's Bay Company and was made up of territory that today is known as the Prairie Provence's . In 1869, the Hudson's Bay Company, the Canadian Government, and the British Government, held negotiations for the transfer of the lands sovereignty, all the while leaving the M√©tis out of the conversation . With over 12,000 residents in the Red River Settlement, the M√©tis people became worried about their status in the new Dominion and decided to fight for their rights . The provisional government was successful in that it was able to negotiate the terms of M√©tis entry into the Dominion, resulting in the Manitoba Act . The Manitoba Act of 1870 created the province of Manitoba, and secured the rights of M√©tis by providing bilingual institutions, denominational schools, and granting 1.4 million acres of land to future M√©tis children .  Later Life  Following the creation of Manitoba as a province, Maxime L√©pine was able to escape the hands Ontario Orangemen and went on to become a founding member of the Union Saint-Alexandre, which was created to bring together M√©tis of French Canadian and Catholic origin. Moreover, Maxime L√©pine represented St Fran√ßois Xavier East in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1874 to 1878 . Maxime joined the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in December 1874, where he served a single term before being defeated in December 1878 . In 1882, he moved to Saskatchewan, settling near St. Louis. Maxime L√©pine fought at the Battle of Fish Creek and surrendered to General Frederick Dobson Middleton after the defeat at Batoche. He was convicted of high treason and sent to Stony Mountain Penitentiary in August 1885, he was released in 1886 having serving about seven months of his seven-year sentence. In 1896, he was given an appointment in the Indian agency at Battleford. L√©pine died in poverty at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan on September 16, 1897.

It is set during the First English Civil War, primarily focusing on the final campaign of 1645-1646 in the West Country and shows the effect of the conflict on two friends, who find themselves on opposite sides.  Plot summary  Apart from 'The Chronicles of Robin Hood,' Sutcliff's three previous novels, The Queen Elizabeth Story, The Armourer's House and Brother Dusty-Feet were aimed at a younger audience and set in the 16th century. 'Simon' shows a significant shift in both tone and subject matter and is generally acknowledged to be the first to feature the mastery of subject and style for which she is now remembered.Historical Novel Society: Rosemary SutcliffMarcus Crouch, Treasure Seekers and Borrowers: Children's books in Britain 1900-1960, The Library Association, 1962, pp 125-126: \\"suddenly, in Simon (1953), the author found her strength in a brilliant realistic picture of life in the civil wars.\\" The story begins in the West Devon town of Torrington, on the eve of the First English Civil War in 1642. The protagonists are Simon Carey, son of a local farmer who supports Parliament and his best friend, Amias Hannaford, son of the Royalist town doctor. The two friends fall out when the war begins; Simon's father goes off to fight for Parliament but orders him to finish school first. Castle Hill, Torrington ca. 1890 - 1900; in the novel, Simon pursues the retreating Royalists down this hill. Amias joins the Royalist forces in April 1644, while Simon helps a regiment of Parliamentary cavalry escape after their defeat at Lostwithiel in September. With the help of an officer he met then, he joins the New Model Army in early 1645 as a Cornet in the regiment of the Army commander, Sir Thomas Fairfax. His corporal is an Ironside trooper called Zeal-for-the-Lord Relf. The story covers the decisive Parliamentary victory at Naseby in June 1645; when Zeal-for-the-Lord deserts to seek revenge on a former friend, he is flogged and dismissed from the army. The rest of the book covers the final campaign in the West Country; Simon takes part in the July 1645 Battle of Langport, then helps capture a house at Okeham Paine held by the Royalists, where he finds himself fighting against Amias. He is badly wounded and then sent home as a scout to gather information on the Royalist army led by Ralph Hopton; here he meets again with both Amias and Zeal-for-the-Lord, who is now with the Royalists and gives him the information he needs. Simon rejoins the army for the Battle of Torrington; this results in a Parliamentary victory but a huge explosion blows up the church, killing over 200 prisoners. Simon helps the injured Amias, who is suspected of causing the explosion and is also arrested for 'harbouring the enemy.' Zeal-for-the-Lord is one of the wounded recovered from the explosion and before he dies, helps clear Amias. Simon is also freed and the story ends four years later in 1649, after the Second English Civil War with the two resuming their friendship. In 'Simon,' Sutcliff addresses a theme that re-appears in many of her works ie that of conflicting personal and societal loyalties and what keeping faith with one can mean for the other. Thomas Fairfax also appears in Sutcliff's novel 'Rider of the White Horse,' written from the perspective of his wife Anne Fairfax.  Historical background  Rosemary Sutcliff wrote that it is a fiction based on real events; \\"Most history books deal with the final campaign of the civil war in a single paragraph, and the Battle of Torrington they seldom mention at all. In this story I have tried to show what that final campaign in the west was like, and to re-fight the battles fought over my own countryside. Most of the people I've written about really lived; Torrington Church really did blow up, with 200 Royalist prisoners and their Parliamentary Guard inside, and no one has ever known how it happened, though Chaplain Joshua Sprigg left it on record that the deed was done by 'one Watts, a desperate villain.'\\" While the fact of the explosion is historically correct, other sources claim the prisoners were Parliamentary soldiers held by the Royalists (Sutcliff has it the other way round), while the actual number killed is unclear.http://bcw- project.org/military/english-civil-war/west-country/battle-of-torrington The battle itself features in local historical re-enactments.

Analyzing regional differences in party choice in Norway, he was the first to pinpoint factors relating to relations of production as well as counter-cultural cleavages when describing distinctions between Eastern and Western Norway. He also wrote several works on his native region, Agder, among others on the so-called child migration in older times. Early life and education √òidne was born in 1918 in Konsmo. He took the cand.philol. degree at the University of Oslo in 1950, with the paper Audnedalen--a work on his native valley.Entry for Audnedalen in BIBSYS Notable worksEast‚ÄìWest distinctions in Norway= √òidne is first and foremost known for the article Litt om motsetninga mellom Austlandet og Vestlandet (On the Distinction Between Eastern and Western Norway), published in the periodical Syn og Segn in 1957 and which was also selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009‚Äì2011. In it, he began by discrediting popular theories of the impact of topography on people, as well as Andreas Hansen's race theories. Instead, he cited differences in relations of production; Western Norway was more egalitarian than Eastern Norway. Also, he noted that three counter-cultures were rooted Western Norway, creating cleavages towards the rest of Norway: Landsm√•l, temperance and laity. Politically, √òidne tied these counter-cultures to the Liberal and Christian Democratic parties. He also noted the similarity in support of the Christian Democratic Party and the short-lived Moderate Liberal Party. Thus the article laid the grounds for voter sociology, a subset of political sociology which explores the ties between political party choices and the sociological characteristics of the electorate. In the same year that √òidne published the article, the first election survey in Norway was held, administered by the Norwegian Institute of Social Research in conjunction with the Norwegian parliamentary election of 1957. Inspirations in addition to √òidne include Paul Lazarsfeld et al.'s book The People's Choice. √òidne never developed his own theories, limiting himself to only one article,Rokkan, 1987: p. 203 but in later research his theories were developed scientifically by internationally renowned political scientists Henry Valen and Stein Rokkan. Pioneer works were Regional Contrasts in Norwegian Politics, published in 1964 by Rokkan and Valen, and Party Systems and Voter Alignments, published in 1967 by Rokkan and Seymour Martin Lipset. In 1973 √òidne issued the book √òstkant og vestkant i Oslos politiske historie: sosial og politisk struktur i Oslo 1906‚Äì69, about the distinctions between eastern and western Oslo.Entry for √òstkant og vestkant i Oslos politiske historie in BIBSYS =Child migration= √òidne also wrote on child migration in the Agder region, among others in the 1955 work Vest-Agder heimkunnskap. The study of this field has traditionally been severely underdeveloped in Norway, but √òidne grew up in this region and was aware of the practice, which took place between 1750 and 1910. Because of poverty, children in Southern Norway were sent to work during the summer. The migration typically took place from valleys in Vest-Agder--Kvinesdal, Lyngdalen, Audnedalen, Mandalen, Marnardal, √Öseral and Sirdal as well as Lindesnes--to more affluent areas in Aust-Agder, often near the coast--H√∏v√•g, Landvik, Arendal and Grimstad as well as Birkenes and Iveland. Many emigrated to the United States when they reached adolescence. In the late phase of his life √òidne assisted the screenwriter and film director Grete Salomonsen Hynnekleiv, who spent many years working on a screenplay, Yohan: The Child Wanderer, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1230478/?ref_=nm_knf_i1, which she also directed. The film was released in 2010 en featured Kris Kristoffersen as the story-teller.

Organization Prior to June 1, 2014, Miami Valley Council was divided into six districts. There were four rural districts: Darke District, Miami District, Preble District, and Shelby District, each named for the county in which they were located. There were two urban districts: Sunwatch District, which roughly covered the northern half of Montgomery County, and Wright Brothers District, which roughly covered the southern half. Part of the 2012-2014 Miami Valley Council Strategic Plan called for the council to review its district structure. A District Realignment Proposal was approved by the Miami Valley Council Executive Board in November 2013, and took effect on June 1, 2014, reducing the total number of districts from six to four. As a result of the realignment, the former Miami and Shelby Districts were merged into a single, new district known as Two Rivers District, while the former Darke and Preble Districts merged into Wayne Trace District. The Sunwatch and Wright Brothers Districts were not affected. As of June 1, 2014, the four districts of Miami Valley Council are Two Rivers District, Wayne Trace District, Sunwatch District, and Wright Brothers District.http://www.miamivalleybsa.org/Districts HistoryCampsWoodland Trails Scout Reservation= Woodland Trails Scout Reservation is the Miami Valley Council's year-round camping facility. It is located on a spread of hardwood forests, fields, and streams. Woodland Trails Scout Reservation is a camping facility owned and operated by the Miami Valley Council, Boy Scouts of America in Camden, Ohio, USA. History At the start of the 1950s, the Miami Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America operated one camp, Cricket Holler Scout Camp. This camp is located in Butler Township, a community approximately north of Dayton, Ohio. Cricket Holler was established in 1919 and occupies of forested land.http://mvcbsa.com/openrosters/DocDownload.asp?id=72292&orgkey;=2379 Due to the vast increase in the number of boys joining the Scouting movement in the Dayton area at that time, Cricket Holler could no longer adequately meet the burgeoning needs of the area's scouts, so the council leadership began to look for a large tract of land which could better serve the region's young men. In 1958, the Miami Valley Council succeeded in purchasing just over of land on the northern outskirts of the village of Camden in Preble County. =1959= The new scout reservation was originally planned to be a massive property divided into two camps for resident and day camping activities. Each camp would have its own man-made lake with campsites and other necessary buildings and support structures. Financial shortfalls and a decline in membership lead to the eventual abandonment of this master plan, with only the eastern camp being developed for summer resident camping purposes. By June 1959, there existed a new road cut into the interior of the camp, a food preparation building, the swimming pool and the spillway which would soon protect the waters of Mystic Lake. A name for the new property had not yet been selected, so for the first year it was simply referred to as \\"Miami Valley Scout Reservation.\\" With only a short time to prepare for the summer season, much of the property was still being developed as campers arrived. With the spillway construction only finished in early June, Mystic Lake was only about 1/3 filled, requiring boats to be carried across more than 50 yards of mud and tree stumps to reach the waterfront. Water lines across camp were limited, and were being run as required to accommodate the greatest need. Roads and campsites were established using a bulldozer with no specific plan. Initially 11 campsites were constructed, but each was nothing more than a cleared area with no physical structures. As much of the property was active farmland until 1958, there were few trees to speak of. Campers and staff planted young trees to help establish the current hardwood forest that covers Woodland Trails. =1960 - 1989= In 1960, the property was officially named Woodland Trails Scout Reservation. 12 additional campsites were built, establishing a total of 23 areas each equipped with a pavilion, kybo, and wash stand. Buildings such as the chapel, an climbing tower, Dittmar Ecology Center, 32-pole flag quadrangle, Herb Smith craft area, Pointner Lodge and a water tower were constructed. With these facilities, the camp flourished as one of the finest in Ohio. Originally, there was no dining hall; units practiced the traditional \\"patrol cooking\\" method, serviced by the camp commissary. As the years progressed, Pointner Lodge was developed into the camp's dining hall. Because of size constraints, this facility was not able to accommodate the entire camp at one time, requiring units to eat in shifts and pavilion tents to be set up outside to add to the seating capacity. =1990 - 1999= In 1990, the Miami Valley Council and the Dan Beard Council in Cincinnati completed the construction of a new dining hall. This was the last major joint venture between the organizations, as the Dan Beard Council received a large monetary gift and re-opened Camp Friedlander later in the decade. In 1991, Woodland Trails opened a new Project COPE course in the southern area of the property. In the fall of 1999, the dam holding back the waters of Mystic Lake was found to be unstable, and the lake was subsequently drained for nearly two years to complete repairs. =2000 - present= A tree was planted commemorating the 50th anniversary of Woodland Trails. Former campers and staff alumni stand in the foreground. In 2000, the Miami Valley Council sold approximately of the original property to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to form the Woodland Trails Wildlife Area.http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/woodlandtrails This transaction provided a solid financial foundation, allowing the council to rebuild its endowment fund and to retain ownership of Cricket Holler Scout Camp in Dayton. With the repairs to the spillway complete, Mystic Lake was filled once again and reestablished as Four Eagles Lake to honor the benefactors responsible for the donations to the repair efforts. In 2002, a new climbing and rappelling tower was constructed, spearheaded by Miami Lodge #495http://www.miami495.org of the Order of the Arrow. In 2002, the Wilbur Shoup Activity Center was donated by Dayton Power and Light, serving as a central meeting place in camp during the summer season.

He made his first-team debut as a substitute in a League Cup match against Middlesbrough in December 1995, and first played in the Football League on 4 February 1996, coming on to replace Jason Bowen in a Division One match away to Norwich City which finished as a 1‚Äì1 draw.

He played intermittently for Barnet in his first season, rarely in his second, and in March 2000 he rejoined his former club Welling United on loan, where he scored twice in eight appearances. His second goal, which secured a 1‚Äì0 defeat of Hednesford Town on the last day of the season, was not enough to prevent Welling's relegation from the Conference. In the summer of 2000, Barnes joined Hayes, where he made 22 appearances in all competitions, and scored only once: the goal, either \\"a mis-hit shot or an intentional lob from 25 yards\\", won the game against Kettering Town which played a significant role in deciding which of the two were relegated. He went on to play for St Albans City, Harrow Borough, Welling United (two more spells) and Chesham United. In March 2009, having spent time out of the game, Barnes joined Maidenhead United of the Conference South.

The Queen Anne style Tetcott House built by the Arscott family in about 1700 and demolished 1831 Tetcott is a civil parish, small settlement and former manor (once the home of the Arscotts of Tetcott) in Devon, England. The parish lies about five miles south of the town of Holsworthy and is bordered on the north by the parish of Clawton, on the east by a small part of Ashwater, and on the south by Luffincott. It forms part of the local government district of Torridge, and its western boundary is the River Tamar which forms the Cornish border. In 2001 its population was 110, half that of a century earlier (220 in 1901). The settlement of Tetcott itself consists almost solely of the manor house and parish church of Holy Cross,Hoskins, pp.492‚Äì3 but there are other hamlets in the parish, the largest of which is Lana about half a mile to the south-east.OS Explorer Map 112 (2011) . Lana is at grid ref SX339962. Parish church The parish church was dedicated by the Bishop of Waterford in 1338 or 1339. Before the Reformation it was dedicated to the Trinity. In 1740 the parish feast day was said to have been 3 May (the date of the Invention of the True Cross) probably leading, according to Nicholas Orme, to its present dedication to \\"Holy Cross\\", the first record of which dates from 1742. The present-day church has a Norman font and partly dates from the 13th century with some 16th-century additions, mainly the tower. The church was restored in 1890. It has one bell, though three are recorded in an inventory of 1553. A local tradition says that the treble bell at North Tamerton, across the River Tamar, came from Tetcott church and John Taylor the bell-founder having recast North Tamerton's ring of five in the early 19th century sold the treble to Tetcott so that the parishioners at North Tamerton could hear it across the valley and decide to acquire it. The south transept of the church, known as the Arscott Chapel, contains an ornate pew for the family and notable pew railings dating from around 1700. There are also four memorials to members of that family, the most elaborate to John Arscott (died 1675), who was Sheriff of Devon, and his wife. The others are noted below.

Arthur Arscott (1554‚Äì1618) built a new manor house at Tetcott in 1603,Hoskins, p.493; Pevsner (p.802) states however that the 1603 datestone was removed from Tetcott Mill and affixed to the present house in the 20th century which survives today in expanded form. A new and larger house was built adjacent to it by his descendants during the reign of Queen Anne (1702‚Äì1714). At this time new outbuildings were built in brick, unusual in Devon, some of which survive. The Queen Anne style house was demolished in 1831. =Descent= *John Arscott (died 1558) of Tetcott, was the fourth son of John Arscott (died 1541) of Arscott by his wife Margery Floyer, daughter of Richard Floyer. John married Elizabeth Walter, daughter of John Walter of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. His eldest son and heir was: *Arthur Arscott (1554‚Äì1618), of Tetcott, who married Mary Langsford, daughter of John Langsford of Thursleton.Vivian, p.21 His eldest son and heir was: *Edmund Arscott (1588‚Äì1656), of Tetcott, who married Mary Walrond (died 1652), daughter of William Walrond (died 1627)Vivian, p.21, Arscott; p.769, Walrond of Bradfield, Uffculme. *John Arscott (1613‚Äì1675), Sheriff of Devon at his death.Vivian, p.21; at his death as recorded on his monument in Tetcott Church He married Gertrude Calmady (died 1699), but died without progeny leaving as his heir to Tetcott his nephew: *John Arscott (died 1708), of Tetcott who married as his second wife Prudence, of unrecorded family. His third son was Dennis Arscott (1685‚Äì1721) of Ethy, Cornwall, Sheriff of Cornwall, whose daughter, Jane Arscott (born 1678) married Sir John Molesworth, 3rd Baronet (1668‚Äì1723) in 1699, leaving descendants who eventually inherited Tetcott in 1788 (see below). A mural monument exists in Tetcott Church to John Arscott and his two wives. By Prudence John Arscott had a son and heir: *Arthur Arscott (1683‚Äì1763), of Tetcott, who married Elizabeth Trefusis (died 1714), daughter of Francis Trefusis of Trefusis in the parish of Mylor, Cornwall, which family in 1794 succeeded as Barons Clinton.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, pp.264‚Äì5, Baron Clinton His mural monument exists in Tetcott Church. His eldest son and heir was: *John Arscott (1719‚Äì1788), of Tetcott, who died without having been legally married and without issue. In the style of a mediaeval lord, he kept as a member of his household a dwarf jester named Black John. The eccentric ways of him and his household were described in Footprints of Former Men in Cornwall (1870) by Robert Stephen Hawker, and also in Devonshire Characters and Strange Events (1908) by Sabine Baring-Gould. In this unusual respect he resembled his contemporary Devonian John Fulford (1736‚Äì1780) of Great Fulford, known as \\"Squire John\\", also one of the last in England to employ a full-time fool \\"dressed in the motley\\".http://www.greatfulford.co.uk/about-great-fulford/#history His mural monument survives in Tetcott Church.

The brick building to the left with rusticated quoins may have been associated with the mansion demolished in 1831.Pevsner, p.802 Following the Arscotts, Tetcott was inherited by their distant cousins the family of Molesworth, later Molesworth- St Aubyn, of Pencarrow, Cornwall, who continue there until the present day.\\"Jester Walk\\" itinerary, TetcottDebrett's Peerage, 1968, p.709, Molesworth-St. Aubyn baronets, seats: Pencarrow & Tetcott, Holsworthy The 7th and 15th Molesworth-St Aubyn baronets had as a first-name \\"Arscott\\". In 1831, whilst retaining the original manor house used some time later as a farmhouse, they demolished the adjacent Queen Anne mansion, an act much resented by the local population, and built in its place a \\"Gothic cottage\\"Hawker, Appendix to serve as a hunting lodge.Luke This was burned down, apparently by disgruntled locals five years later. In 1925, as a secondary residence to Pencarrow, the family moved into the original manor house, formerly let as a farmhouse, which survives today. It is a long two-storey building built of rubble stone. Above the round arch of the central two-storey porch was reset, in the 20th century, the 1603 datestone taken from Tetcott Mill. Tetcott hunt The last of the Arscotts had been a keen hunter, and kennelled his pack of hounds at Tetcott. Later the sporting rights were acquired by Vincent Calmady who in about 1872 formed a pack of otter-hounds. In 1879 he recommenced fox-hunting on the Tetcott country, and the current South Tetcott Hunt and Tetcott Hunt continue today. HMS Tetcott a Type II British Hunt class destroyer was built for the Royal Navy during World War II, named after the hunt. In 2013 Mr Paul Martin MFH, master of the South Tetcott Hunt, lives at Tetcott.

Life James Brown was born around 1734. The son of a Jacobite farmer who died in the Battle of Culloden in 1746, he retained the same Jacobite allegiances throughout his life. He married Helen Taylor, daughter of an Episcopalian minister, and they had a son, Robert, who would become a notable botanist, giving his name to his discovery of Brownian motion. Brown was minister at Montrose in 1788 when Charles Edward Stuart died. The Scottish Episcopal Church had long supported the House of Stuart, but found it impossible to support Charles' heir, his brother Henry Benedict Stuart, who was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. Accordingly, the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church met and agreed to recognise George III. 25 May 1788 was set as the day upon which services were to include prayers for King George III for the first time, and on that day the directive was followed by all but two ministers, Brown and Charles Rose, the Bishop of Dunblane and Dunkeld. Around 1790, Brown moved to Edinburgh, where he became pastor to the remaining Jacobite dissenters. On presenting himself to the old and increasingly senile Rose, he was consecrated as a bishop. When questioned later, Rose denied having done so, suggesting that perhaps his sister had. Rose had no authority to consecrate Brown, as the canon required no fewer than three consecrating bishops, although the nonjuring church in England had relied on such consecrations. The Episcopal Bishops were furious at Brown's consecration and declared it null and void. Some accused Brown of taking advantage of Rose's senility in order to advance his own position, but it is equally likely that Rose was perfectly aware of what he was doing and, as a strong Jacobite, would have desired the non-juring laity to be catered for. The following year Rose died, making Brown the last remaining minister to the Jacobite dissenters. Succession Brown ordained Donald Macintosh as deacon in 1789 and later priest. Macintosh then continued the ministry for some years, living to 1808. References  \\"The Robert Brown memorial\\" in Journal of Botany, British and Foreign 34.

Mathematical results Tardos started with a result in universal algebra: he exhibited a maximal clone of monotone operations which is not finitely generated. He obtained partial results concerning the Hanna Neumann conjecture. With his student, Adam Marcus, he proved a combinatorial conjecture of Zolt√°n F√ºredi and P√©ter Hajnal which was known to imply the Stanley‚ÄìWilf conjecture.

They consist of a collection of functions in all pure finite types. The primitive recursive functionals are important in proof theory and constructive mathematics They are a central part of the Dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic arithmetic developed by Kurt G√∂del. In recursion theory, the primitive recursive functionals are an example of higher-type computability, as primitive recursive functions are examples of Turing computability.  Background  Every primitive recursive functional has a type, which tells what kind of inputs it takes and what kind of output it produces. An object of type 0 is simply a natural number; it can also be viewed as a constant function that takes no input and returns an output in the set N of natural numbers. For any two types œÉ and œÑ, the type œÉ‚ÜíœÑ represents a function that takes an input of type œÉ and returns an output of type œÑ. Thus the function f(n) = n+1 is of type 0‚Üí0. The types (0‚Üí0)‚Üí0 and 0‚Üí(0‚Üí0) are different; by convention, the notation 0‚Üí0‚Üí0 refers to 0‚Üí(0‚Üí0). In the jargon of type theory, objects of type 0‚Üí0 are called functions and objects that take inputs of type other than 0 are called functionals. For any two types œÉ and œÑ, the type œÉ√óœÑ represents an ordered pair, the first element of which has type œÉ and the second element of which has type œÑ. For example, consider the functional A takes as inputs a function f from N to N, and a natural number n, and returns f(n). Then A has type (0 √ó (0‚Üí0))‚Üí0. This type can also be written as 0‚Üí(0‚Üí0)‚Üí0, by Currying. The set of (pure) finite types is the smallest collection of types that includes 0 and is closed under the operations of √ó and ‚Üí. A superscript is used to indicate that a variable xœÑ is assumed to have a certain type œÑ; the superscript may be omitted when the type is clear from context.  Definition  The primitive recursive functionals are the smallest collection of objects of finite type such that: * The constant function f(n) = 0 is a primitive recursive functional * The successor function g(n) = n + 1 is a primitive recursive functional * For any type œÉ√óœÑ, the functional K(xœÉ, yœÑ) = x is a primitive recursive functional * For any types œÅ, œÉ, œÑ, the functional *::S(rœÅ‚ÜíœÉ‚ÜíœÑ,sœÅ‚ÜíœÉ, tœÅ) = (r(t))(s(t)) *:is a primitive recursive functional * For any type œÑ, and f of type œÑ, and any g of type 0‚ÜíœÑ‚ÜíœÑ, the functional R(f,g)0‚ÜíœÑ defined recursively as *::R(f,g)(0) = f, *::R(f,g)(n+1) = g(n,R(f,g)(n)) *: is a primitive recursive functional  See also  * Dialectica interpretation * Higher-order function * Primitive recursive function * Simply typed lambda calculus  References  * Category:Proof theory Category:Computability theory ","title":"Primitive recursive functional"},{"id":"22833084","text":"Aydƒ±nspor 1923 is a Turkish sports club based in Aydƒ±n.

It deals with the construction and representation of free-form curves, surfaces, or volumesFarin, G.: \\"A History of Curves and Surfaces in CAGD\\", Handbook of Computer Aided Geometric Designand is closely related to geometric modeling. Core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation. GD studies especially the construction and manipulation of curves and surfaces given by a set of points using polynomial, rational, piecewise polynomial, or piecewise rational methods. The most important instruments here are parametric curves and parametric surfaces, such as B√©zier curves, spline curves and surfaces. An important non-parametric approach is the level-set method. Application areas include shipbuilding, aircraft, and automotive industries, as well as architectural design. The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by shipbuilders of 1960s. Geometric models can be built for objects of any dimension in any geometric space. Both 2D and 3D geometric models are extensively used in computer graphics. 2D models are important in computer typography and technical drawing. 3D models are central to computer-aided design and manufacturing, and many applied technical fields such as geology and medical image processing. Geometric models are usually distinguished from procedural and object-oriented models, which define the shape implicitly by an algorithm. They are also contrasted with digital images and volumetric models; and with mathematical models such as the zero set of an arbitrary polynomial. However, the distinction is often blurred: for instance, geometric shapes can be represented by objects; a digital image can be interpreted as a collection of colored squares; and geometric shapes such as circles are defined by implicit mathematical equations. Also, the modeling of fractal objects often requires a combination of geometric and procedural techniques. Geometric problems originating in architecture can lead to interesting research and results in geometry processing, computer-aided geometric design, and discrete differential geometry.H. Pottmann, S. Brell-Cokcan and J. Wallner: Discrete surfaces for architectural design In architecture, geometric design is associated with the pioneering explorations of Chuck Hoberman into transformational geometry as a design idiom, and applications of this design idiom within the domain of architectural geometry.

Camp Long Lake has grown and kept changing with the times. Traditional merit badge offerings were augmented with a Project First Class program in 1991 after changes in Boy Scout advancement requirements that challenged boys to complete their First Class rank in a year. A climbing tower was built to challenge Scouts 14 years of age and older in 1998. The Trail to Eagle program was added in 2002 to answer that call of many Star and Life Scouts needing assistance in obtaining the difficult required merit badges. Golfing merit badge was also added that year due to the increasing popularity of the sport. In 2004 a whitewater outpost was added for Scouts who are at least 13 years of age. In 2005, Photography merit badge was added to the program. Starting in 2009, the council undertook to extensively update the camp's shooting range facilities with the construction of a BB gun and slingshot building and ranges which opened in 2010 and the construction of a large standing gun range for rifle and shotgun shooting activities which is scheduled to open in 2011. thumb In the fall of 2018 the camp was hit with a large storm that took out upward of a thousand trees on the property. The only building that suffered any major damage was the \\"aqua-shed\\" which had to be removed and rebuilt in 2019. other damaged areas include Campcraft and the zipline which had to be removed.

The island is commonly believed to be conterminous with the overall Grosse Ile Township, but the township consists of over a dozen islands‚Äî many of which are very small and uninhabited. Local residents refer to Grosse Ile as the Big Island, Main Island, or simply The Island, to distinguish it from the township as a whole. A large number of islands in the Detroit River are closely connected to Grosse Ile. The island was named by French explorers, and Grosse √éle means \\"Large Island\\". The island was first given to the early French explorers by the Potawatomi in 1776. The Potawatomi referred to the island as Kitcheminishen. Brothers William and Alexander Macomb, merchants and fur traders from Albany, New York and Detroit, bought the island from the Potawatomi, becoming the first European-American owners. They had the island surveyed in 1819 and it was incorporated into Monguagon Township in 1829. The island remained sparsely populated and an independent community, but it did not gain autonomy until the formation of Grosse Ile Township on October 27, 1914. In the 21st century, Grosse Ile is considered a Downriver community as part of Metro Detroit. The island is bordered on the west by the Trenton Channel and is connected to mainland Michigan by the Wayne County Bridge in the middle of the island and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge on the northern end. The island itself is divided by two canals. The area on the north, known as Hennepin Point, is undeveloped and the site of a historic lighthouse.

The reservation is operated by Theodore Roosevelt Council, BSA and located near Wading River, New York. The reservation comprises camp located in the Long Island Pine Barrens and surrounds the \\"Deep Pond\\". It was originally named Camp Wauwepex in 1921 in Miller Place. In 1922, it was moved to its present location. At the time the camp comprised . Camp Wauwepex was renamed the John M. Schiff Scout Reservation when the Mortimer L.

Kniffin, Copyright ¬© 1999 Theodore Roosevelt Council, Boy Scouts of America Inc In 1922, it was moved to its present location. The Council bought the property in 1926 for $250,000. At the time the camp comprised 550 acres (2.2 km2). There were three program areas, named Pioneer Division, Frontier Division and Indian Division. The dining halls were named accordingly, as Pioneer Hall, etc. The camp divisions are no longer used, and the dining halls are now Hayden (formerly Indian) Hall and Hickcox (formerly Frontier) Hall, which burned to the ground on November 1, 2011. The cause of the fire remains under investigation although investigators have said it does not appear suspicious. The dining hall was unoccupied at the time of the fire. The old Pioneer Hall was used as a craft lodge but has since been demolished. Onteora Scout Reservation Onteora Scout Reservation is a Boy Scout Camp owned by the Theodore Roosevelt Council located in Livingston Manor, New York. The camp consists of and adjoins the Catskill State Forest Preserve. It was opened in 1955 due to overcrowding in Camp Wauwepex. At its peak in the early 1970s, it was the nation's third-largest Boy Scout Camp in terms of attendance (after Philmont and Ten Mile River,) accommodating 1200 Scouts at a time utilizing two dining halls and three water fronts. Nicknamed \\"The Land in the Sky\\", it was closed in 1991 and reopened in 1998 with a completely volunteer staff, and in 2003 opened for a full season with a paid staff. It is the only Boy Scout camp to have been closed, and then reopened. The property on which the Reservation is located has a long and rich history, which begins with the Lenni-Lenape Indians. They used the Sun Trail to go from the Hudson River to the Delaware. The Sun Trail ran from Hudson River to the East Branch of the Delaware and was so called because an Indian or Scout could start running at sun-up and reach the other end by sun-down.History of the Town of Rockland, Wilmer Sipple, http://www.sullivancountyhistory.org/new_page_4.htm Later that same trail was enlarged by John Hunter and in 1815 became known throughout the area as the Hunter Road.History of the Town of Rockland, Wilmer Sipple, http://www.sullivancountyhistory.org/new_page_4.htm Since it was the first road in the area, many traders and farmers made great use of it. In 1880s the property became one of the favorite fishing spots of the area and a man named Todd Hammond built a large manor house on the property overlooking the lake and developed the lake and streams for trout fishing.THE WALTON REPORTER, 14 July 1894LIBERTY REGISTER, 10 March 1896 In 1911,NEW YORK TIMES, 9 Feb 1916 the Orchard Lake Club was formed by New York City businessmen who purchased the property to enjoy the trout fishing and beauty of the woods.FOREST AND STREAM MAGAZINE,May 3, 1913,page 567 By the turn of the century, what is now the Al Nassau area of the Reservation was then a small town consisting of five houses, a logging camp and a mill for the Resherif Lumber Company. To this day, the foundations of the houses and mill can be seen. During the \\"Roaring 20s\\" the area was the property of the New York Trout and Skeet Club. Many people came to the area from the city to fish and vacation. During WWII, however, due to the rationing of gasoline, the club was forced out of business. When put up for sale in 1942, the club was bought by Mr. Charles R. Vose for $20,000. He used it as a private retreat until 1956 when the Nassau County Council bought the property with the help of a donation from Mr. Alfred H. Capery. Many generations of Scouts and Scouters have enjoyed the property since its purchase and the establishment of the base camp in 1956. Many of the buildings were constructed between 1958 and 1962. It is the only Scout Reservation to close and then reopen. Order of the Arrow The council's Order of the Arrow lodge is called the Buckskin Lodge, 412 WWW.

In 2010, UNPC trained 889 youth in this course over 12 summer weeks in 39 separate courses. = Family camping = UNPC used to offer an annual Family Camp program at Camp Maple Dell which allowed a whole family to participate in the fun activities associated with a Scout camp as a family and without an advancement focus. UNPC also offers a Family Odyssey program which is modeled after the Philmont Training Center experience at Tifie Scout Camp. This is a family program where a parent may attend Wood Badge, a Scout aged child may attend Timberline (NYLT), and the rest of the family may participate in age appropriate activities all at the same camp and all during the same week. Eagles Nest UNPC has a nationally sanctioned National Eagle Scout Association committee which recognizes new Eagle Scouts as well as notable Eagle Scouts from the council. \\"Our council is the largest in the country, and we really have had the lead in Eagle Scout awards the last two years,\\" said John Gaily, council program director. \\"We are by far the most.\\" In 2010, UNPC recognized 2,818 new Eagle Scouts. UNPC and NESA recognize notable Eagle Scouts with either the Outstanding Eagle Scout Award or the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award: Notable Eagle Scouts from UNPC include: =Distinguished Eagle Scouts= *Merrill D.

Casserly was born in Sydney and attended St. Dominic's College in Kingswood.  Biography  Casserly made his senior debut for Marconi in the National Soccer League as a 17-year-old, and quickly established himself as an integral part of the first-team squad winning the National Soccer League championship in 1992/93. An enterprising wing back, Casserly spent 7 seasons with Marconi, earning International honours at Under 20 and Under 23 level, and ultimately making his full senior debut under Terry Venables against New Zealand in 1997. He was lured to Northern Spirit in 1998, the newly formed National Soccer League franchise based in North Sydney. After two impressive seasons there, and in the prime of his career at 26, he moved to Sweden, signing with AIK. His progress at the Swedish club was steady, and he finally secured a regular starting position in his third season with the club, playing 30 out of a possible 36 matches. However, he failed to negotiate an improved contract, and returned to Australia, playing out the final seasons of the now defunct NSL with Marconi. Despite the dawn of the A-League, Casserly elected to pursue more lucrative career interests outside of football, and continued to play football at the NSW Premier League level, where his clubs have included Marconi, Stanmore Hawks, Blacktown City and Manly United. The 2010 NSWPL season was Casserly's last as a player and he became head Coach of Marconi Stallions in 2011. After an average year in his first year as coach, Casserly managed to bring championship success to Marconi in 2012 winning the grand final match against Bonnyrigg White Eagles 2‚Äì0. This was Marconi's first championship victory since the 1992/93 NSL season. Casserly was part of that team as a player and has now become one of a rare few that have won titles with a club as both player and coach. In 2013, Casserly was appointed as head of national performance of the Football Federation Australia.

On the other hand, a proof of must first demonstrate a particular x, and then provide a function that converts a proof of œÜ into a proof of Œ∏ in which x has that particular value. As a weak counterexample, suppose Œ∏(x) is some decidable predicate of a natural number such that it is not known whether any x satisfies Œ∏.

The construction of the fortress began in 1810 by decree of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, in the atmosphere of increased tension before Napoleon's invasion of the Russian Empire in 1812. Construction of the fortress, due to Napoleon's invasion, lengthy delays, serious floodings and slow construction work, was fully completed only in 1878. The Mark Rothko Art centre is located in the former Artillery arsenal. History About 10,000 workers built the fortress in two shifts. In 1812, the fortress was attacked by a detachment of the French Army of 24,000 men. The fortress was still under construction and was defended by 3300 men with 200 cannons. The fortress was a significant modern military centre of the Russian Empire, for a long time being a defense base of the western frontier of the Russian Empire. The direct route taken by Russian nobles and Royalty from St. Petersburg (then capital of the Russian Empire) to Europe led right through the city of Daugavpils (then named Dinaburg), and Daugavpils Fortress was the place of rest for many nobles including tsars Alexander I, Nicolas I, Alexander II, Alexander III and Russia's last tsar Nicolas II.

The current church building was built in 1792, and with its distinctive round shape and high tower it is a well-known landmark in the town. It faces The Quarry area of parkland, which slopes down to the River Severn. The church is a Grade I listed building. The motto of the church is \\"open doors, open hearts, and open minds\\". This indicates the aspiration of the church to be a welcoming church, involved in the community, and on a collective journey seeking after God. Music is a strong tradition at St Chad's. The church has a robed choir which leads the music at many of the services. The church organ is a large three-manual pipe organ, built by Norman and Beard in 1904 and restored by Nicholsons in 1963 and Harrison & Harrison in 1985 and more recently in 2011.http://www.stchadschurchshrewsbury.com/Newsletters/organrecitals2012.pdf The church hosts lunchtime organ recitals and other concerts. Charles Darwin was baptised in St Chad's church in 1809, and as a young boy attended the church with his mother Susannah. The headstone prop of Ebenezer Scrooge (played by George C. Scott) that was used in the 1984 film A Christmas Carol is still present in the now-disused churchyard. According to the Shrewsbury Town Crier, Martin Wood, the headstone is not a \\"prop\\" but an actual period headstone, on which the original inscription had deteriorated to the point that the movie production people asked the church if they could use it and inscribe the \\"Ebenezer Scrooge\\" words on it. You can still see some of the original inscription on the bottom part of the stone. Among those actually buried in the churchyard was Shrewsbury architect Edward Haycock, Sr.Obituary of Haycock. In 2010, the church became a member of the Greater Churches Group.Official website, URL accessed 16 September 2010. History Inside St Chad's Church, looking towards the sanctuary Palladian style entrance to the church The present building replaced an earlier church, dedicated to St Chad, situated near College Hill; this was a 13th-century building which was largely destroyed when the central tower collapsed in 1788. All remaining of the earlier building is a side chapel surrounded by a disused churchyard which also contains an exposed crypt. Scottish architect George Steuart was commissioned to build a new church, and he submitted several preliminary designs. Due to a misunderstanding, Steuart went on to complete a circular plan which was not the Parish Church Council's preferred design; however, time was limited, and this was the design which was built. The foundation stone was laid on St Chad's day, 2 March 1790. The church was built of white Grinshill stone. The building work was supervised by John Simpson (who later worked on several projects with Thomas Telford, including the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct). Internally, the gallery was supported by slender cast iron pillars, an early example of cast iron used for this purpose; they were made by William Hazledine, a pioneering ironmaster who had a foundry in Shrewsbury. (There are memorials to Simpson and Hazledine on either side of the sanctuary arch of the church.) The church was opened on 19 August 1792. The sanctuary window is a copy in stained glass of a triptych by Rubens in Antwerp Cathedral; it was made in the 1840s by David Evans, a local stained glass artist. The original pulpit, which obscured the altar, was removed in 1888; it was replaced by a copper and brass pulpit in Arts and Crafts style, placed to one side and giving a clearer view of the Sanctuary. The entrance hall has many memorials relating to the 53rd Regiment of Foot, and its successor regiment the King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) including: *alabaster tablet memorial to officers and men of the 53rd who died at the Battle of Sobraon (1846); *large tablet to those of that regiment who died in the Indian Mutiny campaign (1857‚Äì59); *tablet to those of the 1st Battalion KSLI who died in the Egyptian campaign of 1882; *tablet to those of the 1st KSLI who died in the occupation of Suakim, Sudan, 1885‚Äì86; *tablet above vestibule entrance to KSLI dead (4,700 all ranks) of the Great War, unveiled 1930 in presence of Poet Laureate John Masefield; and *books of remembrance of KSLI war dead of both World Wars, in separate cases. In 1913 a vestry off the right hand side of the entrance lobby was converted to a chapel of St Aidan, in memory of former vicar Richard Eden St Aubyn Arkwright. In 1951, at about same time as a second storey was added to another vestry the opposite side of the lobby, funds were raised to convert this chapel into a regimental chapel for the KSLI, resulting in an enlarged apse, new altar, rood screen, rails and chairs. In 1952 and 1966 Regimental colours were laid up here. After World War I, the church's main sanctuary was refitted with a light oak reredos, designed by Cecil Lightwood Hare, new altar and wainscot as a memorial to the parish fallen of the war, repainted in gold leaf and cobalt in 1951.

This was defined by a TM Forum working group based on research documented in its Revenue Assurance Technical Overview . practically, it can be defined as the process of ensuring that all products and services provided by the Telecom Service Provider are billed as per the commercial agreement with customers', by ensuring network, billing and configuration integrity and accuracy across network platforms and systems. In many telecommunications service providers, revenue assurance is led by a dedicated revenue assurance department. Overview \\"Revenue assurance\\" is used both to describe an activity performed within telecommunications service providers, and is a common name for a small business unit associated with that activity. Revenue assurance is a practical response to perceived or actual issues with operational under performance, most commonly relating to billing and collection of revenue. Some of the procedures associated with identifying, remedying or preventing errors may be undertaken by a dedicated Revenue Assurance department, though responsibility for revenue assurance is often diffuse and varies greatly with the organizational structure of the provider. Assuming a provider with a typical organizational split, responsibilities for revenue assurance primarily sit between the Finance and Technology directorates, however, revenue assurance initiatives are often started in a business unit or marketing group. The relevance to Finance rests with the responsibility for financial control, audit and reporting, while the subject matter would be network and IS systems as implemented or operated by the Technology side of the business. Marketing groups and / or business units (e.g. wholesale or retail business lines) will often embark on revenue assurance projects in an effort to improve product line margins. Furthermore, marketing and business units are pivotal in providing input into the \\"should be\\" state of customer bills and products. The sphere of influence described by revenue assurance varies greatly between telecommunications service providers, but is usually closely related to back office functions where small errors may have a disproportionately large impact on revenues or costs. The processing of transaction data in modern telecommunications providers exhibits many attributes akin to a complex system. However, there is significant disagreement about the ultimate aims and legitimate scope of revenue assurance teams. This is in part caused by: (1) the cross-functional nature of the activity and the consequent need for a variety of skills from IT, marketing, finance, et al.; (2) the difficulty of generalizing across businesses with different objectives and business models; (3) political infighting within each telco about responsibility for revenue leakages and assurance; and (4) the difficulty in reliably measuring the value added by revenue assurance as separable from underlying performance. There is high-level agreement between practitioners about the goals and methods of revenue assurance, though reaching a consensus on defining the boundaries of revenue assurance has proved elusive so far. The goals relate to improving the financial performance by eliminating mistakes in the processing of transaction data. Some take a more encompassing view of what counts as a mistake, which may extend as far as questioning the policy set by executives even when this has been executed correctly. Others take a more open-ended view of the data that is the subject matter. For example, in decreasing order of frequency, revenue assurance may cover: (1) revenues from retail and corporate sales; (2) revenues and costs from interconnect and wholesale contracts; and (3) margins and profitability of investment in networks and information systems. Other markets have different or more refined priorities. For example, in the U.S.A. management of wholesale contracts has often been the first objective because of the complexity of the domestic market resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's regulatory framework. In contrast, telcos in developing countries may prioritize management of international interconnect arrangements because of the risks posed by fraud and arbitrage. A cable supplier or internet service provider that predominantly offers retail customers flat monthly charges and no limits on usage may be most interested in assuring the profitability of network investments. Revenue assurance is often regarded by practitioners as a low-cost mechanism to generate significant financial returns for telecommunications service providers. However, the returns are unpredictable as well as being hard to measure, which encourages many executives to take a sceptical view of its worth. Comparable revenue assurance activities do occur in other industries, such as with billing of utilities or with the licensing of software, and there are many parallels with financial and operational control activities undertaken by most large businesses. The rationale for why revenue assurance has come to be considered particularly important in telecommunications, unlike other industries, is disputed. Reasonable conjectures are that: (1) the fast pace of change and intense commercial competition increase the likelihood of mistakes; (2) there is significant complexity in determining the combined effect of interacting systems and processes; and (3) the high-volume, low-value nature of transactions amplifies the financial implications of \\"small\\" errors. Another conjecture is that revenue assurance is a response to changing market conditions. The thinking is that as markets reach saturation and growth potential falls off, so the value of maximizing returns from existing sales increases. This observation has some merit but does not explain the increasing popularity of revenue assurance in telcos serving growth markets. It also in part contradicts the assumption of a compelling costs versus benefits argument for revenue assurance, which would be enhanced in businesses undergoing rapid change. It is also important to recognize that there is a long history of revenue assurance activities in some telcos that predates the coining of the term \\"revenue assurance\\". The revenue assurance techniques applied in practice cover a broad spectrum, from analysis and implementation of business controls to automated data interrogation. At one end of the spectrum, revenue assurance can appear very similar to the kinds of review and process mapping techniques applied for other financial controlling objectives like accounting integrity, as exemplified by those derived from clause 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by consultancies. The size of such consultancies covers the entire range; the Big 4 all offer some form of revenue assurance consulting, but there are also niche specialist consultancies. At the other end of the spectrum, revenue assurance is treated as a form of reactive automated data interrogation, seeking to find anomalies in transaction data that may indicate errors and potential revenue loss. This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by software houses that aim to provide databases and configurable tools to extract and interrogate a telco's source data. A less popular form of reactive automated assurance involves using both software and specialised hardware as a means of extracting additional data on transactions, for example by creating actual network events or interfacing directly with network elements to replicate dummy events. As with consultancies, IT-oriented revenue assurance solutions are offered by both large vendors like providers of billing and mediation software, and by specialized niche providers. There is some debate about the relative merits of the different techniques that can be employed in revenue assurance. As yet, there is no professional body, no qualifications, and no academic research that would help to drive consensus about the purpose or methods of revenue assurance. In part this is addressed by individuals working in the sector through membership and qualification in related fields such as accountancy and information systems audit. Some scientific research in other fields is also applicable to revenue assurance, though most revenue assurance \\"facts\\" rely heavily on anecdotes and oft-repeated truisms. Some of the most helpful and progressive initiatives in addressing the problem of consensus and scientific basis are listed below. The value of revenue assurance Revenue assurance is usually understood as a means to identify and remedy, and perhaps also to prevent, problems that result in financial under performance without seeking to generate additional sales. The most common metaphor is that of leaking water from a pipe, where water stands in place of revenues or cash flows, and the leaks represent waste. The value of revenue assurance is hence determined by the size of the leaks \\"plugged\\", and possibly also those leaks prevented before they occur, although estimating the value of the latter is very problematic. The value added also includes the recovery of \\"lost\\" revenues or costs (through issuing additional bills, chasing uncollected payments, renegotiating with suppliers a refund of costs etc.) after the fact. This last form of reactive revenue assurance is the easiest to put a value to, but is in many ways the least efficient form of revenue assurance; effort is directed towards repeatedly addressing the consequences of known flaws, and not on addressing the flaws themselves. This can lead to a parasitical relationship between a Revenue Assurance department or vendor and the wider business, where the department/vendor finds it easiest to justify its ongoing existence/contract by repeatedly fixing symptoms and not the root causes. The TM Forum conducted a benchmark survey in 2008 that concluded average leakage, not including losses due to fraud, was 1% of the gross revenues for those telcos that took part.http://www.tmforum.org/TMForumPressReleases/RevenueAssuranceStudy/36002/article.html The number of participating telcos was relatively small compared to some other surveys, but the survey technique was more demanding than any comparable survey to date. The survey used the most detailed and prescriptive definition of how to calculate leakage of any survey of its type. The definition was taken from the TM Forum's own standard on how to calculate revenue assurance metrics . To increase confidence that participants calculated their leakages correctly, the TM Forum's benchmark program independently reviewed the results and corroborated them with representatives of the participating companies. The survey's average of 1% leakage of gross revenue, whilst still significant, is notably lower than many other quoted estimates and reported survey findings about average leakage. This may be because the survey used a very strict definition of leakage. The survey measured only actual under-billed and unbilled amounts discovered by the participants; it excluded other types of leakages such as cost leakages and loss of opportunity leakages, and it excluded projected leakage estimations that are commonly used (i.e., what would have been the amount of leakage, if the leakage would not been discovered by revenue assurance activities). It may also reflect a reduction in bias or exaggeration in reported leakages, or at least the exclusion of guesswork. Respondents were given authoritative instructions on how to quantify leakage based on actual data and were instructed to avoid making suppositions in the absence of such data. The best known estimates of \\"typical\\" revenue leakage come from a series of annual surveys conducted by the Analysys consultancy and research business. In these surveys, leakage was commonly estimated as being worth between 5% and 15% of the total revenue of the business. Similar research by other businesses has generated results in the same range, with none concluding leakage of less than 1% of gross revenue, and some suggesting leakage of 20% or more was not uncommon. Reasons to doubt these estimates are as follows: (1) All the estimates of leakage were derived from the subjective opinions of staff working in service providers; (2) All the research was conducted by businesses wishing to promote their revenue assurance products; (3) Increased annual spend on revenue assurance has not resulted in a clear downward trend in estimates; (4) The estimates were broadly similar even when the criteria for what losses to include varied greatly; and (5) Genuine losses of this scale should be a severe corporate governance issue in any publicly listed business. What can be said with some confidence is that revenue assurance practitioners are able to provide a vast number of consistent anecdotes relating to the causes of leakage and means to resolve them. Though there is little objective evidence relating to actual leakages approaching this scale in the public domain as this information per se is highly confidential, there are some indirect measures of data integrity that help give a sense of potential leakage. For example, in reconciling interconnect costs and revenues between telcos, a 5% variance is the common practice to accept before a disputed invoice can lead one party to withhold payment, and a 0.5% variance would be considered industry-leading practice according to best practice advice issued by the UK Revenue Assurance Group. Revenue Assurance in Telecom Although Revenue Assurance has always been present in the telecom parlance it has recently been brought at the forefront of the top management. This is due to several factors including * Profit: Increasing cost pressures and decreasing margins. The high profit days for most telcos are over. They all need to find alternative means to squeeze higher margins by effectively tracking their revenue. * Regulatory: New regulatory structure and compliance requirements which force the telecom operators to report their revenue accurately. * Technology Innovation: Ensuring new technologies and products are performing as per perceived plans. Keeping up with release of new technologies along with co-existing of legacy systems. * Mergers and Acquisitions: With increase in the number of telco mergers and acquisitions, organizations are finding it very difficult handle multiple BSS systems including Billing, Mediation and Rating together etc. Revenue Assurance has been a problem for the telecom companies since the very early stages. Tracking of pulses, minutes, counts, bytes etc. has never been more difficult. One would think these would be easy for the tech-savvy telco companies. However, the truth has been just the opposite. In a hurry to release new technologies in the market, the Revenue Assurance systems are always lagging behind. Revenue Assurance in a telco environment covers a wide range of technical and business aspects. An RA operator needs to be aware of both OSS & BSS processes and internal dependencies to accurately decipher the revenue code. =What causes the problem = A telecom organization's revenue chain is usually a very complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end consumer. As the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each of its connections. A revenue leakage is typically attributed to when a telco organization is unable to bill correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment. As the organization grows the probability of revenue leakage only increases. =Where is the problem = The most debated part of revenue assurance is where to start checking, i.e. at the network side, the rating side, the billing side, the interconnect side, the CRM side, etc. However, most surveys and reports state that the maximum leakage happens during the flow of Call Detail Records (CDRs) or Event Detail Records (EDRs) from the Switch to the respective rating / billing engines. Some of the common problem areas are : * Network * Signaling problems * CDRs in Switch not sent to Mediation * CDRs in Mediation not send downstream * CDRs rejected by rating / billing system * Wrong duration on the CDRs * Wrong TON value populated in the CDRs * Incorrect Business rules * Subscriber provisioning * Incorrect Routing * Rating & Billing * Incorrect Rejection Logic * Duplicate CDRs resulting in double charging * Incorrect tariff plans * Rating & Billing accuracy errors * Late rating / billing * Incorrect configurations ‚Äì rating minutes instead of seconds * Incorrect Disconnection Revenue assurance as a discipline Among the disciplines in revenue assurance are: 1\\\\. The CORE functions of a revenue assurance group: Monitoring, Baselining, Auditing, Synchronizing, Investigating and Compliance. 2\\\\. Decomposing an organization's revenue assurance scope (The Revenue Management Chain). 3\\\\. Assessing and minimizing revenue loss risk. Maturity of Revenue Assurance There is no formal maturity model for Revenue Assurance which is universally accepted. However the Revenue Assurance processes can be pegged against a generic five stage maturity model. The five stages are listed below and are described in terms of a Revenue Assurance Strategy, People, Process and technological advances. Revenue Assurance Maturity Stages * Initial: At this level that they are (typically) un-documented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ad hoc, uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the Revenue Assurance processes. At this stage there is no formalized Revenue Assurance strategy in place. Teams run adhoc queries on various systems. It depends entirely on personal ideas & initiatives. It encompasses substantial manual effort. There are undocumented repeat processes. * Repeatable: At this level that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be precise. This is where the Revenue Assurance functions starts to take some shape in defined procedures and outputs. However they still don‚Äôt cover the entire revenue spectrum of the telecommunications company nor do they cover all aspects of a specific revenue stream. People are still learning the skill set of revenue assurance. There are specific measurement and analysis outcomes received at this stage. * Defined: At this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard Revenue Assurance processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place (i.e., they are the AS-IS processes) and used to establish consistency of process performance across the organization. There are specific tools for Revenue Assurance identified and implemented. There is clear sense of what revenue chain coverage does, what the Revenue Assurance department cover and road maps are in place for the future. All major revenue streams are covered by now. There is a formalized and approved Revenue Assurance charter and strategy in place. There is a specific year on year budget for the department. * Managed: At this level with the use of process metrics, management can effectively control the Revenue Assurance AS-IS process (e.g., for Issue Detection, Root Cause Analysis, Closure). There is a formalized strategy and long term road map for people, process and technology for the revenue assurance department. In particular, management can identify ways to adjust and adapt the process to particular Revenue Streams without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level. The people have the right skill set to execute daily operations and have subject matter expertise. * Optimizing: At this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements. A risk based strategy is in place to evaluate the coverage of Revenue Assurance at specific intervals of time. Controls reach a maturity where Revenue Assurance only acts as an improvement agency for other process areas including product development, product deployment, customer retention, billing, collections, dunning etc. At this stage the RA processes are concerned with addressing statistical common causes of process variation and changing the process to improve process performance. RA Process Categories The Revenue Assurance processes in many ways can be regarded as an auditing process. The objective is to ensure that policies of the organization are well implemented and that no or minimal revenue leakage is occurring. The RA processes have the capability to cover all departments and service lines in a telecommunications organization. There are many ways in which RA processes can be classified, however in view of an audit function; the RA processes can be categorized into Detective, Corrective and Preventive activities, controls or processes. Let's understand the difference with the help of an example. Supposing the objective is to ensure trunk groups correctly entered in the MSCs. The detective control would be to monitor Trunk Groups appearing in CDRs are harmonized with the master list and any deviations are reported. The corrective control would be to initiative a process and confirm with the Network / Wholesale team of all deviations found. The preventive control would be to set up a process with the Network / Wholesale team where all new trunk groups are first informed to the RA, Mediation, Wholesale and other essential departments and then made live on the Network. =Detective Processes= Revenue Assurance Detection is the process of spotting a change in value of a dimension relative to its movement from System A to System B or within a given systems itself. The change in the value is relative to a dimension is question. Detection in RA can be achieved by both manual and automated means. Typical detection activities include monitoring, summarization, investigation and auditing. * Monitoring: Typically monitoring activities in Revenue Assurance refers to observing data, system or a process for any changes which may occur over a period of time. With the use of automated tools one can typically achieve constant monitoring which can notify the user or administrator (via email, SMS or other alarms) in case of any changes. The various processes which typically are monitored by a Revenue Assurance department include daily network usage, profile and configuration changes, mediation, rating, billing, settlement, roaming, collections and dunning related processes. * Summarization: When dealing with large volumes of information like network usage, it may not be practical to go through CDR by CDR and compare the same between 2 systems. In such cases summarization will help in quickly examining and finding out the preliminary problems areas. For example, one could first summarize information on the basis of few dimensions like events ( voice, sms, data), customer type (postpaid, prepaid, in roamer, out roamer), operator (self, local, national, international) etc. and compare the measures like count and duration of these dimensions between 2 systems. Such rapid assessments help in identifying the problem areas or dimensions quickly and a further detailed investigation can be carried out for those dimensions identified. Summarization greatly reduces the manual effort in identifying problem areas within a large data stream. * Auditing: A revenue assurance audit is a set of activities carried out to ensure that the organization is taking necessary steps to remain compliant to the evolving changes of organizational policies, regulations and market conditions. Every Revenue Assurance audit has a list of specific objectives which may come from management, regulations or industry standards. The actual tasks of the audit can differ based on the information, system or departmental processes being audited. Some sample RA audit objectives could be like ensuring billing accuracy up to 0.01%, no configuration variances on the Network, rating & invoicing process assurance etc. Each RA audit can span into different departments, each with its own specialized technical requirements. * Investigation: Investigation is the act of detecting something new, or something \\"old\\" that had been unknown. Investigation leads to discovery which is the observation of new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered. An RA investigation is a series of processes or procedures carried out to identify the Root Cause of an anomaly. This is also known as Root Causes Analysis (RCA) procedures or activities. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving that tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems that cause operating events. An investigation would try to identify and correct the root causes of events, as opposed to simply addressing their symptoms. By focusing on correction of root causes, revenue assurance problem recurrence can be prevented. =Corrective Processes= Correction is the set of activities and processes related around getting the process structures correct in order to minimize the changes identified as per the detection techniques. Correction itself is the act or method of correcting a discrepancy. Typically some information, configuration, amount or quantity needs to be added, edited or removed from a system, process or procedure in order to correct the anomaly. In Revenue Assurance activities, the process of correction of a root cause could involve correction of information, processes, technology or people. * Information Correction: This refers to the process of correcting or updating a value for a configuration element or a reference table. This is typically the result of a missing data set in a particular given table or system file. For example, a particular number series may be missing in the Switch and hence not getting connected or updating a missing tariff plan in rating engine leading to unrated CDRs etc. * Process Correction: Process correction refers to the modification of an activity by adding, modifying or removing an activity step which will prevent a miss-configuration or revenue leakage in the process. Typically process correction is required to have a pro-active revenue assurance step to provide better governance across the operations. For example, the pre-bill verification process may be required to be modified when a new service line or product is introduced into the market. The new service line may be required to be included within the pre-bill process. * People Correction: People correction is required when skills of the resources are in question. Revenue Assurance is a niche business process with limited people present with the right amount of Telecom Network, Mediation, Billing, IT and Business related experience. This leads to many Revenue Assurance teams with inexperienced people on operational departments. Owing to this, most Revenue Assurance operations end up being only re-active rather than moving into a proactive foundation. * Technology Correction: The very nature of the telecom business changes frequently. There are 2 aspects to Technology correction i) The technology on the Network side ii) Technologies in use by the RA department themselves. Telecom Network technologies evolve at a rapid pace. Sometimes technologies need to be balanced in the Network. For example, having multiple vendors on the Network side could lead to a requirement of having time synchronizer equipment installed just to have CDRs showing consistent time and date related information. Any current implementation of Revenue Assurance becomes obsolete rapidly. As technologies evolve revenue assurance tools and coverage of the tools also need to evolve. This essentially means technology corrections need to be performed either on the hardware side or on the tool / application side. Technology corrections are rare and need to be performed with due diligence as technology corrections can be very expensive to an organization. =Preventive Processes= Prevention is the process of performing an activity in order to avoid a high risk situation. It is essentially an action carried out to de-risk a threat. For example, if there is risk that a tariff plan is not correctly implemented, then the preventive action could be to simulate calls on test SIMs on the new tariff plans prior to launch and confirm the tariffs coming in the test CDRs against the marketing or advertising department rates. Preventive activities lead to effective risk management around Revenue Assurance. * Synchronization - A set of activities which ensure that 2 data sets are synchronized over a period of time. For example, a set of Revenue Assurance activities would ensure that all prepaid customers on the CRM systems are represented in the IN - SDP (Intelligent Network) and vice versa. Similarly all trunk groups between the whole sale departments are in sync with the trunk groups mentioned in the MSCs. Another example could be to ensure all B number tables between the MSCs are same. * Integrity Checks - These are individual activities carried out to ensure the integrity of the system or process. This is an effective check in gaining insight into an individual process and to assess whether it has anything in their immediate background that may be a cause for concern. For example, performing a sample based credit check for postpaid customers prior to generation of a bill. Another example could be subscriber checks with sanction lists watch lists for involvement in/association with fraud, money laundering & related illegal activities. * Pre Process Checks - Any checks performed on the input parameters of a process to ensure that the right data is fed into the process. Pre Process checks are necessary for complex processes like rating and billing which involve multiple sub processes and consume a lot of time for each run. Some sample preprocess checks could include validation of CDR sequence number before rating, file count confirmation before rating, subscriber pre check before billing, duplicate CDR check, report all postpaid customers that do not have the correct bill cycle etc. * Post Process Checks - Post process checks are required to verify the reliability on the outputs of a given process. Some processes of Revenue Assurance can produce multiple co-related outputs which need to be verified before being released to the consumer either internally or externally. Some examples of post process checks are formats checking on the target outputs like TAP 3 files, cross reference subscribers on the bill cycle with pre bill list, numbers terminated directly on OSS systems and not via CRM / BSS systems etc. Tool for Revenue Assurance Since Revenue Assurance is a very niche area in the telecommunications environment, there are some specific products and solutions supporting this subject. There are various vendors in the market which address either the complete suite of Revenue Assurance requirements or specialize in the specific domains. This section describes the basic features of a generic Revenue Assurance tool. One must keep in mind that software RA solutions can only help in pointing toward the error locations or problem areas. When one addresses the question of developing an RA solution they need to consider the magnitude, scope and capacity of the systems available along with the intellect, skills, and the number of people accessible. Finally it is the people, their skills and knowledge that make a complete RA solution. An organization should be careful when automating revenue assurance as it may end up with an expensive and inflexible solution which no one can manage effectively. There are a variety of specialized RA products which have different characteristics including probing, RA add on modules on respective OSS / BSS elements. However the most common tool adopted by most Telecommunication companies is one which can simulate the natural process of the CDR flow from Network generation to Invoicing. Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) of such a Revenue Assurance product. =Extract, Transform and Load= Telecommunications is an environment where there are many heterogeneous systems creating a multitude of data. Typically a single day‚Äôs information runs into many Giga Bytes or in some cases Tera Bytes also. This creates a need to have very proficient and rigorous extraction, transformation and loading tool for a Revenue Assurance application. Some of the common features of this tool are: *It should be able to import data in all common formats of data (ASCII, ASN, BCD, Binary etc.) * It should be able import data directly from common databases * It should have the ability to receive data feeds from various data sources of the Network, Operational and Business support systems * It should have an extensive audit log to track files and records status - received, processing, duplicate, loading, error etc. * The solution must provide an integrated environment to perform data integrity checks * It should be configurable using a user friendly GUI. * It should provide the ability to normalize, enrich and transform business rules as applicable into a data model * It should be able to look up large tables or files for reference information * It should enable the creation of new data fields by manipulating and calculating values based on other fields * It should provide the capability to monitor the progress and success of the whole ETL process from start to end * It should handle unexpected errors and continue processing and maintain the appropriate audit logs * It should support full automation of the ETL procedure from file pick up to record entry in the DB or file system. * It should have the ability to store historical summary and detail information for a period of time configurable by the user * It should be able to summarize information on the fly based on configurable dimensions * It should have the ability to configure ETL level alarms and thresholds on data and notify relevant users of any exceptions * The solution must be highly scalable so that the data processing platform can be sized to accommodate current and projected, with business growth, traffic volumes & audit points. =Reconciliations= One of the primary focus areas of a Revenue Assurance tool is to compare CDRs or XDRs from 2 different sources and checking if all the records from the first system have transferred properly to the second system keeping the appropriate business rules in consideration. This is achieved via comparative analysis of the records between the 2 systems either at the details record level or summary level by evaluating the common dimensions between the 2 data sets. Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) which a Revenue Assurance Reconciliation side of the product should provide. * It should have a graphical user interface to enable the RA analysts to create/update reconciliation and business rules * It should support various reconciliation and controls rules types e.g. missing records, unmatched records, problems in source file (duplicates, invalid values) * It should be able to filter the data prior to the rule executing to ensure efficient system operation * It should be able to set effective start and end date from which a newer business rule will be applied and valid for. * It should be to define rules using a naturalized user friendly language or a ‚Äúdrag and drop‚Äù GUI. * It should be able to associate monetary values with discrepancies identified based on predefined business rules * It should support the creation of a hierarchy of rules, when the results of a rule can become a source for further rules definition. =Analysis and KPIs= Once all the information has been received into the Revenue Assurance systems it time to crunch numbers and generate reports. The critical part is the analytical capabilities of the tool. The tool needs to have the ability to make sense of the problems in the vast set of data that it has gathered. This can only be done by a high performance analytical engine which should be capable of the following activities (non exhaustive): * It should have the capability to create measures based on the output of selected reconciliation and control rules and/or other user-definable criteria e.g. Customer Account Number, Product Code * This tool should be able to create alerts based on the application of thresholds to measures and dynamically change the thresholds based on business logic * It should be able to create KPIs based on various measures (such as count, sum, average, etc..) and multiple dimensions. * It should be able to showcase trends based on KPI values over the period of time and raise alarms when thresholds are crossed (for example alarms could be raised on a) Zero duration CDRs; b) Short duration calls; c) Long duration calls; d)Duration discrepancies; e) Invalid structure code/call types etc.) * It should be able to forecast information based on past records and raise alarms or reports * Users should be able to set thresholds of KPIs on the total value as well as on the value per specified dimension, e.g. the system should be able to alert on the situations when the threshold per a specific attribute is violated. * It should be able to categorize alerts and alarms based on priorities (e.g. critical, major, minor) * It should enable users to create new, and update and delete existing, KPIs and measures at any time through a simple graphical user interface. This should include full KPIs definition ‚Äì calculation, dimensions, thresholds, calculation frequency. * The solution must have the ability to support detection, investigation, validation and correction of discrepancies resulting from audit comparisons * It should be able to co-relate gaps in the reconciliations with missing profile information or missing reference information or other system errors and prepare a consolidated report. =Dash boarding= A Revenue Assurance dashboard is an easy to read, often single page, real-time user interface, showing a graphical presentation of the current status (snapshot) and historical trends of an organization‚Äôs Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to enable instantaneous and informed decisions to be made at a glance. For example, a prepaid dashboard may show KPIs related to prepaid CDRs reconciliation, prepaid user profile reconciliation, balance reconciliations and voucher reconciliations carried out in real time or near real time. * It should be able to provide a fully personalized dashboard screen to present concise summary and/or detailed information * It should be composed of ‚Äòbuilding blocks‚Äô or ‚Äòsections‚Äô, each containing valuable information for the user e.g. summary of all currently defined dimensions & measures * It should allow different building blocks to display the information of different types (e.g. grid tables, trend graphs, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, gauges, URLs, Maps etc..). * It should enable each block or section to be linked on a functional level e.g. once a user selected a specific gauge, for example, in one building block, a specific relevant pre-defined table or graph in other building block(s), is being refreshed accordingly, to reflect the selection of the user * It should provide information on each source on the dashboard with drill down capabilities to investigate detailed information related to the building block whether presented with textual of graphical means * It should provide a designer module with full flexibility in defining data sources based on any information type stored in the RA database as well as the ability to use external information sources * It should enable users to search on a predefined set of fields within the source data for records using a complex combination of logical operators e.g. ‚Äú=‚Äù, ‚Äù<‚Äù, ‚Äù>‚Äù, including wildcards * It should provide drill down capabilities from the list of records resultant from a search into specific record details. =Case Management= A case management capability in Revenue Assurance should be able to provide a 360 degree view of a given case. The tool should be able to track and resolve the identified discrepancies. The tool should handle each ‚Äúcase‚Äù in the system from the point where the system detected it, and manage follow up through the correction and reclamation processes, until the case is resolved. Based on a discrepancy in one given area, It should be able connect relevant information from various sources. For example, if a CDRs reconciliation has a problem, the case tool should be able to co-relate with respective user profiles, non-usage information, credits risks, network configurations etc. The case management component may have some of the following non exhaustive capabilities: * Ability to create a unique case identification reference for each discrepancy (or group of discrepancies) where user-defined criteria are met * It should enable users to manage and track cases by updating different case‚Äôs attributes such as: Status, Value, Priority, Assignee, Description, etc. * The user should have a full case history mechanism associated with cases and the case details. The history should be kept throughout the case life cycle including when the case is reopened by the system * It should be completely user- definable with content based on any data field available in the RA database by a simple drag and drop mechanism * It should enable users to include in case details all case related information and also any additional information (not necessarily case related) that can help in case analysis * It should enable users to create new fields in the case that will include either the automatically calculated value or will be opened for the user update. These fields should retain their value throughout the case life cycle * It should support case report output manipulation including sorting, multi-level grouping and filtering based on any one of the displayed attributes * It should have the ability to ‚Äúmulti-assign‚Äù cases (such as changing the assignee or closing a large number of cases) to one another * It should enable users to print the displayed discrepancies and export them to Excel, Word, Csv and PDF etc. files with restrict user access so that they can only see and update only the cases that are assigned to them External links * TM Forum's Revenue Assurance program allows members to use the Forum's publications and other communications, resulting in a mixture of constructive and thoughtful collaboration, and unresolved inconsistency and contradiction in one place.

It was released in September 1986. Plot Laurie Collins (Chase) is an attractive and highly successful stuntwoman in the motion picture industry. Her job on one film takes her to a small town not far from where her younger sister Bonnie Cusack (Michelle Newkirk) lives. Because of the close proximity, Laurie invites Bonnie to come visit her on the set, as she likely won't have time to visit her on her own. Bonnie readily agrees, and during a night of partying, she's picked up by a man in a bar who then tries to rape her at gunpoint. Having been taught some self-defense moves by her sister, Bonnie manages to overpower her attacker and kills him with his own gun. Though the case seems like a sure open-to-shut one of self-defense, Bonnie is shocked when she's charged with murder, as she learns that her attacker was the son of an influential local politician. Because Bonnie is from out of town, she's seen as the troublemaker and convicted on her charges. The judge sentencing her states that while she may have seemed justified by her actions, she cannot take the law into her own hands, and is sentenced to a term in the state prison. Bonnie learns the realities of prison life when she draws the sexual interest of Kay (Martin), an influential trustee inmate who soon shows herself to be capable of making life miserable for the youngster. One night Bonnie is touched inappropriately by Kay, and fights back. Bonnie's victory is short-lived, however, as Kay and her gang assault her and inject her with heroin before dumping her over a railing several floors up and to the floor below, resulting in her death. The next day, Laurie is called to claim and identify her sister's body. She sees on the report that her sister had died of a drug overdose, but when she sees her sister's dead and visibly bruised body in the morgue, Laurie concludes that a cover-up is being engineered by the authorities, and is determined to find out the truth. Laurie decides to get arrested and inside the prison herself by intentionally driving drunk. Her efforts succeed, and she gets the same sentencing judge her sister had. However, she is shocked when the judge gives her a suspended sentence because she is a first-time offender. Outraged, Laurie proceeds to insult the judge and attempts to attack him. She is dragged off to jail as the judge reinstates the suspension he had just revoked. It doesn't take long for Laurie to realize who's behind her sister's death once on the inside. However, Kay doesn't make the same sexual advances on her as she had her sister. Laurie finally gets Kay's attention by killing Bobo, the first inmate who's part of Kay's gang. Throughout all of this is a subplot involving Miss Dice (Roberta Collins), a firm but benevolent guard at the prison who is aware of the corrupt circumstances at the prison and in the judicial system, but has little power to do anything about it. When China, another one of Kay's henchwomen, is killed after Laurie attacks her at the prison pool, and then Star, who dies from a head injury after Laurie fights her in a prison shower, Dice takes an interest in the pattern and asks Kay what's going on. An anguished Kay, unaware of Laurie's relationship to Bonnie, claims not to know. Later on, two more of her people die at Laurie's hands, ultimately leaving Kay to face Laurie in a showdown of hand-to-hand combat. Kay is stunned to discover Laurie is the one responsible for the killings and even more so when she reveals that Bonnie was her sister. Kay tells Laurie that Bonnie's death was merely an accident and that she and her cohorts just roughed her up a little. Enraged, Laurie attacks Kay and proceeds to beat her into submission. While the older and heavier Kay is physically stronger and has considerable endurance for her age, she proves to be no match for Laurie's stuntwoman training. Laurie quickly gains the upper hand and proceeds to try and choke Kay to death. But then, Laurie suddenly has an attack of conscience and can't bring herself to kill her. She leaves Kay on the floor and walks away, but Kay recovers and proceeds to chase Laurie through the prison. Kay taunts her the entire time, daring her to stand and fight. This proves to be a mistake as Laurie finally stops running and once again, Kay is soundly thrashed. Just as Laurie defeats Kay, leaving her battered and bloody on the floor, Miss Dice appears, armed with a shotgun and orders them both to stand down. Laurie does so, but then Kay rises up off the floor with a wrench, posed to kill Laurie. Miss Dice quickly fires on Kay, gunning her down and saving Laurie. Laurie stares in shock at Kay's body and then back at Miss Dice, who looks back at her with sympathy. \\"Did it bring Bonnie back?\\" Miss Dice asks Laurie rhetorically, revealing she knew about what Kay and her people had done to her and the reason Laurie had gotten herself imprisoned. \\"You have the rest of your life to think about that.\\" The scene then cuts to the movie's final shot, showing Laurie being picked up from prison by her boyfriend and now living life as a free woman.

It was started as a breakaway faction of the Indian National Congress by former Haryana Chief Minister Bhajan Lal in 2007. The party forged an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the 2014 parliamentary elections. In April 2016, the party merged with Indian National Congress after nine years of separation.  History  The HJC party was founded by former Chief Minister of Haryana Bhajan Lal in 2007 after breaking away from Indian National Congress. It had a good hold in Hisar and Fatehabad district. In August 2009, the HJC joined hands with the Bahujan Samaj Party. The alliance was however called off by the BSP before the Vidhan Sabha elections. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the party won in Hisar where Lal emerged as winner. In the 2009 Vidhan Sabha elections, the party contested 87 out of the 90 total seats and won six. But five of its MLA's defected to Indian National Congress to support the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led government. In September 2013, Kuldeep Bishnoi declared his support for the BJP by backing the party's Prime Ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi. In 2014, the party aligned itself with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance to fight the general election in 2014. The HJC won the Hisar by-election. However, in the 2014 general election, HJC chief Bishnoi lost to Dushyant Chautala in the same parliamentary constituency. In August 2014, Bishnoi ended the alliance with the BJP and joined with the Venod Sharma-led Haryana Jan Chetna Party for the Assembly elections in Haryana. They won two seats. On 28 April 2016, the party merged with the Indian National Congress. Bishnoi and his wife were the only two MLAs of the party in Haryana assembly . The merger, took place in the presence of Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi and Vice President, Rahul Gandhi. However, Pawan Pandit and his supporters claimed that Haryana Janhit Congress Party will continue.

Its primary role is the reviewing of constitutionality under the Constitution. It also has administrative law functions such as ruling on competence disputes between governmental entities, giving final decisions on impeachments, and making judgments on the dissolution of political parties. It was established as a consequence of the third amendment to the Constitution of Indonesia, ratified by the People's Consultative Assembly on 9 November 2001. Between the adoption of the third Constitutional amendment and the establishment of the Constitutional Court, the duties of the Constitutional Court were carried out by the Supreme Court.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 241, 266 History Aerial view of the Constitutional Court building Between the adoption of the third Constitutional amendment and the establishment of the Constitutional Court, the duties of the Constitutional Court were carried out by the Supreme Court. In August 2003, the People's Consultative Assembly passed the Constitutional Court Act (Law No 24 of 2003) and the nine justices were appointed on 15 August. They were sworn in the following day. On 15 October 2003, the Supreme Court handed over authority, marking the start of the Constitutional Court's activities.Constitutional Court Website: History of The Constitution Court accessed 17 May 2009 The nine founding judges were: * Prof. Dr Jimly Asshiddiqie from the University of Indonesia * Dr Harjono from Airlangga University, Surabaya * I Dewa Gede Palguna from Udayana University, Denpasar * Dr Mohammad Laica Marzuki, a former judge of the Supreme Court * Maruarar Siahaan, former chairman of the High Court of Bengkulu * Soedarsono, former chairman of the Administrative High Court of Surabaya * Prof. Mukthie Fajar from Brawijaya University, Malang * Prof. H.A.S. Ahmad Natabaya from Sriwijaya University, Palembang * Lieutenant General (Retired) Roestandi. For the first time, a prominent scholar who was actively involved in the process of discussing amendments to the Indonesian constitution and with the introduction of the idea of the constitutional court, Prof. Dr Jimly Asshiddiqie was elected the first chief judge (2003‚Äì2006). With the successful completion of his first period on the court, he was then re-elected as the chief judge for a second term of 2006-2009. He resigned from the court after finishing his first five-year term of office. After the completion of this first five years period, the Constitutional Court has been considered one of the icon of Indonesian reform success story, together with the Anti Corruption Eradication Commission. The leadership of the court continued under Prof. Dr Mohammad Mahfud, a senior politician of National Awakening Party and member of parliament. The constitutional court has five jurisdictions: * Constitutional review of legislation (law) * Disputes about constitutional competence between state institutions * Disputes about electoral results * Dissolution of political parties * Impeachment of the President or Vice President of Indonesia With the establishment of the court, the aim is to safeguard democracy and the constitution according to the principle of rule of law, and the constitutional rights of the people and human rights can be protected accordingly. The high-profile performance of the constitutional court has made it a respected institution in Indonesia. During the general election and the first presidential election in 2004, the role taken by the constitutional court was widely appreciated by the people. Many landmark decisions have been made in the fields of politics, social, and economic law since its first year of establishment. The rehabilitation of the political rights of former members of communist party, the prohibition of retroactive law of anti-terrorism, the abolition of articles of subversive law and of defamation against presidential institution, etc., are among the landmark decisions which made it influential in guiding the new democracy of Indonesia. Public interest in the court has included discussion of the appointment processes of judges; the delineation of responsibilities between the Constitutional Court and other parts of the legal system; and overall approach that the Court has taken to the issues that it has considered.Prodita Sabarini and Ina Parlina, 'Constitutional Court: Independence of the last resort', The Jakarta Post, 3 May 2013. In mid-2011 the Indonesian parliament approved certain changes to the 2003 Constitutional Court Law that established the Constitutional Court.'Constitutional Court's power to be limited ', The Jakarta Globe, 15 June 2011. Dicky Christanto, 'House passes amendments to Constitutional Court law', The Jakarta Post, 22 June 2011 The revisions approved include changes to the arrangements for the Court's ethics council, a strengthening of the qualifications and experience required for the appointment of justices, a reduction in the term of the Court's chair and deputy chair (to two-and-a-half years, down from three years), and raising the mandatory retirement age for justices from 67 years to 70 years. The proposal to change the arrangements for the membership of the Court's ethics council was a controversial issue with the first chief judge of the court, Jimly Asshiddiqie, describing the planned changes as \\"frivolous.\\" In October 2013, in a move designed to improve the standards of appointment of justices to the Court following the arrest of the then-chief justice Akil Mochtar, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono issued a regulation-in-lieu-of-law (known as a Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-undang or Perppu). The Perppu set out new arrangements relating to the processes of selection of justices. Under the proposed arrangements, a Constitutional Court justice is not to have had links to a political party for at least seven years and would have to undergo screening by an independent selection panel. In addition, a permanent ethics committee was to be established to monitor the performance of the Court. On 19 December 2013 the Indonesian parliament endorsed the Perppu.Haeril Halim and Ina Parlina, 'House endorses SBY's MK reform plan', The Jakarta Post, 20 December 2013. Powers The court has the same legal standing as the Supreme Court. Its powers, set out in article 24C of the Constitution, include the final say in reviewing laws concerning the Constitution, disputes over the authority of state institutions, the dissolution of political parties and disputes over election results. It also is obliged to rule on any attempt to impeach the president. Its jurisdiction on the electoral disputes Jimly Asshiddiqie, The Constitutional Law of Indonesia: A Comprehensive Overview, Thompson Sweet & Maxwell Asia (2009). was first limited to the five-yearly general elections (such as the 2004 and 2009 general elections). However, since 2009 the definition of general election has been broadened and includes the election of governors and regency heads (bupati). To date, of the five jurisdictions of the court, most cases handled have centred around issues of judicial review, disputed electoral results, and disputes between state institutions. The Supreme Court continues to perform an informal judicial review function. A major problem for the court, like other parts of the legal system in Indonesia, is enforcement of decisions. The ability of the court system in Indonesia to have decisions enforced is sometimes quite weak and in recent years across Indonesia local officials have, in some cases, refused to abide by important decisions of the Constitutional Court.See International Crisis Group, Indonesia: Defying the State , Update Briefing, Asia Briefing No 138, 30 August 2012.

He was one of the 24 Founding Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science and had a significant influence on the structure of higher education in Australia as chairman of the Australian Universities Commission from 1959 until 1966. He was Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne from 1945 to 1959, and Dean of the Faculty of Military Studies and Professor of Physics at the University of New South Wales at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra from 1967 to 1970. He was the Defence Scientific Adviser and chairman of the Defence Research and Development Policy Committee from 1948 to 1968, and a member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission from 1958 to 1968. In this role he was an official observer at several British nuclear weapons tests in Australia. Early life Leslie Harold Martin was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray on 21 December 1900, to Henry Richard Martin, a railway worker, and his wife Esther (Ettie) Emily, n√©e Tutty. He attended Flemington State School and won a Junior State Scholarship to Melbourne High School for his final years of secondary schooling in 1917 and 1918. His mathematics teacher, Miss Julia Flynn, encouraged him, and he won a Victorian Education Department Senior Government Scholarship in 1918. He entered the University of Melbourne on the scholarship in 1919, to study for a Bachelor of Science for Education, with the intention of becoming a maths teacher. In 1921, in his final year, he came top of his year with first class honours in Natural Philosophy (physics) and was awarded the Dixson Scholarship in Natural Philosophy. In 1922, he completed his Master of Science degree, writing his master's thesis on \\"The emission of X Rays\\" under the supervision of Professor T. H. Laby. He was awarded first class honours and both the Dixson and Kernot Scholarships. Martin was awarded the Fred Knight Research Scholarship in 1923, which allowed him to continue his research with Laby. He earned extra money as a demonstrator in the Department of Natural Philosophy, and he lectured in the evenings at the Working Men's College. Laby nominated him for an 1851 Research Fellowship and a free trip to England to study physics under Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory. Before departing, he married Gladys Maude Elaine Bull, a Bachelor of Music student at the University of Melbourne, at St James's Church of England in Ivanhoe on 13 February 1923. She did not complete her studies, but instead accompanied him to England, sailing on the SS Berrima. They had two sons; the first, Leon Henry Martin, born in Cambridge on 25 April 1924. When Gladys became pregnant again, she decided to return to Australia to be with her parents. Their second son, Raymond Leslie Martin, was born on 3 February 1926. Leon died on the return voyage to England on the SS Benalla in July 1926. Academic career Martin enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, and continued his research into X-rays under Rutherford's supervision. He completed his PhD in 1926. The results of this work were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, and the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. He was awarded an International Research Fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation, allowing him to stay on into 1927. He later recalled that: Martin applied for a position as a lecturer at the University of Melbourne in January 1927. He was successful, and returned to Australia in August 1927. His corner of the Cavendish Laboratory was taken over by Ernest Walton. Martin continued his research into X-rays, working with Laby, J. C. Bower and F. F. H. Eggleston. He won the David Syme Research Prize in 1934, for his investigation of the Auger effect, the emission of electrons after ionisation by X-rays. Work with the chemical element xenon gave important confirmation of Paul Dirac's quantum field theory. In 1937 he became an Associate Professor in Natural Philosophy, and second-in-charge of the Natural Philosophy Department. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Martin commenced projects at the request of the Australian Defence Forces, investigating a proximity fuse for the Australian Army and an acoustic communications system for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) that would allow an instructor and trainee pilot to converse with each other. He led a team that built a prototype Height and Range Finder No. 3, Mark IV, for the Army, but the Army cancelled the order in August 1941 when the prototype was nearly complete. In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio Direction Finder. He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a magnetron, producing a working prototype on 23 May 1942. He then went on to build an original magnetron that generated 25 centimetre microwave radiation. These magnetrons were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne. On 1 January 1945 he became Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a position he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school at a time when Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and most research students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947‚Äì48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV betatron was converted an 18 MeV electron synchrotron in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to scrounge funding and components from various sources. Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne. Other work The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research created the Atomic Physics Section in 1947 led by Martin. In 1948 he became a member of the Interim Council of the Australian National University. He was president of the Australian Branch of the Institute of Physics in 1952 and 1953. From 1953 to 1963 he was a Trustee of the Science Museum of Victoria and its chairman in 1962 and 1963. He became a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1954 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1957. For his work in education and defence he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 Birthday Honours, and he was knighted to honour his outstanding contributions to science in the 1957 New Year Honours. He was a Pro-Vice-Chancellor for the University of Melbourne in 1957. Some of his many other posts included being the Defence Scientific Adviser and chairman of the Defence Research and Development Policy Committee from 1948 to 1968. He was present at the British Operation Hurricane nuclear test in the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Western Australia in October 1952, and then for Operation Totem tests at Emu Field in South Australia in October 1953. When the British government established the Maralinga Test Range in 1953, the Australian government created the Maralinga Safety Committee, which became the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee, with Martin as its chairman. As such he was responsible for safety of the Operation Mosaic tests at Monte Bello in May and June 1956, and Operation Buffalo tests at Maralinga in September and October 1956, after which he handed over the chairmanship to Ernest Titterton. An advocate for the peaceful use atomic energy, Martin became a member of the Industrial Atomic Energy Policy Committee in 1949, and a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in 1953. In 1958 he was an Australian delegate to the United Nations conference on Atoms for Peace in Vienna. That year, he was appointed a member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, and was its deputy chairman when he retired in 1968. Martin was the full-time chairman of the Australian Universities Commission from August 1959 until he retired in 1966. In this time he oversaw a rapid expansion of Australian higher education, including the commencement of five new universities. In 1961 he became chairman of the Committee on the Future Development of Tertiary Education in Australia, a position he held until 1965. The Committee‚Äôs advice led to a formalised \\"binary divide\\" between the universities, as research and teaching institutions, and other higher education teaching institutions, mostly colleges of advanced education. The links between his academic activities and his defence activities led him to work for the establishment of the RAAF College at Point Cook as an affiliated college of the University of Melbourne in 1961. In 1967 he became the chairman of the government's Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee that began planning for the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA). During this year he also became Professor of Physics and the first Dean of the Faculty of Military Studies for the University of New South Wales, at the Royal Military College, Duntroon until he retired in 1971. Retirement Martin retired in March 1971, stepping down as a director of IBM Australia Limited and as the chairman of the editorial council of Pergamon Press. He lived in Canberra for a while, but moved back to Melbourne to be near his four grandchildren. He suffered a stroke in 1979, but recovered. He died suddenly in Camberwell on 1 February 1983, and his remains were cremated. He was survived by his wife and son Raymond. LH Martin Institute The University of Melbourne formed the LH Martin Institute on 30 August 2007. The Institute is interdisciplinary and has as its key objectives: * to train the next generation of leaders of Australia‚Äôs tertiary education in the strategic management of their institutions; * to provide a forum in which public policy makers, public and private sector institutions and national and international experts can explore, assess and anticipate the changing national and international environment in which tertiary education operates; and * to support its educational programs with scholarship and research. Sir Leslie Martin Prize In 1971 Duntroon established the Sir Leslie Martin Prize which has been awarded every year until 1985, and from then at ADFA since 1986. The prize is awarded for \\"distinguished performance by a First Year Officer Cadet in First Year Physics\\" from all streams, that is, all Physics, Engineering and Arts students who take Physics I.

His work was recognized in 1967 with the Premio Nacional de Artes and was a founding member of the Academia de Artes. Life Monumento a la Madre (Monumento to Mothers) in Sullivan Park, Mexico City Luis Ortiz Monasterio (full name Luis Ortiz Monasterio del Campillo) was born in Mexico City, losing his father the year he was born. In 1920, he spent a year at a teacher‚Äôs training course at the Escuela Normal para Maestros while studying drawing at night at the Academy of San Carlos. He later registered as a matriculated student, specializing in engraving, drawing and sculpture. Because of the family‚Äôs economic situation, he went to Los Angeles, where he worked and studied, coming into contact with the works of Auguste Rodin, Br√¢ncu»ôi and Wilhelm Lehmbruck. In 1927, he participated in a workshop at the Escuela Libre de Escultura y Talla Directa founded by Guillermo Ruiz at the San Ildefonso College, which promoted sculpting Mexican themes and values into native rock. For the next several years, he lived in the United States and Mexico, before permanently settling in Mexico City. In addition to art, he was an author of books and monographs, which generally contained philosophic and poetic references. Ortiz Monasterio retired from his sculpting career in 1989, dying a year later at the age of 83 in Mexico City from multiple natural causes. His body was cremated at the Pante√≥n de Dolores in Mexico City. Career Nezahualcoyotl Fountain in Chapultepec Park With a career that spanned over sixty years, Ortiz Monasterio is one of the main figures of Mexican sculpture in the 20th century. He is one of few to be active during the dominance of the Mexican muralism movement and one of fewer of the century to be remembered. The artist began his career in 1927 as a drawing teacher at the Escuela de Maestros Contructores of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica, after returned from studies in the United States. He went on to be a long-time teacher of the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas ENAP from 1939 to 1962 and taught at La Esmeralda as well. In 1928, Ortiz Monasterio returned to Los Angeles to sculpt full-time, having his first individual exhibition at the Book Shop Gallery and a later one at Gump‚Äôs Art Gallery in San Francisco. In the 1930s he created a number of sculptures which made him known for their originality of form and texture:El soldado herido (1932), La Victoria (1935), El nacimiento de Apolo (1936) and La Venus (1937) . He had two shows at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano an at UNAM in 1935 and 1936. In 1946 he participated in the International Sculpture Exhibition at the Philadelphia Art Museum, which acquired a work called Cabeza de mujer (1945). Another piece was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His success in United States brought him back to Mexico, receiving commissions for monumental works. The first of these was El llamado de al revoluci√≥n in stone, carved between 1932 and 1934. The next in a similar technique, was El esclavo, which has since been lost. Later works include the reliefs for the Benem√©rita Escuela Nacional de Maestros, the Monumento a los defensores de la ciudad de Puebla (1943), the Monumento a la Madre in Parque Sullivan (1948) the Nezahualcoyotl Fountain in Chapultepec Park, the p√≥rtico for the open air theater of the Plaza C√≠vica of the Unidad Independencia house complex and the Tigres y √Åguilas sculpture at the Centro Medico Nacional of IMSS(1963). He also created sculptures for cities such as Xalapa and Acapulco. The first award for his work was a prize in sculpture from the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica in 1946. In 1967 he received the Premio Nacional de Artes in sculpture. In 1968 he was a founding member of the Academia de Artes and later received a diploma and medal for his teaching career at ENAP. Posthumous tributes include one in 1992 at the OMR Gallery, and a retrospective in 2011 at the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo. However, since his career, about fifteen percent of his work is missing or destroyed and much of the rest is in deteriorated condition, especially the monumental works. Artistry Ortiz Monasterio is of the generation of Mexican sculptors which includes Oliverio Mart√≠nez, Francisco Mar√≠n, Juan Cruz Reyes, Federico Cant√∫,Federico Canessi and Carlos Bracho, which adopted elements of Art Deco and Cubism, using figures from the working class and indigenous populations. His artistic style is characterized by the use of classical and geometric elements, along with pre Hispanic influence. There is also influence from an artist named Ivan Mestrock, a Yugoslav artist whose works he saw in art magazines from Europe. In his works, he applied concepts from numerology and Pythagorism along with metaphysical concepts from the Aztec and Mayan cultures. His work can be divided into two types. The first are monumental public works with historical themes, such as the Nezahualcoyotl Fountain in Chapultepec (1956) and the Plaza C√≠vica de la Unidad Indepedencia (1962). His smaller works often consists of sensual human forms as well as those with a mechanical feel.

Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest in their objects and collections. Educational exhibition on \\"Materials & Meanings\\" at the Dallas Museum of Art. In a seminal report called Excellence and Equity published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, \\"...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education‚Äîa term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue\\". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums. HistoryNon-formal education= In his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during John F. Kennedy's administration, in 1968, Philip H. Coombs emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world‚Äôs population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country.Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2001). ¬´La necesidad de planificaci√≥n y evaluaci√≥n educativas en la educaci√≥n no formal. Algunas propuestas¬ª. Educaci√≥ i Cultura: 14, 87-89. To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2011 [2004]). ¬´1¬ª. Pedagog√≠a muse√≠stica. Nuevas perspectivas y tendencias actuales. Ariel. p. 15. . In a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as \\"...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system‚Äîwhether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity‚Äîthat is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective\\".Coombs, Phillips H. and H. Ahmed. New Paths To Learning: For Rural Children and Youth (en ingl√©s). New York, N.Y.: International Council for Educational Development Publications. p. 11. Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation. Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining for the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education. =Beginnings in art museums of the United States= At the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.Burnham, Rika and, Elliot Kai-Kee (2011). ¬´2¬ª.

It seeks to overcome problems that institutional investors have encountered in applying modern portfolio theory in practice. The model starts with an asset allocation based on the equilibrium assumption (assets will perform in the future as they have in the past) and then modifies that allocation by taking into account the opinion of the investor regarding future asset performance. Background Asset allocation is the decision faced by an investor who must choose how to allocate their portfolio across a number of asset classes. For example, a globally invested pension fund must choose how much to allocate to each major country or region. In principle Modern Portfolio Theory (the mean-variance approach of Markowitz) offers a solution to this problem once the expected returns and covariances of the assets are known. While Modern Portfolio Theory is an important theoretical advance, its application has universally encountered a problem: although the covariances of a few assets can be adequately estimated, it is difficult to come up with reasonable estimates of expected returns. Black‚ÄìLitterman overcame this problem by not requiring the user to input estimates of expected return; instead it assumes that the initial expected returns are whatever is required so that the equilibrium asset allocation is equal to what we observe in the markets. The user is only required to state how his assumptions about expected returns differ from the markets and to state his degree of confidence in the alternative assumptions. From this, the Black‚ÄìLitterman method computes the desired (mean-variance efficient) asset allocation. In general, when there are portfolio constraints - for example, when short sales are not allowed - the easiest way to find the optimal portfolio is to use the Black‚ÄìLitterman model to generate the expected returns for the assets, and then use a mean-variance optimizer to solve the constrained optimization problem.

While this part of the country had long been relatively peaceful compared to the all-out war zones of the south and east, tensions would flare up again in 2008 when the German soldiers deployed to the area came under attack more often, leading to the deaths of the several soldiers.RP.online (archived) Previously hindered by national caveats,\\"NATO at War: Understanding the Challenges of Caveats in Afghanistan\\", David P. Auerswald / Stephen M. Saideman, 2009 the deteroriating security situation prompted the German-led Regional Command North to launch a series of operations to take on the rising insurgency. Concerted operations began after an insurgent attack on PRT Kunduz within minutes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's departure from a visit.Deutsche Welle Within two years, the German presence would be doubled and additional reinforcements from the American ISAF contingent were called in, including heavy German armoured vehicles and US aviation assets, allowing for a more aggressive approach towards the insurgency.  Initial situation  When German troops took over nominal control over Afghanistan's north in 2003, the area was counted among the safest in the whole country, with places such as Kunduz earning the nickname \\"Bad Kundus\\" (roughly: Kunduz resort and spa) among German troops due to the notable absence of greater threats to peace and security. This misjudgement was partially a result of the caveat-ridden German military's approach to keeping the peace in the area, reaching out not far enough to actually meet resistance. However, with an increasing toll from suicide and roadside bomb attacks it soon became obvious that NATO's dangerously restrained and considerably under-strength forces in the area‚Äîespecially from Germany and Hungary‚Äîwere not able to maintain public order in rural areas. Moreover, a Pashtun minority in several regional \\"pockets\\" began to gradually change allegiance and support opposition movements against both foreign troops and other Afghan ethnicities. These conditions would eventually facilitate the insurgency's arrival in the north and threaten a crucial line of communications between the northern border of Afghanistan and Kabul, the capital. Due to similar problems in Regional Command West's area of responsibility, other insurgent groups and bands of criminals were able to get a foothold in the far west of Regional Command North as well. Qari Bashir Haqqani, the Taliban commander for Kunduz province, had in 2008 already vowed to increase his men's efforts against the Germans. Reluctant to engage directly, the Taliban mainly relied on guerilla tactics, killing three Germans over the year and wounding more than thirty along with causing casualties among the mountain Afghan security forces. This trend continued until 2009MDR (hitherto German troops had only been involved in a handful of firefights with opposing forces). In mid-2009 though, the number of direct contacts had already exceeded the total of the prior seven years. A similar development struck Faryab province and the surrounding districts: having already taken action to rout the Taliban, the Norwegian forces of Provincial Reconstruction Team Meymaneh saw themselves increasingly threatened by insurgent activities. ISAF commander Stanley McChrystal expressed his concerns about Northern Afghanistan. He described Kunduz, Baghlan and the northwest of the country as places where security was deteriorating in a particularly worrying manner, requiring the concerted actions of all allies.Reuters With casualties rising, Berlin agreed to revise its contingent's rules of engagement. The German military immediately began joint operations with Afghan security forces in accordance with ISAF's \\"Afghan-face\\" strategyWashington Independent in April 2009, and continued to conduct its own operations to improve security as well as supporting other allies in their operations. Halfway through the year, three major hotspots of anti-government and anti-ISAF activity had been identified: Kunduz's Chardara district with the adjacent road to Baghlan province, Baghlan province itself, and the western Faryab province. Following the Kunduz airstrike against two captured fuel tankers in September 2009 which killed insurgents as well as scores of civilians who had gathered to steal fuel from a Taliban-captured fuel truck, the German government finally reclassified the Afghanistan deployment in February 2010 as an \\"armed conflict within the parameters of international law\\", allowing German forces to act without risk of prosecution under German law.Der Spiegel While the German contingent had previously relied on lightly armoured and -armed infantry mobility vehicles such as the Dingo and the Fennek armoured reconnaissance vehicle (along with unarmoured utility vehicles), heavy weapons were now brought to the area. While addressing troops in the wake of a deadly attack on April 15, 2010, then Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg announced his decision to deploy Marder infantry fighting vehicles and Pzh2000 self propelled artillery to Kunduz in order to better protect troops and \\"max\\" their \\"punch\\". The military would also go on to acquire new weapons and vehicles better suited for combat in the hot and rugged Afghan countryside. Around the same time, US forces were called into Northern Afghanistan to reinforce the German contingent and provide Regional Command North with direly needed aviation and air mobility assets. ISAF's headquarters in Kabul decided to upgrade its northern presence and placed a German Major-General in command.Die Zeit  Operations  Concerted operations began with numerous raids and \\"provocative patrols\\" into the Taliban heartland, already dubbed \\"Talibania\\" by German troops.Focus.tv Four insurgents and two ANA soldiers were killed in various engagements and more than 40 insurgents got captured, with large amounts of weapons and explosives seized. German troops tried to maintain a presence even in remote areas during these weeks and were frequently attacked in the face of an overall deteriorating situation in all RC-N: On April 17, 2010, a Norwegian officer was killed when his patrol struck a roadside bomb.Aftenposten On April 29, German troops made a concentrated advance into Chardara district and suffered 15 casualties when they were attacked by suicide bombers and came under heavy fire by an overwhelming insurgent force. A trooper of 2nd company, 292nd Light Infantry Battalion was killed in action, marking the first time since World War II that a German soldier would fall in combat. German troops were attacked regularly during the following weeks.Bild Another attempt to regain control over Chardara was initiated on May 7. By late noon, a large group of insurgents assaulted a German infantry detachment reconnoitering the district's borders. Responding reinforcements surrounded the attackers and battled them for more than a day in a fierce engagement which also involved allied close air support and Afghan forces, of whom one police officer was wounded in action. At least seven insurgents were killed, 14 more wounded and numerous captured. On the same day, troops of PRT Faizabad conducted an operation to detain notable leaders of the insurgency in Northern Afghanistan; A high-profile arrest was made when German special forces operatives arrested Abdul Razeq, the Taliban commander for Northeast Afghanistan. One KSK operative suffered minor wounds. Additionally reinforcements were deployed to PRT Kunduz, almost doubling the garrison there. The security situation had turned notably worse. All girl schools in Chardara had to be closed for fear of imminent terrorist attacks. Manpower shortages did not allow German forces to uphold a permanent deterrence against armed militias, crippling the long- term effect of their actions. However, German and Afghan troops increased their efforts to take on the Taliban in different operations of various character. On May 15, ANSF killed Qari Sidiqulla, a Taliban district commander for Imam Sahib, in Imam Sahib's Sharawan region. Three of his fighters were also killed. In the same week, the Taliban tried to assassinate Mohammad Omar, the Governor of Kunduz. He and his bodyguard were slightly wounded. On July 1, four ANSF personnel were killed in Chahardara. = Operation Sahda Ehlm = On June 4, German forces including the quick reaction element of Regional Command North undertook another concentrated advance into rebellious Chardara district after a patrol had been ambushed close to a bordering wetlands. German troops encountered resistance and killed at least ten militants in heavy fighting.Die Welt During the fighting, Master Sergeant Daniel Seibert, a squad leader with 2nd company, 212th mechanized infantry battalion and Master Sergeant Jan Hecht, a squad leader with 2nd Company, 391st Mechanized Infantry Battalion led a daunting counterattack to save the lives of a German recce party in distress and were later awarded Germany's highest military award. Later on, a German unit was ambushed at the same places as it tried to recover a vehicle disabled by hostile fire. Two Germans were wounded in the attack, while at least one attacker was killed and two were wounded. For having evacuated a critically wounded German while under hostile fire that day, Sergeant First Class Steffen Knoska, a squad leader with 2nd Company, 1st Air Assault Regiment would also be awarded for valor. Prolonged fighting continued between the Taliban and various coalition forces. Two Afghan National Army soldiers were killed, and two Afghan soldiers and a Belgian soldier wounded in action. Four American soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb on June 7. A local Afghan official was murdered by the Taliban in Shir Khan on June 17. Another heavy engagement took place on June 23 ‚Äì this time only a few kilometres off the outskirts of Kunduz ‚Äì when 2nd Company, 391st Mechanized Infantry Battalion and 1st Company, 263rd Airborne Battalion as well as Afghan troops clashed with insurgent forces. At least three Taliban were killed in action and three German soldiers were killed when their armored personnel carrier attempting to evade RPG fire slid down a bank, fell into an irrigation ditch and rolled over. Regular fighting and hostile attacks continued over the following days but resulted in few or no casualties among allied troops. PRT Kunduz and adjacent government facilities in Kunduz were now regularly attacked with mortars and unguided rockets. Potential disaster was only narrowly avoided when a 122 mm rocket hit the PRT's mess building, piercing a wall but failing to detonate. = Operation Oqab (Eagle) = \\\\- A German mechanized infantry soldier during the campaign's Operation Oqab, marking the first time ever the Marder IFV saw combat service. July's joint Afghan-German efforts led to more fierce confrontations from July 18 onward. For the first time in the war, the Germans would deploy infantry fighting vehicles and artillery, killing a large number of insurgents on July 19; in addition to the heavy weaponry's first use in earnest, American A-10 Warthogs flew several close air support sorties. On one occasion a Belgian-mentored Afghan unit was trapped and had to be relieved by the German mechanized infantry;Deutschlandradio at least 16 Taliban were killed, 12 wounded and 14 captured. Fighting erupted once more on July 20 when two Afghan civilians, mistaken for hostile individuals, were also among the killed.Hamburger Abendblatt The Taliban murdered approximately 20 civilians in two separate incidents as retaliation on July 22.Sina By the end of July, Chardara had almost been cleared of Taliban. Surroundings of Kunduz where fierce fighting took place almost every day The situation calmed down for about a week. Observers warned that the Taliban were not defeated and could return immediately to the disputed district, though. A rising number of hostile encounters in the first week of August confirmed their assumptions. One German soldier was shot in combat on August 7.Bundeswehr press release Twelve insurgents and four Afghan security forces personnel were killed during a skirmish on August 12. Only 24 hours later, 20 insurgents were killed trying to assault a coalition outpost in Aliabad. The Taliban also began to attack supplies en route to the PRT on August 16, opening fire on a civilian-manned fuel convoy. 2009's Presidential elections were expected to worsen the situation, however only a few attacks actually occurred while the turnout was in progress: Three police officers were killed and five kidnapped in Imam Sahib on August 19. Coalition forces killed 14 Taliban on August 26 and early August 27. Another seven Taliban and four foreign militants were killed by Afghan forces on August 28. Heavy engagements lit up in the first week of September. A tactical victory was scored when German forces managed to rout a Taliban party from a battlefield in Imam Sahib. Eleven insurgents were killed and four wounded in action, but so were four Germans. Eight armoured fighting vehicles were lost to hostile fire. = Kunduz airstrike = On September 4, a devastating nighttime air raid struck a riverbank only 7 kilometres to the southwest of Kunduz. Taliban militants had hijacked civilian supply trucks with gasoline on a nearby road. After an attempt to bring the heavy vehicles across the Kunduz river had failed, the insurgents sent for nearby villagers to come and help unload the fuel. The German command center was aware of the incident, readied a quick reaction force and sent for close air support. Unbeknownst to them a considerable number of civilians had mixed with the insurgents and militant supporters in order to come by a free gallon of fuel. Fearing a truck bomb attack could be imminent if the trucks came unstuck, a German commander ordered a pair of American F-15s to attack the scene with bombs. A later German investigation concluded the attack caused up to 142 deaths, including an unknown number of civilians. The attack, though justified by several officials, caused considerable uproar in Germany and led to the resignation of senior officers and the Minister of Labour Franz-Josef Jung in October 2009. The German officers who orchestrated the bombing were later acquitted of all charges. German courts denied civilian casualties any form of compensation on the grounds that the involved military personnel were led to believe by a double agent among the insurgent party that no civilians were present at the scene. Three German troopers were wounded in a vehicle-born suicide attack the following day.Bundeswehr press release A further week-long series of engagements resulted in eight more German WIAs, among them the first female German soldier to be wounded in action. KSK operatives launched another successful raid in early October and captured 15 Taliban during a surprise attack. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded during a Taliban attack on October 3. Six insurgents were detained by ISAF and ANSF forces on October 10 and more than 50 surrendered. One insurgent was killed when hostile forces attacked German soldiers during a humanitarian mission on October 20. A day later, two Taliban were killed and three ANSF officers wounded in Pul-e Alchhi. On November 2, seven insurgents were killed and eight arrested in an exchange of fire involving Afghan, German and Belgian troops. = Chardara battles of late 2009 = With the support of United States special forces and German troops,The Wall Street Journal a third offensive was launched in the Gor Tepa region and spearheaded by Afghan forces on November 5. Heavy combat lasting until November 11 resulted in the deaths of 133 insurgents (including Qari Bashir Haqqani) and the capture of 25 others.NVDN One US soldier was killed and one Afghan and one German each wounded in action; furthermore a pair of German CH-53GS medium transport helicopters came under prolonged hostile fire and had to return to their base due to damages. The year ended with almost daily hostile contacts for the German-American force.Bundeswehr press release Civilians were caught in the crossfire once more as the Taliban attacked the Mischa Meier Bridge (named after a German soldier who was killed in action there) which extends across the Kunduz river to the southwest of the city. Five Taliban and three locals guarding the bridge were killed in action; other attacks on the same day resulted in the deaths of ten insurgents in Imam Sahib and Khanabad as well as in the capture of six others. An Afghan-German- American patrol killed five insurgents on the following day. = Intensifying warfare in 2010: Operation Gala-e Gorg (Wolf Pack) = In late December it was decided that Chardara would be lost to the insurgency once more if the coalition failed to maintain a permanent presence there as had been normal in other parts of the country, to the situation of which Chardara drew close. For this reason, a fourth and final offensive was launched on December 14, the first time ISAF's new counter insurgency strategy \\"clear ‚Äì hold ‚Äì build\\" should be put to test in Regional Command North's area of responsibilities. A joint force of 300 Afghan light infantry and police units and 300 German mechanized infantry was concentrated near Mischa Meier Bridge, their objective being to enter the rebellious district and set up a forward operating base there. This show of force was intended to win local support for the Afghan government. Combat engineers along with troops of 4th Company, 391st Mechanized Infantry Battalion were attacked several times while rebuilding the partially destroyed bridge. Two Germans were wounded in action. Once the path into Chardara was secure, fierce fighting continued throughout the following days. A blow was dealt to the opposition forces by the killing of Taliban leader Mullah Ahsanullah on December 16.Xinhua In January 2010, the United States and Germany agreed to increase their efforts in Kunduz by raising troop and civilian numbers to 6,000. After the successful advance into Chardara in late December the next stage of the offensive was launched on January 28. 500 German soldiers from two infantry battalions and 120 Afghan troops advanced across country and set up numerous permanent checkpoints, road blocks and heavily fortified observation posts; by the end of January, the coalition's presence took on an air of permanence, with a strong forward operating base and a net of outposts. Trying to stop the Germans from further construction work, nine insurgents were killed in action. A very serious situation unfolded during a firefight on February 5 when a routed group of Taliban in the process of being chased-down by German light infantry hid in a crowd of villagers, leading not only to their deaths but also to civilian casualties. Four days later an Afghan night patrol mistook a German patrol for opposing forces and opened fire. US special forces killed one insurgent and captured two more while searching for a Taliban commander in the far east of Afghanistan.ISAF press release On February 17, six insurgents were killed in clashes with German troops and 25 insurgents surrendered on February 22. Several insurgents were eliminated during clashes in the first two weeks of March.Bundeswehr press release Again, close air support and mortars were used. One German soldier was wounded in action on March 5. Two Swedish officers were killed in action.Aftonbladet Engagements followed throughout the next weeks, and on March 24 a contracted helicopter carrying ISAF-troops was shot down by insurgents. The largest battle yet since the fall of Kunduz to anti-Taliban forces in 2001 took place on April 2, the year's Good Friday, in the form of an attack by 200 insurgents. A platoon of 2nd Company, 373rd Airborne Battalion was caught in the open after a roadside bomb struck their patrol in the village of Isa Khel; simultaneously, the troops manning a nearby base situated in an Afghan police station came under fire as well. During nine hours of intense fighting, 20 soldiers out of the 36 strong German platoon trapped in Isa Khel were killed or wounded in action. Six Afghan troops were also killed by German friendly fire.Bundeswehr press release Furthermore, coalition ground troops and responding US MEDEVAC helicopters belonging to the US Army's 158th Aviation Regiment sustained considerable combat damage in a hail of small arms fire. The American helicopters and the responding German forces saved the platoon from almost certain annihilation. The Battle of Isa Khel went down into German military history as the most bloody engagement German troops have been involved in since the end of World War II. During the months to follow 21 soldiers were awarded for exceptional bravery. Three Germans were awarded with the nation's highest award for valor; 14 Americans were awarded with the second-highest award.The Stars and Stripes News images of sandal-clad Taliban warriors rejoicing on the scarred wrecks of the most modern German military technology had a strong effect on the German public. The following weeks saw daily clashes that killed two US soldiers and three others killed by a roadside bomb on June 16.ABC News On June 27, four Norwegian troops were killed by a roadside bomb TV 2 Nyhetene in the course of a series of operations aimed at increasing coalition and government presence in Ghowrmach, another hotspot in the northern allies' area of responsibility. The mission of the Norwegian forces was to provide mentoring and fire support for Afghan security forces which were initially poorly trained and lacked strength, equipment and leadership. The Norwegian forces killed 150 insurgents during the second half of the year,VG Nett effectively putting a pressure upon insurgent militias in RC-Ns comprehensive security approach to regain control over the entire north of Afghanistan. = Operations Taohid I, II& III (Unity) = While coalition forces were gaining the upper hand in Kunduz and in Faryab, their commanders feared the recent victories were all but in vain if the insurgent presence in the adjacent Baghlan province was left to act at will. Later that month, a multi-national force launched a series of Operations dubbed Operation Taohid in order to drive insurgents out of the so-called Pashtun Corridor. On April 11, 2010 one American who was part of the Hungary-United States Operational Mentor and Liaison Team 9.3 was wounded in combat by an RPG while returning fire from his fighting position. Also one Afghan police officer was wounded in the back blast of an RPG being fired back at the Taliban. On April 15, four Germans were killed in action and five wounded when their armoured vehicle was hit by RPG fire during an ambush. At least 20 Taliban were also killed. Another 21 militants died until early May and 27 were captured. It was the first time that the Afghan military made use of their own aerial assets, rasing hopes about the survivability of the local security forces. A sweep through Dahana-i Gori immediately afterwards was supposed to prevent remaining insurgents from hiding in neighbouring provinces. At least nine Taliban were killed and 11 wounded.Xinhua In late April Two Americans were wounded in action by small arms, while retaking a captured police station on Main Supply Route Uranus. The third phase of concerted operations in Baghlan-i Jadid began in late June. It was planned to build a set of combat outposts and increase coalition presence in areas until then held by armed militants. International troops were also able to distribute humanitarian aid to the population of these areas. Several hostile encounters occurred during the following weeks. However, allied forces were not able to maintain permanent security along the line of communications between Kunduz and Pol-e Khomri initially. Two Hungarian Government of Hungary press release and a US soldier US Department of Defense press release were killed in several incidents. The international forces undertook another advance into the disputed area, the so-called \\"Highway Triangle\\" to the north of Pol-e Khomri between September and October 2010. The battle for Highway Triangle lasted for several days and included a large mechanised force as well as close air support. The liberated area around Shahabuddin and Aka-Khel was supposed to be secured by local pro-government militias. Their outpost was retaken by the Taliban only a few weeks later, though. The German TF Kunduz had to assault the outpost and retake it in close combat. Coalition forces used their gains to maintain a presence in Shahbuddin until the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. On October 7, 2010, one German soldier was killed and 14 wounded in a series of attacks;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung it was also in this outpost on February 18, 2011 that a Taliban sleeper in an Afghan uniform turned against German troops, killing three and wounding six.Bundeswehr press release Only a day afterwards the Taliban scored a major propagandistic victory by killing Mohammed Omar, governor of Kunduz province and the foreign forces main ‚Äì albeit unreliable ‚Äì ally in the north. = Operation Halmazag (Lightning) = From October 31 to November 4, 2010, German troops, with the support of American, Afghan and Belgian forces led Operation Halmazag, an offensive to establish a permanent ISAF presence around the village of Isa Khel and Quatliam, just 6 miles west of the main Coalition compound at Kunduz. Assisted by American close air support and suppressive fire from their PzH2000s, approximately 300 German paratroopers and further Afghan forces drove off the Taliban from the area on November 4, and had consolidated a credible coalition presence around Quatliam and Isa Khel by November 15. At least eight insurgents were killed in battle with the Germans and dozens captured while coalition forces sustained only minor wounds.  Post-Halmazag  In late 2010 it became soon clear that the coalition would end its offensive activities in Afghanistan no later than by the end of 2014. With five infantry battalions now at its disposal, RC-N proceeded to secure the gains scored thus far. Fierce fighting ‚Äì though less frequent in total due to the now-strong coalition presence ‚Äì continued throughout 2011, with the Talibans' focus of operations shifting towards Baghlan province for a time until it came to a near-halt in late 2011. While this was regarded by some observers as a clear indication of the German success in the region, the insurgents continued to show their strength from time to time; perhaps their most humiliating blow dealt to the Germans took place on May 28, 2011 when Major General Markus Kneip, NATO's highest-ranking officer in the northern part of Afghanistan, was seriously wounded in an attack. Two soldiers of Kneip's entourage and several Afghans were also killed that day. Kneip is the highest ranking WIA of the Afghanistan War. The heaviest roadside bombing ever recorded in RC-N struck a German combat patrol on June 2. The approximately quarter ton explosive device tore apart a Marder infantry fighting vehicle, killing one soldier and critically wounding five. This was the only loss of a Marder to hostile activity. Soon afterwards the last officially recognized full-scale Taliban assault on German forces took place at Shahabuddin. An insurgent force tried to take the German outpost there by surprise but was fought off with considerable losses not least due to the defending 231st Mountain Infantry Battalion's commander, Lieutenant colonel Jared Sembritzki. He was awarded with the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross on September 6. A member of the German special forces (KSK) was killed in action and another wounded on June 6, 2013, the first combat losses in that unit's history. The Afghan unit meant to operate alongside the Germans fled combat twice, raising serious concerns about the ability of the Afghans to stand their ground on their own.S√ºddeutsche Zeitung  R√©sum√©  Regional Command North was redesignated as TAAC North on July 1, 2014. The German forces had to retreat to the training of Afghan troops and self-defense duties ‚Äì with the Taliban set to retake Kunduz and undo the joint forces previous successes.CNN Indeed, the 2009‚Äì2011 period marked a U-turn in the rather pacifist military policy of Germany and also represented a crucial test for allied cooperation. The intensity of the fighting sparked a public debate in Germany whether German troops should even participate in a war. The only considerable support for the troops appeared in the form of a 2008 petition to restore a military award entirely reserved for valor; 22 soldiers were awarded with this Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. However, overall support for the military operation plunged down to an all-time low following the deadly September 2009 air strike,New Yorker prompting observers to believe that ongoing combat operations would affect the general elections in 2009 and 2013 respectively (the only party to explicitly speak out against the war, Die Linke, failed to make noteworthy gains in these elections, though). Others regarded the unexpected move as a reaction to sharp criticism Germany long faced for opting out a more offensive role in the Afghanistan war.The Times  See also  * War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) * International Security Assistance Force * German Armed Forces casualties in Afghanistan * Operation Harekate Yolo * Operation Karez * Operation Oqab  References  Main Source: Winfried Nachtwei report on Afghanistan Category:Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Category:Conflicts in 2009 Category:Conflicts in 2010 Category:Conflicts in 2011 Category:Conflicts in 2012 Category:Conflicts in 2013 Category:Conflicts in 2014 Category:2000s in Afghanistan Category:2010s in Afghanistan Category:Battles of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) Category:History of Faryab Province Category:History of Kunduz Province Category:History of Baghlan Province Category:Al-Qaeda Category:NATO operations in Afghanistan Category:Wars involving the Taliban Category:Military campaigns involving Germany Category:Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) involving Germany Category:Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) involving Norway Category:Military operations of the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) involving Belgium Category:2009 in Afghanistan Category:2010 in Afghanistan Category:2011 in Afghanistan Category:2012 in Afghanistan Category:2013 in Afghanistan Category:2014 in Afghanistan ","title":"Counterinsurgency in Northern Afghanistan"},{"id":"22833824","text":"200px Olivier Patru (1604 ‚Äì 16 January 1681) was a French lawyer and writer.

He promoted and defended Rational Christianity, and helped lead the agitation for the repeal of penal laws against Dissenters, canvassing support for a political union of the nation's Dissenters.  Life  William Russell was the eldest of three brothers, Thomas and George, who variously inherited the family's extensive trading interests. His great-grandfather, Thomas Russell had been a Birmingham ironmaster, whilst his grandfather, William had expanded into North America, acquiring iron deposits, furnaces and forges in Maryland and Virginia.Some correspondence of grandfather William Russell for the period 1725-1728 may be found in the British Library, Add. MSS. 29600. His father, Thomas (1696-1760), had diversified into thread-making and skinning, businesses that William inherited. Following his marriage to Martha Twamley in September 1762, he invested in a leather business in Worcester in partnership with Henry Beesley, and in 1772 set up the shipping company Respondentia, with Thomas and Nathaniel Jefferys. A thousand-pound investment in this latter concern, including interests in the East-Indiamen Norfolk and Grattan, yielded a profit of ¬£630 in the first year alone. In 1775 he formed a partnership with John Finch, dealing in textiles, metals and metal products with Sweden, Holland and Russia. William and Martha had five children, Martha, Mary, Frances, Thomas Pougher, and Jane. Jane died an infant, and Frances died in 1785 after a long illness. Russell's wife was killed in a coach accident in 1790, during a family holiday in Yorkshire.Mrs. Russell's Journal for this holiday is in Birmingham Reference Library, MSS 660347. The Russells lived well but not extravagantly in a farmhouse at Showell Green in modern-day Balsall Heath, Birmingham. Russell employed two labourers to run the farm and stables, but took a personal interest in stock-breeding, a subject on which he corresponded with George Washington, America's first president.John C. Fitzpatrick (ed.), The writings of George Washington, 1745-1799, Washington, 1938. As one of Birmingham's leading citizens, Russell's advice and support was sought for many of the important commercial, civic and social causes of the day. He was a subscriber and committee member for the town Hospital and the Birmingham Humane Society. In 1787, he was appointed one of the Wardens of the Birmingham Assay Office, supporting Matthew Boulton in recommending the introduction in Britain of standards of silver lower than sterling (9 oz. and 10 oz. per pound Troy). Russell was also a Justice of the Peace for the county of Worcestershire, his house in Showell Green being just inside the Worcestershire border.  Philanthropy  Russell responded generously and constructively to the needs of those in distress, never courting publicity but always 'more concerned to be good than to appear so.' He financed the teaching of poor children, paid a local surgeon to care for poor families in the neighbourhood, and contributed to schemes to provide food for the poorest of his neighbours. Throughout his life, many families, 'sufferers by fire' and 'persons stricken with illness,' were supported by his bounty. During the American War for Independence, Russell bought food, clothes and shoes to ease the distress of American prisoners of war.An Act of the Maryland General Assembly, 3 November 1783, exempted Russell's American property from confiscation, because 'his purse and interest were liberally made use of in favour of American prisoners, many of whom were clothed and fed by his bounty, their sufferings alleviated, and their lives preserved.' British Library Add. MSS. 44993, f. 16 Nothing better portrays the stature of the man than the response of the local poor when Russell's house was attacked and destroyed in the 1791 Birmingham riots. His 'poor and illiterate' neighbours swarmed to his assistance as soon as Russell's house was announced as the rioters' next target. Some stayed at the roadside trying to calm and dissuade the rioters.  Views on education  As a Rational Christian, Russell valued education. He paid local clergymen to teach poor boys to read and write, helped support the Birmingham Library and its offshoot Scientific Library, and sponsored scientific lectures. He subscribed to schools in Coseley, Oldbury, Hall Green and Birmingham, and to Warrington Academy and the New College at Hackney, as well as numerous Sunday Schools in the West Midlands. Like his grandfather and father before him, he was a governor of King Edward's School, Birmingham.Philip B. Chatwin (ed.), The records of King Edward's School, Birmingham, vol. 5, Oxford (Dugdale Society), 1963 He joined the committee of London's 'Presbyterian University', the New College at Hackney, in May 1790. When the college faced bankruptcy with debts of two thousand pounds because of over-expansion and poor supervision of the builders, he dashed to London to add his support, chairing a subcommittee appointed to 'reduce household expenses.'John Rylands Library, MSS collection of Lindsey letters in three volumes: Lindsey to William Tayleur, 21 May 1791 and 7 June 1791. Dr. Williams's Trust: Hackney College Minute Book, 1785-91, ff 135, 150. In 1790, he backed Priestley's scheme for a Birmingham Sunday Society, where youngsters who had passed through a basic Sunday school were taught arithmetic, book- keeping, geography and drawing, as well as the elements of natural and revealed religion, by teachers drawn from Priestley's Senior Class.J. Money, Experience and Identity, Manchester University Press, 1977, pp. 142, 220. As well as a major subscriber to the Unitarian New Meeting in Birmingham, acting as Secretary to the committee of subscribers from 1771 to 1793,Russell's family had been members of the New Meeting, since its foundation in 1692, when Russell's great-grandfather worshipped in what was then called the Lower Meeting. When a new chapel was built in the late 1720s, in Moor Street, Russell's grandfather was one of thirty-two original trustees: Herbert New, The New Meeting and Church of the Messiah, Birmingham, 1912. Russell subscribed to a host of chapels up and down the country, including Theophilus Lindsey's Essex Street Chapel, and supported a number of dissenting ministers. It was only through Russell's whole-hearted leadership and practical support, that within a few weeks of becoming co-pastor of New Meeting Birmingham, Priestley was able to establish a new scheme of catechetical classes, appointing elders to assist him; introduce lectures on natural and revealed religion to a Senior Class; and start a Congregational Library. Agreeing with Priestley that the promulgation of a Rational Christianity was the best way of reconverting unbelievers, Russell financed several editions of Priestley's Appeal.Joseph Priestley, An appeal to the serious and candid professors of Christianity ... by a lover of the gospel, Birmingham, 1782 When this prompted a vitriolic response from the Anglicans,Anonymous, Martin Luther to Socinus, or A serious and affectionate address to the hearers and admirers of Doctor Priestley, by lovers of the truth as it is in Jesus, Birmingham, 21 April 1783 Russell encouraged Priestley to write the anonymous Melanchton to Martin Luther.Joseph Priestley, Melanchton to Martin Luther; or a serious, affectionate reply and address, to those who under the title of Lovers of the Truth, as it is in Jesus, have addressed the hearers and admirers of Doctor Priestley, Birmingham, 5 May 1783. For years, Russell had voiced his anger at the way Dissenting clergy were treated by Anglican ministers. Things came to a head at his mother's funeral in 1767, at St. Philip's, now St Philip's Cathedral, when one of the curates refused either to ride in the same carriage as the two Presbyterian ministers, or to allow the Presbyterian ministers to walk in front of the coffin.William Russell, As many of Mr. Russell's Friends have lately applied to him for the Perusal of some Letters, Birmingham, 1771. Thus, used to attacking such Anglican bigotry, Russell sprang to Priestley's defence when Anglican clergy contrived a series of acrimonious disputes in regard to the management of the Birmingham Library.Charles Parish, History of the Birmingham Library, London, 1966 Likewise, he encouraged and supported Priestley during the acerbic pamphlet war that accompanied the campaign for the repeal of the Test Acts.  Test and Corporation Acts  With the revival of the movement for repeal in 1787, Russell threw himself zealously into the cause of political liberty. Though this was not always their effect in practice, the Test and Corporation Acts were intended to limit public office to practising Anglicans, and came to be seen as an essential bulwark of the union between church and state. Writing to the Warwickshire M.P. Sir Robert Lawley, to solicit his support on the Dissenters' behalf, Russell tried to assure him that the Dissenters' object was 'entirely of a civil nature, and ... can neither diminish, nor interfere with, the provision which the legislature has made for the established church.' 'We are not attacking the rights of others,' he added, 'but merely endeavouring to recover our own.'William Parry, Remarks on the resolutions passed at a meeting ... held on Feb 2, 1790, Birmingham, 1790. (Russell's letter to Lawley is printed as an appendix) Believing that the Dissenters could only be an effective political force if they presented a united front on common issues, Russell led moves to draw the united strength of the Dissenters together. As a first step, he persuaded representatives of the various Baptist, Independent and Presbyterian congregations to attend a meeting at Dadley's hotel, Birmingham on 14 October 1789. The result was the formation of the Committee of the Seven Congregations of the Three Denominations of Dissenters, chaired by Russell himself. The committee, with Russell's financial backing, undertook the publication and distribution of a number of works on religious liberty, including two volumes of Extracts, substantially edited by Russell.Extracts from books and other small pieces in favour of religious liberty, Number 1, Birmingham, 1789. (Number 2 was published in 1790)  Uniting Protestant dissenters  Russell now sought a union of Protestant Dissenters throughout the land, proposing a four tier Plan of Union, by which Congregations in towns and counties would send deputies to Town and County Meetings of Deputies. These in turn would unite in Provincial Meetings, which would send deputies to a National Meeting in London.The circular letter recommending this plan was republished in Extracts..., Number 2, Birmingham, 1790. The Protestant Dissenting Deputies in London, initially rejected Russell's suggestion of a National Meeting.Thomas W. Davis (ed.), Committees for the repeal of the Test and Corporations Acts, London Record Society, 1978, pp. 37-38 However, countrywide support, prompted by Russell's vigorous canvassing, led the London Deputies to meet with country delegates, to discuss the issue. As a result, on 13 May 1790 the London Dissenting Deputies passed a resolution that a Standing Committee of 'delegates from different parts of the kingdom be appointed to meet in London.' The Birmingham Committee had consistently gone further than the London Dissenting Deputies in calling for the repeal of all penal legislation against Dissenters, including the act against non-Trinitarians. Now, Russell called together on 13 January 1790, a meeting in Leicester of 'Deputies of Protestant Dissenters of the Three Denominations within the Midland District.' Echoing the resolutions of the Birmingham Committee, the Midland District meeting issued a sweeping condemnation of all penal statutes against Dissenters. Russell was appointed secretary and treasurer of the executive committee.Aris's Birmingham Gazette, 18 January 1790 Following the failure of the third application for the repeal of the Test Acts, Russell and Priestley sought parliamentary reform as the most effectual means of achieving equal citizenship. Towards this end, Russell developed plans for a Warwickshire Constitutional Society.The Principles of the Warwickshire Constitutional Society, drafted by Russell, and surviving only in manuscript, have recently been published: Enlightenment and Dissent, volume 9, 1990, p. 45. The society was to have been launched at a dinner in Birmingham on 14 July 1791, but the hostility that developed in Birmingham in the days leading up to the dinner caused the abandonment of the plan. The dinner itself was followed by the infamous riots, in which Russell's house was destroyed along with Priestley's. Russell sought temporary refuge in London where he had an interview with Prime Minister Pitt. He returned to Birmingham a few weeks later, but found the town so divided by sectarian disputes that by 1794 he decided to take his three children to America. Russell's zest for controversy never left him. In 1800, defending Priestley's publication of Letters to the inhabitants of Northumberland, he wrote: 'I have a greater zeal than ever, for such controversies as our good friends the late Dr. Price and Dr. Priestley have set the world an example of. By such means the world has been enlightened and I know it is more likely to promote knowledge and enlarge the mind.'American Philosophical Society, Benjamin Vaughan (1751-1835) MSS., William Russell to Benjamin Vaughan, 1 December 1800. Russell was not a political radical, however. Although he had subscribed to the formation of the Society for Constitutional Information, he did not remain a member.The National Archives, Kew, London, T S11/952/3496, Miscellaneous papers of the Society for Constitutional Information.  Emigration to America  The family set sail from Falmouth in an American ship Mary on 14 August 1794, four months after Priestley. However, four days after weighing anchor, their ship was intercepted by the French frigate Proserpine, to which the Russells with other British citizens were forced to transfer. The Mary's captain Prebble, stayed with them to give what support he could. After being transferred to three different accommodation ships, they finally went ashore at Brest on 26 December, and a few days later travelled to Paris, where they stayed six months. The Russells eventually set sail for America aboard the Nancy on 3 July 1795, landing at New York on 19 August. The Russells settled at Philadelphia, renting a house at 319 High Street. It was here that Priestley stayed the following spring, whilst giving a series of lectures on the evidences of Christianity, at the Universalist chapel in Lombard Street. During this time an interested group of English expatriates met with Priestley, seeking his advice in planning the formation of a Unitarian society. They first acquired the use of a room at the University of Pennsylvania, and on 21 August 1796 formally organised themselves as The Society of Unitarian Christians in Philadelphia, the first Unitarian congregation in the New World. Russell was one of the twenty-one founder members, and for a while acted as their treasurer.Elizabeth M. Geffen, Philadelphia Unitarianism, 1796-1861, Philadelphia, 1961  Return to France  A political breach between America and France in 1797 made life difficult for French √©migr√©s in America, and for men such as Russell and Priestley who were thought to support the French. Russell decided to leave America in 1801, intending to spend a month in France before returning to England. He and Priestley had planned to establish a Unitarian church in Paris and promote the cause of Unitarianism throughout France. But, though Russell hoped to the last that his friend would join him, Priestley decided to stay in America. Russell arrived in Paris in July 1801, to find the French government negotiating with the Vatican. It was not a time for Protestants to rock the boat, and Russell was advised to postpone his plans for a Unitarian church at Paris. Instead, he formed an association for translating and publishing books 'to promote Rational Christianity.' But even this was objected to, and was suspended. To add to his problems, Russell was warned that he would face arrest if he returned to England. In 1795, while in Paris, waiting to travel on to America, he had advanced a loan to Mr. Skipwith, the American consul. The loan not being repaid, in February 1799, Skipwith conveyed through Russell's agent, Mr. Walker, a house in Paris on the Quai Voltaire, and an estate in Normandy, the Abbaye d'Ardennes, at St. Germain la Blanche Herbe, on the Bayeux road, four kilometres from Caen. Although no money had changed hands at the time, and Russell himself was 3000 miles away and knew nothing of the transaction, technically he had purchased property in a country with which Britain was at war. Furthermore, having offended the government by his 'perseverance in endeavouring to establish a bond of union among Dissenters, and to support the plan for District Meetings, &c.;,' he could not expect a dispensation. So, in August, Russell decided to settle on his Normandy estate. Here he wrote several Letters in French to introduce the ideas of Rational Christianity. The front sheet containing an exhortation to search the scriptures, and to use the liberty they now enjoyed of exchanging superstition for genuine Christianity. Russell sent his letters to John Hurford Stone, at Paris, to edit and print, but Stone advised against publication, 'at least for the present.' Rather than 'flying Pamphlets,' Stone suggested a larger more systematic work addressed to the 'philosophical part of the Nation.' Stone suggested translating Priestley's History of the Corruptions of Christianity. Russell enthusiastically agreed, later financing the publication of French translations of Priestley's Institutes of Religion, and Alexander Geddes' Apology for the Catholics, and, in 1805, an edition of the Geneva Bible. In the meantime, Russell had been busy trying to establish a Unitarian church at Caen. The Protestant pastor, M. Fontbonne du Vernet, who had gone into seven years hiding during the Terror, was now holding services in a room in the rue de Bras, but few attended. Russell was outraged. Independent Catholics met regularly for worship, in substantial numbers. Even Roman Catholics, although their meetings were technically illegal, assembled openly. For the Protestants, there seemed 'no other obstacle to this great duty of assembling for Public Worship, than what arose from criminal fear or indifference.' With du Vernet's encouragement, Russell approached the Prefect of the Department to request a church to assemble in at Caen. This was refused, but Russell was permitted to open the small church on his property at the abbaye d'Ardennes. Russell repaired, and refurnished the church, and, despite Stone's advice against it, the first service was held there early in October 1801. It was the first Protestant church to open anywhere in France, since the revolution. The church was soon overflowing, Russell reported, the congregation 'worshipping with an apparent fervor that roused emotions in my breast, which I cannot describe.' In 1802, a new Concordat with the Vatican had eased religious tensions, and by November 1803, the congregation was able to move to a larger, former Benedictine chapel in rue de Ge√¥le at Caen.S. Beaujour, Essai sur l'histoire de l'Eglise reformee de Caen, Caen, 1877, p. 496 Russell contributed 120 livres a year for the remainder of his stay in France. Catholic priests frequently applied to him for support in relieving the sufferings of the afflicted and distressed. To these applications he always lent a patient ear, displaying the most generous sympathy. 'I love all mankind,' he wrote, 'and I see no reason why diversity of opinion should alienate one man from another.' His help to the poor was regular and extensive, particularly during the winter bread shortages, and earned him the accolade le p√®re des pauvres. His generosity to the people of Normandy continued even after his return to England. On 15 May 1807 he was accorded French citizenship, swearing the oath of loyalty to the empire, a month later. Following Bonaparte's internment on Elba, the political situation enabled Russell to return to his homeland at the end of 1814. He spent his remaining few years at his son-in-law's home near Upton-upon-Severn, writing devotional addresses and hymns, some of which were published after his death in 1818.William Russell, Supplicatory addresses to the one everliving and true God, with a biographical introduction by Theophilus Browne, Gloucester, 1818 He was buried next to his wife at St. Philip's Church.

By 1905, Greene was one of the wealthiest businessmen in the world. Biography Greene was born in Duck Creek, Wisconsin, on August 26, 1852, to Eleanor Cornell and Townsend Greene. He was educated at private schools and at the Chappaqua Mountain Institute in Chappaqua, New York. Greene started off as a clerk for O. H. Angevin & Company where he worked for three years before heading out to the western United States as a surveying party member of the Northern Pacific Railroad. He left the Railroad and then in 1870 staked out the site of Fargo, North Dakota, before becoming involved with various businesses. He worked in both mining and cattle-raising industries across the west, which included Montana, Colorado, Arizona, and northern Mexico. He was reported to have had numerous encounters with local native tribes and outlaws that roamed the areas where he prospected. =The Burnett killing= In 1897, Greene and his family were living on a ranch along the San Pedro River, near what is today the town of Sierra Vista, Arizona. That year Greene built a small dam along the river to water his alfalfa fields, which infuriated his neighbor, James C. Burnett. Burnett, who was looking to expand his own ranch, retaliated by hiring a crew of Chinese workers to build a new dam on his property and, according to tradition, blow up Greene's dam with dynamite. That's when tragedy occurred. On the day after the dam was destroyed, on June 25, Greene's daughter Ella and a friend named Katie Corcoran went down to swim at their favorite spot along the San Pedro, but were swept away and drowned in the current. Apparently, the blast from the dynamite had altered the river's channel, creating a deep hole with a strong current, where there was originally just a shallow swimming pool. Ella's younger sister Eva survived because she remained on the riverbank while the two older girls went in. Greene blamed Burnett for the death of his daughter and immediately sought revenge. In Tombstone on July 1, he found Burnett on Allen Street near the O.K. Corral and shot him to death with his revolver. Afterwards he calmly surrendered himself to Sheriff Scott White. Although Burnett was dead and Greene was ultimately acquitted of murder by claiming self-defense, the shooting tore his marriage apart. His wife never recovered from the loss of her daughter and died in Los Angeles in 1899 from ovarian-surgery complications. Greene married Mary Benedict (1876-1955) a few years later. =Businessman= On September 15, 1899, William founded the Greene Consolidated Copper Company to develop copper rich resources he discovered near Cananea.\\"THE CAREER AND FINAL COLLAPSE OF A COPPER KING; Five Years Ago Col. Greene's Cananea Mine Ranked Among the World's Greatest Copper Producers. Then Came Panic, Dramatic Struggle, and To-day the Daring Miner Is a Recluse in Mexico. The Career and Final Collapse of a Copper King\\" New York Times November 1, 1908 Greene Consolidated became in a very short time one of the richest sources of copper ore in the world, with an average output over 70 million pounds per year. Accordingly, Greene himself soon became one of the wealthiest businessmen in the United States and based on his success soon created a number of other ventures; the Pacific Coast Coal Company, Greene Consolidated Gold Company, the Cananea Railroad Company, the Sierra Madre Land and Lumber Company, as well as many others. None of his other ventures ever produced the wealth found in the copper mines of Cananea, though. In 1903, Greene purchased the San Rafael Ranch near Lochiel, Arizona, and made it the headquarters for his cattle ranching empire. Greene was quite successful with his ranch and even attracted the attention of the Mexican raider Pancho Villa, who stole horses from him on more than one occasion. The San Rafael Ranch remained in the Greene family all the way up until 1998, when The Nature Conservancy and Arizona State Parks purchased it for use as a wildlife preserve. In 2008, the ranch headquarters was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the \\"San Rafael Ranch Historic District\\". The Lawson Panic of 1904 and mining strikes two years later were the beginning of the end for Greene Consolidated. The panic, started by Thomas Lawson, a popular investor and writer of his day, created a selling frenzy on Wall Street that sent the price of shares spiraling down. There was some recovery to the share price but the situation worsened in May 1906 when the company was under siege by hostile miners unhappy about unequal pay.\\"ARMED AMERICANS AT GREENE'S MINE; Rushed Into Mexico from Arizona Against Gov.

They began to sell their shares which sent his stock price lower. Still, it was not until his own overspending in related businesses, combined with the aggressive business tactics of rival business men and competitors, forced Greene to succumb. In 1906, with dwindling finances and nowhere else to turn, he sold Greene Consolidated to Thomas F. Cole, John D. Ryan, and Amalgamated Copper. =Death= After selling Greene Consolidated, Greene was forced out of daily operations of the mine. He disappeared from society for the most part and lived a quiet life in Cananea until his death on August 5, 1911, as a result of pneumonia, which was induced by an accident which overtook him several days before.\\"Thousand View Col. Greene‚Äôs Body.\\" New York Times August 8, 1911 At his funeral, and after the religious service in his home, the coffin was loaded onto his private train and was brought to Los Angeles, California. In 1918, Charlie Wiswall, Greene's general business manager and regarded as a man of \\"great heart,\\" married the widowed Mary. The marriage was performed with a prenuptial agreement that Wiswall not have access to the assets of the estate and that he would be considered a permanent employee of Greene Emporium. Wiswall died in 1953 and Mary in 1955; Greene's son, William, was determined to bring his father's remains to Cananea, where he was buried in the heart of the city's cemetery in 1956.

Their population was 146, as of 2010, making them the smallest group in the region. History When the Nahuku√° people were first encountered by German explorers in the late 19th century, they were initially grouped with two other tribes living in the region (the Kalapalo and Kuikuro, rather than recognized as their own unique group. Another group of later explorers only mentioned the Nahuku√° in passing, speculating about the origins of the Nahuku√° people. These explorers, led by a man named Max Schmidt, believed that, because of the Carib ancestry of the Nahuku√°, they were probably immigrants to the region, hailing originally from southwestern Guiana. Early explorers noted that the Nahuku√° had several villages along the Kurisevo and Kuluene rivers. By the 1940s, however, the population of the Nahuku√° people had been reduced to only 28. Although the population did rise slightly in the ensuing years, a measles epidemic decimated populations again in the 1950s. By 1954, some believed that the Nahuku√° may already have been extinct. At some point after 1948, low Nahuku√° populations caused the ethnic group to disband its last existing village at the time. In the 1960s, at the encouragement of the Villas-B√¥as brothers, the Nahuku√° created a new village to a spot closer to the Kalapalo people. This village was eventually abandoned, due to superstition regarding a murder, which the Nahuku√° attributed to sorcery. In 1977, a new Nahuku√° village was set up on the shore of Kuluene river. Nahuku√° populations, which had been increasing since the introduction of proper modern healthcare to the upper Xingu River area in the 1960s, continued to increase after the foundation of this new village.

March 1629 ‚Äì 1 July 1694), known to his contemporaries as Monsieur Du Bois (), was a translator of St. Augustine, member of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise and director of Mademoiselle de Guise's musical ensemble. One of his detractors claimed that Goibaut began his career as dancing master to the young Louis Joseph, Duke of Guise and did not learn Latin until he was thirty, when the Jansenist ‚ÄúMessieurs‚Äù of Port-Royal became his spiritual and intellectual mentors.Pelisson and d‚ÄôOlivet, Histoire de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie Fran√ßaise, ed. Ch-L. Livet (Paris, 1858), vol. 2, pp. 284‚Äì288. In 1965 Jean Mesnard's research into the circle around Blaise Pascal proved the inaccuracy of this legend. Mesnard's findings have shaped the biography that follows.Jean Mesnard, Pascal et les Roannez, (Paris: Descl√©e de Brouwer, 1965), passim. Mesnard‚Äôs findings about Goibaut are succinctly summarized by Thomas M. Carr, Jr., in his Introduction to R√©flexions ... et Avertissement ..., pp. 11‚Äì21. Biography Philippe Goibaut was born into a solid bourgeois family of Poitou. His father, Philippe Goibaut, \\"√©cuyer\\" and \\"seigneur du Bois et de La Grug√®re\\" (d. 1638), was s√©n√©chal of Champdeniers, a fief of the powerful Rochechouarts. Young Philippe studied in Poitiers and in 1655 asserted that he was a ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel ordinaire du roi. An inventory of his possessions drawn up that year refers to a library of some 200 books in Greek, Latin and French, as well as a viol, a theorbo and a guitar. In other words, by the time he was twenty-five, Goibaut was already skilled in classical letters and was at least a competent performer on stringed instruments. In 1655 he married Fran√ßoise Blacvod (d. 1676), the daughter of an official of Poitiers who descended from Adam Blackwood, physician to Mary, Queen of Scots.Mesnard, pp. 666‚Äì674. In 1660, Du Bois journeyed to Paris and rapidly entered the circle of Artus Gouffier, Duke of Roannez, the royal governor of Poitou. Roannez introduced him to his close friend Pascal, to Christiaan Huygens who was in Paris 1660-1661, and also to the ‚ÄúPascalins,‚Äù a group of writers who claimed to be disciples of Pascal or who at least were obsessed with his example and inspired by him.That is the definition of pascalins provided by Mesnard, p. 650‚Äì651. After two sojourns in Paris, Goibaut, with his wife, moved there permanently in 1666. He began trying his hand at translation, consulting with Antoine Arnauld about Port-Royal's translation of the New Testament and gaining Arnauld's lasting respect for his translation skills. Goibaut would soon be described as a man of ‚Äúlimitless intellect who, they say, most closely approaches Monsieur Pascal and has imitated him best.‚ÄùBnF, ms. n.a.f. 4333, fols. 53‚Äì54, quoted by Mesnard, p. 653. Although Goibaut initially defended his Jansenist friends of Port-Royal and, in 1670, participated in their edition of Pascal's Pens√©es, he gradually distanced himself from the movement.Mesnard, pp. 661‚Äì662, 672‚Äì673, 872‚Äì874, 953‚Äì954; Ranum, Portraits around Marc-Antoine Charpentier (Baltimore: 2004), p. 167. In 1666 Mlle de Guise chose Goibaut to be the preceptor (other sources say the ‚Äúgovernor‚Äù)Mesnard, pp. 672‚Äì673, 877. of her sixteen-year-old nephew, Louis- Joseph de LorraineLouis Joseph, Duke of Guise. Indeed, Goibaut had earned respect for his theories about how best to educate princes.Mesnard, pp. 738‚Äì740, 874‚Äì875. Upon his arrival at the ‚ÄúH√¥tel de Guise‚Äù, Goibaut set about ghost-writing the memoirs of Mlle de Guise's late brother, Henry, Duke of Guise, who had died in 1664. The memoirs were published under Henry's name in 1668.Bougeois and Andr√©, Les Sources de l‚Äôhistoire de France (Paris, 1913), vol. 2, pp. 95‚Äì96; Mesnard, p. 878. Mlle de Guise lodged her prot√©g√© in an apartment in the newly renovated stable wing of her splendid urban palace. There Goibaut regularly entertained one or another of the ‚Äúpascalins.‚ÄùMesnard, pp. 878, 902. One of his neighbors was Roger de Gaigni√®res, who was amassing a collection of historical documents and images. A few years later, the princess also offered her protection to a young composer named Marc-Antoine Charpentier, to whom she granted an apartment adjacent to Goibaut's. After the Duke's death in 1672, both Mlle de Guise and the Duke's widow, ‚ÄúMme de Guise‚Äù continued their protection of Goibaut and Charpentier. For seventeen years the two men ‚Äî joined by an ever-increasing number of singers and instrumentalists ‚Äî performed religious and secular music for the two Guise princesses, not only in their private residences and chapels but also at the royal court and in select Parisian venues. To be precise, Goibaut conducted and Charpentier composed. Goibaut may occasionally have played with the ensemble, just as Charpentier sometimes sang with it. Indeed, when Goibaut died, he still owned his viol, plus fifty-six volumes of music by a variety of composers. For some of these volumes he had badgered the resident in Paris for Cosimo III de‚Äô Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to ship Italian songbooks to Paris for the enjoyment of Mlle de Guise.Ranum, Portraits, p. 165. A neo-Latinist who probably wrote most, if not all the libretti for Charpentier's oratorios, Goibaut was respected for his ability to set Latin texts to plainsong.Jean Duron, ‚ÄúLes ‚Äòparoles de musique,‚Äô‚Äù p. 169. After the death of the Duke of Guise in 1672, Goibaut began translating Latin texts into French: Thomas √† Kempis's Imitation of Christ, two volumes of Cicero and eight volumes of St. Augustine. For his point of departure he used the recent Latin editions done by the scholarly Benedictines of Saint-Maur. Always keeping the lay reader in mind, he worked to present not only the author's ideas but also his tone and his manner of expressing himself. To this end, Goibaut did not translate word for word; instead, he conveyed \\"what the author wanted to impress upon the reader's spirit and heart.\\" The translated text was complemented by brief annotations providing background information about the history of the late Roman Empire or the theological quarrels of the first centuries of the Church. The result, said Pierre Bayle, is \\"exact, faithful, pure, elegant, and admirably disentangled.\\"Carr, pp. 18‚Äì19. The first of these translations came off the press 1678; the last appeared posthumously in 1696. In addition, the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in October 1685 caused Goibaut to write his Conformit√© de la conduite de l‚Äô√©glise en France, which parallels the Church's repressive conversion of the Donatists and its forcible conversion of Protestants after the Revocation. Goibaut calls for using, instead, \\"the force of Truth,\\" that is, the gentler approach recommended in two of St. Augustine's letters.Ranum, Portraits, pp. 160-162. Goibaut sent a copy of this work to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, along with, it would seem, a copy of Charpentier‚Äôs most recent oratorio for St. Cecilia (Caecilia Virgo et Martyr, H.415), who converts her husband and brother-in-law with gentle reasoning. The Grand Duke's resident in Paris identified Goibaut as the author of the libretto: http://ranumspanat.com/caecilia_conversions.htm During Mlle de Guise's last illness, Goibaut and Father Fran√ßois de la Chaise, S.J. may well have exerted undue influence on the dying woman. At any rate, both men received large legacies.Ranum, Portraits, p. 168. Upon the princess's death in March 1688, Goibaut was granted the right to remain at the H√¥tel de Guise. During those years, he frequently saw Mme de S√©vign√©, who admired his wit and his intellect and considered him to be sincerely devout. But he had his detractors, who tended to view him as a shameless opportunist who had a knack for ingratiating himself.Mesnard, pp. 653, 662‚Äì665, 669; and Louis Delvaud, Le Marquis de Pomponne, (Paris, 1911), pp. 92, 94, 320. In November 1693, Philippe Goibaut was elected to the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. Eight months later he died in his apartment at the H√¥tel de Guise and was buried at the nearby parish church of Saint-Jean-en-Gr√®ve, since destroyed. He had not lived long enough to collect his legacy from Mlle de Guise.

DNA molecular dynamics modeling involves simulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecular geometry and topology changes with time as a result of both intra- and inter- molecular interactions of DNA. Whereas molecular models of DNA molecules such as closely packed spheres (CPK models) made of plastic or metal wires for skeletal models are useful representations of static DNA structures, their usefulness is very limited for representing complex DNA dynamics. Computer molecular modeling allows both animations and molecular dynamics simulations that are very important to understand how DNA functions in vivo. History The A-DNA double helix molecular model of Crick and Watson (consistent with X-ray data) for which they, with M.H.F. Wilkins, received a Nobel Prize. From the very early stages of structural studies of DNA by X-ray diffraction and biochemical means, molecular models such as the Watson-Crick nucleic acid double helix model were successfully employed to solve the 'puzzle' of DNA structure, and also find how the latter relates to its key functions in living cells. The first high quality X-ray diffraction patterns of A-DNA were reported by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in 1953. Rosalind Franklin made the critical observation that DNA exists in two distinct forms, A and B, and produced the sharpest pictures of both through X-ray diffraction technique. The first calculations of the Fourier transform of an atomic helix were reported one year earlier by Cochran, Crick and Vand, and were followed in 1953 by the computation of the Fourier transform of a coiled-coil by Crick. Structural information is generated from X-ray diffraction studies of oriented DNA fibers with the help of molecular models of DNA that are combined with crystallographic and mathematical analysis of the X-ray patterns. The first reports of a double helix molecular model of B-DNA structure were made by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953., . That same year, Maurice F. Wilkins, A. Stokes and H.R. Wilson, reported the first X-ray patterns of in vivo B-DNA in partially oriented salmon sperm heads. The development of the first correct double helix molecular model of DNA by Crick and Watson may not have been possible without the biochemical evidence for the nucleotide base-pairing ([A---T]; [C---G]), or Chargaff's rules. Although such initial studies of DNA structures with the help of molecular models were essentially static, their consequences for explaining the in vivo functions of DNA were significant in the areas of protein biosynthesis and the quasi- universality of the genetic code. Epigenetic transformation studies of DNA in vivo were however much slower to develop despite their importance for embryology, morphogenesis and cancer research. Such chemical dynamics and biochemical reactions of DNA are much more complex than the molecular dynamics of DNA physical interactions with water, ions and proteins/enzymes in living cells.  Importance  An old standing dynamic problem is how DNA \\"self- replication\\" takes place in living cells that should involve transient uncoiling of supercoiled DNA fibers. Although DNA consists of relatively rigid, very large elongated biopolymer molecules called fibers or chains (that are made of repeating nucleotide units of four basic types, attached to deoxyribose and phosphate groups), its molecular structure in vivo undergoes dynamic configuration changes that involve dynamically attached water molecules and ions. Supercoiling, packing with histones in chromosome structures, and other such supramolecular aspects also involve in vivo DNA topology which is even more complex than DNA molecular geometry, thus turning molecular modeling of DNA into an especially challenging problem for both molecular biologists and biotechnologists. Like other large molecules and biopolymers, DNA often exists in multiple stable geometries (that is, it exhibits conformational isomerism) and configurational, quantum states which are close to each other in energy on the potential energy surface of the DNA molecule. Such varying molecular geometries can also be computed, at least in principle, by employing ab initio quantum chemistry methods that can attain high accuracy for small molecules, although claims that acceptable accuracy can be also achieved for polynuclelotides, and DNA conformations, were recently made on the basis of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectral data. Such quantum geometries define an important class of ab initio molecular models of DNA which exploration has barely started, especially related to results obtained by VCD in solutions. More detailed comparisons with such ab initio quantum computations are in principle obtainable through 2D-FT NMR spectroscopy and relaxation studies of polynucleotide solutions or specifically labeled DNA, as for example with deuterium labels. In an interesting twist of roles, the DNA molecule was proposed to be used for quantum computing via DNA. Both DNA nanostructures and DNA computing biochips have been built. Fundamental concepts The chemical structure of DNA is insufficient to understand the complexity of the 3D structures of DNA. In contrast, animated molecular models allow one to visually explore the three- dimensional (3D) structure of DNA. The DNA model shown (far right) is a space- filling, or CPK, model of the DNA double helix. Animated molecular models, such as the wire, or skeletal, type shown at the top of this article, allow one to visually explore the three-dimensional (3D) structure of DNA. Another type of DNA model is the space-filling, or CPK, model. The hydrogen bonding dynamics and proton exchange is very different by many orders of magnitude between the two systems of fully hydrated DNA and water molecules in ice. Thus, the DNA dynamics is complex, involving nanosecond and several tens of picosecond time scales, whereas that of liquid ice is on the picosecond time scale, and that of proton exchange in ice is on the millisecond time scale. The proton exchange rates in DNA and attached proteins may vary from picosecond to nanosecond, minutes or years, depending on the exact locations of the exchanged protons in the large biopolymers. A simple harmonic oscillator 'vibration' is only an oversimplified dynamic representation of the longitudinal vibrations of the DNA intertwined helices which were found to be anharmonic rather than harmonic as often assumed in quantum dynamic simulations of DNA. =DNA structure= The structure of DNA shows a variety of forms, both double-stranded and single-stranded. The mechanical properties of DNA, which are directly related to its structure, are a significant problem for cells. Every process which binds or reads DNA is able to use or modify the mechanical properties of DNA for purposes of recognition, packaging and modification. The extreme length (a chromosome may contain a 10 cm long DNA strand), relative rigidity and helical structure of DNA has led to the evolution of histones and of enzymes such as topoisomerases and helicases to manage a cell's DNA. The properties of DNA are closely related to its molecular structure and sequence, particularly the weakness of the hydrogen bonds and electronic interactions that hold strands of DNA together compared to the strength of the bonds within each strand. Experimental methods which can directly measure the mechanical properties of DNA are relatively new, and high-resolution visualization in solution is often difficult. Nevertheless, scientists have uncovered large amount of data on the mechanical properties of this polymer, and the implications of DNA's mechanical properties on cellular processes is a topic of active current research. The DNA found in many cells can be macroscopic in length: a few centimetres long for each human chromosome. Consequently, cells must compact or package DNA to carry it within them. In eukaryotes this is carried by spool-like proteins named histones, around which DNA winds. It is the further compaction of this DNA-protein complex which produces the well known mitotic eukaryotic chromosomes. In the late 1970s, alternate non-helical models of DNA structure were briefly considered as a potential solution to problems in DNA replication in plasmids and chromatin. However, the models were set aside in favor of the double- helical model due to subsequent experimental advances such as X-ray crystallography of DNA duplexes, and later the nucleosome core particle, and the discovery of topoisomerases. Such non-double-helical models are not currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community. DNA structure determination using molecular modeling and DNA X-ray patterns  After DNA has been separated and purified by standard biochemical methods, one has a sample in a jar much like in the figure at the top of this article. Below are the main steps involved in generating structural information from X-ray diffraction studies of oriented DNA fibers that are drawn from the hydrated DNA sample with the help of molecular models of DNA that are combined with crystallographic and mathematical analysis of the X-ray patterns. Paracrystalline lattice models of B-DNA structures Silica glass is another example of a material which is organized into a paracrystalline lattice. A paracrystalline lattice, or paracrystal, is a molecular or atomic lattice with significant amounts (e.g., larger than a few percent) of partial disordering of molecular arrangements. Limiting cases of the paracrystal model are nanostructures, such as glasses, liquids, etc., that may possess only local ordering and no global order. A simple example of a paracrystalline lattice is shown in the following figure for a silica glass: Liquid crystals also have paracrystalline rather than crystalline structures. Highly hydrated B-DNA occurs naturally in living cells in such a paracrystalline state, which is a dynamic one despite the relatively rigid DNA double helix stabilized by parallel hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide base-pairs in the two complementary, helical DNA chains (see figures). For simplicity most DNA molecular models omit both water and ions dynamically bound to B-DNA, and are thus less useful for understanding the dynamic behaviors of B-DNA in vivo. The physical and mathematical analysis of X-rayHosemann R., Bagchi R.N., Direct analysis of diffraction by matter, North-Holland Publs., Amsterdam ‚Äì New York, 1962. and spectroscopic data for paracrystalline B-DNA is thus far more complex than that of crystalline, A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns. The paracrystal model is also important for DNA technological applications such as DNA nanotechnology. Novel methods that combine X-ray diffraction of DNA with X-ray microscopy in hydrated living cells are now also being developed. Genomic and biotechnology applications of DNA molecular modeling design of structures for DNA nanotechnology. Here, individual DNA tiles (model at left) self-assemble into a highly ordered DNA 2D-nanogrid (AFM image at right). There are various uses of DNA molecular modeling in Genomics and Biotechnology research applications, from DNA repair to PCR and DNA nanostructures. Two- dimensional DNA junction arrays have been visualized by Atomic force microscopy. DNA molecular modeling has various uses in genomics and biotechnology, with research applications ranging from DNA repair to PCR and DNA nanostructures. These include computer molecular models of molecules as varied as RNA polymerase, an E. coli, bacterial DNA primase template suggesting very complex dynamics at the interfaces between the enzymes and the DNA template, and molecular models of the mutagenic, chemical interaction of potent carcinogen molecules with DNA. These are all represented in the gallery below. Technological application include a DNA biochip and DNA nanostructures designed for DNA computing and other dynamic applications of DNA nanotechnology. Link The image at right is of self-assembled DNA nanostructures. The DNA \\"tile\\" structure in this image consists of four branched junctions oriented at 90¬∞ angles. Each tile consists of nine DNA oligonucleotides as shown; such tiles serve as the primary \\"building block\\" for the assembly of the DNA nanogrids shown in the AFM micrograph.

OS4000 was developed through to late 1990s, and has been in a support-only mode since then.  History  The first operating systems for the GEC 4000 series were COS (Core Operating System) and DOS (Disk Operating System). These were basically single-user multi-tasking operating systems, designed for developing and running Process control type applications. OS4000 was first released around 1977. It reused many of the parts of DOS, but added multi-user access, OS4000 JCL Command-line interpreter, Batch processing, OS4000 hierarchical filesystem (although on- disk format very similar to the non-hierarchical DOS filesystem). OS4000 JCL was based on the Cambridge University Phoenix command interpreter. OS4000 Rel 3 arrived around 1980, and included Linked-OS ‚Äî support for Linked OS4000 operating systems to enable multi-node systems to be constructed. The main customer for this was the central computing service of University College London (Euclid), where a multi-node system consisting of a Hub file server and multiple Rim multi-access compute server systems provided service for over 100 simultaneous users. Linked-OS was also used to construct fail-over Process control systems with higher resilience. OS4000 Rel 4 arrived around 1983, and upped the maximum number of user modules to 150 (again, mainly for the University College London Euclid system), together with an enhanced Batch processing system. It also included support for the GEC 4090 processor, which introduced a 32-bit addressing mode. OS4000 Rel 5 introduced a modified version of the OS4000 filesystem called CFSX, in order to allow easier use of larger disks. The initial Rel 5 only supported the CFSX filesystem, but support for the original CFS1 filesystem was reintroduced as well quite quickly. OS4000 Rel 6 introduced support for dual processor systems (GEC 4190D). OS4000 was developed in the UK at GEC Computers Borehamwood offices in Elstree Way, and at GEC Computers Dunstable Development Centre in Woodside Estate, Dunstable.  Architecture  The architecture of OS4000 is very heavily based around the architecture of the platform it runs on, the GEC 4000 series minicomputers, and these are rather unusual. The platform includes a feature called Nucleus which is a combination of a hardware and firmware based kernel, which cannot be altered under program control. This means that many of the features typically found in operating system kernels do not need to be included in OS4000, as the underlying platform performs these functions instead of the operating system. Consequently, there is no provision for running Privileged mode code on the platform‚Äîall OS4000 operating system code runs as processes. Nucleus supports up to 256 processes, and schedules these automatically using a fixed priority scheme. OS4000 lives entirely within these processes. A set of system tables are used to configure Nucleus, and access to these system tables can be granted to processes which need to alter the configuration of Nucleus, e.g. to load new programs into processes, adjust the Nucleus scheduling for time-shared processes, etc. The system tables tell Nucleus which processes are permitted to communicate with each other, and these are updated as processes are created and destroyed, e.g. when users login and logout. All I/O is performed directly from processes, and the system tables identify which processes have access to which peripherals and handle peripheral interrupts. For example, a device driver for a disk controller is a process, which is responsible for issuing commands through Nucleus to the disk controller, and handling the interrupts passed back from the disk controller via Nucleus, and the system tables will explicitly state that process has access to that disk controller. The system tables will not grant this device driver access to any other peripherals. In the event of a process stopping or crashing, Nucleus looks up its owner process in the system tables, and informs it. The owner process can then take the decision to let the system continue running without that process, or to take out the system (like a Unix panic), or to take some action such as reload and/or restart the process. Functions such as filesystems, store allocation, terminal drivers, timing services, etc. also exist as separate processes. Nucleus implements a segmented memory system, with processes having their access to memory segments defined by the system tables, which is maintained by OS4000. OS4000 provides a memory system which handles both store-resident memory, and virtual memory backed by disk which is known as overlay, with overlaying being performed at the segment level. OS4000 also inherited grouped segments from DOS, where a group of segments were to be overlaid and retrieved as a single group, but this feature was very little used in OS4000. A process may use any mixture of resident and overlayable segments, although a process performing real-time tasks would normally be designed to only use resident segments. OS4000 supports a fully mixed set of process scheduling within the same system, from hard real-time processes, through soft real-time, time-shared, and background. Given that OS4000 also includes full program development and test/debug facilities, this made OS4000 ideal for developing and deploying real-time applications such as process control and high speed (at the time) data communications all within one system.  Filesystem  OS4000 uses its own proprietary filesystem. The filesystem is extent based, and variable block size ‚Äî different files can be created with different blocksizes, ranging from 256 bytes to 16,384 bytes in 256-byte multiples. The filesystem is hierarchical, with components limited to 8 characters and the \\"\`.\`\\" (period) used as the component separator. OS4000 JCL limits characters in file path components to upper case letters and numbers only. Each file path starts with a context pointer which is a name which refers to a position in a filesystem, followed by zero or more catalogues (equivalent to Unix directories), and ending with a filename. Each disk on the system contains a separate and independent filesystem, and the volume name of a disk is the same as the name of its top level catalogue or master catalogue. There must be one disk mounted with a volume name of \`SYSTEM\` which contains specific files required by OS4000. In larger systems, there will usually be additional disks containing user files, data files, etc. although these can all coexist on the \`SYSTEM\` disk, space permitting. Users are each given a set of initial context pointers which each point to a catalogue on a filesystem, and users can only see the filesystem hierarchies below their initial context pointers. Systems are usually configured so that unprivileged users cannot see other users files or the system's files, except for the system executables held in \`SYS\`. By convention, an area called \`POOL\` is available for all users, and enables the transfer/sharing of files. Files in an OS4000 filesystem are typed, which means that the filesystem can hold several different types of file, and understands how the contents are structured. Most common are logical files which contain a record structure. These are split into sequential and random files, with random files having all records the same length to enable seeking to record numbers. Finally, text and binary files are distinguished, mainly to prevent applications which expect textual data from accidentally using a binary file. This results in a set of logical file types identified by three letters, e.g. Logical Sequential Text is LST. The logical file types are LST, LSB, LRT, LRB. The converse to logical files are physical files, which are accessed block at a time, and these are known as Physical Random Binary (PRB) files. File types PST, PSB, PRT also exist in theory, but have the same capabilities as PRB and are not generally used. Additionally, there is a Logical Indexed Sequential (LIS) filetype, which is an ISAM file and always appears to be sorted on its key field, and a Byte stream (BYT) filetype, which was added in Rel 6.5 to better support the OS4000 NFS server. A filetype CAT is used to hold catalogues‚Äîit is actually the same as an LSB file, but can only be modified by the filesystem itself. In addition to files and catalogues, there are 3 types of symbolic links. References (REF) can be created to point to another file or catalogue which creator of the REF can see through an initial context pointer, in either the same filesystem or another filesystem. Off Disk Pointers (ODP) are similar to references but can be created to point to a file or catalogue which cannot be seen through any initial context pointers, and creating an ODP is a privileged operation only available to the system manager. Support for Unix style symlinks (arbitrary text stored in a catalogue) was added in Rel 6.5 to better support the OS4000 NFS server, but symlinks can only be created and are only visible from NFS clients. OS4000 also provides a non-hierarchical temporary filesystem. This supports exactly the same types of file as permanent filesystems, except for CAT, REF, ODP, and symlinks. The file contents are stored in dedicated temporary filing disk regions, but the file metadata is stored in memory. Each logged in user has a private temporary filing name space which cannot be seen by any other logged in user (nor even another logged in user with the same username). A user's temporary files are deleted when the user logs out (and implicitly if the system is rebooted). Temporary filenames start with a percent \\"\`%\`\\" or ampersand \\"\`&\`\\" and are limited to 8 characters.  Multi-access Environment  The following shows a short Multi- access login session: {  SESSION STARTING OS4000 Rel 6.5 A036 on A7 SUN 17 MAY 2009 11:06:27 Logging in user SMAN password ID last used SAT 16 MAY 2009 22:21:43 STARTED - SUN 17 MAY 2009 11:06:31 OS4000 Rel 6.5 A036 on A7 SUN 17 MAY 2009 11:06:31 Only an authorised person should be logged in as SMAN READY EXAMINE EXAMINE version 305 Catalogue USER -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DATA Odp GEST Odp IPL CAT MAILAREA CAT MCODE CAT OPER CAT PDA1 Odp POSTCAT Odp POSTFOLD CAT SEBACKUP LST SMAN CAT SOURCE Odp SOURCE1 Odp SPOOL Odp SUNDRY Odp SYS CAT SYSFILES CAT SYSGEN Odp SYSGEN1 Odp TEST Odp USEA Odp USEB Odp USEC Odp WORK Odp X25 CAT YBTS CAT -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- READY ***TO REMAIN ONLINE TYPE COMMAND WITHIN 5 MINS ***STOPPED CPU used: 3 ieu elapsed time used: 15 mins User SMAN terminal 2 logged out SUN 17 MAY 2009 11:21:31 } In this case, user \`SMAN\` has logged in and issued the \`EXAMINE\` command. Then the session has been left to timeout through inactivity. When a user logs in, the OS4000 JCL command interpreter \`SYS.COMM\` is loaded into the user's \`COMM\` process and started. This reads commands from the terminal. A number of system commands are built into \`SYS.COMM\`. In the case of a command which isn't built in, executable binary files are loaded into the \`USER\` process and run, and text JCL files are opened and processed directly by \`SYS.COMM\` itself. A user normally also gets an \`AIDA\` process which is privileged and used to load only trusted debugging programs.  Main Applications  Real- time Process Control accounts for over half of all the OS4000 systems deployed. Of these systems, steel production accounts for a significant proportion. The earlier of these Real-time Process Control systems were upgraded from DOS to OS4000. X.25 Packet Switches account for a significant proportion of systems (although earlier GEC X.25 Packet Switches ran a special operating system called NOS which was a cut down operating system halfway between DOS and OS4000). Civil Command and Control systems, e.g. Fire Service control systems interfacing the emergency telephone operator with the Fire Stations. Prestel (UK) and the public Videotex systems used in many other countries, and many private Viewdata systems. Multi-User Minicomputers, used in many Education and Research establishments.  Ports  OS4000 was ported to the GEC Series 63 minicomputer where it was known as OS6000. This required the addition of a software Nucleus emulation, as this was not a feature of the GEC Series 63 hardware. GEC Computers dropped OS6000, and the source code was given to Daresbury Laboratory who was the main user of it, and they continued to keep it in step with OS4000 releases for the lifetime of their two GEC Series 63 systems.

This newspaper was suppressed by the Paris Commune in 1871 when he wrote of the events of March: \\"The way the population of Paris yesterday expressed its satisfaction was more than frivolous, and we fear it gets worse with time. Paris now has a festive look that is totally inappropriate, and if we do not want to be called Parisians of decadence, we must put an end to this state of affairs. \\" In 1873, he founded Le Soleil, the first major daily newspaper priced at 5 centimes. With a monarchist viewpoint, publication was to continue until June 1915. Herv√© became a member of the Paris municipal council.

Due to an illness sustained at the age of eight, Van Zelst was a hunchback, and was not in the least self- conscious about it, urging Athletics players to rub his hump for good luck. Van Zelst had originally been a mascot for teams at the University of Pennsylvania, but Athletics players lived in the West Philadelphia neighborhood, and he got to know them. Connie Mack hired him as batboy beginning in 1910, and he attended all home games in that capacity. He made some road trips with the team, and invariably was brought to each World Series game, during a period of success for the Athletics during which they won four pennants and three World Series in five years. Van Zelst had never enjoyed robust health, and he fell ill of Bright's Disease in the winter of 1915. He died in March at the age of 20. Childhood Van Zelst was born in Philadelphia. At the age of eight, he sustained a fall which resulted in a twisted spine. Confined to bed for a period of time, he developed a humped back, which could be extremely painful for him. Batboy Athletics batboy Louis Van Zelst Van Zelst tended to hang out around the Penn campus, and became popular at Penn athletic contests. Since some of the Athletics players lived in West Philadelphia, some of the Athletics players, including Rube Oldring, got to know him. One day in 1909, Van Zelst went over to Shibe Park, approached manager Mack, and asked to serve as batboy that day. Mack agreed, and after Van Zelst had competently handled the chores twice (and the Athletics had won both games), hired Van Zelst for the position at home games the following season, having a uniform made for him. Van Zelst became one of the Athletics family; he was invited to Eddie Collins' wedding and a Baseball Writers' Association of America dinner. He became popular with both Athletics and visiting players. He was taken on at least one road trip per year beginning in 1911, and to spring training beginning in 1912. He exhibited a sunny disposition and was an accomplished mimic, bringing laughter to Mack and his players with his imitation of pitcher Eddie Plank in the batter's box. He would urge players to rub his hump for good luck, which they would do. Mack even sent him out to coach first base in one road game against the Giants; but the umpire required Mack to recall Van Zelst to the dugout. During the five years that Van Zelst served as batboy, the Athletics won four pennants and three World Series. Death Van Zelst's constitution was never robust; Athletics players kept an eye on his physical condition during road trips. In the winter of 1915, he was diagnosed with Bright's disease and died in March after a two-day illness.

Since its establishment in 2004, the site has shifted focus from covering only television and film tropes to covering those in other types of media such as literature, comics, anime, manga, video games, music, advertisements, and toys, and their associated fandoms, as well as some non-media subjects such as history, geography, and politics. The nature of the site as a provider of commentary on pop culture and fiction has attracted attention and criticism from several web personalities and blogs. From April 2008 until July 2012, content on TV Tropes was published as free content. In July 2012, TV Tropes modified its license to allow only non-commercial distribution of its content while continuing to host the prior submissions under the new license. TV Tropes has over 395,000 pages, with over 77,000 pages on works of media, and over 28,000 pages of individual tropes. TV Tropes runs on a heavily modified version of PmWiki, but unlike PmWiki, it is not open source. Prior to October 26, 2010, it was possible to edit anonymously. Registration is now mandatory for all other activities besides viewing the website. Site descriptionOwnership= TV Tropes was founded in 2004 by a programmer under the pseudonym \\"Fast Eddie\\", who described himself as having become interested in the conventions of genre fiction while studying at MIT in the 1970s and after browsing Internet forums in the 1990s. The site was sold in 2014 to Drew Schoentrup and Chris Richmond, who then launched a Kickstarter to overhaul the codebase and design. =Content= Initially focused on the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, TV Tropes has since increased its scope to include television series, films, novels, plays, professional wrestling, video games, anime, manga, comic strips/books, fan fiction, and many other subjects, including Internet works such as Wikipedia (often referred to in a tongue-in-cheek way as \\"The Other Wiki\\"). Additionally, articles on the site often relate to real life, or point out real situations where certain tropes can or cannot be applied. It has also used its informal style to describe topics such as science, philosophy, politics, and history under its Useful Notes section. TV Tropes does not have notability standards for the works it covers. It also can be used for recommending lesser-known media on the \\"Needs More Love\\" page. =Article organization= The site includes entries on various series and tropes. An article on a work includes a brief summary of the work in question along with a list of associated tropes. Trope pages are the reverse of articles on works: they give a description of the trope itself, then provide a list of the trope's appearances in various works of media. In this way, TV Tropes is fully interconnected through the various connections made between the works and their tropes. For example, the trope \\"I Am Spartacus\\" is a specific type of scene that appears in multiple works. It refers to scenes where a character is shielded from identification by other characters who are also claiming to be that particular character. The trope name references a famous scene in the film Spartacus. This example is included, along with examples from South Park, Power Rangers in Space, the Talmud, and even recent stories from real life. Not all examples of a trope may be cases where it is \\"played straight\\". They may also include cases where the trope is parodied, mocked, inverted, or thoroughly deconstructed (i.e applying practical elements to show why the trope may or may not be realistic). Subjectivity In addition to the tropes, most articles about a work also have a \\"Your Mileage May Vary\\" (YMMV) page with items that are deemed to be subjective. These items are not usually storytelling tropes, but are audience reactions which have been defined and titled. For example, the page of the well known trope \\"jumping the shark\\", the moment at which a series experiences a sharp decline in quality as in the notorious story point in Happy Days, only contains a list of works that reference the phrase. TV Tropes does not apply the term to a show, that being a subjective opinion about the show, but cites uses of the phrase by the show (\\"in-universe\\"). Most articles also have various pages within them. For example, the article may have an \\"Awesome\\" page to describe crowning moments of awesome (i.e., a moment in a show or other fictional work that the majority of the readers or viewers regard as one of the high points); a \\"Fridge\\" page which describes examples of the tropes \\"Fridge Logic\\" (issues of a given work's internal consistency that do not typically occur to one until later), as well as the related \\"Fridge Horror\\" and \\"Fridge Brilliance\\"; a \\"Laconic\\" page which describes an article/trope in a few short words; and more pages that focus on a particular aspect of an article/item. =Trope descriptions= Trope description pages are generally created through a system known as the \\"Trope Launch Pad\\"; site members (referred to as \\"Tropers\\"), can draft a trope description and have the option of providing examples or suggesting refinements to other drafts before launch. While going through TLP is not necessary to launch a trope, it is strongly recommended in order to strengthen the trope as much as possible. The site has created its own self-referencing meta-trope, known as \\"TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life\\". The trope warns that some readers may become jaded and cynical as an unanticipated side effect of reading TV Tropes, \\"[replacing] surprise almost entirely with recognition,\\" referring to the inability to read books, watch films, etc. without identifying each trope as it occurs. Also mentioned is that many frequently- contributing community members self-describe themselves as addicted to the site. The community has dubbed the pattern of many tropers as taking a \\"Wiki Walk,\\" starting an edit on an intended article, and subsequently following links from one page to the next for hours on end without intending to, pausing occasionally to add examples the troper notices to the listings or rework articles. In the process, this leads to the discovery of entirely new tropes to analyze, edit, and add examples to. This self-perpetuating cycle of behavior has become the subject of much lampooning for the community, with tongue-in-cheek references being made in the articles for tropes such as \\"Brainwashing,\\" \\"Hive Mind,\\" and Tome of Eldritch Lore (a book of cursed knowledge which infects the reader with obsessive madness). =Expanding scope= Considerable redesign of some aspects of content organization occurred in 2008, such as the introduction of namespaces, while 2009 saw the arrival of other languages, and as of 2018, its content has been translated into 12 languages: German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Romanian, and Esperanto. In 2011, TV Tropes branched out into video production, and launched Echo Chamber, a web series about a TV Tropes vlogger explaining and demonstrating tropes. Reception In an interview with TV Tropes co-founder Fast Eddie, Gawker Media's blog io9 described the tone of contributions to the site as \\"often light and funny\\". Cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling once described its style as a \\"wry fanfic analysis\\". Essayist Linda B√∂rzsei described TV Tropes as a technological continuum of classical archetypal literary criticisms, capable of deconstructing recurring elements from creative works in an ironic fashion. Economist Robin Hanson, inspired by a scholarly analysis of Victorian literature, suggests TV Tropes offers a veritable treasure trove of information about fiction ‚Äì a prime opportunity for research into its nature. In Lifehacker, Nick Douglas compared TV Tropes to Wikipedia, recommending to \\"use [TV Tropes] when Wikipedia feels impenetrable, when you want opinions more than facts, or when you've finished a Wikipedia page and now you want the juicy parts, the hard-to-confirm bits that Wikipedia doesn't share.\\" ControversiesMature content incident= In October 2010, in what the site refers to as \\"The Google Incident\\", Google temporarily withdrew its AdSense service from the site after determining that pages regarding adult and mature tropes were inconsistent with its terms of service. The site separated NSFG articles (Not Safe for Google) from SFG articles (Safe for Google) in order to allow discussion of these kinds of tropes. In a separate incident in 2012, in response to other complaints by Google, TV Tropes changed its guidelines to restrict coverage of sexist tropes and rape tropes. Feminist blog The Mary Sue criticized this decision, as it censored documentation of sexist tropes in video games and young adult fiction. ThinkProgress additionally condemned Google AdSense itself for \\"providing a financial disincentive to discuss\\" such topics. Pornographic tropes and works, as well as additional content deemed inappropriate for coverage on site, were also made prohibited following the incident. =Licensing and content forks= TV Tropes content was licensed since April 2008 with the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC-BY-SA) license for free content. In July 2012, the site changed its license notice and its existing content to the incompatible Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike version (CC-BY-NC-SA).

Regarding these and other concerns of re- licensing and advertising, a wiki called All The Tropes forked all the content from TV Tropes with the original CC-BY-SA license in late 2013. Authors of the fork attributed several actions of taking commercial rights over what is published on its website, censorship, and failing to comply with the original license to TV Tropes managers. Some editors raised concerns that keeping the content submitted with the previous copyleft license at TV Tropes is illegal, as the re-licensing had occurred without the permission of the editors and the original CC-BY-SA license did not allow its distribution under the new terms.

Meteorological history On June 16, a large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms developed in association with a weak area of low pressure well to the southeast of Yap. Gradually, the disturbance became more organized as it moved through an area of moderate wind shear, high sea surface temperatures (estimated at by satellites) and favorable diffluence. Further development of the low prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on June 20. Around 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was located roughly 405 km (250 mi) northwest of Palau. Tracking steadily northwestward in response to a ridge to the northeast, the depression crossed west of 135¬∞E on June 21 and entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's (PAGASA) area of responsibility. The storm was subsequently assigned the local name Falcon by PAGASA. Throughout the day, convection around the center of the depression increased and developed defined banding features along the storm's periphery. Aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the east, outflow improved around the circulation. A large system, roughly 1,480 km (920 mi) wide, convection was slow to consolidate over the center which remained mostly cloud free. Microwave satellite imagery indicated that the system lacked strong inflow, leading to a disorganized structure. Due to its large size, slow intensification was expected over the following several days as the storm tracked generally northwestward towards Taiwan. Early on June 22, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time the JMA assigned it the name Meari. Around the time it was upgraded, the storm had grown to a size that covered nearly the entire Philippine Sea. By June 23, convection began consolidating near the storm's center, indicating that the storm was intensifying. The following day, the JMA estimated that Meari strengthened to a severe tropical storm, with maximum sustained winds around 95 km/h (60 mph). Later that day, the storm's expansive windfield began to contract as an upper- level trough near Taiwan impinged on the western edge of Meari. Though the storm's overall structure degraded somewhat, surface observations continued to show intensification with a meteorological station on Shimojishima reporting winds of . Tropical Storm Meari near landfall in northeastern China on June 26 Late on June 24, Tropical Storm Meari is estimated to have attained its peak intensity with winds around 110 km/h (70 mph) and a barometric pressure of 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79 inHg). Situated northeast of Taiwan, the storm turned northward due to a blocking ridge over Manchuria, China. By this time, the storm moved out of PAGASA's area of responsibility and the agency issued their final advisory. Throughout June 25, Meari's structure rapidly degraded as an approaching trough produced major subsidence over the northwester portion of the storm. Situated between a subtropical ridge to the east and a trough to the west, the storm rapidly accelerated northward towards the Korean Peninsula. During this time, the system crossed over significantly cooler waters and alongside the subsidence, convection struggled to develop. Once over the East China Sea on June 26, the vertical structure of Meari significantly degraded, leaving only a surface low. In light of this, the storm turned back towards the northwest, again threatening China. Void of convection due to shear from the mid-latitude Westerlies, the weakened system soon made landfall along the Shandong Peninsula. After remaining near the peninsula for several hours, Meari rapidly accelerated towards the northeast and began taking on characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. Early on June 27, the storm completed the transition into an extratropical system hours before striking North Korea near the city of Anju with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). Hours after moving onshore, the storm rapidly dissipated and was last noted around 1200 UTC. PreparationsPhilippines= Following the first advisory on Tropical Depression Falcon by PAGASA on June 21, emergency management officials in the Philippines began taking precautions for potential damage. Severe weather bulletins and flood advisories were issued for much of the country as a large rainband established itself. In Cagayan Valley, the Philippine Army and Navy were placed on alert status for possible assistance in evacuation orders. By June 22, Public Storm Warning Signal One was raised for much of the Bicol Region. In some areas, schools were closed due to inclement weather. Additionally, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council prepositioned relief funds to be distributed once the storm passed. Off the coast of the Bicol Region, a no sailing advisory was issued to all vessels after seven fishermen went missing. Continued rains across the country prompted evacuation orders on June 24 for more than 48,000 people. Numerous schools closed due to dangerous travel conditions. In order to prevent failure, several dams began opening gates and releasing excess water. Multiple emergency management agencies across the country stockpiled resources and placed relief teams on standby to quickly assist residents affected by the storm. =South Korea= On June 25, meteorologists and local media in South Korea began warning residents of the approaching storm. The main concern was for heavy, flooding rains falling at rates up to per hour with even heavier amounts in the mountains. In order to prevent contamination of rivers, the government announced that it would closely monitor the 113 disposal sites near streams or on slopes. Offshore, large swells of were expected. Across the country, 46 flights were canceled and 118 ships were ordered to remain at port. Typhoon warnings were raised for much of the country, mainly northern provinces, and storm warnings were issued for southern provinces. ImpactPhilippines= Due to the large size of Meari, heavy rains associated with the storm fell across much of the Philippines starting on June 22. Within two days, parts of Metro Manila were submerged in up to of water and multiple dams neared their critical or spill level. =China= Striking the Shandong Peninsula on June 26, Tropical Storm Meari produced winds up to across parts of the region. Portions of Shandong, Liaoning and Jilin Provinces were affected by heavy rains for much of the day. =Korean Peninsula= Bringing torrential rains to much of the Korean Peninsula, Meari caused widespread flooding in the region. Following on the heels of several days of rain, Meari contributed to a record period of six consecutive days of rain in Seoul. The heaviest rains fell in northern portions of the country, peaking at in Boeun. In Seoul, of rain fell during the storm. Along the Nakdong River in North Gyeongsang, a section of bridge in Chilgok, built in honor of soldiers killed during the Korean War, collapsed. More than of road was washed away due to the storm. High winds in Jeju-do downed several tree limbs and power lines, leaving 9,861 households without power. At least nine people were killed in South Korea while another three were listed as missing. Of these fatalities, two resulted from rescuers being swept away while searching for people reported missing in flooded areas. In one incident, five people died after their car was swept away by an overflowing river. Overall, damage from the storm reached 28 billion won ($24.8 million USD). Heavy rains also affected much of North Korea, worsening ongoing floods. The highest known rainfall total was in Hoeyang, though rain was still falling at the time of the reported amount. The heaviest damage occurred in Kangwon-do, North Hwanghae and South Hwanghae provinces where about 160 blocks of structures were destroyed. According to the country's prime minister, the combined effects of Meari and floods in July killed dozens of people and injured many more. An estimated 2,900 homes were destroyed and 60,000 hectares (148,200 acres) of farmland was submerged or washed away. Overall, approximately 8,000 people were left homeless. Coastal areas of both nations experience large waves. AftermathPhilippines= Across the affected regions of the Philippines, more than 170,000 people were evacuated after the storm due to flooding. With many residents stranded by flood waters, multiple branches of the Philippine military provided rescue vehicles, such as trucks and rubber boats, to local authorities. Emergency operations were in full force shortly after the storm passed and relief distribution began by early July. Nearly 31 million PHP ($7.1 million USD) worth of supplies was provided to affected residents. Several thousand sacks of rice previously stockpiled by disaster relief organizations and the military were distributed across the country. By June 28, the Government of the Philippines declared a state of calamity for the Province of Pampanga, Camiling, Paniqui, Concepcion, La Paz, San Clemente and San Mateo. In San Mateo, the Philippine Navy deployed a team of 198 soldiers to assist in evacuation efforts. =Korean Peninsula= In the wake of widespread flooding, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak expressed his sadness over the loss of life from Meari. By early August, the Government of North Korea began a relief operation to assist residents affected by the July floods and Tropical Storm Meari. Food, drinking water, utensils, clothing and necessities were distributed in the hardest hit regions in South Hwanghae Province. Building supplies were also sent to initiate reconstruction. For the first time since the ROKS Cheonan sinking in March 2010, South Korea offered emergency aid to North Korea. The proposed aid included 5 billion won ($4.7 million USD) worth of quilts, medicine, instant noodles and healthy meals; however, the request made by the North Korean government was for rice and cement. By early October, the proposed aid effort was abandoned due to the disagreement.

OEHHA is the scientific adviser within CalEPA and provides the health effects assessments that assist regulatory decision makers within CalEPA, the California Department of Public Health, and other agencies and non- governmental organizations (see below). This includes assessing health and environmental risks from: * Carcinogens * Reproductive toxins * Air pollutants * Pesticides * Chemical contaminants in food and water * Chemical exposures in the workplace * Climate change in California In the news In May 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed to \\"eliminate and transfer the functions\\" of OEHHA (and other agencies) as part his May Revise for the 2009‚Äì2010 budget. Details about the transfer of functions including mandates, funding, staff resources, and new head agency are limited. Elimination of OEHHA will have a very minor impact on the budget problems because of several reasons: (1) OEHHA's budget is very small (1/500th of 1% of the General Fund, or 1/50,000th) compared to the state deficit; $8.3 million of OEHHA's budget is general fund (2) about half of OEHHA's budget is funded by special funds (e.g. Proposition 65, Biomonitoring) (3) state mandates that transfer to other agencies or departments will still require funding. By an executive order from the Governor in February 2009, all state workers are on a two-day-a-month furlough, or two days off without pay, equivalent to a 10% pay cut. On May 28, 2009 Governor Schwarzenegger proposed an additional 5% pay cut for all state workers (without an adjustment to the number of days worked), resulting a total pay cut of 15%; this additional cut must be approved by the legislature. =Press= Many have questioned the Governor's motivation for cutting OEHHA. Some have proposed this cut was spearheaded by industries who have been in conflict with OEHHA and several industries have been proposed as \\"suspects.\\" An international petition to save OEHHA, titled \\"Doctors and Scientists for Environmental Health\\", has also been circulating and has over 200 signatures from California, the U.S. and over 20 other countries worldwide. On June 2, 2009 articles and editorials/opinions were published in the Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee, California Progress Report, SFGate and others that speak to the importance of OEHHA and further explain how cutting OEHHA would not save a significant source of funding. These timely articles coincide with the California Budget Conference Committee hearings, with public testimony, that occurred on the afternoon of June 2, 2009. =Budget Conference Committee Hearing= On June 2, 2009 the Budget Conference Committee convened a hearing for public comment on the Governor's budget proposal. The hearing is archived on video, the testimony on behalf of OEHHA begins at 3:49:11 The supporters of OEHHA proposed and alternative to keep OEHHA intact and save $8.3 million, OEHHA's general fund budget. The proposal includes alternative funding sources and also expands OEHHA with the addition of Department Pesticide Regulation's risk assessment activities, Department of Toxic Substances Control's hazard evaluation functions, and lead roles in the children's health initiative and the Cal/EPA portion of the biomonitoring program. The main argument against the Governor's proposal is that the science performed in OEHHA should be independent of policy decisions made by the other boards and departments of Cal/EPA. Further, in the governor's proposal, many of OEHHA's programs would be dropped entirely (e.g. the Public Health Goals for drinking water contaminants). Speakers in support of OEHHA included: *Gina Solomon, MD, Natural Resources Defense Council senior scientist and UCSF faculty *John Froines, Ph.D., UCLA School of Public Health *John Balmes, MD, UCSF and UC Berkeley faculty, Director of UC Berkeley Northern California Center for Occupational Health *Janice Kim, MD, Ph.D., MPH, representing American Academy of Pediatrics *Julia Quint, Ph.D., retired chief of Hazard Evaluation System and Information Service of the California Department of Public Health *Martha Guzman Aceves, MS, California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation *Suzanne Murphy, Executive Director of Worksafe *David Chatfield, Executive Director of Californians for Pesticide Reform *Bill Magavern, JD, Director of Sierra Club California *Renee Sharp, MS, Environmental Working Group *Bill Allayaud, MRP, Director of Government Affairs for Environmental Working Group *Bonnie Holmes- Gen, Senior Policy Director, American Lung Association *Kyle Gardner, Center for Environmental Health *Donne Brownsey, JD, Breast Cancer Fund *Amy Kyle, Ph.D., MPH, UC Berkeley School of Public Health faculty *Ann Notthoff, MCRP, California Advocacy Director, Natural Resources Defense Council On June 11, 2009 the second hearing for the Budget Conference committee was convened. OEHHA's item number was 3980 on the Agenda and included the recommendation from the Senate Environmental Quality Committee (below) to keep OEHHA intact and add risk assessment and hazard evaluation functions from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. When OEHHA's item came up, Assemblymember Nielsen requested more time to review the proposal. The committee decided to postpone the discussion and action of the OEHHA item, but did not say when the committee would revisit the OEHHA budget proposal. On June 15, 2009 the Budget Conference Committee voted 6-4 along party lines to approve funding OEHHA's entire budget with fee- and penalty-based special funds. The conference committee's plan will be considered by the full Assembly and Senate as part of the budget package. The final ruling on OEHHA will not be available until after the budget is passed by the state legislature and signed by the Governor. As of June 25, 2009, it does not appear that the Democratic budget plan will be passed. =Senate Environmental Quality Committee Hearing= On June 10, 2009, The Senate Environmental Quality Committee voted to recommend that OEHHA be kept intact and expanded with the addition of California Department Pesticide Regulation's risk assessment activities, California Department of Toxic Substances Control's hazard evaluation functions, and lead roles in the children's health initiative and the Cal/EPA portion of the biomonitoring program. The recommendation will be forwarded to the Budget Conference Committee. Public testimony and discussion on behalf of OEHHA continued for over an hour and included 16 people who spoke in favor of keeping OEHHA intact. Two others spoke in opposition to transferring Department Pesticide Regulation's risk assessment activities to OEHHA, but neither of them commented on the larger issue of OEHHA's future. The vote was 3-2. Senator Ashburn voted against the expansion recommendation but also said, \\"The expertise that resides in OEHHA ought not to be dissipated throughout state government as the Governor proposes.\\" Speakers in support of OEHHA included: *Bill Magavern, Sierra Club California *Dr. Amy Kyle, University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health *Dr. Sarah Janssen, Natural Resources Defense Council *Shankar Prasad, Coalition for Clean Air *Dr. Janice Kim, representing the American Academy of Pediatrics *Dr. Tracy Woodruff, Director, UCSF Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment *Andrea Ventura, Clean Water Action *Gretchen Lee, policy director of the Breast Cancer Fund *Lauren Ornelas, Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition *Martha Guzman, California Rural Legal Assistance *Suzanne Murphy, executive director of Worksafe *Bonnie Holmes-Gen, American Lung Association and California Thoracic Society *Kyle Gardner, Center for Environmental Health *Bill Allayaud, Environmental Working Group Speakers against expansion of OEHHA: *Patrick Moran, legislative advocate, California Association of Professional Scientists *Justin Malan, California League of Conservation Voters Purpose and goals OEHHA's vision is to be California's leading scientific organization for evaluating risks to human and ecological health. OEHHA's goals as a governmental agency include: * Improve the quality of the public's health and the environment * Advance the science for the evaluation of risks posed to the public health and environment, and provide risk assessment leadership for the State of California * Provide quality, useful, and equitable service to the public Scientific responsibilities OEHHA assesses the risk of environmental chemicals based on health considerations alone. In contrast, risk managers consider economic and technical feasibility as factors in their decisions. This separation is essential to prevent undue political influence on the evaluation of health risks. These factors are and should remain explicitly excluded from the assessment of risk. OEHHA plays a critical and unique role that allows for the separation of risk assessment and hazard evaluation from risk management with primary goal of protecting public health and the environment. =OEHHA's Top Ten= OEHHA' most recognizable contributions to public and environmental health are: # OEHHA's groundbreaking work that showed that chromium in drinking water causes cancer; this issue was publicized in the movie Erin Brockovich. # OEHHA's research was critical in passing legislation to ban toxic phthalates from children's toys in California. # OEHHA was the first agency to identify second-hand tobacco smoke as a causal factor in breast cancer in young women. # California's ban on two widely used toxic flame retardants was supported by OEHHA's research. The California ban led to these chemicals being phased out in the United States. # In the face of strong opposition, OEHHA was the first government agency to establish that diesel exhaust causes cancer and induces asthma in children. OEHHA's work has led to stringent new controls on this widespread pollutant. # OEHHA has compiled the most comprehensive list in the world of chemicals that cause cancer, infertility, birth defects (known as the Proposition 65 list). Governments throughout the world rely on this list to regulate toxic chemicals. Manufacturers of consumer products use the list to design safer consumer products. # With OEHHA's ongoing support, the California Attorney General has led the way in removing lead from consumer products including venetian blinds, children's toys and jewelry, tableware, water faucets and ceramics. Other California success stories include reducing the use of toxic pesticides in flea collars and no-pest strips and removal of a cancer-causing chemical from office supplies. # OEHHA maintains a list of hazardous arts and crafts supplies that contain toxic substances which pose health dangers to children. California elementary schools are prohibited from purchasing these materials. OEHHA also provides advice on the selection and use of safer art supplies. # OEHHA's research contributed to the phase-out of a toxic gasoline additive (MTBE) that contaminated groundwater throughout California. # California was the first state to regulate a rocket fuel component which widely contaminates drinking water and produce including lettuce. OEHHA's research provided the basis for this drinking water standard. =Traditional roles= OEHHA's work products cover a variety of environmental media. Traditionally OEHHA has focused on four primary areas: Air pollution * Health-based air quality standards for pollutants associated with smog * Health effects assessments for toxic air contaminants. * List of toxic air contaminants that disproportionately impact children * Indoor air guidelines for green building Water pollution * Fish consumption advisories including warnings for pregnant women and children * Health protective levels for contaminants found in drinking water Proposition 65: Carcinogens and Reproductive Toxicants * Maintain Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to be carcinogens and reproductive toxicants * Health-based assessments of safe levels for Proposition 65 carcinogens and reproductive toxicants Multimedia risk assessment * Assess human and ecological health risk from exposure to chemicals contaminating California sites or facilities * Multimedia evaluation of the health effects of fuels =More recently= In recent years OEHHA has taken on new mandates to address emerging environmental issues of particular concern to the California public: * Biomonitoring - Evaluation of priority chemicals for Biomonitoring in California * Green Chemistry - Identification of key hazards of chemicals for implementation of green chemistry laws * Occupational health - Advice on health-based occupational exposure limits * Dry Cleaning - Research on safer alternative methods for dry cleaning * Environmental Justice * Cumulative Impacts * Emergency response for release of hazardous chemicals * Evaluation of contamination from oil spills * Evaluation of chemical sprays used to control invasive species * Child-specific health-based reference doses used to evaluate toxic chemicals found at school sites * Climate change - Identification of health effects * Involved in the light brown apple moth controversy: Issued report on the complaints of adverse health effects after aerial spraying in Monterey and Santa Cruz. Organizational structure OEHHA has three main divisions: * Administrative Support Services Division * Office of External and Legislative Affairs * Scientific Affairs Division The Scientific Affairs division is composed of four scientific branches that correspond to the scientific duties: * Air Toxicology and Epidemiology Branch * Integrated Risk Assessment Branch * Pesticide and Environmental Toxicology Branch * Reproductive and Cancer Hazard Assessment Branch Who uses OEHHA's science? State agency users of information on issues of environmental and public health include: * All six boards and departments within Cal/EPA * California Department of Public Health * California Department of Food and Agriculture * California Office of Emergency Services * California Department of Fish and Game * California Department of Justice * Federal agencies * Scientific community including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) * Industries in a range of disciplines * General public History OEHHA was established in its current form by Governor Pete Wilson on July 17, 1991 with the creation of Cal/EPA. OEHHA originated in the 1950s for air epidemiology in the Department of Public Health and developed over time with increased public awareness of the environment. OEHHA is the smallest of the six boards, departments and offices within Cal/EPA. OEHHA has no regulatory authority but remains the risk assessment and scientific arm of Cal/EPA and provides health- protective scientific guidance for Cal/EPA. Additionally, OEHHA is the lead agency for Proposition 65 implementation, a ballot measure approved in 1986, titled The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. The highly experienced team of experts is well respected in the scientific community and has been built up over more than twenty years. The quality and depth of OEHHA's commitment to public health, the environment and sound science is illustrated by the scientific quality of the risk assessments produced. OEHHA is headquartered in the Cal/EPA building in Sacramento and has an office in the Oakland Elihu Harris State Building. Before the state building was built, the Oakland office used to be located across from the University of California, Berkeley; OEHHA has maintained academic ties with this institution. Employee composition OEHHA's scientific responsibilities are fulfilled by a highly educated and trained professional staff of about 120 individuals. The staff include toxicologists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians and physicians; many have international reputations in their scientific fields. In fiscal year 2007‚Äì2008 OEHHA was budgeted for approximately $17.5 million or 1/500th of 1% the state General Fund; $8 million is from the general fund.

The urban disease, a by-product of the industrial revolution, was brought on by a vicious cycle whereby industry chose to set up near population bases to ensure labour demands could be met which in turn attracted rural migrants seeking work to move into the city prompting further industry and so on. This resulted in greater pollution in the city, higher populations, and denser living conditions. Moreover, rural areas declining rapidly due to loss of population were left to decay. Furthermore, there were no powers in place to stop prosperous families moving to open spaces or from industry growing in the centres. Fringe growth was vigorous and existing centres were left to deteriorate. Accordingly, those who moved to new fringe suburbs to escape the congestion were in fact ‚Äúbolstering the very process that caused them to move away.‚Äù Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‚ÄòNew Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress‚Äô. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.  Aspirations for Change  Although aspirations of dispersing great cities are as old as the industrial revolution itself, it was not until 1817 that the first model communities were proposed by social reformer Robert Owen to address overcrowded towns. Inspired by John Bellers‚Äôs 1695 proposal for a College of Industry, a colony for the poor enabling disadvantaged people to work and their children to be educated, Owen proposed small, self-contained communities of about twelve hundred people reliant on agriculture but with some other industry. However, his plans ‚Äúfoundered under the heavy weight of revolutionary ideas‚Äù Osborn, F. 1942. ‚ÄòNew Towns After the War‚Äô. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918. Pp 45. Further model community ideas continued to arise but were each dismissed owing to the perception that they were unconvincing as business ventures. Enter Ebenezer Howard, creator of the Garden City Movement, who successfully founded Letchworth Garden City (1903) and proved that new towns could be economically viable. This was affirmed by Bernard Shaw, co-founder of the London School of Economics, who referred to his investments in the garden city movement as ‚Äúentirely satisfactory, both economically and morally.‚Äù  Garden Cities and New Towns  The New Town Movement was derived from the Garden City Movement, founded by Ebenezer Howard in the late 1800s, as an alternative to the overcrowded, polluted, chaotic and miserable industrial cities that had appeared in Britain. Towards the end of World War One a group developed ‚Äì the ‚ÄòNew Townsmen‚Äô ‚Äì whose members were Howard, F.J. Osborn, C.B. Purdom and W.G. Taylor. They began advocating the development of 100 new cities to be built by the government.Hall & Ward, 1998, p. 42  F.J. Osborn  If Howard is the ‚Äòfather‚Äô of Garden Cities, then Frederick J. Osborn is certainly his ‚Äòson‚Äô ‚Äì predecessor and champion of the New Towns. Osborn was born in 1885 and spent the majority of his life arguing the case for New Towns. Like Howard, he had quite a modest education, having never attended a university. But what he lacked in formal education, he made up for with ambition and wise career choices. In his early 30s, after meeting Howard through his job at the Howard Cottage Society, he took to the campaign for Garden Cities, though they were now referred to as New Towns.Hall & Ward, 1998, p. 44 The initial campaigns for the establishment of New Towns failed. Although housing was built, it was often in the form of a ‚Äògarden suburb‚Äô, or located on the edge of the existing cities ‚Äì the antithesis of the Garden City idea.Hall & Ward, 1998, p. 45 With an increasing lack of faith in the government to take up the flag for public housing and new towns, Howard suggested to Osborn that he was wasting his time lobbying government, and that he would be ‚Äòas old as Methuselah‚Äô waiting for action.Hall, 1996, p.108 The Beginnings of Reform In 1909 a greater understanding of the ‚Äòurban disease‚Äô saw Britain's first town planning legislation created. Although technically opposed to fringe development, the Housing, Town Planning, &c.; Act 1909 did not prevent it. Instead, in light of recent success with the development of Hampstead Garden Suburb, the Act, realising that suburbs were easier to develop than towns, held the ethos that good suburbs were better than bad ones. Although planners of the day wanted new towns they were busy dealing with the demand for suburbs: ‚Äúit is difficult for a technician to earn a living in an ivory tower‚Äù Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‚ÄòNew Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress‚Äô. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963. pp 40. Moreover, new towns required government direction which was beyond the scope of municipal powers alone. Towards the end of the First World War the Garden City principles were reasserted by the ‚ÄòNew Townsmen‚Äô (Howard, Osborn, Purdon, and Tayler), who, referring to the success of Letchworth, proposed 100 government-supported new towns to address post-war rebuilding. However, the need for post-war housing resulted in new suburbs being prioritised over towns for the next two decades with some four million high standard houses built in between the wars albeit in the wrong places Conversely, some attempts were made at designing rebuilding efforts as satellite towns such as Manchester's Wythenshawe and Liverpool's Speke and Knowsley which also included provisions for industry. Nonetheless, these were still extensions of existing cities and not true New Towns. Furthermore, three-quarters of all the new housing was built privately meaning a default bottom-line approach was adopted into the inter-war development efforts. During the inter-war years Government committees studied the problem of urban concentration with the Committee on Unhealthy Areas, chaired by Neville Chamberlain (1919-1921), recommending the restriction of further industry in London and the relocation of some of the city's existing industry to garden cities. Although nothing came of these studies they became the origin of Chamberlain's urban decentralisation interests which led to his setting up of the Barlow Commission once Prime Minister. Further important advances included a 1935 Departmental Committee recommendation for the building of new towns in line with garden city principles and a 1936 Special Areas Report reiterating the idea that no new industry should be allowed in London which gained public and political interest  The Barlow Royal Commission  In 1938 Chamberlain, as the new Prime Minister, assigned a Royal Commission chaired by Sir Anderson Barlow into the urban concentration of population and industry. The resulting report raised the problem of large towns as a public issue for the first time and concluded that ‚Äòplanned decentralisation‚Äô was favourable. However, owing to the outbreak of war in 1939 the Barlow Report, published in 1940, was initially ignored due to more immediate priorities although it eventually became a turning point for New Towns policy.Gibberd, F. 1980. ‚ÄòHarlow: the story of a new town‚Äô. Publications for Companies. Stevenage. The damage brought on by the Second World War provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like which was encouraged by the Government who facilitated talk about a ‚ÄòBetter Britain‚Äô to boost morale. Furthermore, the Ministry of Works and Building was commissioned to draft ideas. The Barlow Report was quickly turned to as a best practice document. In 1942, following the Report's recommendation, the Government chose to create a central planning authority in the form of the Ministry of Works and Planning. More importantly the Government also announced that the Report's decentralisation and relocation of population and industry initiatives would be followed. Plans and Legislation  Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London which for the first time addressed the issue of decentralisation. Firstly, the County of London Plan 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the Greater London Plan of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns. In 1945 the New Towns Committee was formed to consider the ‚Äúestablishment, development, organisation, and administration‚Äù Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‚ÄòNew Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress‚Äô. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp 55 of new towns. Within eight months the committee had completed a highly comprehensive study into these issues resulting in positive recommendations for the construction of new towns. Accordingly, the New Towns Act 1946 was passed which, coupled with the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, created a revolutionary ‚Äúmachinery for positive town construction‚Äù.Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‚ÄòNew Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress‚Äô. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp56. These innovative Acts resulted in a total of 28 New Towns being constructed in Britain over the following half-century Hall, P and Ward, C. 1998. ‚ÄòSociable Cities: the Legacy of Ebenezer Howard‚Äô. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester pp. 41-69.  New Towns in Britain  It was in 1946 that the hard work of the ‚ÄòNew Townsmen‚Äô finally paid off with the passing of the New Towns Act 1946. Swayed by the need for post-war reconstruction, more housing, and a call to halt any further expansion of London's girth, authorities saw that there was no alternative to the New Town solution.Hall & Ward, 1998, p.51 In total, 27 New Towns were built after 1946. These were: Stevenage, Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Harlow, Hatfield, Basildon, Bracknell and Milton Keynes outside London; Newton Aycliffe, Peterlee and Washington in the North East; Skelmersdale and Runcorn in the North West; Corby, Telford and Redditch in the Midlands; Cwmbran and Newtown in Wales; and in Scotland, East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Irvine. Towns that were expanded under the new towns act were Peterborough, Northampton, Warrington, Ipswich and Preston-Leyland-Chorley.Osborn & Whittick, 1969  The New Towns Movement around the world  There were similar problems for New Towns advocates in other areas of the world. In Hong Kong, the new towns were developed as an initiative from the British colonial government. In other areas although they understood the concept and approved in large numbers, planners had trouble convincing their own governments or agencies of the merits of the proposal. In the United States, it was not until the 1960s that New Towns policies were put in place, although after World War Two grants had been extended for such things as slum clearance, improved and increased housing, and road construction, and in the 1950s, to ‚Äòcomprehensive renewal projects‚Äô.Osborn & Whittick, 1969, p. 153 In the former USSR, more than 800 New Towns were founded after the 1917 Revolution, but their growth was not constrained by specific limits.Osborn & Whittick, 1969, p. 155 For this reason it could be argued that these towns did not meet the criteria for New Towns since planned population and size limitations were an important part of the New Town idea. Other European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Sweden also had some successes with new towns, especially as part of post-war reconstruction efforts.Osborn & Whittick, 1969, p. 156-157 Notable new towns in the United States include Reston, VA; Columbia, MD; Jonathan, MN; Peachtree City, GA; the \\"new town in town\\" of Riverside Plaza in Minneapolis.

Although the work is Holbein's earliest mythological painting,\\"Venus and Amor\\". Web Gallery of Art. Retrieved on 17 May 2009. depicting the Roman goddess of love, Venus, with her son Amor (Cupid), the model is believed to be his friend Magdalena Offenburg.Toman, 382 They are shown in front of a large hanging green curtain and behind a low parapet. Venus is depicted with an open gesture and sincere gaze. Cupid is seen climbing onto the parapet while holding love's arrow in his left hand. He has red-orange hair, rendered in the same colouring and tone of the rich cloth sleeves covering his mother's upper arms. Venus and Amor was painted after Holbein's return to Basel following a short stay in France. While in France, he had access to the collection of Francois I,Batschmann et al, 135 and it's believed likely that this work was one of his early responses to his exposure to the Italian painters of the era.Batschmann et al, 147 Such influences can be seen in the gesture of Venus, whose pose closely echoes that of Jesus in Leonardo's 1498 Last Supper.Holbein was fascinated by Leonardo's work, which he knew largely through engravings, and completed his own Last Supper in 1524 In addition, her long, oval, idealised face seems closely modeled on Leonardo's depictions of the Virgin Mary.Batschmann et al, 158 Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci, 1498. The right hand and tilted head of Venus echoes those of Jesus in da Vinci's work Lais of Corinth, 1526, also posed by Magdalena Offenburg. Leonardesque portrait painting was very popular across northern Europe during the 1520s, and it is generally believed that a number of Holbein's works from this period were direct attempts to seduce and gain favour from potential wealthy patrons. The art historians Oskar B√§tschmann and Pascal Griener wrote in 1999 that, as with the artist's similar Lais of Corinth, Venus' open hand is \\"stretched towards the beholder and prospective collector.\\" The model is the same as that used for his Darmstadt Madonna and for the Venus and Amor and Lais of Corinth, and has been identified as Magdalena Offenburg, who may have been the artist's mistress. The work was first mentioned when it came into the possession of the collector Basilius Amerbach in 1578 as a gift from his cousin, Franz Rechburger. Amerbach's inventory records that the work was formed as a portrait of a lady from the Offenburg family, however this claim has not been substantiated by art historians. The Web Gallery of Art notes that \\"even if Holbein did make use of a portrait study, he has idealised his model to the point where it can no longer be considered a true portrait.\\" NotesSources * Batschmann, Oskar & Griener, Pascal.

History The Bulgarian Empire was in contact with the German- speaking lands in medieval times, though the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 14th and 15th centuries severed those ties.

In 1825‚Äì1831, Bulgarian enlightener Petar Beron studied at the University of Heidelberg, while from 1845 to 1847 journalist and linguist Ivan Bogorov was a student at the University of Leipzig. From 1846 to 1847, Bogorov published the first Bulgarian newspaper, Bulgarian Eagle, out of Leipzig. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, the German Empire continued to be a centre of higher education for Bulgarians, and hundreds of Bulgarian students were sent to Germany on state scholarships by the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (pre-1885). German universities were, together with universities in Switzerland, only second to those of Russia and Austria‚ÄìHungary among the most favoured foreign educational institutions for Bulgarians. Associations of Bulgarian students were formed in Leipzig, Berlin, Munich, Dresden, Heidelberg, Erlangen, Halle an der Saale and Freiburg im Breisgau in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Roma minorityTurkish minority From the early 1990s Western Europe began to attract Bulgarian Turks for the first time in their social history. Migration to Germany, in particular, was initiated by those Bulgarian Turks who, for various reasons, were unable to join the first massive migration wave to Turkey in 1989 or who were part of the subsequent return wave which was dissatisfied with the conditions of life or the social adjustment prospects there. The majority of Turks from Bulgaria migrated to Germany in the 1990s asylum regime, which provided generous social benefits. Bulgarian Turks are to be found predominantly in the less protected sectors of the German labour market associated with ethnic businesses that require higher flexibility and tougher working conditions. They appear to rely for employment predominantly on co-ethnic networks established by German Turks. The majority of this group of Turks are relatively new in Germany which now consists of regular migrants who legalised their status largely through marriages of convenience to German citizens. Some members of this group have managed to bring their children to Germany whilst there are also a smaller number of people who have given birth in Germany..

This specific movement was essentially composed of French railway workers from the SNCF and played an active role in the French Resistance. The R√©sistance-Fer concentrated its activities on: * reporting the movement of German troops to the Allied forces * the sabotage of railway infrastructure and rolling stock  Personnel Jean-Guy Bernard, Louis Armand and Jean Marthelot established the group in 1943 with the help of the director of the SNCF Albert Guerville and of the Cohors-Asturies and Emilie Plouviez groups. R√©sistance-Fer is considered part of the network of Forces Fran√ßaises Combattantes which was part of the D√©l√©gation G√©n√©rale. After the arrest of Jean-Guy Bernard in January 1944, Armand took charge of the group under the control of Jacques Chaban-Delmas.

It was restored in 1874 by Charles Edward Davis and is a Grade I listed building. It is likely that there was a previous church on the same site, and some fragments of a Norman doorway survive. The church underwent significant work, initially to the pulpit gallery and bells in 1774, and Victorian restoration between 1873 and 1874. The tower has contained bells since the 16th century, however in 1753 Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family of Chew Stoke cast a new peel of six bells. One was recast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1817. These hung in the tower into the 20th century but were not used because of safety concerns. The wooden frame was replaced by one made of steel between 2003 and 2006 when the bells were rededicated and could be rung again. Clipping the church. Painting by W. W. Wheatley in 1848 The church is the setting for an annual ceremony known as Clipping the church. It is an ancient custom that is traditionally held on Easter Monday or Shrove Tuesday in the United Kingdom. The word \\"clipping\\" is Anglo-Saxon in origin, and is derived from the word \\"clyp-pan\\", meaning \\"embrace\\" or \\"clasp\\". Clipping the church involves either the church congregation or local children holding hands in an outward-facing ring around the church. Once the circle is completed onlookers will often cheer and sometimes hymns are sung. At Rode the circle faces inwards and participants dance to the left and right before rushing inwards and cheering. John Michell and Margaret Murray suggest that the nocturnal ritual at Rode may have had non-Christian (possibly neopagan) motivations. The parish is part of the Hardington Vale benefice within the Frome deanery.

Oil recycling also benefits the environment: increased opportunities for consumers to recycle oil lessens the likelihood of used oil being dumped on lands and in waterways. For example, one gallon of motor oil dumped into waterways has the potential to pollute one million gallons of water. Motor oil Oil being drained from an automobile Recycled motor oil can be combusted as fuel, usually in plant boilers, space heaters, or industrial heating applications such as blast furnaces and cement kilns. When used motor oil is burned as fuel it must be burned at high temperatures to avoid gaseous pollution. Alternatively, waste motor oil can be distilled into diesel fuel or marine fuel in a process similar to oil re-refining, but without the final hydrotreating process. The lubrication properties of motor oil persist, even in used oil, and it can be recycled indefinitely. =Used motor oil re-refining= Used oil re-refining is the process of restoring used oil to new oil by removing chemical impurities, heavy metals and dirt. Used industrial and automotive oil is recycled at re-refineries. The used oil is first tested to determine suitability for re-refining, after which it is dehydrated and the water distillate is treated before being released into the environment. Dehydrating also removes the residual light fuel that can be used to power the refinery, and additionally captures ethylene glycol for re-use in recycled antifreeze. Next, industrial fuel is separated out of the used oil then vacuum distillation removes the lube cut (that is, the fraction suitable for reuse as lubricating oil) leaving a heavy oil that contains the used oil's additives and other by-products such as asphalt extender. The lube cut next undergoes hydro treating, or catalytic hydrogenation to remove residual polymers and other chemical compounds, and saturate carbon chains with hydrogen for greater stability. Final oil separation, or fractionating, separates the oil into three different oil grades: Light viscosity lubricants suitable for general lubricant applications, low viscosity lubricants for automotive and industrial applications, and high viscosity lubricants for heavy-duty applications. The oil that is produced in this step is referred to as re-refined base oil (RRBL). The final step is blending additives into these three grades of oil products to produce final products with the right detergent and anti-friction qualities. Then each product is tested again for quality and purity before being released for sale to the public.Harrison, C. (1994). \\"The engineering aspects of a used oil recycling project\\". Waste Management. Vol. 14, no. 3-4, pp. 231-235. But you can not simply compare those ratios and conclude that refining from crude is immensely inefficient. Crude oil refining yields large amounts of fuels. Below is a comparison of refining from used motor oil and refining from crude. Re-refining one unit of used motor oil will yield: * 71% lube oil * 5% fuels * 14% asphalt * 10% water Refining one unit of crude oil will yield: * 84% fuels (46% gasoline, 38% other fuels) * 9% gases * 4% coke * 3% asphalt and road oil * 3% petrochemical feed-stocks * 1% lubricating oil =REOB= The sludge (\\"residue\\") associated with engine oil recycling, which collects at the bottom of re-refining vacuum distillation towers, is known by various names, including \\"re-refined engine oil bottoms\\" (abbreviated \\"REOB\\" or \\"REOBs\\").Arnold, Terence S.

These include polymers, viscosity modifiers, heat stabilizers, additional lubricants, and wear additives. The REOB contains all the additives that were in the waste oil as well as the wear metals from the engine (mainly iron and copper). These additives include zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, which contains zinc, sulfur, and phosphorus; calcium phenate, which contains calcium; and molybdenum disulfide, which contains molybdenum and sulfur.

It is transmitted by mosquitoes. Although humans may become infected as aberrant hosts, the worms fail to reach adulthood while infecting a human body. Epidemiology It most often found in the Mediterranean region, sub- Saharan Africa, and Eastern Europe. Italy bears the highest burden of European dirofilariasis cases in humans : (66%), followed by France (22%), Greece (8%), and Spain (4%). In Europe, the parasite has spread as far north as Estonia.. Lifecycle The lifecycle of D. repens consists of five larval stages in a vertebral host and an arthropod (mosquito) intermediate host and vector. In the first stage, mated adult female worms produce thousands of microfilariae (larvae) into the circulation daily, which are ingested by mosquitoes in a blood meal. Larvae develop into infective larvae within the mosquito over the next 10‚Äì16 days, depending on environmental conditions, before being reintroduced back into a new host.\\"Dirofilariasis\\", Author: Michael D Nissen, MBBS, BMedSc, FRACP, FRCPA, Associate Professor in Biomolecular, Biomedical Science & Health, Griffith University; Director of Infectious Diseases and Unit Head of Queensland Paediatric Infectious Laboratory, Sir Albert Sakzewski Viral Research Centre, Royal Children's Hospital Coauthor(s): John Charles Walker, MSc, PhD, Head, Department of Parasitology, Center for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia; Senior Lecturer, Department of Medicine, University of Sydney, Australia Microfilariae undergo secondary developmental changes in the insect. For the final two stages of development, third-stage larvae are inoculated back into a vertebral host during an act of feeding. The adults of D. repens reside in the subcutaneous tissues of dogs and cats, where they mature in 6‚Äì7 months. Adult worms are 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter (females are 25‚Äì30 cm in length, the males being shorter). Humans are accidental hosts because adult worms cannot reach maturity in the heart or in the skin. Most infective larvae introduced into humans are thought to die; therefore, infected individuals usually are not microfilaremic. Human disease is amicrofilaremic.

Ultrasonography image (C) shows a worm-like structure inside the cyst (arrow), and color Doppler imaging (D) shows marginal vascularization of the lesion). Infections in humans usually manifest as a single subcutaneous nodule, which is caused by a macrofilaria that is trapped by the immune system. Subcutaneous migration of the worm may result in local swellings with changing localization. In addition, rare cases of organ manifestation have been reported, affecting the lung, male genitals, female breast, or the eye. The latter is found in particular during the migratory phase of the parasite. D. repens occurs more commonly in adults (aged 40‚Äì49 years). The only exception is in Sri Lanka, where children younger than nine years are most likely to be infected. The youngest individual reported was aged four months.Schmidt, GD, Robert, LS (2009). Foundations of Parasitology. New York, New York. McGraw- Hill Companies, Inc. Diagnosis Final diagnosis is established by microscopic examination of the excised worm. Making a definite species diagnosis on morphologic grounds is difficult, because a large number of zoonotic Dirofilaria species have been described that share morphologic features with D. repens.  Treatment  Antifilarial medication for infected humans generally is not supported in the medical literature. One group of authors has recommended a single dose of ivermectin followed by three doses of diethylcarbamazine if the syndrome is recognized prior to surgery. However, most cases are diagnosed retrospectively, when histopathological sections of biopsy or excision material are viewed. In terms of surgical care, excision of lesions and affected areas is the treatment of choice for patients with human dirofilariasis. Some authors have recommended a period of observing chest coin lesions for several months if dirofilariasis is suspected and no other features in the history or examination suggesting malignancy or other infection are present. Also, no specific diet is recommended for patients with dirofilariasis.  References  External links  * Dirofilaria repens Microfilaremia in Three Dogs in Estonia.

Taken from Indonesia: Democracy and the Promise of Good Governance, pg. 186. Eds. Ross H McLeod and Andrew Macintyre. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2007. History The idea of a body to consider and give a final ruling on the appointment, promotion, transfer or dismissal of judges first arose in 1968 but failed to make the statute books. Pressure for the establishment of a body to bring about an honest, clean, transparent and professional legal system resurfaced in 1998 after president Soeharto resigned from office. On 9 November 2001, during its annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly passed the third amendment to the Constitution of Indonesia, mandating the establishment of a Judicial Commission. The proposal to establish the Judicial Commission was added into the amendment at the last minute and, in the view of some observers, the Commission was established in a hasty way.Sebastiaan Pompe, 'The Judge S case why court oversight fails', The Jakarta Post, 13 June 2011. On 13 August 2004, Law No. 22 on the Judicial Commission was promulgated and on 2 July 2005, the president officially appointed the seven members of the Commission. The members were sworn in by the president on 2 August 2005.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 241Judicial Commission Website:Sejarah Pembentukan Komisi Yudisial (History of the Establishment of the Judicial Commission) access date 17 May 2009 Since its inception in 2005, most of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored by the Supreme Court. This has led the English-language publication the Jakarta Post to describe the Supreme Court as resistant to reform.Ina Parlina, Hope for effective judicial oversight pinned on new bill. Jakarta Post, 1 October 2016. Accessed 27 November 2016. Powers Logo of Judicial Commission of Indonesia The commission works to \\"maintain the honor, dignity and behavior of judges\\" and formerly held the power to propose candidates for the Supreme Court. Members are appointed by the president with the agreement of the House of Representatives.Denny Indrayana (2008), p267. For a report on the process of the selection of six new judges to the Supreme Court in 2011, see Ina Parlina, 'KY recommends 18 'quality' justice candidates to House', The Jakarta Post, 2 August 2011. The precise authority of the Judicial Commission, however, was not agreed upon by the different branches of the legal system in Indonesia.See the useful discussion in Sebastiaan Pompe, op.cit. It was reported in mid-2011, for example, that since its establishment in 2005 the Judicial Commission had summoned nine justices to be investigated for alleged ethics violations but that none had answered the summonses. Members of other branches of the legal system, such as Supreme Court judges, were reported to have taken the view that the Judicial Commission was exceeding its powers in attempting to summon judges in certain cases.Ina Parlina, 'Judicial Commission finds justices an elusive lot', The Jakarta Post, 16 July 2011. The Commission suffered a major blow to its authority when the Constitutional Court in August 2006 granted a request filed by 31 judges of the Supreme Court to drop activities that gave the Commission the power to investigate alleged violations by Supreme Court and Constitutional Court justices. Following that decision of the Constitutional Court, it was agreed that the powers of the Judicial Commission needed to be clarified. Most recently, during 2011, the Indonesian House of Representatives had under consideration a revision to the 2004 Judicial Commission Law which would strengthen the powers of the Judicial Commission to directly punish high court and district court judges. Under the proposed changes to the law, however, the authority to punish Supreme Court justices would remain with the Supreme Court.Bagus BT Saragih and Ina Parlina, 'Debate on sanctions for judges stalls KY law enactment', The Jakarta Post, 21 July 2011. In 2015, the Commission suffered a major blow to its powers when the Constitutional Court ruled in favor of a judicial review filed by the Indonesian Judges Association. The review alleged that selection of candidates for the bench was out of the Commission's purview, which only includes monitoring the performance of already serving judges.Ina Parlina, Court ruling weakens Judicial Commission.

The Sonderabteilung (‚ÄúSpecial Unit‚Äù) consisted of around known 50-60 Norwegian informants who worked for Henry Rinnan, many of whom were former frontline soldiers in the Waffen SS. This group was not known to the vast majority of Norwegians, including the members of the Nasjonal Samling party, until after the war. Under cover the group contacted people who were anti-Nazi, through whom they infiltrated the Norwegian resistance movement. After a period of active work in the resistance group, both to gather information and build trust, the network was rolled up and the participants arrested and interrogated. These kinds of infiltration operations were called \\"provocation business\\", to expedite action and subsequently arrest the suspects. Rinnan even called this a \\"game in the negative sector\\". The group worked towards the entirety of Central Norway, i.e. Tr√∏ndelag, M√∏re and Romsdal, even Nordland. Rinnan wanted to expand operations to Oslo, but this was possibly stopped by the Germans. The group, which after the war was called the Rinnan gang, was not formally a part of the Sicherheitsdienst until 1943 when Rinnan received a formal position within the occupation. He used these powers to enable interrogation by harsher means. Before this, he had reported resistance people to contact the German officers Gerhard Flesch and Walter Gemmecke, so that they were arrested, tortured and possibly killed, or put in concentration camps. Rinnan himself used a variety of aliases. From September 1943 the group had a base at Jonsvannsveien 46 in Trondheim, after the war known as Bande-Klosteret (Gang cloister), which was equipped with cells and torture chambers in the basement, where several were killed under torture. Rinnan drove the group completely by their own rules and on a couple of occasions killed Norwegians without German prior consent. He even executed members of his own group if he believed they were acting suspiciously. Several hundred Norwegians were tortured, and it is believed that the group killed more than 80 people. In spring 1945 part of the group tried to flee to Sweden with hostages, but was stopped and arrested five kilometres from the border. A legal purge against the group unfolded during 1945 and 1946, and resulted in seven life sentences and 12 death sentences, of which two were later converted to life sentences. Ten men were executed (Rinnan, Bjarne Jenshus, Aksel M√¶re, Harry R√∏nning, Harry Hofstad, Olaus Hamrun, Per Bergeen, Kristian Randal, Harald Gr√∏tte and Hans Egeberg). Many female members were sentenced to prison terms of up to life imprisonment. The Rinnan gang's former base at Jonsvannsveien 46 is as of 2014 still standing and used as an otherwise normal residential house.

He studied at Oswestry School and Worksop College before attending Goldsmiths College, London and the Royal Academy of Arts. During the Second World War he served in the Burma Campaign. From 1964 he taught sculpture at Goldsmiths, University of London. He received his first full-scale commission in 1964 for the memorial sculpture of the Bohemian British painter Augustus John (1878-1961). This sculpture took three years to complete and required major alteration (from a double sculpture of John and his wife Dorelia) due to limitation of funds. Nonetheless, the final 1967 single-figure sculpture was dramatically successful and led to Roberts-Jones' election as an Associate of the Royal Academy. This sculpture was erected in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, near John's last home. In 1971 he was commissioned to produce the full-length statue of Winston Churchill which now stands in Parliament Square, London.About Parliament Square The organiser of the appeal to raise money for the statue did not like its initial appearance, and reported: \\"At the moment the head is undoubtedly like Churchill, but perhaps not quite right of him at the pinnacle of his career. The cheeks, the eyes, the forehead and the top of the head require improvement.

A reward, originally HK$100,000, for information about the perpetrator or perpetrators, was raised to HK$300,000 following the second incident, and cameras were to be installed in the area following the December incident. The third incident occurred the very day the cameras were turned on. The fifth incident happened after Hong Kong government announced its new strategies against the incident. 13 December 2008 incident The first incident occurred on 13 December at 5:15pm near the intersection of Sai Yeung Choi Street South and Shantung Street. Two bottles of an unspecified corrosive liquid were hurled into the crowd, possibly from the 12th floor of the Yuen King Building, onto a popular pedestrianised street area below were many were doing Christmas shopping. The bottles hit the ground and exploded, splashing 46 people with corrosive fluids that burned through clothes and skin. People took refuge in nearby shops as water was poured onto the spilled acid to dilute it. All injuries were minor and the injured were all released from the hospital by the next day. Two days after the attack, Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang personally came to examine the area. Investigation of the attack left the intersection closed for approximately two hours on 16 December as police re-enacted the incident. Investigators threw bottles of chalk powder from several vantage points to gauge the exact point they might have been thrown from. Water was also poured on the ground to provide a better examination of splash and flow patterns. Door to door interviews were also performed. That same day, a reward of HK$100,000 (approx. US$12,800) was offered for any information about the attack, officially classified as \\"throwing corrosive fluid with intent to do grievous bodily harm,\\" a formula usually shortened to \\"throwing corrosive fluid with intent\\". The maximum punishment for this crime is life imprisonment. An individual claiming to be a Triad member later claimed online to have committed the attack, but was never traced. A month after the attack, Yau Tsim Mong District Council voted to install four CCTV cameras in various areas with the specific aim of deterring litter-hurling in general (throwing objects from buildings is a problem in several areas of Asia) and prevent similar incidents from occurring. One of the cameras is to be installed on Hollywood Plaza at Soy Street and Sai Yeung Choi Street South. The system, which is encrypted and whose images are stored for only ten days, could be extended at later dates. 16 May 2009 incident A second incident, almost identical to the first, occurred on 16 May 2009 again in Sai Yeung Choi Street South. Two bottles were again thrown, this time near the Soy Street intersection, some 150 meters from the original attack. The attack occurred around 4:47 pm and resulted in injuries to 30 persons, all but one of whom were released from the hospital the same day. A 16-year-old female remained in the hospital for several days afterward. Donald Tsang again came to visit the area and urged the district council to accelerate the installation of cctv cameras. The next day, the original reward for information was increased to HK$300,000. There is suspicion (though police commissioner Tang King Shing later admitted there was no formal indication of a link) that both cases were committed by the same perpetrator, although the nature of the liquid thrown in both cases has not been made public as of 20 May. Early on that date, a second reconstitution was performed, with a number of bottles (several filled with acid) thrown from several buildings. The area was cordoned off and nearby shop were covered, with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department cleaning afterward. Twenty buildings, the Pakpolee Commercial Centre and Foo Tai Building were thus identified as \\"possible locations\\". An unrelated incident had happened approximately one week prior to the second attack. Four persons were injured on 4 May, in Tsuen Wan District when a woman attempting to clear an ant nest spilled a mix of bleach, acid and insecticide to the street below. The incident, which injured a police officer and a baby girl, was initially thought to be a possible copycat of the December attack. The woman, who had just moved to the 12th-story flat on Hueng Woo Street, was arrested. 8 June 2009 incident A mere few hours after the announced cameras had been turned on, a third attack occurred around 8pm on 8 June at the intersection of Nelson and Sai Yeung Choi streets. Some three hundred police officers flocked to the area in an attempt to capture the culprit. The modus operandi was very similar to the first two attacks, and resulted in 24 injuries, including several tourists. Yau Tsim Mong district councillor Hau Wing-Cheong noted: \\"This acid throwing is obviously a challenge to the police. It is an unscrupulous crime. The formal operation of the sky eyes was not supposed to be known by outsiders and the district council had planned to announce it after a meeting on Tuesday.\\" Several detective teams were dispatched from other units, such as the anti-triad unit and blue-beret police. In light of the poor quality of the recorded images, which may turn out to be unusable, councillor Henry Chan Man- Yu called the HK$1.7 million system \\"a waste of money\\", and another councillor criticised the government for failing to inform the councillors of the purchasing and tendering process. The attack elicited outraged reactions from several Hong Kong politicians, who noted, like Wing-Cheong that the attack was clearly a direct insult to the police. Legislative Councilor Paul Tse Wai-Chun noted his worry about Hong Kong's reputation for safety, since several tourists had been injured: \\"We don't want our good name being tarnished overnight by the attacker. Police have to gear up to make an arrest to help regain the confidence of tourists.\\" The government's total bounty for information soon reached HK$900,000, while Donald Tsang called the attacks \\"cold-blooded and malicious\\" in a televised broadcast. Meanwhile, local business owners have begun to grow concerned and many now stock water in case of a fourth incident. 6 September 2009 incident An incident unrelated to the mass attacks of the summer occurred the evening of 6 September at Tung Choi Street. A shopkeeper couple (Ah Dee and Tam Chan) were assaulted by a man who had come to recover some HK$300,000 that they owed him for handbag supplies. In the middle of a brief altercation, the man, identified solely as \\"Tsz\\", whipped out a bottle and splashed the pair with acid, causing severe injuries to both and minor injuries to nine others. He was captured on the scene, the wife having chased him, shouting, and thus attracting the attention of nearby police officers. Ah Dee had to be transferred to Queen Mary Hospital for emergency skin graft. Others were treated at Kwong Wah Hospital and, except for his wife, discharged later that evening. 9 January 2010 incident On 10 January 2010, Police in Hong Kong arrested a man suspected of carrying out an acid attack in Temple Street. 30 people were injured in this attack. On 11 January 2010, police ruled out the arrested man as a suspect.

It is one of several fictionalized movies about outlaw Belle Starr. The story is set in Oklahoma, where the real Starr was killed. The word \\"Montana\\" in the title refers to the part of the plot in which Starr, wanted by the law, alters her appearance, poses as a widow from Montana and becomes a saloon singer. Plot Oklahoma outlaw Belle Starr meets the Dalton gang when she is rescued from lynching by Bob Dalton, who falls for her. So do gang member Mac and wealthy saloon owner Tom Bradfield, who's enlisted in a bankers' scheme to trap the Daltons. Dissension among the gang and Bradfield's ambivalence complicate the plot, as Belle demonstrates her prowess with shootin' irons, horses, and as a saloon entertainer.

Species within this superfamily are known as filarial worms or filariae (singular \\"filaria\\"). Infections with parasitic filarial worms cause disease conditions generically known as filariasis. Drugs against these worms are known as filaricides. Introduction Filarioidea all are specialised parasites and the definitive host is always a vertebrate, a mammal, bird, reptile or amphibian, but not a fish. The intermediate host is always an arthropod. Most of Filarioidea parasitise wild species, birds in particular, but some, especially in the family Onchocercidae, attack mammals, including humans and some domestic animals. Conditions that result from parasitism by Onchocercidae include some of the most troublesome diseases of the warmer regions, including river blindness and elephantiasis. Taxonomy The Filarioidea include several families: *Aproctidae *Creagrocercidae *Drilonematidae *Filariidae *Homungellidae *Mesidionematidae *Onchocercidae (sometimes included within the Filariidae) *Scolecophilidae *Setariidae and *Ungellidae. Filarioidea and disease Microfilaria of Dirofilaria immitis (Heartworms) in a lymph node of a dog with lymphoma. This baby nematode is in a pillow of intermediate-to-large, immature lymphocytes, exhibiting multiple criteria of cancer. In and about endemic regions filarial diseases have been public health concerns for as long as recorded history. Archaeological evidence for elephantiasis for example extends back some 3000 years, by which time apparently it already was no novelty.Yoshihito Otsuji. History, Epidemiology and Control of Filariasis. Trop Med Health. 2011 Mar; 39(1 Suppl 2): 3-13. Currently perhaps some hundreds of millions of people worldwide, mainly in tropical regions, are infected with pathogenic species of filariae. Where the diseases are endemic many times more are exposed routinely to infection. Some victims harbour more than one medically significant infection simultaneously and this can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Humankind is the definitive host of at least eight species of filariae in various families. Six are particularly significant in medical terms. The ones that mainly occupy lymph vessels and cause conditions such as adenolymphangitis, elephantiasis, and filarial fever are: * Brugia malayi * Brugia timori * Wuchereria bancrofti Three other medically important parasitic species are: * Loa loa causes Loa loa filariasis also known as Calabar swelling * Mansonella streptocerca, which causes streptocerciasis, an itchy condition that creates depigmented skin lesions sometimes mistaken for the first signs of leprosy. * Onchocerca volvulus causes cutaneous onchocerciasis and river blindness The other two are less seriously pathogenic but commonly parasitise humans. * Mansonella ozzardi * Mansonella perstans Some Dirofilaria species usually parasitize animals such as dogs, but occasionally infect humans as well. They are not well adapted to humans as hosts and seldom develop properly though they may cause various confusing symptoms. Various filarial diseases specific to humans are candidates for elimination by such means as breaking the cycle of infection. To eliminate the vectors is not really practical, but if the human population were sufficiently cleared of parasites by treatment with filaricides then one year without any human reservoirs of infection should suffice to exterminate the parasite. That is the intention of for example, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, which aims to interrupt transmission in that way.Martial L Ndeffo-Mbah, Alison P Galvani. Global elimination of lymphatic filariasis. The Lancet Infectious Diseases Volume 17, No. 4, p358-359, April 2017 Published: 21 December 2016 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30544-8 Life cycle of Filarioidea  The mature worms live in the body fluids and cavities of the definitive hosts, or predominantly in particular tissues. Details vary according to species. Some of the worst pathogens invade lymphatic vessels and may be numerous enough to clog them. Some species invade deep connective tissues; some infest subcutaneous connective tissue, causing unbearable itching. Some invade the lungs or serous cavities such as the pleural cavity, or pericardial cavity. Wherever established, they may survive for years, the fertilized females continuously producing motile embryos called microfilariae rather than eggs.O‚ÄôDonoghue, Peter. PARA-CITE. Published by: School of Molecular & Microbial Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4072, Australia July, 2010. A microfilaria cannot reproduce in the definitive host and cannot infect another definitive host directly, but must make its way through the host's body to where an intermediate host that acts as a vector can swallow it while itself acting as an ectoparasite to the definitive host. It must succeed in invading its vector organism fairly soon, because, unlike adult filarial worms, microfilariae only survive for a few months to a year or two depending on the species and they develop no further unless they are ingested by a suitable blood-feeding female insect. In the intermediate host the microfilaria can develop further till the vector conveys it to another definitive host. In the new definitive host the microfilaria complete the final stage of development into sexual maturity; the process takes a few months to a year or more depending on species. The mature filaria then must mate before a female can produce the next generation of microfilariae, so that invasion by a single worm cannot produce an infection. Accordingly, it takes years of exposure to infections before a serious disease condition can develop in the human host. Once a new generation of microfilariae is released in the primary host, those in turn must seek out host tissue suited to the nature of the vector species. For example, if the vector is a skin-piercing fly such as a mosquito the microfilaria must enter the peripheral blood circulation, whereas species borne by skin-rasping flies such as Simuliidae and skin- cutting flies such as Tabanidae tend to establish in hypodermal tissues. For obscure reasons, some such species actually undergo daily migrations to bodily regions favoured by the vector ectoparasites. Outside those periods they take refuge in blood circulation of the lungs.

It contains about 100 species of intermediate to large size (), black or brown, living in the tropical areas of the Old World. Tropical Africa contains about 85 species, with the remaining 15 in tropical Asia. Catharsius are typically short and convex scarabs, with horns on head and forebody of males, sometimes also of females. They mostly live in grasslands and pastures, occasionally in forests, where they eat large mammals‚Äô dung, using it to make pedotrophic nests in which their offspring develop. A few species shifted from coprophagy to necrophagy, and use small vertebrates carcasses as food for both adults and larvae. Due to their rather large size and occasional abundance, Catharsius species play important roles in the ecology and soil dynamics of tropical areas. They bury vast amounts of dung into the ground, thus improving the quality and texture of the soils. Also, they contribute to ‚Äúclean‚Äù the surface of the ground, hence their name (from the Greek katharsios ‚Äúpurifier‚Äù). Catharsius heros Important species are Catharsius molossus (Linnaeus, 1758), one of the most widespread and abundant coprophagous species in tropical Asian regions; C. sesostris Waterhouse, 1888, also coprophagous, widespread and common in savannas and semidesertic zones in Africa and Near East; C. eteocles Laporte, 1840, important necrophagous species in Western Africa, etc. Among less common species, C. mirabilis Felsche, 1901, occasionally abundant in Eastern Africa, displays a strong sexual dimorphism making it one of the most spectacular African dung beetles. Catharsius gorilla is a species widespread in the tropical African regions. An additional group of some 65, much smaller () species, mostly from tropical Africa, is sometimes erected into a separate genus: Metacatharsius Paulian, 1939. Recently, the name ‚ÄúCatharsius‚Äù has been selected by a team of entomologists working on dung beetle fauna of Western Africa.

Currently only 3 species are recognised, all endemic to Australia. The beetles form bonded pairs and occupy permanent nests under the rainforest floor during their lifespan of only one year. The scarcity of dung in their habitat appears to have driven members of this genus to improvise a dung substitute from available materials. The male collects leaves and other plant material which is shredded by the female, turned into dung-like material and then shaped into small brood-balls housing the larvae. During the larval growth period the parents regularly add food to the brood-balls, behaviour previously unrecorded for dung beetles. The larvae also produce audible stridulation by rubbing the tip of the abdomen against the underside of the head - this is taken to be communication between larva and adult. The nests of Cephalodesmius are also inhabited by some 8 other insect species and mites - Macrocheles tenuirostris, Hunteracarus womersleyi, Histiostoma sp., Caloglyphus sp., Sinella sp., Anotylus sp. nov., Oxytellus sp. and Leptocera myrmecophila - these are in a variety of relationships with the beetles.http://scarabnet.myspecies.info/biology-cephalodesmius-genus-dung- beetles-which-synthesizes-dung-plant-material-coleoptera-scarabaei *Cephalodesmius armiger *Cephalodesmius laticollis *Cephalodesmius quadridens References Category:Scarabaeidae genera ","title":"Cephalodesmius"},{"id":"22834908","text":"Chalcocopris is a genus of Scarabaeidae or scarab beetle.
